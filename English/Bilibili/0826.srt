1
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,470
It's all dark out.

2
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,870
It's because you guys took forever eating dessert.

3
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,270
You're one to talk.

4
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,070
It's because you kept on chatting with that pretty waitress

5
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,070
about stupid stuff forever.

6
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,170
What?

7
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,570
I was listening to her problems with all my heart.

8
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,470
Hey, Ran! Call the ambulance!

9
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,070
-Contact the police, too! -Okay!

10
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,770
It looks like he fell off.

11
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,870
Yeah.

12
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,170
Pops.

13
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,570
Miss! Are you all right?

14
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,570
Darn.

15
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,670
A canvas stained black with crime.

16
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,970
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

17
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,970
A beauty is behind the case.

18
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,170
The reason behind the death fall.

19
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

20
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

21
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,370
His name is Detective Conan!

22
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:46,827
"A Beauty, A Lie and A Secret"

23
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,427
"MPD Beika Police Station" -I see.

24
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:55,427
In other words, that man suddenly attacked you?

25
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,427
Yes.

26
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:58,527
"Misaki Takizawa (28)" -So I desperately

27
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,627
ran over to the emergency stairs.

28
00:04:09,627 --> 00:04:11,427
I was scared.

29
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:14,027
I thought he was going to kill me.

30
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:16,327
And you're sure that he was the same man

31
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:19,927
that you witness during that incident?

32
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:23,027
Yes, I'm sure.

33
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:26,827
Inspector, what case are you referring to?

34
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:29,127
A murder robbery.

35
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,627
Murder robbery?

36
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:34,927
A week ago late at night,

37
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:37,327
a robber broke into the house of Mrs. Misaki Takizawa

38
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:39,927
through the 2nd floor veranda.

39
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,727
"Akira Takizawa (58)" -He threatened her husband, Mr. Akira Takizawa,

40
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:45,027
and made him open the safe in the study.

41
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:48,127
And stole precious stones worth about 100 million yen.

42
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:55,127
Then, he killed Mr. Takizawa.

43
00:04:56,127 --> 00:05:00,727
I woke up back then after hearing the glass table crack,

44
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:03,627
and ran over to my husband's room immediately but...

45
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:17,527
Was that perp the man who attacked you a while ago, Ms. Misaki?

46
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:18,727
Yes.

47
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:21,427
He's Takeshi Yaginuma

48
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:23,627
who is a hired manager at a jazz cafe.

49
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,927
"Takeshi Yaginuma (32)" -It seems that the late Mr. Takizawa

50
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,427
also visited that shop several times, too.

51
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:32,427
He turned up as one of our suspects,

52
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:36,327
and all we had left to do was to have Mrs. Takizawa come and point him out.

53
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:37,627
I see.

54
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:39,327
So he tried to beat you

55
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:42,327
to the punch and silence you, Ms. Misaki.

56
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,627
Come in.

57
00:05:46,627 --> 00:05:50,527
Inspector, while we were searching Yaginuma's shop,

58
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:53,527
we found this in the storage space under the floor.

59
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:54,727
What is it?

60
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,827
Please take a good look.

61
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:03,127
Is this what was stolen from the safe at your house?

62
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:06,527
Yes, no mistake about it.

63
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,227
Inspector, that clinches it.

64
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:14,227
It's too bad that we couldn't arrest the perp,

65
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:15,527
but we'll send papers to the prosecutor

66
00:06:15,527 --> 00:06:17,327
pertaining to the dead suspect,

67
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:19,227
then the case will be closed.

68
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,427
I'm happy for you, Ms. Misaki.

69
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:22,927
Thank you very much.

70
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,827
But...

71
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:28,227
Why'd you park your car in a place like that, Ms. Misaki?

72
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:31,527
Because...

73
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:35,827
Isn't that the 1st and 2nd floor of that parking lot was empty?

74
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:38,627
I just thought that you didn't have to go all the way up

75
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:41,627
to the 3rd floor to park your car.

76
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,627
So, did you have a special reason for doing so?

77
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:47,727
Hey, brat! Are you trying to pick a fight or something?

78
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:50,727
Did you take a good look at Ms. Misaki's car or what?

79
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,527
If she parked that expensive car in a place that's too obvious,

80
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,527
it'd get stolen!

81
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:58,127
That's why she went all the way up to the 3rd floor

82
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,627
to park her car!

83
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,227
Understand?

84
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:02,427
Isn't that right, Ms. Misaki?

85
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:04,027
Well, yes.

86
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:05,227
That hurts.

87
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:06,827
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,527
I never rode such a cool car,

89
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,427
so I was curious.

90
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:14,027
You are Conan, was it?

91
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:16,327
-Yep! -Do you like cars?

92
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:19,827
Yes. I wish I could ride in a car like that, if just once!

93
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:23,527
I'll let you ride it next time, then.

94
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,927
When's next time?

95
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,527
Hey, cut it out!

96
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:30,827
But maybe I'll never get to see Ms. Misaki again.

97
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:31,927
Okay, then.

98
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:35,127
Would you like to go for a drive from now?

99
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:36,827
Ms. Misaki, but...

100
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:38,527
It's all right.

101
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:41,927
I was just starting to feel lonely being by myself, you see.

102
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:45,027
Wow, yeah!

103
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,327
That's great.

104
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,127
You're the first, Conan.

105
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,427
What?

106
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:07,627
You're the first man to ever ride in my car.

107
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:10,827
Your husband, Mr. Takizawa never rode this car either?

108
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:13,927
He had a bad heart.

109
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,527
He said he was afraid of my driving.

110
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:34,227
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:38,227
I get this urge to speed down the expressway like this sometimes.

112
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,027
Maybe I like being thrilled.

113
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,627
Do you smoke, Ms. Misaki?

114
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:48,027
No, I don't.

115
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,227
Why?

116
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:53,727
Look. These are cigarette ashes, aren't they?

117
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:57,127
Your husband, Mr. Takizawa probably didn't smoke

118
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:59,127
because he had a bad heart

119
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,027
and you don't smoke either.

120
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:02,327
I wonder

121
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:05,327
who smoked this cigarette, then.

122
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:07,927
Maybe it's not cigarette ashes,

123
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:11,127
but just plain dust.

124
00:09:15,627 --> 00:09:18,427
Conan, when you grow up, do you

125
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:21,527
want to become a detective just like Mr. Mouri?

126
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,327
Yep, sort of.

127
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,127
No.

128
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,827
This place is a secret.

129
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,627
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,727
I kind of got curious.

131
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:33,727
You're curious about everything, aren't you?

132
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:35,527
Do you want to see it that badly?

133
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,927
Yep.

134
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,027
Well, I guess I have no choice, then.

135
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,527
I smoked that cigarette.

136
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:49,027
It was a secret. I didn't smoke in front of Takizawa.

137
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,327
A secret?

138
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:53,527
Yes, since he didn't like cigarettes.

139
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:54,727
When we got married,

140
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,027
I lied and told him that I don't smoke.

141
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:02,127
So you lied even though you were getting married.

142
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,427
Happiness...

143
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:09,627
is made up of lies and secrets, you know.

144
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:12,027
You'll understand when you grow up.

145
00:10:13,327 --> 00:10:15,527
Lies and secrets?

146
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:21,627
Oh, right! Ms. Misaki, your house is big, isn't it?

147
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:23,127
What? Yes.

148
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,127
I want to go see it.

149
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:26,827
Please take me there.

150
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:30,627
But that place is still as it was since the incident, you know.

151
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:33,527
That's why I'm afraid to go home alone.

152
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:35,427
I live in a hotel right now.

153
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,327
Don't worry.

154
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,427
Because you're not alone today.

155
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:44,027
What?

156
00:10:44,027 --> 00:10:46,827
Conan is over at Misaki's place?

157
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:49,027
Yep, he called just a while ago

158
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,627
to say he's going to stop over there.

159
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:53,527
I tell you, what's with that brat, anyway.

160
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,727
Sonoko told me a while ago

161
00:10:56,727 --> 00:11:00,327
that Mr. Takizawa's family has been land magnates for generations,

162
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:04,527
and they're millionaires.

163
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:05,927
So what?

164
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,927
That's why when he married Ms. Misaki

165
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,327
who was 30 years younger than him a year ago,

166
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,527
it seemed people accused her of being a gold digger.

167
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:19,827
That's what's called petty-minded suspicion!

168
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:22,327
Ms. Misaki is a pitiful victim

169
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,627
whose husband was murdered, you know!

170
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:26,127
That's true, but still...

171
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,427
By the way, when did that precocious brat

172
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:32,127
turn into such a womanizer?

173
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,427
Wow, butterflies.

174
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:46,527
Takizawa loved nature

175
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:49,827
and adored country life.

176
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:53,227
That's why there's so much greenery in the garage, too.

177
00:11:53,227 --> 00:11:54,727
But it's not my cup of tea.

178
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:00,227
I hate bugs.

179
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:12,927
Conan.

180
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,027
I'm going to change, so sit wherever you like.

181
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,127
Okay.

182
00:12:35,627 --> 00:12:38,527
If I remember correctly the site of the crime was in the 2nd floor study.

183
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:49,927
Bummers.

184
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:51,427
The study's that way?

185
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:10,327
So, this is the study.

186
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:30,427
This is...

187
00:13:30,427 --> 00:13:32,427
Which means that is just as I thought.

188
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,594
You shouldn't be entering rooms

189
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:52,594
without permission, Conan.

190
00:13:52,594 --> 00:13:54,394
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:57,694
There were a lot of old records so I couldn't help myself.

192
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:00,294
Takizawa was a jazz maniac.

193
00:14:00,294 --> 00:14:01,494
Would you like something to drink?

194
00:14:01,494 --> 00:14:03,694
I think I've only got orange juice, though.

195
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:08,094
He used to say listening to jazz with the volume up high

196
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,094
got rid of his stress.

197
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,194
I see.

198
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:14,294
That's why this room has a soundproof door?

199
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:16,794
Soundproof door?

200
00:14:16,794 --> 00:14:21,094
Yep. When I came in here the door was really heavy and thick,

201
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,494
so I could tell right away.

202
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,494
I see.

203
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:27,694
But it's strange.

204
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:31,394
You woke up because you heard the table crack, right?

205
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:32,594
Right.

206
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:35,194
But if the soundproof door was closed,

207
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:37,494
you couldn't have heard the noise, right?

208
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:39,794
The door was open back then.

209
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:41,594
It couldn't have been.

210
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:45,694
Mr. Takizawa was killed while he was listening to records

211
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:48,594
so I'm sure the soundproof door was closed.

212
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:50,794
How do you know?

213
00:14:50,794 --> 00:14:54,994
Because look, the record is still on the turntable.

214
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,694
If he treasures his records,

215
00:14:57,694 --> 00:15:01,194
I don't think he'd leave a record that he's listening to like that, right?

216
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:02,894
I guess you're right.

217
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:07,094
If so, maybe Yaginuma opened the door.

218
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:08,694
Mr. Yaginuma did?

219
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:11,394
After stealing the jewels,

220
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:15,494
maybe Yaginuma tried to take Takizawa to my room,

221
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,694
so he could silence the both of us.

222
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,694
But weren't you asleep, Ms. Misaki?

223
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:25,794
I'm not Yaginuma so I wouldn't know.

224
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,894
Here's your orange juice.

225
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,894
Just one more thing, then.

226
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:34,894
When you ran over here after hearing the glass table crack

227
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,894
the jewels were already stolen, weren't they?

228
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:39,494
Yes, of course.

229
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:41,294
But take a good look.

230
00:15:41,294 --> 00:15:44,294
The door of the cabinet this safe is in...

231
00:15:44,294 --> 00:15:45,294
Behind it.

232
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:52,594
I found a cracked piece of glass from the glass table.

233
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:54,394
What about it?

234
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:58,194
In order for the piece of glass to get in here,

235
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:01,594
the door of the cabinet had to be closed.

236
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:05,394
But, if the door was closed, the safe cannot be opened.

237
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,594
In other words, the safe was opened

238
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:09,994
after the glass table cracked.

239
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:13,994
That is, after Mr. Takizawa was killed.

240
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:17,594
But if so, how did Yaginuma open the safe?

241
00:16:17,594 --> 00:16:19,594
Ms. Misaki, you opened it, right?

242
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:21,194
You opened the safe, didn't you?

243
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,294
I wasn't expecting that.

244
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:33,294
Then, what? Are you saying that I'm lying?

245
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:36,994
That's not the only thing you lied about, Ms. Misaki.

246
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:39,094
You said that when you came into this room,

247
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:42,694
you saw the face of the perp who fled from the veranda.

248
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,194
But that would've been impossible.

249
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:49,694
Impossible or not, I saw what I saw.

250
00:16:49,694 --> 00:16:51,194
From there,

251
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:54,994
the light of the mercury lamp would result in a backlight effect.

252
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:07,294
You can't see my face, can you?

253
00:17:09,494 --> 00:17:10,694
In other words,

254
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:14,094
the fact is, you didn't care to look at the perp at all.

255
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:17,394
You were certain that Mr. Yaginuma was the perp

256
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:20,094
because you were his accomplice.

257
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:26,294
You instructed Mr. Yaginuma to steal the jewels

258
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:28,594
and murder your husband.

259
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:33,194
Then, you called him to the parking lot, murdered him

260
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:36,094
and framed him for the entire crime.

261
00:17:36,094 --> 00:17:37,894
Conan, you're cute.

262
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:43,194
Maybe I'll take you somewhere far away.

263
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:46,394
It seems you'll fit right into my suitcase, too.

264
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,694
I'm only joking, sorry.

265
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:04,094
You'd better answer the phone or they'll get worried.

266
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:07,494
Hello.

267
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:10,294
Hey, Kid! Where are you?

268
00:18:10,294 --> 00:18:12,194
I'm still at Ms. Misaki's house.

269
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:14,294
What?

270
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:18,094
I hope you're not planning to spend the night at her place!

271
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:21,794
You don't need to worry, Mr. Mouri.

272
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:22,794
Ms. Misaki?

273
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:24,594
We'll be a little late,

274
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:27,194
but I'll see to it that Conan gets home safely.

275
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:31,194
Well, I'm sorry for all the trouble.

276
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,594
For all I care,

277
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:35,294
you can dump that glasses kid out there anywhere.

278
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:37,694
Here.

279
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:45,094
Since when did you start thinking that I was the one who murdered Yaginuma?

280
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:46,294
From the start.

281
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,994
Because the palms of Mr. Yaginuma's corpse

282
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:53,194
were spotless.

283
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:54,294
His palms?

284
00:18:54,294 --> 00:18:57,794
Yeah. Anybody falling down the stairs

285
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:01,394
would impulsively try to grab onto something, right?

286
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:04,294
The stairs there were pretty dirty,

287
00:19:04,294 --> 00:19:05,394
so if you tried to grab onto it,

288
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,294
the palms of your hands would get dirty.

289
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:11,794
But the palms of his hands were clean.

290
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:15,494
Instead, there were cigarette ashes around his chest area.

291
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,794
Which means that Mr. Yaginuma was smoking

292
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,994
until just before he fell.

293
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:25,494
The only thing thinkable then is...

294
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:28,794
Mr. Yaginuma approached you

295
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,694
while smoking a cigarette.

296
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:32,794
Then, at that time...

297
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:36,894
Insecticide causes...

298
00:19:36,894 --> 00:19:39,294
unbearable pain when sprayed from a close distance.

299
00:19:40,294 --> 00:19:43,094
And when Mr. Yaginuma covered his eyes with both hands,

300
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:45,894
you pushed him from behind.

301
00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:50,994
Fantastic deduction.

302
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:52,694
But...

303
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,894
if it's just as you say, it means that

304
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:59,194
you're here with a murderer in front of you, you know?

305
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:01,194
Moreover, it's just you and me.

306
00:20:03,694 --> 00:20:05,394
Aren't you scared?

307
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:07,994
What? You're going to kill me?

308
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,494
But if I don't go home,

309
00:20:10,494 --> 00:20:13,494
you'll be the first one to be suspected, right?

310
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,194
I wonder about that.

311
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:18,494
If I say that I dropped you off near your home,

312
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:20,394
I think that everyone will believe me.

313
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:21,894
I wonder about that.

314
00:20:21,894 --> 00:20:24,594
Of course, because...

315
00:20:24,594 --> 00:20:28,094
I have no motive to have to kill you.

316
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:35,094
You're planning to keep on lying?

317
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,194
Didn't I tell you?

318
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:40,894
That happiness is built upon lies and secrets.

319
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,594
I don't think so.

320
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:46,294
But I also deceived you, too.

321
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:47,294
What?

322
00:20:47,294 --> 00:20:50,294
When I put the smartphone back in my pocket a while ago,

323
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,794
I pushed the call back button.

324
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,694
"Kogoro Mouri: In Call" -Ms. Misaki! Don't do anything stupid!

325
00:20:55,694 --> 00:20:57,994
I already reported this to the police!

326
00:20:57,994 --> 00:21:00,994
The inspectors and the others will be there any minute now.

327
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,194
So, turn yourself in already!

328
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:06,394
Too bad, Ms. Misaki.

329
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:11,394
Who on earth are you, anyway?

330
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:15,294
Conan Edogawa, a detective.

331
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:38,194
"MPD Beika Police Station"

332
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:40,094
According to her confession,

333
00:22:40,094 --> 00:22:43,894
Yaginuma and Misaki were friends since some time ago,

334
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:47,594
and they seem to have devised this scheme even before she got married.

335
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:48,994
I see.

336
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:52,994
At any rate, Conan, you were a great help again this time.

337
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:55,894
Did Kudo give you instructions again?

338
00:22:55,894 --> 00:22:58,694
What? Oh, sort of.

339
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:01,994
But because of that, Conan was put in danger.

340
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,594
What's on that guy's mind anyway?

341
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:04,894
But that's...

342
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:06,394
Exactly, exactly!

343
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:09,594
What was he going to do if something happened to this brat?

344
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:10,594
Well, well.

345
00:23:10,594 --> 00:23:12,894
The case has been solved.

346
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:15,294
And Conan is safe, too.

347
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:18,994
I tell you. If they let me handle it, to begin with.

348
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:23,794
You were having lewd thoughts again, weren't you?

349
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:26,494
Idiot. No, I was not.

350
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:28,694
I'm positive you were.

351
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:29,794
You were imagining

352
00:23:29,794 --> 00:23:32,294
-being alone with Ms. Misaki, weren't you? -Come on, both of you.

353
00:23:32,294 --> 00:23:34,294
I was thinking no such thing.

354
00:23:34,294 --> 00:23:36,594
-It's just that I... -You just what?

355
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:37,794
-I only... -Only?

356
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:39,494
Oh, inspector, would you like to go for a drink

357
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:41,894
-to celebrate case closed. -Don't get me involved.

358
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:43,894
Dad, don't play dumb with me!

359
00:23:43,894 --> 00:23:45,594
I'm not playing dumb.

360
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:48,494
Will you have your family brawls at home!

361
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:57,494
"Next Episode" -Shall we have ramen for dinner, Conan?

362
00:23:57,494 --> 00:24:00,294
-Okay. -Will you cancel

363
00:24:00,294 --> 00:24:03,394
my French dinner tonight for me?

364
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:06,494
-You want ramen instead of a French dinner? -Bye!

365
00:24:06,494 --> 00:24:07,894
Hey, you over there!

366
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,094
Just what do you think you're doing?

367
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,094
As if carrying out

368
00:24:13,094 --> 00:24:15,694
a ritual or something!

369
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:17,694
Ritual?

370
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:18,894
Spooky.

371
00:24:18,894 --> 00:24:20,594
Next Conan,

372
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:24,294
"Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 1)"

373
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:26,937
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:26,937 --> 00:24:29,237
"Ramen Ogura"

375
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,537
Ramen with red beans?

376
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:32,537
No, no, it's the name of the shop.

377
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:33,637
It's my second time.
