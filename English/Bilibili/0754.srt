1
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.340
It feels good.

2
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.940
Forest bathing is super.

3
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.340
That's right.

4
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.440
The air's so delicious too.

5
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.640
It's so healing.

6
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.140
I should've brought Dad along too.

7
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.640
Thank you for inviting us to come, Sera.

8
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.540
Not at all, I'm glad that you're here with me too.

9
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.540
But, it's not like you

10
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
to be interested in forest bathing, Sera.

11
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.240
Well, I came over because I was asked to do some work here.

12
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.640
Work? Don't tell me...

13
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.840
You mean your detective work?

14
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
Yes. The request actually came for my brother.

15
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.440
A friend of his during his high school days

16
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.440
asked him to solve a mystery at the rental villa

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.740
that we're headed for right now.

18
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.340
But, it seems he's busy, you see.

19
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.140
That's why he asked me, a woman high school detective,

20
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.340
to come here in his place.

21
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.940
You mean, your older brother is a detective too?

22
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.940
No, it seems that during his high school days

23
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.640
he used to solve mysteries just like that you see.

24
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.340
But, I thought your older brother passed away.

25
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.540
Yes. My oldest brother did.

26
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.840
The one who was asked to do the job was my second brother.

27
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.340
I have two older brothers, you see.

28
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.040
All three of us have different last names though.

29
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.740
Why are your last names different?

30
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.440
Because of things like Dad dying and such.

31
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.740
I have my mother's maiden name, Sera, you see.

32
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.040
My second brother's last name was also Sera

33
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.540
until he graduated from high school.

34
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.840
Then before your name changed to Sera...

35
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.240
I'll bet it was...

36
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.940
Akai. (Also means "red")

37
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.740
A red person.

38
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.640
There was a red person beyond the trees

39
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.540
just a while ago, wasn't there?

40
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.140
Yes.

41
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.540
A woman wearing a red raincoat and red boots.

42
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.040
She had long hair.

43
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.340
I thought I saw her right around there until a while ago.

44
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.440
A red woman.

45
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.840
Conan!

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.340
A swamp?

47
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.840
You'd better watch your step.

48
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.040
This forest seems to have quick sand swamps too.

49
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.440
-No joke. -No joke.

50
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.740
A refreshing autumn wind blows away the heat of summer.

51
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.540
A stylish and fashionable deduction show!

52
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.140
A rental villa with a bright red door.

53
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.540
The shadow of the red woman resurrects.

54
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

55
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

56
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.940
His name is Detective Conan.

57
00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:12.978
"The Tragedy of the Red Woman (Bath Steam)"

58
00:05:18.378 --> 00:05:21.878
What a wonderful villa.

59
00:05:21.878 --> 00:05:25.278
But, was is only the entrance door bright red?

60
00:05:25.278 --> 00:05:29.178
True. It's sort of eerie.

61
00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:34.078
Oh, are you're Sera's younger sister and her friends?

62
00:05:34.078 --> 00:05:36.578
Yes, we are.

63
00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:39.078
Thank you for coming all this way.

64
00:05:39.078 --> 00:05:41.578
-"Tamami Minegishi (28)" -I'm Tamami Minegishi.

65
00:05:41.578 --> 00:05:44.378
We're counting on you, okay!

66
00:05:44.378 --> 00:05:49.078
Who of you are Sera's younger sister?

67
00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:51.378
I'm his younger sister, Masumi,

68
00:05:51.378 --> 00:05:55.878
and they're my classmates, Sonoko Suzuki and Ran Mouri.

69
00:05:55.878 --> 00:05:58.578
-Hello. -How do you do?

70
00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:02.678
And, he's Conan Edogawa,

71
00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:04.578
who's staying over at Ran's.

72
00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:07.378
He's a detective who's much smarter than me.

73
00:06:07.378 --> 00:06:11.678
Conan, you're little but super, aren't you?

74
00:06:11.678 --> 00:06:15.378
Oh, well, not really.

75
00:06:15.378 --> 00:06:18.178
And, about what we're asking you to do.

76
00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:22.478
We've been taking pictures of the weird things that are happening

77
00:06:22.478 --> 00:06:26.178
at this villa with a digital camera,

78
00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:30.978
and Sumika said that she going to bring it after printing them out.

79
00:06:30.978 --> 00:06:32.978
Oh, there she is.

80
00:06:32.978 --> 00:06:36.778
Sumika, did you bring the pictures?

81
00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:43.578
-"Sumika Kawana (28)" -These are the pictures I printed out.

82
00:06:43.578 --> 00:06:44.578
We're counting on you.

83
00:06:44.578 --> 00:06:45.678
Yes.

84
00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:46.778
See you.

85
00:06:48.478 --> 00:06:51.078
I'm sorry, don't let her bother you.

86
00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:53.678
Sumika's not very friendly with people she meets for the first time.

87
00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:55.778
She always that way, you see.

88
00:06:57.978 --> 00:07:01.478
Oh! Sera's younger sister, the high school detective, right?

89
00:07:01.478 --> 00:07:03.078
So, you really came?

90
00:07:03.078 --> 00:07:05.578
Ninda and Hakuya?

91
00:07:05.578 --> 00:07:07.178
Did you guys come together?

92
00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:08.578
No.

93
00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:11.678
-"Masaie Hakuya (28)" -We happened to run into each other in the forest.

94
00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:13.078
So, we came together.

95
00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:16.978
He said that he fell into the swamp.

96
00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:19.678
I saw him just as he was changing clothes in the forest.

97
00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:23.378
-"Jinsuke Ninda (29)" -He's a klutz as ever, isn't he?

98
00:07:23.378 --> 00:07:25.478
Come on, cut that out.

99
00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:27.378
But, how disappointing.

100
00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:28.778
I was looking forward to seeing her

101
00:07:28.778 --> 00:07:30.778
because he said she was a high school student,

102
00:07:30.778 --> 00:07:33.678
but it seems like she brings her boyfriend along.

103
00:07:33.678 --> 00:07:35.378
He told us that his younger sister

104
00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:38.078
was coming with her girlfriends, you see.

105
00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:41.678
I'm his younger sister, Masumi Sera!

106
00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:43.678
You mean, you're a girl?

107
00:07:43.678 --> 00:07:46.578
I was so sure that you were a boy.

108
00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:48.278
Excuse me.

109
00:07:48.278 --> 00:07:52.378
What's in that bag you're carrying on your back?

110
00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:54.178
Oh, this?

111
00:07:56.778 --> 00:07:58.378
It's a bat.

112
00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:01.378
I bring it with me every year for self-protection.

113
00:08:01.378 --> 00:08:04.578
It sure is a thin bat, though.

114
00:08:04.578 --> 00:08:06.878
Can hit balls with that?

115
00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:08.978
Like I said, it's for self-protection.

116
00:08:08.978 --> 00:08:11.478
Self-protection?

117
00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:13.078
Are there bears around here so something?

118
00:08:13.078 --> 00:08:16.278
No, there are no bears here...

119
00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:18.478
-Right? -Right.

120
00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:43.078
It's delicious.

121
00:08:43.078 --> 00:08:45.478
Really! It's super delicious.

122
00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:49.178
Tamami! This hamburger is really delicious.

123
00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:50.578
Right, Conan?

124
00:08:50.578 --> 00:08:53.178
-Yes. -Thank you.

125
00:08:53.178 --> 00:08:57.278
Tamami's hamburger's so good that she could run a store making it.

126
00:08:57.278 --> 00:08:59.378
I wonder about that.

127
00:08:59.378 --> 00:09:00.778
It's true.

128
00:09:00.778 --> 00:09:03.478
That you could make pretty good money with this hamburger.

129
00:09:03.478 --> 00:09:05.778
Don't be silly.

130
00:09:10.678 --> 00:09:15.078
Sera, you're good at using a knife and fork, aren't you?

131
00:09:15.078 --> 00:09:17.578
I couldn't use them at all when I was child,

132
00:09:17.578 --> 00:09:20.478
but after living abroad for three years, I got used to them.

133
00:09:20.478 --> 00:09:23.478
Just as would be expected of someone who returned from the States!

134
00:09:23.478 --> 00:09:27.378
Children are really fast learners.

135
00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:30.878
You got sauce on your face, Conan.

136
00:09:30.878 --> 00:09:34.278
By the way, what kind of gathering is this?

137
00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:36.578
The outdoor club in our high school days.

138
00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:40.678
We used to go mountain climbing and camping together.

139
00:09:40.678 --> 00:09:43.078
But, since we were still just high school students,

140
00:09:43.078 --> 00:09:46.678
the only time we got to do anything was during summer vacation.

141
00:09:46.678 --> 00:09:48.078
Thank you!

142
00:09:48.078 --> 00:09:50.978
But, really enjoyed the time we spent together!

143
00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:55.678
The only members were five of us, classmates though.

144
00:09:55.678 --> 00:09:57.278
If there is five of you...

145
00:09:57.278 --> 00:10:02.978
which means that the woman in red clothes is the other member?

146
00:10:15.578 --> 00:10:18.178
Where did you see her?

147
00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:20.378
In the forest, with Sonoko.

148
00:10:20.378 --> 00:10:23.178
Is it true that she was wearing red clothes?

149
00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:24.478
Yes.

150
00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:27.378
She was wearing a red raincoat and red boots.

151
00:10:27.378 --> 00:10:31.678
She was red from head to toe and had long hair.

152
00:10:31.678 --> 00:10:33.978
Hey. Don't tell me.

153
00:10:33.978 --> 00:10:36.278
That's a lie!

154
00:10:36.278 --> 00:10:37.878
It can't be.

155
00:10:37.878 --> 00:10:41.278
There's no way Satoko's alive.

156
00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:42.978
Oh, well,

157
00:10:42.978 --> 00:10:47.778
I thought it may be the killer 15 years ago.

158
00:10:49.378 --> 00:10:51.078
About that...

159
00:10:51.078 --> 00:10:55.578
Tell me more about it in detail.

160
00:10:55.578 --> 00:10:57.378
You want to hear about it too, don't you, Conan?

161
00:10:57.378 --> 00:10:59.978
What? I mean yes.

162
00:11:04.178 --> 00:11:07.878
Well, it was 15 years ago.

163
00:11:07.878 --> 00:11:13.678
There was a murder at a different rental villa near here.

164
00:11:13.678 --> 00:11:16.878
The victim was some office worker.

165
00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:22.178
He had secretly come to the villa with his cheating partner,

166
00:11:22.178 --> 00:11:25.678
when his wife burst in on them with a knife.

167
00:11:25.678 --> 00:11:29.578
By the time a police officer who heard of this incident got to the room,

168
00:11:29.578 --> 00:11:33.778
the entire room was a sea of blood.

169
00:11:38.878 --> 00:11:44.078
The white raincoat that she was wearing had turned bright red

170
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:48.578
because she had stabbed him over and over.

171
00:11:49.678 --> 00:11:51.978
They called her...

172
00:11:54.578 --> 00:11:56.578
The Red Woman.

173
00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:15.612
-The Red Woman? -The Red Woman?

174
00:12:21.312 --> 00:12:25.112
And was that woman arrested?

175
00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:26.612
No.

176
00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:29.212
She stabbed the police officer who came to the scene,

177
00:12:29.212 --> 00:12:31.012
she vanished into the forest,

178
00:12:31.012 --> 00:12:33.112
and is still on the run.

179
00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:37.612
And, three years later.

180
00:12:37.612 --> 00:12:42.612
When we came to this rental villa during summer vacation,

181
00:12:42.612 --> 00:12:47.512
another member of our club, Satoko, said that she saw a red woman,

182
00:12:47.512 --> 00:12:52.512
so we all went to the forest to look for her, but...

183
00:12:52.512 --> 00:12:56.412
while searching, Satoko seems to have gone astray.

184
00:12:56.412 --> 00:12:58.612
So since it started to get dark we called the police

185
00:12:58.612 --> 00:13:01.112
and had them search for her too, but...

186
00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:04.412
She was found a week later.

187
00:13:05.912 --> 00:13:08.512
Satoko's corpse was found sunk in the quicksand swamp

188
00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:13.112
covered all over with mud.

189
00:13:13.112 --> 00:13:16.212
Satoko's shoes were found near the swamp

190
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.912
and that's what lead to the discovery of corpse.

191
00:13:18.912 --> 00:13:23.812
The knife that was used in the murder case was also found on the ground.

192
00:13:23.812 --> 00:13:26.812
And so we all thought

193
00:13:26.812 --> 00:13:28.912
that maybe Satoko...

194
00:13:39.212 --> 00:13:42.712
Was chased around by the red woman in the forest

195
00:13:42.712 --> 00:13:46.012
and ended up falling into the quicksand.

196
00:14:09.212 --> 00:14:13.312
You want Sera to catch the red woman?

197
00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:16.612
What? Oh, no.

198
00:14:16.612 --> 00:14:19.412
That's work for the police, isn't it?

199
00:14:19.412 --> 00:14:24.012
Even after graduating, we've decided to gather here every year

200
00:14:24.012 --> 00:14:27.712
on the day that Satoko's corpse was found.

201
00:14:27.712 --> 00:14:29.412
But, from about the year before last,

202
00:14:29.412 --> 00:14:31.912
weird things have been happening.

203
00:14:34.412 --> 00:14:36.312
Like windows cracking

204
00:14:36.312 --> 00:14:39.812
and a lot of apples found scattered around the room.

205
00:14:43.012 --> 00:14:46.912
When we couldn't get any hot water,

206
00:14:46.912 --> 00:14:50.112
we found red rose petals stuffed inside the hot water heater.

207
00:14:54.412 --> 00:15:00.212
There were times when the front door was splattered with red paint too.

208
00:15:00.212 --> 00:15:03.412
And this time, a red woman.

209
00:15:05.012 --> 00:15:07.112
It seems that the owner of the villa

210
00:15:07.112 --> 00:15:12.112
decided to paint the front door all red after that incident.

211
00:15:12.112 --> 00:15:15.212
That's why the front door is red.

212
00:15:15.212 --> 00:15:18.312
Well, I think that most probably all the weird occurrences

213
00:15:18.312 --> 00:15:24.812
including the red woman you saw in the forest are all pranks.

214
00:15:24.812 --> 00:15:29.312
And, well, we wanted to figure out who the culprit was,

215
00:15:29.312 --> 00:15:33.112
so we decided to ask Sera who's clever to do the job.

216
00:15:33.112 --> 00:15:37.412
I see. I got the rough picture.

217
00:15:37.412 --> 00:15:41.812
So, you want me to solve the mystery involving the red woman.

218
00:15:41.812 --> 00:15:44.812
No. We can leave the red woman to the police.

219
00:15:44.812 --> 00:15:46.112
Okay!

220
00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:51.012
I'll go check around the forest on more.

221
00:15:51.012 --> 00:15:52.212
Me too.

222
00:15:52.612 --> 00:15:54.612
Wait, Conan!

223
00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:57.212
You can't just go off on your own!

224
00:16:01.212 --> 00:16:05.612
I'll go shopping at a store about a kilometre from here.

225
00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:08.312
We need a lot of things like drinks and foodstuffs, right?

226
00:16:08.312 --> 00:16:10.212
Yes, thanks.

227
00:16:10.212 --> 00:16:13.112
Okay, I'll clean the dishes and all.

228
00:16:13.112 --> 00:16:16.812
Shall we help you shopping?

229
00:16:16.812 --> 00:16:19.112
Oh, no. It's fine...

230
00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:23.012
Because shopping and carrying things are my job.

231
00:16:29.212 --> 00:16:32.612
What's the matter, Hakuya?

232
00:16:32.612 --> 00:16:35.112
You look pale.

233
00:16:35.112 --> 00:16:39.512
It's nothing. It's really nothing.

234
00:16:39.512 --> 00:16:44.512
Well... I guess I'll go clean the bath tub and bathroom.

235
00:16:44.512 --> 00:16:46.412
Thanks, Hakuya.

236
00:16:51.512 --> 00:16:54.312
I guess I'll go clean the rooms then,

237
00:16:54.312 --> 00:16:56.412
but will two help me out too?

238
00:16:56.412 --> 00:16:58.812
Sure.

239
00:16:58.812 --> 00:17:00.612
You know...

240
00:17:00.612 --> 00:17:04.212
After taking a good look around this place, it's really dusty.

241
00:17:04.212 --> 00:17:08.012
We should've cleaned the place a bit before eating lunch.

242
00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:10.912
Even so, don't you think it's a bit too filthy?

243
00:17:10.912 --> 00:17:15.212
Well, if such a case as we just heard about had happened nearby,

244
00:17:15.212 --> 00:17:17.912
maybe not too many people want to rent the place already.

245
00:17:21.112 --> 00:17:23.412
The sound of the vacuum cleaner's really loud.

246
00:17:23.412 --> 00:17:26.712
It's probably the big type that has great suction.

247
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:29.712
Yes, the one that you see a lot on TV shopping and stuff.

248
00:17:29.712 --> 00:17:30.712
Right...

249
00:17:30.712 --> 00:17:34.912
What do you two want for dinner?

250
00:17:34.912 --> 00:17:37.812
I thought I'd start making preparations.

251
00:17:37.812 --> 00:17:40.612
Anything that tastes good

252
00:17:40.612 --> 00:17:42.112
Okay, I got it!

253
00:17:42.112 --> 00:17:44.212
Shall we help with the preparations?

254
00:17:44.212 --> 00:17:45.412
No, thanks...

255
00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:48.012
I can handle it alone.

256
00:17:48.012 --> 00:17:51.012
Did you two finish cleaning the living room?

257
00:17:51.012 --> 00:17:52.112
Yes.

258
00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:55.012
Then, please help me with the other rooms too, will you?

259
00:17:55.012 --> 00:17:57.112
-Yes, of course! -Yes, of course!

260
00:18:06.412 --> 00:18:09.712
Hakuya filled the bath tub up.

261
00:18:09.712 --> 00:18:12.012
He's pretty thoughtful.

262
00:18:12.012 --> 00:18:14.112
Hakuya's not here.

263
00:18:14.112 --> 00:18:16.112
I wonder if he cleaning the bathroom then?

264
00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:21.712
How's the water temperature?

265
00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:23.312
It seems to be just right.

266
00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:25.612
The colour of the water is green.

267
00:18:25.612 --> 00:18:27.512
It's green bath salt.

268
00:18:27.512 --> 00:18:29.612
Hakuya's hooked on it now.

269
00:18:29.612 --> 00:18:31.712
My mother uses it too!

270
00:18:31.712 --> 00:18:34.012
It promotes perspiration, doesn't it?

271
00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:36.912
I hear it's good for the skin too.

272
00:18:36.912 --> 00:18:40.812
Then, shall we finish up cleaning and be the first to take a bath?

273
00:18:40.812 --> 00:18:43.612
The bath tub here's quite large too, see?

274
00:18:43.612 --> 00:18:44.912
Sounds good!

275
00:18:44.912 --> 00:18:46.512
Let's, let's!

276
00:18:47.612 --> 00:18:49.412
I'm back.

277
00:18:49.412 --> 00:18:51.212
Welcome back.

278
00:18:51.212 --> 00:18:53.412
Oh, you're together?

279
00:18:53.412 --> 00:18:57.512
Well... I coincidentally ran into them on my way back here,

280
00:18:57.512 --> 00:19:00.012
and had them help me carry stuff.

281
00:19:02.212 --> 00:19:05.212
I looked here and there in the forest

282
00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:07.612
but couldn't come up with anything.

283
00:19:07.612 --> 00:19:09.212
I see.

284
00:19:09.212 --> 00:19:13.412
Well... I guess we'll close the case for today then.

285
00:19:13.412 --> 00:19:17.812
I got ready my very best recipe for tonight's dinner, you see.

286
00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:20.312
That sounds great.

287
00:19:20.312 --> 00:19:23.412
Where are Ran and the others?

288
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:24.712
They said since they finished cleaning,

289
00:19:24.712 --> 00:19:26.412
they're going to take a bath.

290
00:19:26.412 --> 00:19:29.412
So she taking a bath now with Sumika and Sonoko.

291
00:19:29.412 --> 00:19:32.312
Hey, what's this?

292
00:19:32.312 --> 00:19:33.412
It's revolting.

293
00:19:33.412 --> 00:19:35.612
Is this someone's prank too?

294
00:19:40.912 --> 00:19:42.412
What's the matter?

295
00:19:46.212 --> 00:19:48.512
Hey! What's up?

296
00:19:48.512 --> 00:19:50.312
Are you guys okay?

297
00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:51.512
Red.

298
00:19:57.112 --> 00:19:58.412
Red?

299
00:20:02.812 --> 00:20:04.312
Red...

300
00:20:04.312 --> 00:20:05.812
Woman.

301
00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:17.612
The bath tub is filled with tomatoes.

302
00:20:18.712 --> 00:20:21.112
Red tomatoes.

303
00:20:21.712 --> 00:20:25.712
This is also a prank.

304
00:20:25.712 --> 00:20:27.412
Where's Hakuya?

305
00:20:27.412 --> 00:20:29.612
What? Now that you mentioned it,

306
00:20:29.612 --> 00:20:32.012
I haven't seen him since after lunch.

307
00:20:32.012 --> 00:20:34.812
Nindo, is Hakuya around?

308
00:20:34.812 --> 00:20:37.512
Oh, no, he's not.

309
00:20:37.512 --> 00:20:39.312
I wonder where he went.

310
00:20:39.312 --> 00:20:42.312
He was supposed to go clean the bath tub and bathroom, right?

311
00:20:42.312 --> 00:20:46.012
Yes. He was supposed to.

312
00:20:46.012 --> 00:20:47.812
-Don't tell me... -Don't tell me...

313
00:22:43.012 --> 00:22:46.212
He's Hakuya, isn't he?

314
00:22:46.212 --> 00:22:47.612
Yes.

315
00:22:54.612 --> 00:22:56.012
Darn it.

316
00:23:14.112 --> 00:23:15.412
I see.

317
00:23:15.412 --> 00:23:17.612
This is a bath tub.

318
00:23:19.412 --> 00:23:24.312
Is Hakuya dead?

319
00:23:24.312 --> 00:23:27.412
Yes, it seems that way.

320
00:23:50.812 --> 00:23:52.612
Then, who on earth?

321
00:23:52.612 --> 00:23:54.712
Who else?

322
00:23:54.712 --> 00:23:56.912
The one who killed Hakuya.

323
00:23:56.912 --> 00:23:58.112
The Red Woman.

324
00:23:58.112 --> 00:24:00.412
Who else could it be but her?

325
00:24:03.212 --> 00:24:04.812
The Red Woman.

326
00:24:06.012 --> 00:24:07.612
There're no such things.

327
00:24:07.612 --> 00:24:09.712
Evil spirits or goblins.

328
00:24:09.712 --> 00:24:12.112
Witches or wizards.

329
00:24:12.112 --> 00:24:15.112
They all belong to the world of fantasy.

330
00:24:15.112 --> 00:24:16.612
Next Conan,

331
00:24:16.612 --> 00:24:20.612
"The Tragedy of the Red Woman (Evil Spirit)"

332
00:24:36.112 --> 00:24:38.312
Next Conan's Hint:

333
00:24:38.312 --> 00:24:40.612
"Nagano Prefectural Police Department".

334
00:24:40.612 --> 00:24:43.012
-Are you all right, Conan? -Of course I'm not okay.

335
00:24:43.012 --> 00:24:45.412
Ran, pick up your bath towel.
