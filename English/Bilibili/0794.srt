1
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.540
Hide!

2
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.440
I did it! How about it?

3
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.940
Oh, no...

4
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.140
That's it.

5
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.440
It hurts...

6
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.140
Thank you.

7
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.840
You failed to sterilize (Inspect and verify safety) the room.

8
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.540
Minus 20 points!

9
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.840
You put the Marutai (The person who needed to be protected)

10
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.440
in the room alone.

11
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.140
Minus 30 points!

12
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.540
You confronted and fought the Maruhi (The suspect without authorization).

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.240
Minus 20 points!

14
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.140
On top of that you overlooked the other suspect.

15
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.740
Minus 20 points!

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.240
Consequently, the Marutai died.

17
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.140
Maximum minus point, that's not even worth evaluating!

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.740
Therefore...

19
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.240
"Arimasa Dobashi (45)" -You've failed.

20
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.840
How many times do I have to tell you, Mr. Mouri?

21
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.640
You're currently not a police detective nor a detective.

22
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.540
Your sole job is to protect the life of the Marutai,

23
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.440
not to defend the law nor practice justice!

24
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.340
Absolutely. I'm ashamed of myself.

25
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.740
Let me try once more!

26
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.240
Rather, please!

27
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640
Good for you!

28
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.540
Everyone, standby!

29
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.940
Great!

30
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

31
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.840
Love and cases come from the same origin.

32
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.540
Many things are suspicious at a location for a drama.

33
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.940
Close call, bodyguard Pops.

34
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.940
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:42.587
"Bodyguard, Kogoro Mouri"

38
00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:53.687
"Reina Sawasaki (28), Actress"

39
00:03:53.987 --> 00:03:55.987
"Chisato Arimura (25), Nichiuri TV Assistant Director"

40
00:03:55.987 --> 00:03:58.987
Here you go, Reina. It's coffee.

41
00:03:58.987 --> 00:04:02.287
"Kenzo Kushizaki (45)" -Well... I wish you would do something about it.

42
00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:04.187
Okay?

43
00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:08.287
"Hideo Isokawa (40), Nichiuri TV Director"

44
00:04:11.587 --> 00:04:14.087
But is it really okay?

45
00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.687
For only us to come along with all of you.

46
00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:20.487
I can't have my bodyguard riding in another car, can I?

47
00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:23.587
"Ryo Haneki (40), Actress" -I could really be killed next time.

48
00:04:24.087 --> 00:04:25.587
I...

49
00:04:34.787 --> 00:04:36.287
I went out of my way to ask you,

50
00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:39.287
the famed Detective Mouri to serve as my bodyguard

51
00:04:39.287 --> 00:04:41.587
because simultaneous to protecting me,

52
00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:42.887
I want you to find out who's trying to kill me

53
00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:45.487
with your fantastic skill of deduction.

54
00:04:45.487 --> 00:04:48.087
Of course, you can count on me.

55
00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:51.187
That's the very reason I trained with the security company

56
00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:54.487
affiliated with your agency.

57
00:04:54.487 --> 00:04:56.587
But, why are they...

58
00:04:59.187 --> 00:05:01.687
You must all be thirsty.

59
00:05:01.687 --> 00:05:02.887
Please help yourselves.

60
00:05:02.887 --> 00:05:06.387
"Kazuya Kusumoto (35)" -It's Ryo Haneki's special vegetable juice.

61
00:05:06.387 --> 00:05:08.087
Thank you very much.

62
00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:09.487
Thank you.

63
00:05:10.087 --> 00:05:11.887
Dramas are a different story,

64
00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:13.587
but I've actually got a lot of free time.

65
00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:16.587
I'm glad I found somebody to keep me company talking.

66
00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:18.687
That's for us to say!

67
00:05:18.687 --> 00:05:21.387
We just came to watch and yet we get to travel together

68
00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:25.087
with the great actress, Ryo Haneki.

69
00:05:25.087 --> 00:05:26.687
Right, Conan?

70
00:05:26.687 --> 00:05:27.787
Yes.

71
00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:34.687
"Lake Nakajima"

72
00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:43.987
"Auberge Muto"

73
00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:47.187
Thank you for coming, everyone.

74
00:05:47.187 --> 00:05:50.187
"Kimie Muto (30), Shohei Muto (33)" -You must be tired from the long trip.

75
00:05:50.187 --> 00:05:52.087
Well, hello.

76
00:05:52.087 --> 00:05:55.487
We look forward to staying here, Mr. Muto.

77
00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:58.387
Yes, we hope you get to relax here.

78
00:05:58.387 --> 00:06:01.687
Well them, I'll be off to sterilize the premises.

79
00:06:01.687 --> 00:06:03.787
I'm counting on you, Mr. Mouri.

80
00:06:07.387 --> 00:06:09.887
It's okay, Mr. Mouri.

81
00:06:09.887 --> 00:06:12.787
It's already been sterilized inside.

82
00:06:12.787 --> 00:06:14.687
Chief Dobashi?

83
00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:17.287
You're here too, Mr. Dobashi?

84
00:06:17.287 --> 00:06:19.887
I heard that you were unusually taking time off,

85
00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:22.387
so I thought you were out with your family.

86
00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:25.687
If I remember correctly, you have a daughter?

87
00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:28.187
Don't worry.

88
00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:30.887
I'm getting along fine with my daughter.

89
00:06:32.187 --> 00:06:34.387
Well, what a coincidence!

90
00:06:34.387 --> 00:06:37.087
I have a daughter too.

91
00:06:37.087 --> 00:06:39.987
Mr. Mouri, today is also your graduation exam day

92
00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:41.987
from Dobashi Security Guard Agency, you know.

93
00:06:41.987 --> 00:06:44.987
Oh, yes, indeed.

94
00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:46.987
Talk about stressful.

95
00:06:46.987 --> 00:06:50.987
How reassuring to have two good men looking out for me.

96
00:06:50.987 --> 00:06:52.887
I feel like a princess.

97
00:06:52.887 --> 00:06:55.787
Yeah, but a princess way past her prime I'd say.

98
00:06:55.787 --> 00:06:58.187
Reina.

99
00:06:58.187 --> 00:07:01.687
Then, why don't you look after Princess Reina, Mr. Dobashi?

100
00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.887
I feel safe as long as Mr. Mouri's with me.

101
00:07:07.487 --> 00:07:09.487
Come on, dad.

102
00:07:11.287 --> 00:07:14.387
I'm perfectly fine with sweetie Kusumoto, you see.

103
00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:16.987
Oh no... I'm not a bodyguard.

104
00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:18.287
I'm just joking.

105
00:07:21.187 --> 00:07:25.387
Reina's famous for being a troublemaker, right?

106
00:07:25.387 --> 00:07:28.487
Yes, I hear she's always fighting at the location sites.

107
00:07:28.487 --> 00:07:30.887
-Moreover... -We're in the same agency,

108
00:07:30.887 --> 00:07:33.487
and yet are like cats and dogs.

109
00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:35.787
That's famous too.

110
00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:38.687
But, I may be the problem rather than her.

111
00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:41.087
I don't get along with anyone here,

112
00:07:41.087 --> 00:07:44.187
I wonder why nobody likes me.

113
00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:48.287
Is it because I try too hard although it's not a drama?

114
00:07:48.287 --> 00:07:50.487
Am I taking too long?

115
00:07:50.487 --> 00:07:51.887
No... That's not it...

116
00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:54.887
This program wouldn't exist without you, Ryo.

117
00:07:54.887 --> 00:07:56.887
I heard, Kushizaki.

118
00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:58.587
Rumor that the program'll be cancelled.

119
00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:00.787
And that the ratings are low too.

120
00:08:00.787 --> 00:08:04.187
No... Rumors are nothing more than rumors.

121
00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:09.587
I'm sorry if you lose your jobs.

122
00:08:09.587 --> 00:08:11.587
It's all because of me.

123
00:08:18.187 --> 00:08:22.187
I mean, she's making the most out of all of us.

124
00:08:22.187 --> 00:08:24.787
She's paid more than her skills and time are worth.

125
00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:25.787
That's what it is...

126
00:08:25.787 --> 00:08:28.787
Cool it. Isokawa, come on.

127
00:08:29.587 --> 00:08:31.287
-This voice? -It's Reina.

128
00:08:31.287 --> 00:08:32.787
What do you mean it's already sterilized?

129
00:08:32.787 --> 00:08:34.287
It can't be!

130
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.287
Are you all right?

131
00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:44.887
What? What the...

132
00:08:50.287 --> 00:08:51.687
I've had it!

133
00:08:53.987 --> 00:08:56.887
What's the matter, Reina?

134
00:08:56.887 --> 00:08:58.287
Maybe it's that?

135
00:09:03.187 --> 00:09:04.687
I'm so sorry...

136
00:09:04.687 --> 00:09:06.987
There are a lot of stray cats out here.

137
00:09:06.987 --> 00:09:09.487
I'll clean the room up again right away.

138
00:09:10.287 --> 00:09:12.987
Hey, you know it, right, Kusumoto?

139
00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:16.187
That I really can't handle this.

140
00:09:16.187 --> 00:09:17.787
Allergic to cats.

141
00:09:17.787 --> 00:09:18.987
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:18.987 --> 00:09:22.887
I did tell Mr. Mouri about you too, Reina, but...

143
00:09:22.887 --> 00:09:24.887
No, it's my mistake.

144
00:09:24.887 --> 00:09:28.387
I should've left everything up to Mr. Mouri.

145
00:09:28.387 --> 00:09:29.687
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:29.687 --> 00:09:31.987
What? Is something wrong?

147
00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:33.187
Not really...

148
00:09:33.187 --> 00:09:35.687
I'm not a Maru-whatever,

149
00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:39.487
so I found out that I can't have maximum protection like you.

150
00:09:49.687 --> 00:09:51.087
-Cheers! -Cheers!

151
00:09:52.387 --> 00:09:55.387
They're both beautiful. As expected.

152
00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:57.687
True.

153
00:09:57.687 --> 00:10:00.787
You can't tell their like cats and dogs.

154
00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:02.787
They're actresses all right.

155
00:10:02.787 --> 00:10:04.087
Cut.

156
00:10:04.087 --> 00:10:05.487
Okay.

157
00:10:05.487 --> 00:10:07.387
Next, we're switching scenes!

158
00:10:07.387 --> 00:10:09.887
Aren't we going to retake the previous shot before that?

159
00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:12.387
Oh... I'm sorry...

160
00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:13.987
Talk about disorganized...

161
00:10:13.987 --> 00:10:16.187
I hope you don't keep me up all night for this.

162
00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:17.887
Because it's bad for my skin.

163
00:10:17.887 --> 00:10:18.987
That's right...

164
00:10:18.987 --> 00:10:22.287
Because Ryo's way past her prime.

165
00:10:25.887 --> 00:10:27.287
Let's retake the scene!

166
00:10:28.887 --> 00:10:30.887
Goodnight!

167
00:10:30.887 --> 00:10:33.687
After the breakfast shoot tomorrow,

168
00:10:33.687 --> 00:10:35.987
we'll be shooting at the lake.

169
00:10:35.987 --> 00:10:38.187
Thank you, everyone!

170
00:10:55.587 --> 00:10:58.187
I wonder who it is at this time of night?

171
00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:07.687
That's Ryo's room.

172
00:11:32.637 --> 00:11:34.137
That's it!

173
00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:42.037
This is...

174
00:11:42.037 --> 00:11:43.837
Kusumoto?

175
00:11:43.837 --> 00:11:45.237
Hey, hold it!

176
00:11:47.337 --> 00:11:49.037
No point running.

177
00:11:49.037 --> 00:11:51.237
I've already called the police.

178
00:11:52.437 --> 00:11:53.537
Don't tell me that...

179
00:11:53.537 --> 00:11:55.437
Is it about the transfer?

180
00:11:55.437 --> 00:11:58.037
Yeah! I want to stay at the set...

181
00:11:58.037 --> 00:12:00.937
But, I'll bet you told the higher ups to move me to desk work.

182
00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:04.537
Is that why you've been following her around trying to killer her?

183
00:12:04.537 --> 00:12:07.237
No! This was the first and only time!

184
00:12:09.737 --> 00:12:15.837
I'm just saying you that there are still many others that hate you.

185
00:12:15.837 --> 00:12:17.337
No.

186
00:12:17.337 --> 00:12:18.937
What's the matter?

187
00:12:18.937 --> 00:12:20.237
Dad?

188
00:12:20.237 --> 00:12:23.637
Oh? Well...

189
00:12:23.637 --> 00:12:24.837
This is...

190
00:12:33.937 --> 00:12:38.137
-The wind is nice. -It feels great.

191
00:12:38.137 --> 00:12:41.437
I wonder if it'll be okay to keep shooting?

192
00:12:41.437 --> 00:12:45.037
After he said that, there are still a lot of people who don't like Ryo.

193
00:12:45.037 --> 00:12:47.937
That's why Pops and everyone else are keeping close watch over her

194
00:12:47.937 --> 00:12:49.537
just in case, right?

195
00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:53.337
Cut!

196
00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.737
Okay!

197
00:12:54.737 --> 00:12:58.237
Next, please get the boats ready!

198
00:12:58.237 --> 00:13:00.437
The forecast says there will be fog today.

199
00:13:00.437 --> 00:13:02.137
The oars will be harder to handle,

200
00:13:02.137 --> 00:13:03.537
so please be careful.

201
00:13:03.537 --> 00:13:06.137
Just what do you mean by that?

202
00:13:06.137 --> 00:13:10.437
As you can see, the mountains around here have a unique shape

203
00:13:10.437 --> 00:13:12.137
and it seems that the wind

204
00:13:12.137 --> 00:13:15.637
that blows downward subtly affects the waves.

205
00:13:15.637 --> 00:13:18.137
How frightening.

206
00:13:18.137 --> 00:13:20.937
Mr. Dobashi, you have a phone call.

207
00:13:20.937 --> 00:13:23.037
It must be the results of the investigation.

208
00:13:23.637 --> 00:13:24.837
Investigation?

209
00:13:36.237 --> 00:13:40.637
Mr. Kushizaki, please send in the two extras.

210
00:13:40.637 --> 00:13:41.837
Okay.

211
00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:44.637
Conan, Ran, you're on.

212
00:13:44.637 --> 00:13:45.637
Yes, sir.

213
00:13:45.637 --> 00:13:46.637
Let's go.

214
00:13:47.737 --> 00:13:49.537
What's that?

215
00:13:58.937 --> 00:14:00.137
What's happening?

216
00:14:03.337 --> 00:14:04.937
What a dense fog.

217
00:14:04.937 --> 00:14:07.137
Is everyone okay?

218
00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:09.937
This is Arimura! The oars aren't working.

219
00:14:09.937 --> 00:14:12.337
And we lost sight of Ryo and Reina.

220
00:14:12.337 --> 00:14:14.237
What?

221
00:14:15.537 --> 00:14:18.237
Mr. Mouri! Confirm whether the Marutai is safe!

222
00:14:18.237 --> 00:14:20.737
But my oars aren't working either...

223
00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:22.337
I can't see her.

224
00:14:22.337 --> 00:14:24.137
Dad! Are you okay?

225
00:14:24.137 --> 00:14:27.137
Leave it to me! I give you my word, I'll keep her safe.

226
00:14:27.137 --> 00:14:30.637
Hold it, I just received some unbelievable inspection results.

227
00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:32.237
On this case we're handling,

228
00:14:32.237 --> 00:14:35.737
she could've made all this up.

229
00:14:35.737 --> 00:14:38.437
It seems that an informal decision of laying her off

230
00:14:38.437 --> 00:14:40.537
from the agency has been in process.

231
00:14:40.537 --> 00:14:42.937
And it seems she caught on to this...

232
00:14:42.937 --> 00:14:46.437
So, she conjured up a topic that would interest the mass media.

233
00:14:46.437 --> 00:14:48.137
No way.

234
00:14:48.137 --> 00:14:51.037
But the worst of it all, is that it seems she thinks

235
00:14:51.037 --> 00:14:54.737
that Reina has caught on to this too.

236
00:14:54.737 --> 00:14:56.537
Don't tell me that because of this?

237
00:14:56.537 --> 00:14:59.237
Ryo's going to kill Reina?

238
00:14:59.237 --> 00:15:00.637
Wait, Conan!

239
00:15:00.637 --> 00:15:02.037
I'll row the boat!

240
00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.937
No good. I can't work the oars...

241
00:15:07.937 --> 00:15:10.137
Do you see anything, Conan?

242
00:15:10.137 --> 00:15:12.037
Nope. Nothing at all...

243
00:15:14.537 --> 00:15:16.237
What's this sound?

244
00:15:16.237 --> 00:15:17.437
What was that?

245
00:15:22.337 --> 00:15:23.437
This sound?

246
00:15:25.337 --> 00:15:28.037
No good, we're being swept away.

247
00:15:28.037 --> 00:15:30.137
I see! I got it.

248
00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:32.237
Conan? What's that?

249
00:15:43.137 --> 00:15:46.037
Darn, I'm being swept away by the wind.

250
00:15:47.437 --> 00:15:48.537
That's...

251
00:15:54.837 --> 00:15:56.037
That's...

252
00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:02.637
This is Ryo's...

253
00:16:02.637 --> 00:16:04.037
The other is the film crews'...

254
00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:11.837
Ryo, where are you?

255
00:16:17.437 --> 00:16:18.737
Reina?

256
00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.537
She's just passed out.

257
00:16:22.537 --> 00:16:24.637
Don't tell me that Ryo...

258
00:16:31.037 --> 00:16:33.737
Everybody got washed up here like us.

259
00:16:33.737 --> 00:16:36.437
Wait over here, Ran, since it's dangerous.

260
00:16:36.437 --> 00:16:37.937
No, Conan!

261
00:16:37.937 --> 00:16:39.337
I'm coming with you.

262
00:16:47.637 --> 00:16:48.637
Ryo?

263
00:16:48.637 --> 00:16:50.837
Stay away, Mr. Mouri!

264
00:16:50.837 --> 00:16:52.437
Don't tell me... Just as I thought...

265
00:16:52.437 --> 00:16:53.537
Don't move!

266
00:16:53.537 --> 00:16:54.737
What?

267
00:17:22.537 --> 00:17:23.537
Dad?

268
00:17:23.537 --> 00:17:25.137
Are you all right, Pops?

269
00:17:25.137 --> 00:17:26.737
Hide, both of you!

270
00:17:26.737 --> 00:17:28.137
Mr. Mouri...

271
00:17:28.137 --> 00:17:29.937
Who the heck was that?

272
00:17:29.937 --> 00:17:31.837
Where's Reina? Where is she?

273
00:17:31.837 --> 00:17:35.437
What? Could that have been her?

274
00:17:35.437 --> 00:17:38.537
She pretended to be passed out and after I left.

275
00:17:38.537 --> 00:17:40.237
That's not it.

276
00:17:40.237 --> 00:17:42.037
No, not possible.

277
00:17:42.037 --> 00:17:45.037
That cat-hater could never make it this far.

278
00:17:45.037 --> 00:17:46.137
More importantly,

279
00:17:46.137 --> 00:17:50.037
how'd you know all the boats would be washed up here?

280
00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:55.237
Oh, so that's the story.

281
00:17:55.237 --> 00:17:58.137
Ryo, will you trust me?

282
00:17:58.137 --> 00:18:01.537
Of course, you're my bodyguard.

283
00:18:01.537 --> 00:18:04.037
Okay, then.

284
00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:09.737
Ryo, hide behind that big tree.

285
00:18:09.737 --> 00:18:12.637
No, Pops! You didn't sterilize yet.

286
00:18:20.937 --> 00:18:22.037
What the...

287
00:18:28.937 --> 00:18:30.037
Mr. Dobashi?

288
00:18:31.837 --> 00:18:33.637
Dad, are you all right?

289
00:18:33.637 --> 00:18:35.537
You did it, Pops!

290
00:18:35.537 --> 00:18:39.037
Mr. Dobashi, you checked beforehand, didn't you?

291
00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:41.237
The direction the wind would blow if there is to be a fog,

292
00:18:41.237 --> 00:18:42.937
the movement of the waves,

293
00:18:42.937 --> 00:18:45.837
or where we would all land if we were swept away by the wind...

294
00:18:45.837 --> 00:18:47.937
In other words, you sterilized the place.

295
00:18:49.137 --> 00:18:51.837
You beat everyone here on a motorboat

296
00:18:51.837 --> 00:18:54.037
that you probably got ready beforehand

297
00:18:54.037 --> 00:18:58.337
that wouldn't be affected by the wind or the waves.

298
00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:01.437
So, the sound we heard was that of a motorboat.

299
00:19:01.437 --> 00:19:04.337
You did all this to kill Ryo.

300
00:19:04.337 --> 00:19:05.737
You wanted to make it look like Ryo killed Reina,

301
00:19:05.737 --> 00:19:08.537
then killed me as well because I tried to stop her,

302
00:19:08.537 --> 00:19:11.137
and then finally she kills herself.

303
00:19:12.637 --> 00:19:15.437
And, you were saying something about an investigation, weren't you?

304
00:19:15.437 --> 00:19:17.437
That was indeed something you made up.

305
00:19:17.437 --> 00:19:19.637
You asked someone at your company

306
00:19:19.637 --> 00:19:22.337
to call you at a pre-set time.

307
00:19:22.337 --> 00:19:24.437
The contents didn't matter.

308
00:19:24.437 --> 00:19:27.837
I can easily check on it and confirm!

309
00:19:27.837 --> 00:19:30.237
Oh, there you are, everyone.

310
00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:34.237
It's good that we landed but, we got lost in the fog...

311
00:19:34.637 --> 00:19:37.337
I heard something that sounded like a gun shot?

312
00:19:37.337 --> 00:19:39.537
Did something happen?

313
00:19:39.537 --> 00:19:41.437
What now, Mr. Dobashi?

314
00:19:41.437 --> 00:19:45.237
It's hard to silence as many people as this, you know?

315
00:19:47.237 --> 00:19:49.737
It was last month.

316
00:19:49.737 --> 00:19:52.137
That my daughter tried out for an audition for a drama

317
00:19:52.137 --> 00:19:53.937
and was dropped.

318
00:19:53.937 --> 00:19:55.737
She was so depressed,

319
00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:58.537
she attempted suicide the following day.

320
00:19:58.537 --> 00:20:02.337
The judge at that time was her.

321
00:20:02.337 --> 00:20:07.137
I wanted to take revenge for my daughter, as her father.

322
00:20:07.137 --> 00:20:10.337
Wait, that wasn't me.

323
00:20:11.637 --> 00:20:13.737
I wasn't feeling well that day,

324
00:20:13.737 --> 00:20:15.337
so I had someone else take my place.

325
00:20:15.337 --> 00:20:16.337
As judge.

326
00:20:16.337 --> 00:20:17.637
Who was it?

327
00:20:17.637 --> 00:20:19.937
Me.

328
00:20:19.937 --> 00:20:21.437
Enough, already.

329
00:20:21.437 --> 00:20:23.837
I was dodging the kitties and fell.

330
00:20:23.837 --> 00:20:26.137
I fainted!

331
00:20:26.137 --> 00:20:30.337
I mean, I can't stand the itchiness.

332
00:20:30.337 --> 00:20:32.137
You're the one who dropped my daughter.

333
00:20:32.137 --> 00:20:35.237
So... If you're going to kill anyone, it should be me.

334
00:20:35.237 --> 00:20:39.137
You shouldn't make a mistake, you know?

335
00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:43.437
Your daughter misses you and wants to see you.

336
00:20:43.437 --> 00:20:45.537
Reina's been visiting the hospital to see her

337
00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:48.237
at least once every two days.

338
00:20:48.237 --> 00:20:50.237
You knew?

339
00:20:52.337 --> 00:20:55.937
It's just like you, so different from me.

340
00:20:55.937 --> 00:20:59.537
But, you didn't even know about it, Mr. Dobashi.

341
00:21:04.237 --> 00:21:07.337
You get along fine with your daughter?

342
00:21:07.337 --> 00:21:10.637
And this is what you do? Killing people?

343
00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:12.337
You didn't do it for you daughter.

344
00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:15.037
You did it only to attain self-satisfaction.

345
00:21:15.037 --> 00:21:17.037
Didn't you do this just so that you could prove to yourself

346
00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:20.737
that you were being her father?

347
00:21:26.137 --> 00:21:27.437
You may be a bodyguard,

348
00:21:27.437 --> 00:21:30.137
but you're a failure as a father.

349
00:21:30.137 --> 00:21:33.637
Well, I can't talk either, but...

350
00:21:33.637 --> 00:21:34.937
Dad.

351
00:21:37.237 --> 00:21:40.437
Right, the same goes for you, Mr. Mouri.

352
00:21:40.437 --> 00:21:41.937
You're a failure as a bodyguard.

353
00:21:41.937 --> 00:21:43.937
You used me as decoy.

354
00:21:43.937 --> 00:21:46.737
Well... That was...

355
00:21:46.737 --> 00:21:48.437
You're fired as of today.

356
00:21:48.437 --> 00:21:51.737
Go back to where you belong!

357
00:21:51.737 --> 00:21:53.137
Yes.

358
00:21:56.537 --> 00:21:59.237
Thank you, Mr. Detective.

359
00:23:22.137 --> 00:23:24.237
"Mouri Detective Agency"

360
00:23:24.237 --> 00:23:25.337
"Ryo Haneki Retires!"

361
00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:29.337
Ryo's going to go independent and become president of a company.

362
00:23:29.337 --> 00:23:31.037
It seems Reina, who moved agencies,
