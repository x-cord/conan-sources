1
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:02,915
The haunted storeroom.

2
00:00:02,915 --> 00:00:06,415
We, the detective squad set off to check on a rumour

3
00:00:06,415 --> 00:00:10,615
saying that everything that is placed storeroom disappears in an instant.

4
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:14,315
Why are Genta and the others so excited about this case?

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,415
After checking the inside of the storeroom,

6
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:20,015
we find traces of footprints left here and there on the floor.

7
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:23,415
We also find a large abacus embedded in the wall beyond,

8
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:26,515
but there is nothing else there. The storeroom is completely empty.

9
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:32,015
But, when you look in through the window,

10
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:35,415
there is a heap of treasure that covers the entire floor.

11
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:39,615
It can't be! It was empty just a while ago!

12
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:42,515
However, when the door is opened again,

13
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:45,115
the treasure that was there is gone,

14
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:47,715
and the storeroom is empty as before.

15
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,215
I figured that either the ceiling or floor moved,

16
00:00:50,215 --> 00:00:52,915
thereby making the treasure appear and disappear.

17
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:54,715
But that possibility was denied after looking at the pictures

18
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:56,615
taken by Mitsuhiko and the others

19
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:59,515
and the mark that was put on the floor.

20
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:02,415
Regardless, I'm sure there's something.

21
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:04,615
Something like magic,

22
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:07,315
in which the treasure can be put in and out.

23
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:12,015
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

24
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:14,215
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

25
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:16,015
The Detective Squad is really on their toes.

26
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:18,215
They solve the mystery of the rigged mansion.

27
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:20,015
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,015
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,115
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

30
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:14,562
"Treasure Battle in the Haunted Storeroom (Part 2)"

31
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,862
First, the thing that stands out is,

32
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:20,562
that queer Shinto altar that is set up

33
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,762
right above the entrance of the door.

34
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:25,362
Setting something right above a inward opening door

35
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,762
is dangerous, isn't it?

36
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,362
If someone happens to come in

37
00:03:28,362 --> 00:03:30,362
when you're making an offering to the altar.

38
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:32,262
That's true.

39
00:03:32,262 --> 00:03:34,862
And the thing that bothers me

40
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:36,962
even more than that altar is...

41
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:40,262
that abacus that's embedded in the wall

42
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,662
right opposite the Shinto altar.

43
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:44,962
I wonder what it is?

44
00:03:44,962 --> 00:03:48,162
Maybe it's there to count the number of treasure that is brought here.

45
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,962
If so, it should be lying sideways.

46
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:53,162
If placing it vertically, no matter how much you calculate

47
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:54,862
and move the balls on the abacus,

48
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,462
they'll just all come falling down.

49
00:03:56,462 --> 00:04:00,062
No, there's a stick sticking out from behind the balls

50
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,662
and it's set into the space behind.

51
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:05,162
Genta, lend me your back!

52
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,562
Okay!

53
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:11,762
It's most likely that if you move one of the balls...

54
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:18,362
Did you hear that sound?

55
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:21,762
Conan, try moving more!

56
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,962
Yeah.

57
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:27,862
I'll move the ball that is right below the one I just moved, up.

58
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,362
It fell down.

59
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:35,362
It seems that the abacus is working as a switch for something,

60
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:38,462
and if the wrong ball is moved, it resets.

61
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:44,462
Judging from the amount of dust that is accumulated on the ball,

62
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:46,862
only the balls of the upper second level to the extreme right edge

63
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:49,762
seem to have been moved,

64
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,262
As for the five rows below,

65
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:52,662
only the balls of the 3rd row from the right

66
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,662
and the balls in the 6th row

67
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,562
and the 4th row with no balls

68
00:04:57,562 --> 00:05:00,662
and the 8th row where the balls are all clumped together

69
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:02,562
show traces of having been moved.

70
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:06,562
The 3rd row from the right...

71
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,862
And what row was it?

72
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:10,662
4th, 6th and 8th rows!

73
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:13,562
Huh? Are you keying in mail?

74
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:17,262
I'm taking notes, so I don't forget.

75
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,762
Okay, I'll go look through that window once more,

76
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,262
so wait for me inside!

77
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,662
Okay.

78
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:28,462
Hey, you haven't finished checking the storeroom yet?

79
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,362
No.

80
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:34,362
There's a strange slit in the door.

81
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:36,762
Besides, theses stairs...

82
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:39,662
Hey, hurry up and go look!

83
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,962
"Investigations should be done speedily" is basic!

84
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:44,462
Okay.

85
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,662
Darn! Is it Ms. Kobayashi...

86
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:52,862
the one who is giving them ideas?

87
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:56,262
Huh? You said I call the children?

88
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,062
I don't have such time.

89
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:00,262
I'm in the middle of a teacher's meeting, you know.

90
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,862
Rather, you're at the storeroom in question, aren't you?

91
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,462
Tell me where it is? I'll go on over later!

92
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,262
So, she isn't the one.

93
00:06:08,262 --> 00:06:10,862
Which means...

94
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:13,962
Yeah, I did get a phone call from Ai.

95
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,562
Hey, quit playing dumb with me!

96
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:17,762
You called Mitsuhiko and the others, didn't you?

97
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:21,762
No, I didn't! Since Ai said she's going to be late today,

98
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:25,562
I'm making beef stew that takes time to make, you see!

99
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:29,562
Beef stew? I didn't know you could cook something like that, Doc.

100
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:31,962
The onions are starting to look good, Doc!

101
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:33,662
Oh, I see!

102
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:36,662
Hey, is Subaru there, too?

103
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,762
Yeah, I had him come over to make it while Ai's away!

104
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:44,662
He's a pretty good cook, you see!

105
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:48,762
Subaru's not text mailing while pan frying the onions, is he?

106
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:50,262
Of course not!

107
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:53,162
We can't take our eyes off the pan, because it'll get burnt if we do.

108
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:57,862
Then, who in the world is it that's giving them clues?

109
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:00,562
Oh, my God.

110
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:03,462
Is Conan Edogawa on the phone?

111
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:06,462
Yeah, it seems that he's gone with the children

112
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,562
to check up on a haunted storeroom.

113
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,162
A haunted storeroom?

114
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:14,062
According to the call I received from Ai a while ago,

115
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:17,462
it's a strange storeroom in which the things that are put inside it

116
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:20,462
disappear in no time at all.

117
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:23,462
That sure sounds interesting.

118
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,662
Conan!

119
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:34,062
How are things inside the storeroom as compared to a while ago?

120
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,462
Not any different.

121
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:40,362
The only difference is whether the treasure is there or not.

122
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,862
It seems that the floor is a bit farther than before.

123
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,862
Far?

124
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:52,162
It can't be, because the storeroom couldn't possibly be growing.

125
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:56,462
Maybe it ate up the treasure that Conan saw a while ago,

126
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:58,762
so the storeroom got big.

127
00:07:58,762 --> 00:07:59,762
That can't be.

128
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,662
But...

129
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:04,262
Something fell!

130
00:08:04,262 --> 00:08:07,362
It seems to have been by the wall.

131
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:11,762
The detective squad badge!

132
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:15,162
It's Mitsuhiko's badge!

133
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,562
Where in the world did it come from?

134
00:08:18,562 --> 00:08:22,762
It's here after all. Something's here after all!

135
00:08:22,762 --> 00:08:25,162
There's a monster in the ceiling!

136
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:30,062
It picked up Mitsuhiko's badge, and threw it just now!

137
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:31,662
No way!

138
00:08:31,662 --> 00:08:35,462
A monster in the ceiling? That can't be.

139
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,262
Could... could it be...

140
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:48,462
Uh, let's get out of this storeroom already.

141
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:51,162
Yeah, it's creepy.

142
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:53,062
But...

143
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:56,762
Telephone.

144
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:58,162
Maybe...

145
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,262
"I figured it out!"

146
00:09:01,362 --> 00:09:04,262
Hey, it's about time you come out of the storeroom

147
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:05,662
or the sun will set soon!

148
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:07,762
Mister.

149
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:10,162
You said that this storeroom was built

150
00:09:10,162 --> 00:09:12,262
around the end of the Tokugawa shogunate regimne, right?

151
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,962
Yeah.

152
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:16,262
Could the person who built it

153
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:18,662
have been Kichiemon Samizu, a puppeteer?

154
00:09:18,662 --> 00:09:20,362
That's right.

155
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:23,162
Then, I think you should make a call.

156
00:09:26,162 --> 00:09:30,062
Call the police officer from Investigations 3rd division.

157
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:38,362
Oh, it's you people who called us, the police.

158
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:40,762
We haven't seen you since the Girl's Day Festival doll case,

159
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,062
have we, Inspector Momose?

160
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:44,262
And, is it true that

161
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:47,762
you maybe have found the culprit who's on the run?

162
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:49,162
Yep, the fact is...

163
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,062
A thief!

164
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,462
The culprit who's been going around

165
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:56,762
breaking in to the jewelry and antique shops in this vicinity!

166
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,062
That guy is here. Inside this storeroom!

167
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:03,762
He's accumulated a lot of treasure here!

168
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,962
Inside this storeroom...

169
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:10,062
But, there's not one person here,

170
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:12,662
much less no sign of treasure at all.

171
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,362
This storeroom is rigged,

172
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:16,362
rigged to hide the treasure!

173
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:17,462
Rigged?

174
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:19,262
First, take note of this stairs

175
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,962
by the entrance!

176
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,862
It has four steps, correct?

177
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:24,862
Yeah...

178
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:30,162
But the stairs inside has five steps.

179
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,762
True...

180
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:35,462
Besides, don't you think that

181
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:37,362
every step on this side

182
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:40,462
is much higher than those at the entrance?

183
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:43,162
Now that you mentioned it.

184
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:47,462
I see. That's why when you first came inside this storeroom...

185
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:51,462
Be careful! Watch your step because it's dark.

186
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,862
You tripped.

187
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,662
Yeah, because I thought there were four steps

188
00:10:57,662 --> 00:10:59,462
like the one at the entrance.

189
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:02,462
But, so what?

190
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,262
Can't you tell?

191
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,162
Compared to the stairs outside,

192
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:07,862
there are more number of steps

193
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:10,562
and moreover, if the steps are higher,

194
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:13,962
it means, the inside is much deeper than is the ground.

195
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:15,162
It's only deeper.

196
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:17,362
There's no place a person can hide

197
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:19,762
or any place treasure can be hidden, is there?

198
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:24,062
Don't tell me that the floor opens up or something.

199
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:25,762
What's this?

200
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:30,662
It's the badge that we marked when we first came in here.

201
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:33,662
Back then, the storeroom was empty

202
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:38,062
but we left once and Conan looked inside again

203
00:11:38,062 --> 00:11:41,362
there was a lot of treasure inside!

204
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:46,362
But, that window is about 2 meters from the ceiling.

205
00:11:46,362 --> 00:11:48,562
The window that I looked at from outside a while ago,

206
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:50,862
is about 2 meters from the roof.

207
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:53,462
There seems to be nothing by the ceiling either.

208
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,462
Your badges don't seem to have moved either,

209
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:59,262
which means, there are no tricks on the floor.

210
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:02,562
To make it look that way, is where the trick of this storeroom is!

211
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:03,762
Trick?

212
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:05,762
Genta, are you ready?

213
00:12:05,762 --> 00:12:08,262
Okay, I'll open it now!

214
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,362
What?

215
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:26,626
There's... there's a window on top of a window?

216
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:30,626
Hey! Are you really opening the window that's on the outside?

217
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,326
Yeah! I climbed the tree and opened it!

218
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:35,226
But, isn't it strange?

219
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:36,426
Just a while ago

220
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:39,026
the light seeped in from the space between the window below.

221
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:42,626
Huh? No light is seeping in now.

222
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,026
That's probably because

223
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:47,126
the a portion of the wooden board under the window is cut

224
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:49,926
in order to let light into the storeroom.

225
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:53,326
Then, a window matching the cut wood is also attached on the inside

226
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:56,426
made to look like a real window.

227
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:58,826
No light is seeping in right now because

228
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,226
when the window was opened,

229
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,226
something inside the wall like the wooden board slid

230
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:07,026
and it's rigged so that the space in the wall is blocked!

231
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:11,726
But if just like now, light is shone on it and the window is opened,

232
00:13:11,726 --> 00:13:13,526
anybody could see through the trick.

233
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,826
It's true that if this storeroom was built in modern times,

234
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,026
it's an old-fashioned trick.

235
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:22,526
But it was built at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate regime

236
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:24,926
when there was no flashlight

237
00:13:24,926 --> 00:13:27,826
that could conveniently shine light at a distance,

238
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:30,526
don't you think this is a quite high leveled trick?

239
00:13:30,526 --> 00:13:34,126
Above the entrance where the ceiling is,

240
00:13:34,126 --> 00:13:36,026
it is hidden out of view.

241
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:37,426
Hidden out of view?

242
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:39,126
That Shinto altar!

243
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:40,926
It's attached right above the entrance

244
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:43,826
so that you can't look up at the ceiling.

245
00:13:43,826 --> 00:13:46,226
If before entering, the person realizes

246
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,126
that compared to the height of the roof,

247
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:52,126
the ceiling after entering is obviously lower,

248
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:54,826
the trick would lose it's meaning.

249
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:58,326
Which means that the floor is constructed deeper than the ground,

250
00:13:58,326 --> 00:14:01,226
to give off the illusion that the ceiling is not low.

251
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:03,426
Right! In other words,

252
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,926
this storeroom looks completely empty

253
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:09,026
but in fact, a mysterious space

254
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,826
exists in the ceiling!

255
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:15,026
True, it would turn out that way but...

256
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:17,726
How do you get up to the attic?

257
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,426
You don't climb up!

258
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,326
We mentioned that when we first came here,

259
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,226
we placed marked badges on the floor, didn't we?

260
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:28,126
When we came in here,

261
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:31,826
Ayumi and Genta's badges were not moved

262
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:35,726
but my badge alone that I left standing against the wall was gone.

263
00:14:35,726 --> 00:14:37,026
Gone?

264
00:14:37,026 --> 00:14:40,626
Yep! A little while later it came falling from above!

265
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:43,126
It's most likely that right above the badge that I left standing

266
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:45,826
poked into the wooden board of the ceiling,

267
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:48,026
hung suspended in the air for a while,

268
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:50,426
then naturally fell off.

269
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:54,826
If the badge poked into the wooden board of the ceiling...

270
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:55,926
Don't tell me that...

271
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:59,826
Yes, when Conan looked through the window,

272
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:03,526
and we consider the fact that then...

273
00:15:04,626 --> 00:15:06,726
the floor was filled with treasure.

274
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,026
There's no doubt that the ceiling moves up and down!

275
00:15:09,026 --> 00:15:10,226
I see.

276
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,626
If the storeroom was rigged to move during an age

277
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:15,926
when remote controllers didn't exist to move things from a distance,

278
00:15:15,926 --> 00:15:18,026
someone had to be here!

279
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:20,626
However, if there is no sight of such a person around,

280
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:22,726
nor any trace of anyone having left the storeroom,

281
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,826
then the only conclusion is

282
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:26,626
that the person must still be in the attic.

283
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,326
Yeah! And that guy's somebody who has to hide

284
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,326
in the attic of a place like this.

285
00:15:31,326 --> 00:15:33,326
And he's surrounded by treasure...

286
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:35,426
It's very likely that he's the thief

287
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:39,026
who's been breaking into places recently!

288
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:42,726
What do you think? Are we correct, Conan?

289
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:47,426
Yeah, exactly! You guys are super.

290
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,426
We did it...

291
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:53,426
Then, have you figured out how to move the ceiling, too?

292
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:56,326
That's probably done moving the balls on that abacus.

293
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,226
Move the balls, how?

294
00:15:58,226 --> 00:16:02,326
Well, that's...

295
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:06,926
I've got to look at it with my own eyes to figure it out.

296
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:08,626
What?

297
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:15,826
I see... You have to look at it with your own eyes to figure it out.

298
00:16:15,826 --> 00:16:17,926
Oh, well...

299
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:21,226
Inspector, the police officer you brought along is here, isn't he?

300
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:23,326
Yes.

301
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:26,926
Then, can you make him outside the storeroom.

302
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:29,226
Genta, keep your head inside the window!

303
00:16:29,226 --> 00:16:30,926
Okay.

304
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:34,026
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko and Ai go out the storeroom

305
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,326
and hide behind the police officer that will be coming!

306
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,526
Okay.

307
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:42,726
I called two officers.

308
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:45,926
Then, all that needs to be done now is to lower the ceiling

309
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:48,426
by moving the balls of this abacus.

310
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:51,126
But, which balls and how do you move them.

311
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:52,826
The place that draws attention most

312
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:55,726
is the row right in the middle where the balls are clumped together.

313
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:58,526
Although they look as if they can't moved, they aren't movable,

314
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:00,026
we need to divide it right in the middle

315
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:03,726
and indicate something to the right and left, right?

316
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,326
Something like what?

317
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:08,426
Something like hiragana, katakana.

318
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:11,226
Or kanji characters.

319
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:13,026
Kanji characters?

320
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:14,426
You can figure out the character

321
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:16,426
to the left side of the abacus, can't you?

322
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:20,026
Raise the ball that is at the very bottom from the first seven row

323
00:17:20,026 --> 00:17:22,926
from left just one space up.

324
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,926
That's right.

325
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:34,226
Then move the ball in the 3rd, 4th and 5th rows

326
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:38,226
that is 3rd from the bottom up.

327
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:46,426
The place with no balls look to be the kanji character "3".

328
00:17:46,426 --> 00:17:48,226
Then, the right side.

329
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:51,426
Since there is a row with no balls whatsoever,

330
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:54,526
it stands for a kanji character with a vertical line in the middle.

331
00:17:54,526 --> 00:17:56,226
Taking that into consideration

332
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:59,726
and move each ball one up.

333
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:03,626
The 2nd ball from the row to the extreme right

334
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:07,326
and 3rd ball from the bottom of the 2nd row,

335
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:11,326
Move the ball at the very bottom in the 5th row from the right.

336
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:15,026
Then move the ball 2nd from the bottom in the 7th row from the right.

337
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:20,826
This is the character to the right is...

338
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:23,026
water (Mizu)?

339
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:26,626
Three (san) and water (mizu).

340
00:18:26,626 --> 00:18:29,026
It's Kichiemon Samizu!

341
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:34,926
Kichiemon Samizu?

342
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:38,626
The puppeteer who was famous in the last days of the Tokugawa regime.

343
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:41,826
But, nothing moved!

344
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:45,126
Because the character hasn't been completed yet.

345
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:48,726
Try raising the ball in the top row at the right edge up!

346
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:50,826
Because the only ball that show traces of having been moved

347
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:52,926
in the top row is that.

348
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:57,426
Now the character has been completed,

349
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:08,026
The... the ceiling

350
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:10,026
is gradually closing in.

351
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:18,826
What's going on?

352
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,826
Conan.

353
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:24,726
Don't worry! It's built so that a space is made

354
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,726
in keeping with the angle of the roof.

355
00:19:30,226 --> 00:19:33,926
Then, would you like to see the heap of treasure?

356
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:42,526
These are...

357
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:46,726
They're all items that were reported stolen!

358
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:49,126
Just as would be expected of the great Kichiemon Samizu,

359
00:19:49,126 --> 00:19:52,926
a great trick indeed.

360
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,626
They are items I've never seen before too.

361
00:19:55,626 --> 00:19:58,426
Maybe they're things that were in this storeroom to begin with?

362
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,126
I think they are valuables

363
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,726
that the owner who had asked Samizu

364
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:05,926
to make this storeroom hid here.

365
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:08,926
And the one who took advantage of this rigged storeroom

366
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:13,126
and hid the things that he stole inside and accumulated them is...

367
00:20:14,826 --> 00:20:17,526
this thief over here.

368
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,026
I see.

369
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:21,126
After the children left this storeroom,

370
00:20:21,126 --> 00:20:23,826
he tried to lower the ceiling and get out of here

371
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:26,226
but since you looked inside from the window,

372
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,726
he hastily moved the ceiling again

373
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,926
and returned it to the original position.

374
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:37,426
Seriously, this sure is some illusionary trick device.

375
00:20:37,426 --> 00:20:41,726
Hey, sonny, be careful. He may have accomplices here with him.

376
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:46,626
There aren't any. Because there was only one type of footprints.

377
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:50,126
But, how do you plan to get out of here?

378
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:54,526
Because the ceiling was lowered, the door is half blocked.

379
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:57,826
See, between the floor that came down

380
00:20:57,826 --> 00:21:01,226
and the door there is a stream of light, isn't there?

381
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:05,226
If you touch a place on the door...

382
00:21:08,826 --> 00:21:10,126
Conan!

383
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:13,826
You're the gardener that was hired to work here before!

384
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:17,426
So, that's when you found out about the secret of this storeroom!

385
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:20,826
I'm sorry!

386
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:46,626
And? How was it?

387
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,326
Our deduction!

388
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,526
Did we knock you out?

389
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:53,826
Great job.

390
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:56,526
Considering it was Heiji.

391
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:00,026
Sorry, sorry.

392
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:04,626
I went to the detective agency to do some business.

393
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:05,926
And heard these kids saying

394
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,926
that they wanted to surprise the hell out of you.

395
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,426
So, I dropped them a few hints.

396
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:17,026
No, Conan, you shouldn't call your teacher by his first name.

397
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:18,926
Huh? Teacher?

398
00:23:18,926 --> 00:23:23,526
Right, Mr. Hattori is your teacher, isn't he, Conan?

399
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:25,226
Just what do you mean?

400
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:27,126
I showed them this picture.

401
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:31,926
So, I'm your teacher at being a detective.

402
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:37,226
Hey, isn't this the picture you took for fun some time ago.

403
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:40,426
Hey, Kudo! Something's on the ground.

404
00:23:41,926 --> 00:23:44,726
Hattori, how dare you.

405
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:48,826
But, we didn't get to see Conan surprised out of his wits.

406
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,226
You can say that again.

407
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:51,926
It's too bad.

408
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:54,426
You shouldn't rely on someone else.

409
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:56,426
Right...

410
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:59,626
If you want to realize your dreams,

411
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:03,126
you've got to exert effort on your own!

412
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:06,226
That's not for you to say, Hattori.

413
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:09,726
"Next Episode" -Homicide?

414
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:11,826
This Jr. student of Teitan University

415
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,526
called Teruaki Kunimatsu!

416
00:24:14,526 --> 00:24:19,126
That lucky charm is the one that Kazuha valued?

417
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:20,926
What seems to be the matter?

418
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,826
A man with his hand in a cast was found punched up in the restroom.

419
00:24:23,826 --> 00:24:27,426
Which means that the culprit is still inside.

420
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:31,226
Maybe we'll nail the culprit in a cinch.

421
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:33,126
Next Conan,

422
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:36,350
"Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 1)"

423
00:24:51,954 --> 00:24:54,254
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:56,154
"Cracker"

425
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:57,154
The next episode centers around

426
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:58,154
a racket involving a lucky charm.

427
00:24:58,154 --> 00:25:01,459
The two great friends from Osaka are also making an appearance.
