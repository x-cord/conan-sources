1
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:07,346
Are you sure?

2
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:11,646
Yes. There was a camera in the lowest basement floor.

3
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:15,446
Ordinary people don't use cameras with lenses like that.

4
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:18,346
Which means, it was Kaneko after all?

5
00:00:18,346 --> 00:00:20,646
We're checking on it now.

6
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:24,646
I'm sorry if we find him there.

7
00:00:24,646 --> 00:00:27,446
We checked all the keys of the basement.

8
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,346
It's not your fault.

9
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:33,046
You're victims too.

10
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:35,446
Of the ruthless perp.

11
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,246
Sonoko and the others just left.

12
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:41,246
Didn't you give them a lift back?

13
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:44,446
They wanted to ride home with the car that came to pick Sonoko up.

14
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:46,146
Right.

15
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,346
We found it!

16
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,246
The corpse of Eiji Kaneko.

17
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:50,546
And...

18
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,546
My god.

19
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:55,046
Can you fix it?

20
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:56,946
Even if it were to be fixed...

21
00:00:56,946 --> 00:01:00,146
It was found in Kaneko's camera bag?

22
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,846
Yes, near the corpse.

23
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:04,246
After stealing the mask,

24
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:07,946
he tried to get rid of the kid that got close to him

25
00:01:07,946 --> 00:01:10,446
and got messed up in this.

26
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,046
Things don't go that well.

27
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:18,046
I guess that's the way the perp wants us to see it.

28
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:25,646
Didn't you go home with them?

29
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:27,646
It's bedtime for children,

30
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:30,046
but adults have a lot of things to do yet.

31
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:35,746
-Here. -Thanks!

32
00:01:35,746 --> 00:01:36,946
If you had your glasses,

33
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:39,646
you would've found the exit sooner, right?

34
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:43,146
Yeah. I wasn't wearing my suspenders either,

35
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,246
so I really panicked.

36
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:48,246
To be lured out by someone who might've been the perp.

37
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,846
It's not like you.

38
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,146
That's because I was confident he wasn't the perp.

39
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,646
Huh? Ai, why are you here?

40
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:57,446
Weren't you with Sonoko and the others?

41
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:58,946
I was left behind.

42
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:00,046
No!

43
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,346
No, I lied.

44
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:02,546
Come on down.

45
00:02:02,546 --> 00:02:04,946
Officer Chiba says he'll give us a lift.

46
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,846
What about Pops and the others?

47
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:08,846
They're going back to the practice hall

48
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,946
with Inspector Megure and the others.

49
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,246
You're going to have to take a bath when we get home, Conan.

50
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:17,546
Okay.

51
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,646
It must've been tough being trapped in there for so many hours, didn't you?

52
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:21,146
Yes.

53
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:23,046
Why don't you have her wash you down while you're at it?

54
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,646
Shut up!

55
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:29,046
I wonder what Pops and the others were talking about.

56
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:31,546
I didn't have time to wiretap them.

57
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:33,546
-Here. -Huh?

58
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:38,746
And when did you last see Mr. Kaneko?

59
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:40,946
In the afternoon. In my hospital room.

60
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:44,646
After Ebizo and Conan came to visit me.

61
00:02:44,646 --> 00:02:47,546
What did Kaneko want to talk to you about?

62
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:50,946
Be honest about it!

63
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,846
Yes, sir.

64
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:55,946
You came to Kabukiza at midnight, didn't you?

65
00:02:57,246 --> 00:02:58,446
What...

66
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,546
You don't have to hide it.

67
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:03,246
So, did you steal the mask?

68
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:09,046
So you didn't steal the two-faced mask?

69
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,346
I... I swear I didn't steal it.

70
00:03:11,346 --> 00:03:14,746
If I did, I wouldn't... No way.

71
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,746
Did you really come here at midnight?

72
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:23,746
I couldn't stand staying in the hospital alone.

73
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,246
So I snuck out.

74
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:27,946
But I had no place to go.

75
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,546
And when I noticed I was...

76
00:03:30,546 --> 00:03:32,246
But I lost the memo

77
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:35,946
that had the PIN for the front door written on it.

78
00:03:35,946 --> 00:03:38,846
So I went back to the hospital.

79
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:41,346
You couldn't tell unless you had the memo?

80
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,446
Because I never came at a time like that.

81
00:03:45,446 --> 00:03:47,546
Excuse me.

82
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:51,346
I'm the one who gave Mr. Iwami the PIN.

83
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:55,846
In that case, I will be arrested as an accomplice too.

84
00:03:55,846 --> 00:03:57,946
So, like I said, I didn't take it.

85
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,946
-Mr. Minowa. -Yes, sir!

86
00:03:59,946 --> 00:04:02,846
-Please sit down. -Yes, sir.

87
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:07,046
Mr. Kaneko took a picture of you back then.

88
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:12,846
Aren't you amazed at how good I got a shot of you coming in?

89
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:13,946
You're the kind of guy who ends up being hospitalized

90
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:16,846
just because you can't write the script.

91
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:17,946
As long as the mask goes missing,

92
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:21,346
I'll bet you thought that the performance would be canceled, right?

93
00:04:22,746 --> 00:04:27,846
Iwami, you really didn't go to the room where the lockers are?

94
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,746
No, I didn't go.

95
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,246
The memo with the number on it

96
00:04:31,246 --> 00:04:32,846
was found on the floor of that room.

97
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:38,546
That memo... Mr. Mouri, you got it from that boy, didn't you?

98
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:41,446
No, I know of no such memo.

99
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,146
That's awful!

100
00:04:43,146 --> 00:04:44,846
Darn.

101
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:46,646
Excuse me.

102
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:51,546
I just found the call history left on Mr. Kaneko's cell phone.

103
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:52,946
Mr. Hosoo.

104
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:57,346
Didn't you receive a call at 15:05 today from Mr. Kaneko?

105
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:59,446
At around 15:00?

106
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:02,946
Weren't you having negotiations at Beika Hotel at that time?

107
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:04,546
Right.

108
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:05,546
I was having a business meeting,

109
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,746
so I had the phone on manner mode.

110
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:10,246
I had an incoming call from a number that I'm not familiar with.

111
00:05:10,246 --> 00:05:13,246
That's the incoming call from Mr. Kaneko.

112
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,746
Did you ever receive a call from him before?

113
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:17,246
Never.

114
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:20,846
"I got the mask. How much will you pay me?"

115
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:22,146
Isn't that what he said?

116
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:23,546
I see.

117
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:26,046
Then, it was Kaneko after all?

118
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:29,346
No, Mr. Kaneko was just a pawn.

119
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:32,146
Somebody else was manipulating him.

120
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:35,146
It started with the attempted murder against Mr. Hosoo.

121
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:37,546
Then the theft of the two-faced mask,

122
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,046
onto the murder of secretary Mr. Takahashi.

123
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:45,246
Then finally to the abduction of Conan and the death of Mr. Kaneko!

124
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:48,946
Everything has fallen into line.

125
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:51,146
There is no case that I cannot solve!

126
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,646
Please gather all those involved here.

127
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,946
I will tell you what the truth of the case is.

128
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:56,946
What?

129
00:05:56,946 --> 00:05:59,246
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?

130
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:00,746
Isn't it a bit too early for that?

131
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:03,746
Thanks to my great deduction will be able to save time and money,

132
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,246
isn't that correct, Inspector?

133
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,846
So, you're that confident.

134
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,246
Gather everyone at this time of day?

135
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,746
President, tomorrow afternoon will do,

136
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,046
so let's rehearse on the main stage.

137
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:17,946
At this stage in the performance?

138
00:06:17,946 --> 00:06:20,146
But the stage is not set yet.

139
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,146
No problem.

140
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:23,046
Please get everyone to come.

141
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,346
I understand.

142
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:26,846
I'll contact everyone right away.

143
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,346
What about the two-faced mask?

144
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:33,046
Even if it's cracked, I'll use it.

145
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:35,646
But it's really exciting that I get to see

146
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,046
the great deductive skills of the Sleeping Kogoro

147
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:39,546
right before my eyes.

148
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:43,246
Oh, boy. Talk about speed racing, Pops.

149
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:47,246
I've got to find back up evidence by tomorrow now.

150
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,746
But fine, I'll do it.

151
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:52,846
Where's my "thank you"?

152
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,046
When did you to it?

153
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:57,846
I used to be able to remember all the numbers before, but now...

154
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:00,346
I'll enter the number.

155
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,946
Then, push here last.

156
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:06,946
You put it on Ebizo?

157
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:08,246
Don't worry.

158
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:10,646
I'll take it off tomorrow.

159
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:13,146
I hope he wears the same jacket tomorrow.

160
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:19,746
I see. So that's why...

161
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:22,846
I got it.

162
00:07:22,846 --> 00:07:25,446
He's the perp!

163
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,355
Please check on this for me.

164
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,155
What's this chip?

165
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:41,655
It was in Mr. Kaneko's camera.

166
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,355
What?

167
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:48,855
Sorry, I'm late.

168
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:52,055
How long did you intend to leave a helpless little girl all by herself?

169
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,855
Sorry. A helpless little girl.

170
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:56,655
And, what was inside it?

171
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:59,355
It's almost done.

172
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,755
Okay, done.

173
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:03,155
You go ahead and take it out of the camera without even telling me,

174
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:05,255
and it's surprising how you can nag me that way.

175
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,655
Yeah, yeah. Sorry for the trouble.

176
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,555
Maybe I'll develop a new drug.

177
00:08:10,555 --> 00:08:11,755
It's so heavy.

178
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:13,155
How many did he take anyway?

179
00:08:13,155 --> 00:08:15,055
He is after all a cameraman.

180
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:17,655
So, what part concerns you?

181
00:08:17,655 --> 00:08:19,355
All of them concern me but...

182
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:22,455
First of all, Mr. Takahashi's...

183
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:23,855
-Who is it? -Who is it?

184
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:25,155
Does he look familiar?

185
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:26,955
Nope. Not at all.

186
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:28,055
Let me check on it.

187
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:29,255
Thanks.

188
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:30,555
There's no time.

189
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:32,255
Since I was trapped for half a day,

190
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,155
I really got a late start.

191
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:37,255
Can you zoom that?

192
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:38,555
What's this?

193
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:41,155
Not the center, but to the left below.

194
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:43,455
Left below?

195
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,855
It's the same.

196
00:08:46,855 --> 00:08:49,055
Is this the perp's stuff?

197
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:51,455
Yeah, it's his.

198
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,655
Then, he's there.

199
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,355
Hey, wait!

200
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:59,055
We're going back to the crime scene again?

201
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,155
Wasn't it a little farther down?

202
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:03,255
The place that I started the chase was.

203
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:12,955
Once daylight sets in, everything will come to light.

204
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,755
Let's go down to the railroad crossing.

205
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,455
If you didn't stop him,

206
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:23,155
he would've run right into the railroad crossing.

207
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:26,155
True, he wouldn't have been able to stop.

208
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:33,555
Haibara.

209
00:09:34,555 --> 00:09:35,655
I found it.

210
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:39,255
I see.

211
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:41,755
Let's ask Officer Takagi and the others for help

212
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,455
and solve the mystery of the seven masks.

213
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,255
Yes!

214
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:50,055
Conan, you're still awake?

215
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:51,455
Mr. Mouri?

216
00:09:51,455 --> 00:09:53,655
Yes...

217
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,855
You want me to check on it, right?

218
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:57,455
Easily done.

219
00:09:57,455 --> 00:09:59,155
Bye then.

220
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:08,355
What's up, Conan? Are you still awake?

221
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:11,155
Yes, Mr. Mouri?

222
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:12,255
The convenience store?

223
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:18,155
Yes. Pops Kogoro asked me to ask you to check on this.

224
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,155
And...

225
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:20,355
You shouldn't be walking around at night.

226
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:22,755
Will you come pick us up without telling anybody?

227
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,355
We're first year grade school students.

228
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:02,355
Times may change,

229
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:10,155
but humans shall never

230
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:16,455
let go of their emotions!

231
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:28,155
Fantastic!

232
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:33,055
You can show your performance starting tomorrow already!

233
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:39,255
You're talented enough to put on such a performance

234
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,955
and yet, too bad, Ebizo.

235
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:45,455
However, you brought it upon yourself.

236
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:47,955
I'll go get ready.

237
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:49,455
Thanks.

238
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:52,555
Why don't you just put him to sleep already?

239
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:56,055
Pops sometimes gets in right, you see.

240
00:11:56,055 --> 00:12:00,255
Mr. Mouri, I did my part.

241
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:04,255
I wonder if I served sufficient as your curtain-raiser.

242
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,255
Then!

243
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:11,455
Here goes the deduction of the great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

244
00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:15,855
-Is this okay? -I guess so.

245
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:18,555
She's enjoying herself.

246
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,355
In this case,

247
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,255
let's start with cameraman, Mr. Eiji Kaneko.

248
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:26,355
He was used as a pawn for the perp

249
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:29,155
and killed in that basement!

250
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:32,455
He was probably struck with the block that was on the ground.

251
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,655
Wow, Pops' got it right.

252
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:38,555
Kaneko who stole the two-faced mask from Mr. Takahashi...

253
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:39,955
Okay, time to switch!

254
00:12:39,955 --> 00:12:42,455
The perp who was dying to get a hold of

255
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:45,055
the two-faced mask more than anyone else!

256
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,055
Right!

257
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:49,055
You, Ichikawa...

258
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:50,055
Ebiya!

259
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:52,255
-Okay, turn it on. -Okay!

260
00:12:53,455 --> 00:12:55,455
Was that my name...

261
00:12:56,955 --> 00:13:00,955
The Sleeping Kogoro!

262
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:05,555
Let's talk about the Ebi of Ichikawa some other time.

263
00:13:05,555 --> 00:13:07,455
Nobody's asking him about it.

264
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,755
He must really like the place.

265
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,155
I'm getting hungry.

266
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,855
The deduction I just mentioned

267
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,255
about Mr. Takahashi stealing the mask doesn't apply.

268
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,855
Then, who?

269
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:22,955
Mr. Iwami!

270
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:27,355
You withdrawing cash from the ATM at the hospital,

271
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:31,155
and handing it over to Mr. Kaneko

272
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:35,155
was found on the security camera of the ATM.

273
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:36,855
You gave him money?

274
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,055
I'm sorry.

275
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:40,455
But he took a picture of me entering at midnight, so...

276
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:45,455
Mr. Kaneko knew that you weren't the one who stole the mask.

277
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:46,455
What?

278
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:48,255
He knew and yet blackmailed?

279
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:51,755
He figured you'd pay him if he threatened you.

280
00:13:51,755 --> 00:13:53,655
Mr. Yabusaki and Mr. Minowa!

281
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:56,255
Please rest at ease.

282
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:59,855
Both of you weren't blackmailed by Mr. Kaneko.

283
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:02,055
Are you saying that if they weren't threatened by Kaneko,

284
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:04,055
they're not the perp?

285
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:10,455
This is where Mr. Iwami enters Kabukiza.

286
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:12,355
Mr. Iwami who was shown this footage,

287
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:15,955
did what he was told to, and paid.

288
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,255
However, there was a continuation

289
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,455
to what was taken on Mr. Kaneko's camera.

290
00:14:20,455 --> 00:14:22,355
This.

291
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,155
Please look closely.

292
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,255
Mr. Iwami is not holding a case or anything.

293
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:31,855
Mr. Kaneko showed you only what he wanted you to see.

294
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:35,855
Mr. Kaneko's camera showed me everything I needed to know this time.

295
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:38,755
Then, the only person left is...

296
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:43,855
Hey, wait a minute.

297
00:14:43,855 --> 00:14:46,455
Mr. Mouri mentioned just now that

298
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:48,855
anybody that was not shown in Mr. Kaneko's camera

299
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,055
isn't the perp.

300
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:55,555
Mr. Hosoo. How do you know that your picture wasn't taken?

301
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,455
Did I say that?

302
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:01,455
My picture would never be in his camera.

303
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,955
Your picture would never be

304
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:07,355
because you dished out a lot of cash and bought up the chips.

305
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:09,555
Let's cut out the joke.

306
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:10,955
Did you forget

307
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:15,055
that my car was tampered with and that my life was endangered?

308
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:17,755
Kogoro Mouri's Seven Masks!

309
00:15:17,755 --> 00:15:18,755
Mask One!

310
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:20,655
"Wataru Takagi, First Investigation Division Sergeant"

311
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:23,755
I checked that slope once again this morning,

312
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:27,155
and found out that the residue of brake oil was found

313
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,455
only on the very top of the slope,

314
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:32,455
and there were no traces of it anywhere else.

315
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:35,455
Why did you take that road?

316
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:39,055
The most direct and shortest path from your residence to Kabukiza

317
00:15:39,055 --> 00:15:42,155
is an almost straight flat road.

318
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:47,855
What was your reason for going all the way up the slope?

319
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:50,155
Moreover, near there,

320
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:53,255
a vinyl tape with oil on it was found.

321
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,455
A tape with oil?

322
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,855
I get it!

323
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:01,055
I guess you got it, Ebizo. Because you like cars.

324
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:04,955
Since it's not that easy to open a hole in the brake hose,

325
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:08,055
you wrapped tape around the hose that you opened a hole in

326
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:10,655
at the garage of your residence.

327
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,755
Please hold it.

328
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,555
You all saw, didn't you?

329
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:18,055
The footage of the security camera at my residence.

330
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:22,055
I didn't go to the garage.

331
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,655
I see.

332
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:24,655
Mask two!

333
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:26,955
"Ninzaburo Shiratori, First Investigation Division Inspector"

334
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:30,255
There's a convenience store in front of your house, isn't there?

335
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,155
I compared the footage of their security camera

336
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:34,555
with the one at your house.

337
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,755
-Okay, cue! -Okay!

338
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:38,755
The time is adjusted.

339
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:42,755
The one on the left is the one I received from Mr. Hosoo of images outside.

340
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:46,255
The one to the right is the convenience store's.

341
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,055
As you can see,

342
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,555
although it's the same road, at the same time,

343
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:53,655
cars are seen only on one side of the road.

344
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:54,955
An individual who is capable of tampering

345
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:57,255
with the hard disk of your residence...

346
00:16:57,255 --> 00:16:58,955
Do you have any idea who it is?

347
00:16:58,955 --> 00:17:00,955
Who'd do something like that?

348
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,055
Mask three!

349
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,155
"Kazunobu Chiba, First Investigation Division Sergeant"

350
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:08,155
We secured the two-faced mask at Haneda Airport!

351
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,955
We got the story from the buyer Richard too.

352
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:16,655
It seems he bought the mask at an exorbitant price.

353
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:20,555
Mr. Hosoo. You were saying, weren't you?

354
00:17:20,555 --> 00:17:24,555
Japanese cultural assets going overseas is a problem.

355
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,355
What did you mean when you said that?

356
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:29,655
It's not anyone's business what I do with my stuff, is it?

357
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:33,255
Stop accusing me of being a killer just for something like that!

358
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:35,455
-Okay, here! -Roger!

359
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,455
Mask four!

360
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,355
"Juzo Megure, First Investigation Division Inspector"

361
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:41,555
Ms. Shioji told us everything.

362
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:43,255
Shioji...

363
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:46,855
That mask is a fake that I had made.

364
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:49,355
The president told me to keep the genuine mask safely stored

365
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:52,855
until the day of the actual performance.

366
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:56,055
Didn't you already know about this, Ebizo?

367
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,255
Yes.

368
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:58,455
I tried to convince myself that it was

369
00:17:58,455 --> 00:18:02,055
because the mask was cracked, but...

370
00:18:02,055 --> 00:18:04,355
Shioji!

371
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:06,655
You killed them, didn't you?

372
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:08,755
I see. I got it.

373
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,455
Money, you wanted money!

374
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:13,955
I was going with Mr. Takahashi!

375
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:16,455
But the president...

376
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:17,855
Mr. Hosoo.

377
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:22,055
We've already checked and found that your company hasn't been doing well.

378
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:23,755
The money that you sold the mask for

379
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:28,255
and the money from Mr. Takahashi's life insurance policy.

380
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:31,355
Mr. Takahashi's insurance policy?

381
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:32,655
Right.

382
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,055
It's sometimes payable even if suicide is the cause of death.

383
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:37,355
But to further ensure getting hold of the money even soon

384
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:40,255
after being covered...

385
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,255
Being murdered is even better.

386
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:48,955
Where? Just where do you have proof that I did it?

387
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:54,055
This is your button, isn't it?

388
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:58,055
I've been telling these guys repeatedly,

389
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:01,955
that if they should ever be abducted or suddenly attacked,

390
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:06,155
leave a trace of anything on the perp.

391
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:09,655
It's okay to bite on something that you were covered with too, right?

392
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:13,155
Yeah, because the teeth marks or saliva

393
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:15,655
can later be used as evidence.

394
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,055
Why's he acting so sophisticated?

395
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:26,355
What's come over you, Mr. Mouri?

396
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:28,355
You of all people should know better.

397
00:19:28,355 --> 00:19:33,355
Shioji, why don't you tell him when I changed my jacket?

398
00:19:36,055 --> 00:19:38,855
It's time we get going.

399
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,455
President. The button of your sleeve...

400
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,055
I wonder when it came off.

401
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:46,955
When I went to the hotel with you,

402
00:19:46,955 --> 00:19:49,155
I was wearing a new jacket, no?

403
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,355
Sonny! When did you get that button?

404
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:54,555
Tell me, won't you?

405
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,055
You want to pin the murder of Kaneko on me too,

406
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:01,455
despite going as far as using a kid to do so!

407
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:05,355
Pops Kogoro, when did I say jacket?

408
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,355
He's so mean.

409
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:12,355
Mr. Hosoo, all Conan said was what he was covered with.

410
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:13,755
Finish him!

411
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,255
Okay. I'll show everything in rapid succession!

412
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:19,455
This button of yours was found

413
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:22,855
in the engine room of the car that Mr. Takahashi was found dead in.

414
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:27,055
These water cushions beside the railroad crossing.

415
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:30,155
This is where you were planning to crash into.

416
00:20:31,755 --> 00:20:33,855
This is in your garage.

417
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:35,655
You used vinyl gloves

418
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,255
to keep your hands from being soiled by brake oil.

419
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:42,555
This is the building that your office was previously in

420
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:45,755
that is now being demolished.

421
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:48,355
The basement floor used to be the staff room.

422
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,055
No wonder you knew so much about it.

423
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:52,455
What's this?

424
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:54,155
It's Mr. Hosoo picking up Mr. Iwami's memo.

425
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:55,455
Why?

426
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,855
Why do you have all these pictures?

427
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:01,455
Mr. Kaneko had all the pictures he sold to you

428
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:05,255
saved in his computer.

429
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:08,655
So that he could suck you dry of more cash.

430
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:15,355
My company's going to go bankrupt.

431
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:22,355
No company is worth saving if you have to kill to do so!

432
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:25,255
The place you are standing in now

433
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,355
is where people hone their skills on a daily basis

434
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:29,855
and hold themselves on high standards.

435
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,355
This stage belongs to them.

436
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:35,655
A person like you doesn't belong here!

437
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,755
Mr. Mouri!

438
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:13,755
The perp!

439
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:16,955
You were fantastic. Just as expected, Kogoro Mouri!

440
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:19,955
Dad, you were quite attractive a while ago.

441
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:21,855
Remember, she said "quite".

442
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,455
What're you guys talking about?

443
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:24,855
I've got to nab him.

444
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:26,155
Please,

445
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:30,055
let me include the Sleeping Kogoro in my next performance!

446
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:35,055
I'm definitely confident that it'll turn out to be a great performance.

447
00:23:35,055 --> 00:23:37,655
Let me go!

448
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,655
Then, who's going to act my part?

449
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:49,555
"Next Episode" -Now all that is yours is mine.

450
00:23:53,055 --> 00:23:55,855
No, I can't take it anymore!

451
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:57,655
Please get a hold of yourself.

452
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:04,055
Psychiatric tests aren't 100 percent accurate.

453
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:08,555
I...

454
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:10,655
I didn't do it!

455
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:12,255
Next Conan,

456
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:15,955
"The Ventriloquist's Illusion (Part 1)"

457
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,867
Next Conan's Hint:

458
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,867
"Speaker"

459
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,767
-I'm awesome at ventriloquism! -Give it a try.

460
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:23,967
Okay! I'm Genta!

461
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:25,867
We can't tell with just your voice.
