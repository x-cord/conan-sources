1
00:00:02,575 --> 00:00:04,175
Everyone.

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:06,775
I hate to have to do this, knowing how tired you all must be,

3
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:09,375
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,275
The incident occurred,

5
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:13,175
in the wee hours of the morning at around 2:30.

6
00:00:13,175 --> 00:00:18,275
Please tell me in order, what you were doing at that time.

7
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,175
First, Honami.

8
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:24,775
I was fast asleep in my room until Ran came to wake me.

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,675
You got the key and headed for the 2nd floor?

10
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,975
Where do you keep the key?

11
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:33,775
On the kitchen wall that is next to this dining room.

12
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:36,875
So anybody could take it and use it at will?

13
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,575
But, the key was definitely there at that time.

14
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:43,775
-Ran? -She's right.

15
00:00:43,775 --> 00:00:45,075
Are there any spare keys?

16
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,775
They are old keys, so we can't make spares.

17
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:51,175
When we unlocked the door and went into the room of masks,

18
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:55,375
we noticed that the masks of Chableu were gone.

19
00:00:55,375 --> 00:01:00,175
That was when we heard the groan and loud noise from the 3rd floor.

20
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:05,275
Yes, and while we were waking Minaho on the extension phone,

21
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,575
Aikawa came along.

22
00:01:07,575 --> 00:01:10,675
I was sleeping in my room on the 1st floor, too.

23
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:14,375
I realized that they had come to wake Minaho,

24
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,975
but I didn't think it was a big deal.

25
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:19,575
Then, it started getting noisy,

26
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:22,675
so I went to the 2nd floor to check things out.

27
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:25,475
I was awakened by Honami on the extension phone,

28
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:27,875
took the key and went to the 2nd floor.

29
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:29,975
I was also sleeping in my room,

30
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,675
but since it started to get noisy outside,

31
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,075
I got up and went out into the corridor,

32
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:37,375
just as Minaho had come up the stairs.

33
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,475
Same with me.

34
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,775
Me, too.

35
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:44,375
Ms. Inaba, I heard that you did not appear

36
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,675
at the time the corpse was found?

37
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:52,075
I over drank wine last night and was totally passed out.

38
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:54,775
So, you didn't realize all the racket going on?

39
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,875
No...

40
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:01,475
Mr. Katagiri, have you ever met Ms. Suou before?

41
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:03,775
No, I met her for the first time yesterday.

42
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:05,575
Why did you ask?

43
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:09,475
Ms. Suou asked me to check on the traffic accident

44
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:12,375
that took your wife's life 20 years ago.

45
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,275
Ms. Suou did? Why?

46
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:17,375
Do you have any idea why?

47
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,575
No, I don't.

48
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:23,075
Ms. Suou asked Pops to check on the traffic accident

49
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:25,675
that took Mr. Katagiri's wife's life?

50
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:27,075
Why would she want to check on a traffic accident

51
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,775
that happened 20 years ago?

52
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:33,675
Your mother got into a traffic accident 20 years ago too,

53
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,075
didn't she, Mr. Aikawa?

54
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,575
Yes, that's right.

55
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,375
Don't tell me that... Mr. Katagiri?

56
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,575
Will you tell us about the traffic accident that took your wife's life?

57
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,675
You'll find out sooner or later even if I didn't tell you.

58
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:53,175
Yes, my wife was the victim of the traffic accident

59
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:55,375
that Mr. Aikawa's mother had caused.

60
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,275
No way.

61
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:00,275
Didn't you know about it, Mr. Aikawa?

62
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:04,175
No. Because I was still only six years old.

63
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:08,275
But, how is that traffic accident connected to today's murder case?

64
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:12,975
The police think that the murderer is among us, isn't that right?

65
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,075
What?

66
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,575
Oh, no. Is that true, inspector?

67
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:19,475
Oh, no, not really...

68
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:23,475
I recall that it had stopped snowing after 12:00

69
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:26,875
I'll bet you couldn't find traces of the killer on the snow?

70
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:33,275
Is she right, inspector?

71
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:35,175
It can't be helped.

72
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:38,075
Yes, it's true that there are no traces of the killer

73
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:40,175
having entered or left the mansion.

74
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:41,775
Oh, no.

75
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:44,075
You mean the killer is among us?

76
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:47,575
Moreover, since the room of masks was locked,

77
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:52,175
the killer has to be one of the five that was in the west wing.

78
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:58,175
Mr. Katagiri, Haruka, Ms Inaba, Mr. Matsudaira and Minaho.

79
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,175
What? Wait a second.

80
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,775
That was a strange remark.

81
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,575
Why that remark?

82
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:09,675
But, it's difficult to determine the suspect.

83
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,575
I think there is a way.

84
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:15,075
Don't tell me that you're going to find the killer

85
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:17,675
using your cards, are you?

86
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,275
From the looks of the scene of the crime,

87
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:22,875
killer probably was splattered by a lot of blood.

88
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,475
Although it is possible to avoid blood on the face by wearing the mask,

89
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:29,475
it would not be as easily remove the blood from the hair and body.

90
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:30,475
I see!

91
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,475
The killer is someone who had time

92
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:34,475
to wipe off the blood that splattered on.

93
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,975
What? Are you saying that I'm the killer?

94
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,575
The only person who had time to wipe blood off

95
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,075
is you, because you weren't at the scene where the body was found.

96
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:46,575
You've got to be kidding!

97
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:49,075
Why would I have to kill Ms. Suou?

98
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,775
Hey, you!

99
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,475
Cut out your nonsense!

100
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:54,675
Please calm down!

101
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:56,275
You fraud fortune-teller!

102
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:16,175
That's what happened.

103
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:21,975
I was completely deceived by the trap that the killer had set.

104
00:05:23,175 --> 00:05:25,975
But, the trick's over.

105
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,775
I've figured out the curse of the masks!

106
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,275
What's up, Conan?

107
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:40,675
Mr. Mouri says he has a favor to ask you.

108
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:41,875
What?

109
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,975
What is it? Hey, what?

110
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:49,475
On the chest over there. Take a look at it.

111
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,575
What a nuisance.

112
00:05:57,875 --> 00:06:00,475
There's nothing here.

113
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,975
Leave the rest to me, Pops.

114
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:20,175
So, this is the bedroom next door.

115
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:26,075
So a bedroom that looks just like Ms. Suou's was right next door.

116
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,975
Yes. This room, with the same structure

117
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:30,675
as that of the room where the crime took place,

118
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:32,375
is what helped solve the mystery of the locked doors

119
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,475
as well as reveal the identity of the killer.

120
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:38,775
What? You mean Ms. Inaba is not the killer?

121
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,875
I've been saying that I'm not!!

122
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,575
Have you solved the mystery of the locked doors?

123
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:45,675
Yes, I've figured everything out.

124
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:48,075
Who on earth is the killer?

125
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,575
The killer who killed Ms. Beniko Suou in a locked room,

126
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:53,975
the "messenger of the cursed mask" is...

127
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,175
you!

128
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:05,063
The "messenger of the cursed mask" is...

129
00:07:05,063 --> 00:07:06,663
you!

130
00:07:06,663 --> 00:07:08,763
Mr. Touya Aikawa!

131
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,263
What?

132
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:12,363
No way.

133
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:14,563
Oh, no.

134
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:16,763
What on earth are you talking about, Mr. Mouri?

135
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:19,063
How could I, who was in the east wing of the mansion

136
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,563
have gone to Ms. Suou's bedroom?

137
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:26,263
Yes, indeed you could not go to Ms. Suou's bedroom.

138
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:28,363
In order to prove that,

139
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:31,063
you called us on the extension phone,

140
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:33,463
just before you committed the murder.

141
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:36,063
But, if he couldn't go to her bedroom,

142
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:38,463
how could he have committed the crime?

143
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:42,563
I've been suspicious from the time the body was found.

144
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,963
I kept thinking of why the killer, despite having committed the crime

145
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:50,063
behind a locked door, did not make her death look to be suicide.

146
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:53,263
It was because he couldn't.

147
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:55,463
Mr. Aikawa

148
00:07:55,463 --> 00:08:00,563
killed Ms. Suou without entering her bedroom at all.

149
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,963
-What? -Without going into her bedroom?

150
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,963
Impossible.

151
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:11,963
It's possible, with the help of the cursed masks.

152
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:17,363
Don't tell me that you really believe in things such as curses?

153
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,863
No. But the masks of Chableu are indeed

154
00:08:20,863 --> 00:08:24,463
the key to committing murder behind locked doors.

155
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,563
I will replay that method here.

156
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:29,363
-Officer Takagi! -Yes, sir!

157
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:37,663
I borrowed a knife that is similar to the murder weapon.

158
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:39,263
There is a rubber rope

159
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:41,263
attached through the hole at the rear end of the handle.

160
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:43,263
Next for the mask.

161
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,063
The rubber rope is passed through both eyes of all the masks.

162
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:50,663
And the rubber rope attached to the knife

163
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,163
is passed through the mouth hole of all the masks.

164
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:57,163
After all of us went to bed, Mr. Aikawa

165
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:00,063
went to the kitchen to get the key to enter the room of masks.

166
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:02,563
He stole the masks of Chableu and a knife,

167
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:06,663
then locked the door and returned the key to the kitchen.

168
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:09,663
He brought the masks and knife into this room,

169
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:12,363
and carried on with the rubber rope trick.

170
00:09:12,363 --> 00:09:14,463
He dropped the masks and the knife into Ms. Suou's bedroom

171
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,663
through the space between the railing.

172
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:18,363
The size of the space is 5X5 centimeters.

173
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:22,363
A thin mask would easily slide through.

174
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:24,663
Can you really solve the mystery of the locked door

175
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:26,063
doing something like this?

176
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:28,363
Well, please watch.

177
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:47,063
This is the last mask!

178
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:51,463
After placing all the masks inside the room,

179
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:53,663
he pulled the rubber rope towards himself.

180
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:17,763
Now everyone, since the mask is 15 millimeters thick,

181
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:19,763
if 200 are piled up one on top of the other,

182
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:21,663
the pile would be 3 meters.

183
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,963
The position of the neck of the victim asleep in bed

184
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:27,863
was about 3.5 meters from the railing.

185
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:29,663
So, then what...

186
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:39,463
This...

187
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:56,463
From the edge of the knife to the victim's throat is only 10 centimeters.

188
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:58,463
All he had left to do now,

189
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,063
was to push the masks out using a ruler or something.

190
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:08,063
By using these stairs that only the people

191
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:11,363
who are in the east wing of the mansion can climb,

192
00:11:11,363 --> 00:11:13,563
This way, Mr. Aikawa killed Ms. Suou

193
00:11:13,563 --> 00:11:17,363
without setting foot into her room at all.

194
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:18,363
I see!

195
00:11:18,363 --> 00:11:21,363
One of the masks was badly covered blood

196
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:24,163
because it was the mask on the very top, wasn't it?

197
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:27,563
The reason why several masks had blood by the mouth,

198
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,863
was because Ms. Suou's blood splattered on them.

199
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,963
And he finally severs the rubber rope that was passed through

200
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:35,963
the eyes of the masks and the handle of the knife.

201
00:11:40,863 --> 00:11:42,163
This is...

202
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:48,163
So, that's it for the locked door mystery.

203
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:49,363
It's all baloney!

204
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:52,663
Just where do you have the proof that I used that trick!

205
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:55,763
Mr. Aikawa, you're acting in bad grace.

206
00:11:55,763 --> 00:12:00,363
Haven't you realized that you've already confessed

207
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:02,463
that you are the killer?

208
00:12:02,463 --> 00:12:04,763
What? What do you mean?

209
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:09,463
While you were being questioned a while ago,

210
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:13,563
you said, "I noticed that the kids came to wake Honami up".

211
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:17,763
Yes, because I was in my room on the first floor then!

212
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:21,163
When you said, "Those kids" who and Ran were you referring to?

213
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:24,163
Who else but the kid named Conan!

214
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:25,963
How strange.

215
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:28,863
I didn't say a word back then,

216
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:31,263
and yet how did you know I was with Ran?

217
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:33,263
That's because...

218
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,663
Right, I opened the door a bit and looked out.

219
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:40,763
That's why I know that he was with her.

220
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:43,763
-Really? -Really.

221
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,063
Then, it's even stranger.

222
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:49,263
Because I didn't go with Ran.

223
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,963
I went to check if the doors around the house were locked.

224
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:54,863
No way.

225
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,163
Is that true?

226
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:57,363
Yes.

227
00:12:57,363 --> 00:13:01,363
I went to Honami's room alone.

228
00:13:02,663 --> 00:13:08,163
I did tell Ran and Conan to go get Honami back then.

229
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,563
Didn't you think that they went together to Honami's room

230
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:13,263
because when you heard me say so,

231
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:16,963
you were in the room on the 3rd floor?

232
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:20,163
Only because of something like that, you...

233
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:23,563
Touya! After all she did for you, how could you?

234
00:13:23,563 --> 00:13:26,463
Shut up! After all she did for me?

235
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:27,963
You've got to be kidding!

236
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:31,763
That woman blamed the hit-and-run accident that she caused on my mother,

237
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:34,363
and made it look as if she committed suicide!

238
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:35,963
Is that true?

239
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,163
It's true.

240
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:40,763
Although I found out about it just 2 months ago.

241
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:42,963
I was cleaning out my mother's belongings

242
00:13:42,963 --> 00:13:45,563
when a letter fell out from behind the cover of her diary

243
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:48,363
and the truth about the incident was written in it.

244
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:51,663
That's a lie! It's all baloney!

245
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:55,363
No, it's not! My mother had an alibi!

246
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:59,963
The accident occurred on the night of October 31st.

247
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,463
October 31?

248
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:04,663
Touya's birthday.

249
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:08,763
Right! My mother was with me right through on that day!

250
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:12,963
Which means that the one who hit-and-run my wife

251
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:14,563
was Suou.

252
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:17,063
Moreover, she didn't even know that your wife

253
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:20,063
was the victim of a traffic accident, Mr. Katagiri!

254
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:23,963
I guess she asked me to investigate on the case,

255
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,763
after she heard Mr. Katagiri talk about it at dinner.

256
00:14:26,763 --> 00:14:31,263
Ms. Suou is a fine person who has been hosting charity shows for 15 years!

257
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:32,663
What a laugh!

258
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:37,063
That woman embezzled the money that was raised to fatten her own pocket!

259
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:39,563
You're lying! Ms. Suou would never do any such thing...

260
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:42,463
You also got part of the cash, didn't you?

261
00:14:42,463 --> 00:14:45,163
You're not playing dumb with me!

262
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:50,563
I wanted to keep Mr. Katagiri from participating

263
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:53,063
in this corrupt charity no matter what.

264
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:54,563
That woman...

265
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:59,063
Beniko Suou was a devil wearing the mask of a person practicing goodwill!

266
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:02,063
Just to think that I felt grateful

267
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:06,463
for her having saved me, all these years...

268
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:41,563
It could be that Mr. Aikawa was possessed by the curse of the masks.

269
00:16:41,563 --> 00:16:44,263
Curses are only superstitions!

270
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:02,163
Curse! This is a curse!

271
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:07,263
That's no curse. It's just that you're a klutz, Pops.
