1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.440
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.140
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.140
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.840
Today's point is a shopping receipt.

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.740
A small piece of paper says a lot.

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult,

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.240
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.190
Whoopee, whoopee.

10
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.090
How's about it, Mitsuhiko?

11
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.590
Yaiba Kick!

12
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.590
Gosh! I'm beat!

13
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.490
It's my turn next!

14
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.990
How long are you guys going to keep this up?

15
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.690
There, Ayumi! Go for it!

16
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.290
I'm not going to lose! There!

17
00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.390
No!

18
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.390
Yaiba Punch!

19
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.290
"Dangerous Recipe"

20
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.190
"B1-Food Products"

21
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.890
An ice cream cone after a battle is delicious.

22
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.790
Right. You should've played too, Conan.

23
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.390
Yeah, maybe next time.

24
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.190
It sure is crowded, isn't it?

25
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.690
It's already past 16:00,

26
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.290
so they're all here to buy things for making dinner.

27
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.090
Dinner... I wonder what it is today.

28
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.690
I hope it's eels over rice.

29
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.590
Right! Why don't we play a menu deduction game?

30
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.890
A menu deduction game?

31
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.490
What's that?

32
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.790
Well, it goes like this.

33
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.690
We deduce what the shoppers are having for dinner

34
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.290
by looking at the receipts they leave behind.

35
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.090
Okay, here goes.

36
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.190
Potatoes, onions,

37
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.090
"Keiran", six pack.

38
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.190
What's a "keiran"?

39
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.690
Eggs. Eggs of a hen.

40
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.690
I see.

41
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.290
Next. Ground beef and bread crumbs.

42
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.490
-The answer is? -I got it! It's croquette!

43
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.390
But you also need flour to make it, don't you?

44
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.790
Maybe she's already got the flour.

45
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.790
I see.

46
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.490
It's my turn next.

47
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.290
Well, chicken thighs, ketchup,

48
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.790
green peas, tomato, lettuce and celery.

49
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.590
Chicken rice!

50
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.590
With vegetable salad.

51
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.290
Okay, next it's my turn!

52
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.890
There's a lot listed.

53
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.390
Okay, here goes.

54
00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:00.290
Well, potatoes, onions, beef, flour, sugar.

55
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.090
The answer is?

56
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.490
Meat with potatoes...

57
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.990
Cream stew or gratin?

58
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.290
But then it should be salt and pepper, not sugar.

59
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.090
Maybe the sugar is going to be used for something else.

60
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.390
The person doesn't have to be buying ingredients

61
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.090
only for tonight's dinner, right?

62
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.690
I see. That's true.

63
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.190
Then, here's the next one.

64
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.990
Peti... Petite knife, cutting board,

65
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.690
grater, handy gloves, food case, dustpan.

66
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.990
Isn't that the receipt for a different section?

67
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.790
What is this thing called petite knife?

68
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.090
It's a small knife.

69
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.090
Something like a knife for cutting fruit.

70
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.390
What're handy gloves?

71
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.990
Gloves used when cooking?

72
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.790
Do you wear gloves when cooking?

73
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.190
Oh, I get it!

74
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.890
That person probably just moved in,

75
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.990
and is going to start cooking from tonight.

76
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.590
That's why the shopper bought a knife and cutting board too.

77
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.990
The grater's going to be used for grating onions.

78
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.390
Their deductions are pretty good.

79
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.190
The dustpan's going to be used for cleaning.

80
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.990
Obviously.

81
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.490
I wonder if she's a young woman?

82
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.190
It could also be a man.

83
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.890
Well, the third one is...

84
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.490
It's Masked Yaiba color ball!

85
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.190
Huh? Then maybe there's a child?

86
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.890
The fourth one is

87
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.090
size #2 batteries, handle light...

88
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.290
What's a handle light?

89
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.690
I think it's light that you attach to the handle of a bicycle.

90
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.990
The items are not all food, are they?

91
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.090
The fifth one is...

92
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.490
This one is of another store.

93
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.990
Drugstore Satoshi Kobayashi.

94
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.990
The drugstore next door.

95
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.890
The name of the drugstore changed recently, right?

96
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.790
Never mind that. What's on the shopping list?

97
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.890
Well... Chlo... chlorine?

98
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.190
Chlorine!

99
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.190
Genta, show me that!

100
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.490
The receipt of the food products section

101
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.490
that you read at the beginning too.

102
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.090
What's with you, Conan?

103
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.690
-Hurry, give it to me! -Okay.

104
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.290
What's wrong, Conan?

105
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.090
He's right. Chlorine.

106
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.990
What on earth is that thing called "chlorine"?

107
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.290
It's a colorless or whitish crystalline substance,

108
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.090
usually used to sterilize or disinfect the skin.

109
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.990
There is another way this substance is used.

110
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.690
Another way?

111
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.790
Chlorine is deadly toxic.

112
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.290
What?

113
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.590
Did you say toxic?

114
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.690
Well, it's usually used to make mole balls

115
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.890
to get rid of moles.

116
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.090
The ingredients for making those mole balls are

117
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.890
on this receipt, potatoes, onions, beef, flour, and sugar.

118
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.590
Then maybe the shopper bought them to get rid of moles.

119
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.790
Genta.

120
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.290
Do you think that there are moles in a city like this?

121
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.890
That's true.

122
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.690
Maybe we see mice sometimes.

123
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.990
Then maybe it's going to be used to disinfect the skin after all.

124
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.590
The potatoes and onions

125
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.990
are going to be used to make stew or gratin.

126
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.690
Well, I guess so.

127
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:19.490
Conan.

128
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.290
If it bothers you so much,

129
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.990
why don't you ask the employees here?

130
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.790
Yeah, you're right.

131
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.190
Well...

132
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.690
15:20. It was bought only an hour ago.

133
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.890
The person in charge is Masako Arai.

134
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.290
Thank you for waiting.

135
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.890
I remember that person very well.

136
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.390
All right!

137
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.490
He was about 20 years old.

138
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.090
At first, I thought what he wanted was out of stock,

139
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.990
so I told him it'll come in tomorrow.

140
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.290
But he insisted he needed it today.

141
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.090
How did he act?

142
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.290
He seemed sort of jittery and didn't look all that calm.

143
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.690
Do you remember his face?

144
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.890
The color of his hair?

145
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.990
Was he fat like me?

146
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.890
Please tell us!

147
00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.690
Hey.

148
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.390
Height, about 170 centimeters.

149
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:27.090
Brown hair and wearing glasses.

150
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.390
Skinny and wearing a blackish top.

151
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.590
The point is why this man bought chlorine.

152
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.090
Yeah. If he used it to disinfect his skin,

153
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.290
it bothers me that he didn't seem calm.

154
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.690
Hey. What happens if humans eat the mole balls?

155
00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.890
Well...

156
00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.490
It won't kill the person,

157
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.490
but probably numb the body making it unable to move.

158
00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:58.990
Unable to move?

159
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.990
I got it!

160
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.390
The guy was trying to make mole balls after all!

161
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.190
He was going to make somebody eat them

162
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.390
and then kidnap the person.

163
00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.190
Kidnap?

164
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.290
If so, it's understandable why he bought the ingredients

165
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.590
to make mole balls despite no moles.

166
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.790
Anyway, let's search the identity of this man.

167
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.990
Yes...

168
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.990
I wonder.

169
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.490
I don't remember because there are a lot of shoppers.

170
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.990
This is the one.

171
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.690
Petite knife, 1980 yen.

172
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.190
Although it's small, it's enough to cut potatoes and onions.

173
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.790
The cutting board is plastic

174
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.690
and is also the smallest one around.

175
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.590
The grater is also plastic.

176
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.490
Everything looks like something a man who doesn't usually cook

177
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.790
rushed to buy.

178
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.390
Hey! These are the glove for 120 yen!

179
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.590
Very thin gloves made of polyethylene.

180
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.490
If these are used to make mole balls,

181
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.190
no fingerprints would be left behind.

182
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.990
Disposables.

183
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.190
But it's more than enough to carry around the mole balls.

184
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.590
This dustpan has the longest and thinnest handle.

185
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.790
But, what does a dustpan have to do

186
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:25.290
with the sales floor mole balls?

187
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.590
I can't tell either.

188
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.690
Maybe a guy something like that bought it.

189
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.890
Do you have any idea who he is?

190
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.790
No.

191
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.990
Hey! Did you know that this pole glows in the dark?

192
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.590
It's made with fluorescent paint.

193
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.990
What does this have to do with the mole balls?

194
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.290
We didn't notice anybody like that buying it, did we?

195
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.390
And we were playing right behind too.

196
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.490
This handle light.

197
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.790
I remember it well

198
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.590
because it's a new item that just came out only three days ago.

199
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.690
See.

200
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.390
This is an important piece of evidence!

201
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.190
Was the person who bought it

202
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.690
about 170 centimeters

203
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.790
and ah skinny, wearing a blackish top,

204
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.790
with brown hair and glasses?

205
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.990
Oh, you really are knowledgeable.

206
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.090
He also bought batteries.

207
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.390
But I have no idea of who or where he lives.

208
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.690
Okay, we'll buy that

209
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.490
Are you going to put that on your bicycle too, Conan?

210
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.590
If so, you've got to buy batteries too.

211
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.290
I'm not going to use it.

212
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.290
We'll use it as a clue to finding the man.

213
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.890
But how? Without even knowing his name or address.

214
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.990
No, we've got a clue.

215
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.090
The sixth receipt.

216
00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.590
We haven't looked at the sixth receipt yet.

217
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.390
It's a receipt from a convenience store.

218
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.490
Utopia, Beikacho Park Branch.

219
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.790
A vinyl umbrella was bought at 14:50.

220
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.090
14:50?

221
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.590
That's about the time we were at the Beika Library.

222
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.690
Yeah, and there was a sudden pour of shower.

223
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.190
200 meters from this shop,

224
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.490
there is a bus stop for the Beika Station bus.

225
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:25.490
The man probably rode the Beika Station.

226
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.790
I think this guy walked from his residence

227
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.990
and headed for Beika station.

228
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.190
But since it suddenly began to pour,

229
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.190
he went into this store and bought himself an umbrella.

230
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.290
So he lives close to the store

231
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.390
at the opposite side of the bus stop.

232
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.690
Enough of a distance that going back for an umbrella

233
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.690
would be a pain.

234
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.290
Judging from the fact that he bought a knife and cutting board,

235
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:53.990
he probably doesn't live with his family,

236
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.790
but rather alone in an apartment or a condo.

237
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.290
I see, living alone.

238
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:03.190
It's most likely that he frequents the convenience store.

239
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.090
Maybe we'll be able to find out who he is or where he lives.

240
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.590
Okay, let's go to that store!

241
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.690
The man remarked that he had to have the chlorine by today.

242
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.690
If the plans to make the mole balls by today

243
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.690
and make someone eat it...

244
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:18.990
We've got to hurry. We have no time to lose!

245
00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:51.779
This way!

246
00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:04.579
Brown hair, wearing glasses, about 20 years old,

247
00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:08.079
about 170 meters tall, and a male...

248
00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:10.879
We have a lot of customers like that.

249
00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:15.379
He bought a large vinyl umbrella at about 14:50.

250
00:14:15.379 --> 00:14:17.879
Maybe it could be him.

251
00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:19.179
Do you know him?

252
00:14:19.179 --> 00:14:22.879
Yes. He comes here every so often.

253
00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:24.979
Do you know his name or address?

254
00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:26.579
No.

255
00:14:26.579 --> 00:14:28.979
But I think he lives nearby

256
00:14:28.979 --> 00:14:30.779
because he comes here wearing sandals most of the time.

257
00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:37.079
We couldn't find out who or where he lives after all.

258
00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:39.079
We've got no choice but to split up and look for him.

259
00:14:39.079 --> 00:14:41.579
What? -But, how?

260
00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:42.679
The bicycle!

261
00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:44.379
Bicycle?

262
00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:46.579
The man didn't go shopping with his bicycle

263
00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:49.579
because it wasn't equipped with a basket to carry his things in.

264
00:14:49.579 --> 00:14:51.679
And I'm positive that the guy's bicycle

265
00:14:51.679 --> 00:14:56.179
has a new type handle light on it.

266
00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.879
I see! So, we're going to look for a bicycle that doesn't have a basket

267
00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:00.079
and has a new type handle light attached to it

268
00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:02.279
parked in the apartments nearby.

269
00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:03.479
Yes.

270
00:15:03.479 --> 00:15:05.279
Take this, Genta,

271
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:07.079
so you don't make a mistake.

272
00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:09.279
All right!

273
00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:12.579
For you, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko.

274
00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:14.079
Okay. -Okay.

275
00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.179
Listen. Like I said before,

276
00:15:16.179 --> 00:15:19.779
the man's house is near here opposite the bus stop.

277
00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:21.179
He lives some distance away

278
00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:22.879
that it is too much trouble to go back home to get his umbrella.

279
00:15:22.879 --> 00:15:25.379
If you find him, report so, using your badges.

280
00:15:27.079 --> 00:15:28.279
See you.

281
00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:30.579
-Conan! -That way is the bus stop!

282
00:15:32.479 --> 00:15:34.779
Where on earth is he going?

283
00:15:34.779 --> 00:15:38.279
I'm sure Conan has something in mind.

284
00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.179
Let's go ahead and look for the guy.

285
00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:41.279
Okay.

286
00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:46.279
He probably went to buy the handle light today

287
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.479
because he's planning to use his bicycle tonight.

288
00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:51.179
We've got to be ready for that too.

289
00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:55.179
But I wonder what he's going to use the dustpan and pole for?

290
00:15:59.379 --> 00:16:01.079
"Mouri Detective Agency"

291
00:16:25.779 --> 00:16:27.379
I found it!

292
00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:33.179
Testing microphone, testing microphone.

293
00:16:33.179 --> 00:16:34.879
Youth Detective Squad...

294
00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:36.779
The bicycle in question has been found!

295
00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:39.079
Report the scene on the double!

296
00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:40.579
Good work, Genta!

297
00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:45.279
Genta!

298
00:16:45.279 --> 00:16:46.679
So, you've found it!

299
00:16:46.679 --> 00:16:48.679
Only Conan's not here yet.

300
00:16:52.379 --> 00:16:54.679
You went back to get your skateboard?

301
00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:56.979
Yes.

302
00:16:56.979 --> 00:16:58.279
So, he lives here.

303
00:16:58.279 --> 00:16:59.679
Yes.

304
00:16:59.679 --> 00:17:01.979
But I wonder which room he lives in.

305
00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:04.979
Let's hide and watch.

306
00:17:04.979 --> 00:17:06.379
He should be coming out.

307
00:17:06.379 --> 00:17:07.379
Yes...

308
00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:22.479
Somebody is coming out!

309
00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:31.479
About 170 meters tall, skinny, wearing a blackish top,

310
00:17:31.479 --> 00:17:33.079
brown hair and glasses!

311
00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:34.779
-Is it him? -Wait.

312
00:17:38.379 --> 00:17:40.279
It's definitely him.

313
00:17:45.679 --> 00:17:47.079
Okay!

314
00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:51.579
-Me too! -Same here!

315
00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:52.679
Me too!

316
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.079
Gosh!

317
00:17:56.379 --> 00:17:58.379
Hang on tight.

318
00:18:04.279 --> 00:18:06.979
Conan, he's pulling away from us.

319
00:18:06.979 --> 00:18:08.679
At this rate, we'll lose him.

320
00:18:08.679 --> 00:18:10.979
Can't you speed up a bit more?

321
00:18:10.979 --> 00:18:13.079
You guys are too heavy!

322
00:18:22.279 --> 00:18:23.479
He's gone.

323
00:18:23.479 --> 00:18:25.879
We've lost him after all.

324
00:18:25.879 --> 00:18:29.279
He got off here, which means...

325
00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:33.079
It's most likely that he went into one of the houses nearby.

326
00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.979
Should we check one house after another?

327
00:18:34.979 --> 00:18:36.279
Huh?

328
00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:38.679
I don't want to go in this alley.

329
00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:40.179
There's a house with a large yard,

330
00:18:40.179 --> 00:18:42.679
with a big dog that barks a lot here.

331
00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:44.679
A dog?

332
00:18:44.679 --> 00:18:46.479
Maybe...

333
00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:50.279
Did you know that this pole glows in the dark?

334
00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:53.579
This dustpan has the longest and thinnest handle.

335
00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:38.379
Don't.

336
00:19:41.479 --> 00:19:45.779
What you are about to do is a crime, you know.

337
00:19:51.779 --> 00:19:53.179
No use trying to flee!

338
00:19:53.179 --> 00:19:55.279
Your name is Murakami, isn't it?

339
00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:58.279
We know where you live too!

340
00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.579
What?

341
00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:16.479
Well, Mr. Murakami,

342
00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:17.879
are you still going to run?

343
00:20:28.779 --> 00:20:29.979
Genta, take off your shoes!

344
00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.979
What?

345
00:20:31.979 --> 00:20:33.379
The shoe!

346
00:21:02.379 --> 00:21:04.279
My shoe...

347
00:21:08.979 --> 00:21:12.879
After this, the neighbors call the police, who arrive in no time.

348
00:21:12.879 --> 00:21:14.879
Murakami is arrested.

349
00:22:48.579 --> 00:22:53.579
To think that he was going to give the mole balls to the dog.

350
00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:57.379
I heard from the officer of Beikacho police station over the phone

351
00:22:57.379 --> 00:22:58.479
that the guy was saying

352
00:22:58.479 --> 00:23:01.179
he was going to kill that dog one of these days,

353
00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:03.479
everyday when he went out for a walk along his favorite path,

354
00:23:03.479 --> 00:23:06.779
that dog would bark ferociously at him.

355
00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:10.179
That dog really does bark a lot.

356
00:23:10.179 --> 00:23:13.579
He learned of making mole balls in a book,

357
00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:15.879
and yesterday afternoon, when he passed in front of the house,

358
00:23:15.879 --> 00:23:18.179
he happened to find out that the entire family

359
00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.679
was out on an overnight trip.

360
00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:22.279
He suddenly decided to carry out his plan.

361
00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:24.479
He was going to feed the dog the mole balls,

362
00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:25.779
and after it became immobile,

363
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.879
he was going to hit it with the stick and kill it.

364
00:23:27.879 --> 00:23:30.279
