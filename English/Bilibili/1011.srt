1
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.860
Come on, honey.

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.490
We've been walking for a while.

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.160
Are we there yet?

4
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.780
Where's this villa your wealthy
uncle bought us as a wedding gift?

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.700
Where's this villa your wealthy
uncle bought us as a wedding gift?
Fukikoshi Toji (42)

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.680
Where's this villa your wealthy
uncle bought us as a wedding gift?

7
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.460
Be patient. We're almost there.

8
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.820
Be patient. We're almost there.
Zenda Maika (38)

9
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.420
Zenda Maika (38)
Like you told me the other day,
I made sure it's in your name.

10
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.200
Like you told me the other day,
I made sure it's in your name.

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.670
Don't worry,

12
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.670
darling.

13
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.180
We've arrived.

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.580
I'm so excited.

15
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.690
Stop teasing me and let me see it, honey.

16
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.930
Nope.

17
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.500
I'm going to remove my hands now,
but keep your eyes closed, okay?

18
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.330
Okay.

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.620
Now open your eyes and take a good look.

20
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.450
Th-This house...

21
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.930
That's right.

22
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.460
It's the villa you built with the money
you scammed from stupid women like me.

23
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.880
The love nest you've been
sharing with some bitch.

24
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.850
It's not like that with her.

25
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.300
Y-You've got it all wrong, honey.

26
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.230
What a shame.

27
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.350
Your excuses won't reach my ears.

28
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.510
Make all the excuses you
want in the afterlife.

29
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.740
Goodbye, darling.

30
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.230
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

31
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.510
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

32
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.280
The Detective Boys go picking wild plants

33
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.330
and encounter a case in the forests of Gunma!

34
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.010
Always determining the one truth

35
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.950
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

36
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.500
his name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.410
Picking Wild Plants and Clovers

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.990
Picking Wild Plants and Clovers
(Part One)

40
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.630
TR Minanokami Station

41
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.740
TR Minanokami Station
You must be exhausted from your long journey.

42
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.170
Gunma Prefecture Minanokami Station

43
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.240
Gunma Prefecture Minanokami Station
Welcome to Gunma prefecture.

44
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.210
It must've been a long trip from Tokyo.

45
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.740
It wasn't too bad.

46
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.870
Are you kids all right? You're not too tired?

47
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.570
I'm totally fine.

48
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.960
I'm a little hungry, though.

49
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.710
Let's pick some wild plants today.

50
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.630
That's right.

51
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.590
Thank you for coming to meet
us today, Zenda-sensei.

52
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.730
You even brought a car.

53
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.940
It's fine.

54
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.650
My own elementary school used this
mountain for our own outdoor class.

55
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.400
It comes highly recommended.

56
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.400
Besides, I'm excited since this
is my last job as a teacher.

57
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.580
What? Your last job?

58
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.780
Are you quitting?

59
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.410
Yes. I'm actually getting married.

60
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.040
Actually, I already quit last week.

61
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.140
Congratulations.

62
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.720
Thank you.

63
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.210
Hey.

64
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.810
We're taking this car, right?

65
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.500
Can we get in?

66
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.170
Go ahead.

67
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.550
First.

68
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.530
Huh? There's something on the seat.

69
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.310
Looks like unassembled cardboard boxes.

70
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

71
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.940
I forgot that my cardboard moving
boxes were still in my car.

72
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.410
Would you mind putting them
up against the windows?

73
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.700
Okay.

74
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.740
Everyone's in, right?

75
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.620
Yup.

76
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.620
Then let's go.

77
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.090
I see.

78
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.140
Your school has first and second years
attend outdoor classes together.

79
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.460
Yes.

80
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.830
That's why we brought some children with
us today to check things out beforehand.

81
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.150
We wanted to see how they'd
respond to the location.

82
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.850
We chose five exceptionally precocious kids.

83
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.400
We chose five exceptionally precocious kids.
I'm so excited.

84
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.720
Me, too.

85
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.380
Me, too.
I see.

86
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.910
I see.

87
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.150
Anyway, isn't this way too much cardboard?

88
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.410
They're covering the rear windshield.

89
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.360
There're lots of expensive-looking houses.

90
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.830
They look like villas.

91
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.670
Yeah.

92
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.020
This area has a lot of vacation homes, huh?

93
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.920
Yes.

94
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.430
Although they have nothing
to do with us common folk.

95
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.460
Okay, you can get out now.

96
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.290
Okay.

97
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.750
It's so pretty!

98
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.340
The air here is nice, too.

99
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.380
I bet we'll be able to pick
lots of wild plants here.

100
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.390
Let's pick a whole bunch
and turn them into tempura.

101
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.700
Yeah.

102
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.400
Hold on.

103
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.610
As long as we're here,

104
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.520
why don't we take a photo
to commemorate the occasion?

105
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.270
Good idea.

106
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.660
Ready? What's one plus one?

107
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.160
Two.

108
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.140
We should probably have an
instructor assigned to each group.

109
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.050
Yes.

110
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.480
Maybe I got too excited.

111
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.990
I'm kind of thirsty.

112
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.920
Oh, right. I left the drinks
I brought in the car.

113
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.690
I'll go get them.

114
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.050
We'll help you.

115
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:36.310
No, we should have the children help.

116
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.080
Your name is Yoshida-san, right?

117
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.820
Could you help me get the drinks?

118
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.500
Yeah, sure.

119
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.500
All right, Yoshida-san.

120
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.520
Could you take this bag to the others?

121
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.510
Okay.

122
00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.060
Hup.

123
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.510
Zenda-sensei, what is it?

124
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.770
I think I dropped my earring.

125
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.770
See? This one.

126
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.930
I'll help you look for it.

127
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.420
Sorry about that. Thank you.

128
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.530
Ayumi's taking a long time.

129
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.490
What are she and Zenda-sensei doing?

130
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.910
I'm parched over here.

131
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.210
The direction of the wind suddenly changed.

132
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.020
This...

133
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.960
This smell...

134
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.100
Blood?

135
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.440
What is this?

136
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.200
He probably died about five or six hours ago.

137
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.110
Look.

138
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.610
There are tracks behind the tree
as though something was dragged.

139
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.120
This body wasn't here when
we got out of the car.

140
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:07.620
Someone must've moved the body here
while we were picking wild plants.

141
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.630
But who put it here, and why?

142
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.160
Hey, Conan.

143
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.080
What's the matter?

144
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.030
What happened?

145
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.970
No. You're kidding.

146
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.900
Darling. Darling!

147
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.840
Darling!

148
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.030
D-Darling?

149
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.360
The victim is Fukikoshi
Toji-san, 42 years old.

150
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.780
He's the president of a trendy IT company.

151
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.510
Is that correct?

152
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.340
Yes.

153
00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:58.560
Yes.
Yamamura Misao
Gunma Prefecture Division One Inspector

154
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.220
Yamamura Misao
Gunma Prefecture Division One Inspector
And you happened to be at the location
where the body was discovered,

155
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.880
And you happened to be at the location
where the body was discovered,

156
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.570
Zenda Maika-san, the victim's fiancée.

157
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:15.090
Yes. We were supposed to
get married next month.

158
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.690
Why did he have to die?!

159
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.530
Who would do something so awful?!

160
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.200
Please arrest his killer as soon as you can!

161
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.870
That's what you say now, but...

162
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.010
What?

163
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.860
Perhaps you changed your mind about marrying
him, killed him, and left the body here.

164
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.020
Maybe it was your plan to act surprised

165
00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:42.430
when the people you invited to
pick wild plants discovered him.

166
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.500
No...

167
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.260
That's not possible.

168
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.780
When we arrived, the body wasn't here.

169
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.400
Right, Wakasa-sensei?

170
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.600
Yes.

171
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.740
When we arrived, I believe we took a photo in
front of the car to commemorate the occasion.

172
00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.920
As long as we're here,

173
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.870
why don't we take a photo
to commemorate the occasion?

174
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.620
Good idea.

175
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.000
Ready? What's one plus one?

176
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.000
Two!

177
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.470
You can check the photo later.

178
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.810
But while all of you were distracted
by picking wild plants,

179
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.010
maybe she retrieved the
body she hid in the trees.

180
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.640
That's not possible.

181
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.390
Zenda-sensei was with us the whole time.

182
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.980
Really? The whole time?

183
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.060
Yeah.

184
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.520
Really really?

185
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.420
We went back to the car
together to get drinks.

186
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:50.160
She dropped her earring next to the car, so we
looked for it til our hands were covered in mud.

187
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.130
Right, Sensei?

188
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.040
Y-Yes.

189
00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.500
And besides, you always have
ridiculous things to say.

190
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.050
Please don't disrupt the investigation
with your crazy remarks again.

191
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.140
Shut up!

192
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.140
If you kids don't watch your tone,

193
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.530
even though you discovered the body,

194
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.020
I'll throw you out of the crime scene.

195
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.130
Sorry we don't know how
to keep our mouths shut.

196
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.910
You're right.

197
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.170
When you took this photo,
there wasn't a body here.

198
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.020
That's what we've been telling you.

199
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:49.870
Someone left the body next to that tree
while we were picking wild plants.

200
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.470
But there are a lot of similar
trees growing in this area.

201
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.600
Perhaps you initially parked your car
in a very similar-looking location.

202
00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.480
And while you were distracted,

203
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.740
she left the body here and moved the car.

204
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.530
I-I didn't do anything like that.

205
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.150
Maybe she did it when you went to get
drinks while picking wild plants.

206
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.840
I told you, I was with her
when we got the drinks.

207
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.120
Zenda-sensei didn't move the car.

208
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.830
And we didn't hear the sound of a car engine.

209
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.800
The only thing Zenda-sensei
did was open the rear door

210
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.130
and get the bags of drinks out of the car.

211
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.670
And besides, we didn't smell
anything when we got here.

212
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.430
That's right. When people die,
they produce a weird putrid smell.

213
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.140
Actually,

214
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.180
it depends on the specific
body and where it's left,

215
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.660
but generally corpses don't smell until
after two days during the summer,

216
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.320
or four days in the winter.

217
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.160
It doesn't smell right now, does it?

218
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.160
Now that you mention it, you're right.

219
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.500
You know a lot about corpses.

220
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.710
Oh, I saw it on a suspenseful
drama last night.

221
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.530
You mean "The Thunder God Murder," right?

222
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.470
The one where the horrible wife
electrocutes her husband to death.

223
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:13.970
I-Is that what happened?

224
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.350
Excuse me, Inspector Yamamura.

225
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.350
Did you find something?

226
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.280
I found a large quantity of business cards
inside the body's inside jacket pocket.

227
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.620
Well, of course he has some.

228
00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.920
After all, he was the
president of an IT company.

229
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.030
I'm sure he meets a lot of people.

230
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.620
We found several business
cards that aren't his own.

231
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.500
Large numbers of each, too.

232
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.000
What did you say?

233
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.040
Tadano Hajima
Usui Ruita

234
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.500
Tadano Hajima
Usui Ruita
Kogo Michio
Segawa Rikuaki

235
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.750
This is certainly odd.

236
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.880
Why was it necessary for him to carry
so many business cards that weren't his?

237
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.740
Maybe he was doing something

238
00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.520
that required him to change his name or
profession depending on who he was meeting.

239
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.580
Like a detective who assumes different
titles in order to acquire information,

240
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.530
or a spy who becomes other people
in order to blend in better.

241
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.200
Or a conman who assumes different identities
in order to fool people more easily.

242
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.200
A conman?

243
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.710
Could it be?

244
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.220
That's my phone.

245
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.900
Hello, this is Yamamura.

246
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.880
What? You identified the body from his face?

247
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.770
Marriage fraud?

248
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.500
Fukikoshi-san was committing marriage fraud?

249
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.310
Yes.

250
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.510
We sent the body's face to the Gunma
police headquarters, and we got a hit.

251
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.340
Wanted
For Fraud Committed
in a Broad Area
Uruma
Shigefumi
This man is a con artist who has
scammed women across the country
out of large sums of money.

252
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.610
Wanted
For Fraud Committed
in a Broad Area
Uruma
Shigefumi
This man is a con artist who has
scammed women across the country
out of large sums of money.
His real name was Uruma Shigefumi.

253
00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.000
Wanted
For Fraud Committed
in a Broad Area
Uruma
Shigefumi
This man is a con artist who has
scammed women across the country
out of large sums of money.
He committed numerous cases of
fraud in other prefectures, too.

254
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.830
Wanted
For Fraud Committed
in a Broad Area
Uruma
Shigefumi
This man is a con artist who has
scammed women across the country
out of large sums of money.
Apparently he was a wanted criminal.

255
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.000
In some ways, this was a good thing for you.

256
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.260
It happened before you got
married to a wanted man.

257
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.270
There's nothing good about this.

258
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.340
How much do you think I gave him?

259
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.710
When we went to buy this engagement ring,

260
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:26.100
he said he didn't have any
money on him, so I paid for it.

261
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.110
Really? That's unfortunate.

262
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.360
Something's definitely odd.

263
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.930
The dirty fingertips on her
left hand wearing the ring

264
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:41.370
can be explained by searching
for the earring she dropped.

265
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.100
But even though the fingertips on her
right hand aren't particularly dirty,

266
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.880
she's got dirt on the inside of her
arm all the way up to her elbow.

267
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.130
How did that happen?

268
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.720
Come to think of it, when we found the body,

269
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.180
Zenda-san and Ayumi-chan
were next to the car.

270
00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.630
They were both near the front tire.

271
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.090
What are you doing, Ayumi-chan?

272
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.820
I'm looking for a four-leaf clover.

273
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:18.740
A four-leaf clover?

274
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:28.210
Yeah. I found one earlier while looking for
Zenda-sensei's earring, right next to this tire.

275
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.830
I'll help you look for it.

276
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.290
Sorry about that. Thank you.

277
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.090
It's a four-leaf clover.

278
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.590
Yoshida-san?

279
00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.430
Did you find my earring?

280
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.420
No, not yet.

281
00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.260
Then could you look over there?

282
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.310
Okay.

283
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.760
Fine, then.

284
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.820
We'll help you look for it.

285
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.910
Let's all look for it together.

286
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.550
Thanks.

287
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:05.480
It's not here.

288
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.910
I can't find it either.

289
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:12.090
Are you sure it had four leaves?

290
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:15.300
Yeah. I know I saw it.

291
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.360
Why didn't you pick it when you found it?

292
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.930
I was busy looking for
Zenda-sensei's earring then.

293
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:31.440
Besides, don't they say carrying a four-leaf
clover is supposed to bring you good luck?

294
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.540
I suppose.

295
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.940
They do say that.

296
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.950
So I wanted to give it to Zenda-sensei.

297
00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:47.410
I'm sure she's shocked that the man
she was supposed to marry is dead.

298
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.170
And it sounds like he was a bad person,
and she seems really down about that.

299
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.670
So I wanted to cheer her up.

300
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.370
I see. It's like a good luck charm.

301
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.340
Then we've got to find it.

302
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.500
Don't get too excited and
accidentally step on it.

303
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.680
Yeah.

304
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.310
A good luck charm.

305
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.200
A good luck charm...

306
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.010
"A bishop on your own
side makes clever moves."

307
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.140
Will you still kill me regardless?

308
00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.800
That idiot...

309
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.320
Idiot...

310
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.480
Wakasa-sensei?

311
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.990
Are you all right, Wakasa-sensei?

312
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.240
Yes.

313
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.740
I've been feeling a bit anemic recently.

314
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.140
We did get up early this morning.

315
00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.980
She covered her eye just now.

316
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.580
Her right eye must be damaged.

317
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.840
Inspector.

318
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.970
Inspector Yamamura.

319
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:15.960
What is it?

320
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.950
We followed the tracks left
by the body was dragged.

321
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.800
It led us to a villa through the woods.

322
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.840
A villa?

323
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.600
Apparently it belonged to the murder victim.

324
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.100
What?

325
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.970
I-In any case, please come with me.

326
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.310
Okay.

327
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:53.480
Did someone really move the body
while we were picking wild plants?

328
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.260
The dirt on Zenda-san's right arm is odd.

329
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.880
As well as all the cardboard
boxes in her car.

330
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:16.600
And then there's the four-leaf
clover Ayumi-chan lost track of.
