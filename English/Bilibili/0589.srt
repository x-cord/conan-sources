By the way, Ran...

3
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:06,299
Yeah?

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,799
The long weekend is coming up, isn't it?

5
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:10,899
Let's see.

6
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:13,799
Monday the 11th is Health and Sports Day,

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,699
so it's a three-day weekend.

8
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:18,899
Why? Why? Are you taking us somewhere over the long weekend?

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,699
Nope, I was just asking.

10
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:23,199
Is that so?

11
00:00:24,799 --> 00:00:28,599
Hey, if we don't hurry, we're going to miss the raffle.

12
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,099
You're right.

13
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,399
If you're going to the raffle, take my wallet.

14
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,899
I've saved up quite a few raffle tickets.

15
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:37,299
Got it.

The birthday of the lady that Kogoro is not good at handling.

19
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,299
Kogoro's great present strategy.

20
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,999
He sees through the one and only truth.

It's true.

25
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:48,528
There are almost 20 raffle tickets in here.

26
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:50,628
I wonder what he bought.

27
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,428
Maybe the receipts are in his wallet?

28
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:55,428
I do see some receipts,

29
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:58,328
but they're all for the snacks to go with his beer.

30
00:02:58,328 --> 00:02:59,928
"Receipt" -Here it is.

31
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:01,328
50,000 yen!

32
00:03:02,628 --> 00:03:05,728
Beika Jewelry Shop... A necklace?

33
00:03:06,928 --> 00:03:08,428
Don't tell me that dad

34
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:11,628
is going around supporting some bar waitress?

35
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,528
Maybe it's a birthday present for someone.

36
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,528
Birthday? Mine's still way off.

37
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:22,128
If it's not for you, then it must be for...

38
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:26,728
That's it! October 10th is mom's birthday!

39
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:28,228
That must be it!

40
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:30,728
He was checking the date a while ago.

41
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:35,228
I bet dad must've remembered mom's birthday.

42
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,828
So do I.

43
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:40,228
Because you'd always mention it at school sports day as a child.

44
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:42,628
October 10th is my mom's birthday.

45
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:47,328
I'll win the first place and give her the red ribbon as present!

46
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,528
As you'd say.

47
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:54,328
So, did he give us his wallet and let us find the receipt

48
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,428
because he wants us to arrange a situation

49
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:58,828
that would make it easier for him to give mom the present?

50
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:02,228
Pretty smooth, Pops.

51
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:05,128
But, what should I do to ensure they meet each other?

52
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:08,028
As usual, you can invite them to have a meal together.

53
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,928
The usual way won't do. It has got to be special.

54
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:13,028
Then, how about something like that?

"1st Prize: Shizuoka Seaside Hotel Stay For Two"

56
00:04:15,828 --> 00:04:18,228

57
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,928
All right! Leave it to me.

58
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,928
What?

59
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:26,728
You won tickets for a free hotel stay?

60
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,728
Even better, it comes with an exquisite dinner!

61
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,928
What tremendous luck she has.

62
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:36,428
It seems all right to bring Conan along so long as I ask.

63
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:39,628
So the three of us will go this weekend, all right?

64
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:41,828
-Yeah. -Of course.

65
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:46,328
Be sure to bring everything you need.

66
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,128
All right.

"Law Eri Kisaki" -A hotel stay in Shizuoka next weekend?

68
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:55,928
Is this another scheme to pair me up with that mustached old man?

69
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,028
Bingo, exactly!

70
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:04,728
Sorry, but I have an appointment with someone for work next Monday.

71
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:07,228
Why do you think dad was able to get so many tickets

72
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,028
to win the hotel stay?

73
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:13,228
It's because he spent 50,000 yen to buy a necklace.

74
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:16,828
I bet it's a birthday present for someone.

75
00:05:16,828 --> 00:05:18,728
But I guess it's too bad.

76
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,228
It can't be helped if you already have an appointment.

77
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:23,228
Wait... Wait a second!

78
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:25,428
If it's Shizuoka we're talking about, it'll be perfect.

79
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:28,028
The person I'm meeting on Monday is from Shizuoka

80
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,528
and I was actually supposed to meet her there.

81
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:35,828
Then, we'll meet you next Sunday at Shizuoka Seaside Hotel.

82
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:44,228
Attorney, you're supposed to meet your client here, right?

83
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,528
Isn't it fine?

84
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:49,128
Since I'm taking the trouble to go and meet her personally.

00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:51,228
"10th October"

86
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,828
Well? I'm here at the hotel.

87
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:57,028
What should I do now?

88
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,928
Just relax for a bit before dinner time.

89
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:06,328
I think dad will give you the present before or right after the meal.

90
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:09,528
After that, maybe you two can spend the night together in his room.

91
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:13,328
The two of us? What will you be doing, then?

92
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:16,728
Conan and I will spend the night in your room.

93
00:06:16,728 --> 00:06:18,428
Right, Conan?

94
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:24,428
Looks like someone's here. I have to go.

95
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:26,428
Mom.

96
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,128
Happy birthday.

97
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:31,128
Thank you.

98
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:35,828
Oh, Mrs. Kokubu.

99
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,428
Our meeting was scheduled for tomorrow.

100
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:42,028
My husband came with me and we ended up having a fight.

101
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:44,228
"Akiho Kokubu (28), Client" -I'm sorry...

102
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:47,928
but do you mind if I stay here tonight?

103
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:51,928
I don't mind sleeping on the sofa.

104
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:55,428
But, prior to tomorrow's settlement negotiations,

105
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,728
wouldn't it be best if you discuss everything with your husband?

106
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:00,228
I already told you.

107
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:03,428
I don't want to stay near that dork.

108
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:08,128
But you're the one dealing with the stalker problem.

109
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,828
We need to talk over the amount of consolation money

110
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,928
as well as the terms for the out-of-court settlement.

111
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:21,428
Hello, this is Kisaki, the attorney speaking.

112
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:24,328
Is this Mrs. Akiho Kokubu's room?

113
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:27,528
Yes. This is Akiho's husband, Takehiko speaking.

114
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:30,728
A moment ago, your wife came to my room, Number 306,

115
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,628
and she has fallen asleep.

116
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:37,728
I'll be going out and won't return until 11.00 pm.

117
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:41,828
Would you mind coming by to get her at some point?

118
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,628
"Takehiko Kokubu (30)" -I think she'll cool off...

119
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,228
"Akiho's Husband" -after she's slept off her drunkenness.

120
00:07:46,228 --> 00:07:48,028
Yes, I understand.

121
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:53,528
Oh, my. Attorney.

122
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:58,928
I'm counting on you during tomorrow's negotiations.

123
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,928
"Midori Hino (51)" -Since it seems to be true that my son

124
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:03,028
"Opposing Party In The Negotiation" -has been following the woman,

125
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:06,328
we'll pay the extent of the settlement fee.

126
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:09,228
But this all started because that former race queen tricked

127
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:12,328
and toyed with my son's feelings.

128
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:15,428
I intend to give her a piece of my mind about it.

129
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,928
Well, let's talk about it tomorrow.

130
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:22,928
I take it that your son's not here with you, correct?

131
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:27,128
That's a requirement for our negotiation.

132
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:30,328
No, I didn't bring him.

133
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:34,628
But who knows whether he'd followed me here...

134
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:36,928
"Seiji Hino (26), Midori's Son" -on his own or not.

135
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:42,528
Geez! We haven't seen each other for so long.

136
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:45,728
Couldn't you wear something sexier than this?

137
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:49,428
Well, it seems you aren't surprised that I showed up here.

138
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,728
Yeah. Judging from the way Ran was talking,

139
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:55,628
I expected a certain old lady would be coming along.

140
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:59,828
Ran, apologies, but will it be all right if I leave now?

141
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,428
Now, now! Since all of us are already here,

142
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:05,728
let's just enjoy this exquisite dinner.

143
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:09,228
This old guy. Is he even planning to give her a present?

144
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:16,728
The food is really delicious, isn't it?

145
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:18,828
Yes, it really is.

146
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:21,428
It's totally different from someone's cooking.

147
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:27,628
That reminds me of the last time the three of us had a meal together.

148
00:09:27,628 --> 00:09:29,728
It was my birthday, wasn't it?

149
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:31,328
Right?

150
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:32,528
Yeah.

151
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:35,828
Was it?

152
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:44,628
Anyway, isn't this restaurant a little warm?

153
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:45,728
What's this?

154
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:49,028
Mom, you aren't wearing anything around your neck.

155
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:53,728
Yeah, I haven't found an accessory I like.

156
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:56,328
Why don't you try wearing a collar, then?

157
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,728
Just like the one your cat's wearing.

158
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:06,328
Bear with it. He says things like that, but I bet he's just teasing you

159
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:09,528
and waiting for the final moment of your birthday to give it to you.

160
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:16,828
Hey, dad.

161
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:20,528
He's passed out.

162
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:24,628
There's only an hour left of my birthday.

163
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:29,528
Sorry, but I'll head back to the room now.

164
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,128
Of course, I do mean my own room.

165
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:38,628
Gosh.

166
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:50,828
Looks like Mrs. Kokubu has left.

167
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,628
But what was all that about?

168
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:55,228
The necklace that man bought.

169
00:10:56,928 --> 00:11:00,528
Could it be that he's being duped by some woman?

170
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,328
Oh, goodness.

171
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,028
Looks like I don't have a choice.

172
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:15,628
Seriously, what a terrible birthday.

173
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:21,028
I'll ask again. Why should I apologize to her?

174
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,828
Because there's something you haven't given her.

175
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:28,028
It's all right. There are still three minutes left.

176
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:32,328
Huh? Is mom asleep?

177
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:34,728
Yes, who's there?

178
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,728
It's me. I've got something to tell you.

179
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:39,028
Can't it wait until tomorrow?

180
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:42,628
It has to be done today. Please let me in.

181
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,928
Gosh. What is it?

182
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,628
Why are you dressed like that, idiot?

183
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,828
I was taking a shower. Does that bug you?

184
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:56,828
Well? What do you want to talk about?

185
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:58,728
If it's about that mustached old man,

186
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:01,228
I have nothing to say.

187
00:12:06,628 --> 00:12:09,128
Mrs. Kokubu? Hang in there!

188
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:15,128
Mrs. Kokubu? Mrs. Kokubu!

189
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:28,834
The estimated time of death is between 10.00 pm and 11.00 pm.

190
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:31,334
Her death was caused by blunt force.

191
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:35,134
She was struck on the back of the head with a blunt object.

192
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:38,234
However, we have yet to locate the murder weapon.

193
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:42,434
So, are you and the victim acquainted?

194
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:44,734
Well, Attorney...

195
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,134
I'm Eri Kisaki.

196
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:50,134
She was a client of mine.

197
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:52,534
Her name is Akiho Kokubu.

198
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:54,734
She was dealing with a stalker problem.

199
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:55,934
We had planned to conduct

200
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:58,034
a settlement negotiation in this room tomorrow.

201
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,634
Why was she in your room?

202
00:13:00,634 --> 00:13:03,834
She was staying in this hotel with her husband,

203
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:06,934
and the two had a dispute around sundown.

204
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:10,634
That's when she said she wanted to stay in my room,

205
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:13,234
and she fell asleep here.

206
00:13:13,234 --> 00:13:17,034
Of course, I made a call to her husband who was in his room.

207
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,434
I told him I'd be out of the room until 11.00 pm

208
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:22,634
and asked him to pick her up when it was convenient for him.

209
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:26,134
And judging by the fact that she wasn't here

210
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:27,834
when I returned shortly after 11.00 pm,

211
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:31,334
I was fairly sure that her husband had come to get her.

212
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,634
Hold on a second, please!

213
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:35,934
Are you absolutely certain that there was nobody here

214
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:39,334
when you returned to this room?

215
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:41,134
Yes.

216
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:43,434
The door to this room is auto-locked.

217
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:46,634
Without the keycard, no one could've come in from outside!

218
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:51,134
Also, the window is designed so that no one can go through it.

219
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,334
There wasn't a body here when you came back to the room.

220
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,834
And yet, you claim that

221
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,834
a body suddenly appeared after you took a shower.

222
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,834
That makes this a locked room murder!

223
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:04,334
It's an impossible crime!

224
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:06,634
Or perhaps the truth is that you returned to the room

225
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:08,634
and had an argument with the victim.

226
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:12,634
Therefore, you killed her in a fit of anger.

227
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:13,734
What?

228
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:17,534
Then, while you were taking a shower to clean the blood on you,

229
00:14:17,534 --> 00:14:20,434
Mr. Mouri arrived.

230
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,734
If that was the case, wouldn't I have refused to let him in?

231
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:26,634
Precisely. Utilizing reverse psychology,

232
00:14:26,634 --> 00:14:31,034
you invited the great Detective Mouri inside.

233
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:34,934
It's all to make a simple crime appear impossible.

234
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,234
Listen...

235
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:41,634
Regardless, it's possible that you still have a weapon on you.

236
00:14:41,634 --> 00:14:43,634
I'll call a female officer to conduct a full body search.

237
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,534
That won't be necessary.

238
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:50,334
I already stripped her completely in the bathroom

239
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:52,434
and checked her thoroughly.

240
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:55,334
Strip... Stripped her completely?

241
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:56,734
Yeah.

242
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:58,734
She was only wearing a bath towel,

243
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,234
so that's all I had to remove.

244
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,834
No... What I'm saying is...

245
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,134
That's sexual harassment!

246
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:07,834
-It's fine. -What?

247
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,734
We're a married couple.

248
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,634
But we're living separately.

249
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,734
Married... A married couple?

250
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:16,934
But your name...

251
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:20,134
Kisaki is my mom's maiden name.

252
00:15:20,134 --> 00:15:23,534
She only uses it for professional purposes.

253
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:26,134
Oh, my. So you're his wife.

254
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,134
We finally got to meet each other.

255
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,434
Finally?

256
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:33,634
You see, every time Mr. Mouri is with a beautiful woman,

257
00:15:33,634 --> 00:15:37,334
I mistake the woman for his wife.

258
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:40,334
Idiot! You talk too much!

259
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:44,334
But in any case, your statement will be considered a family testimony

260
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:47,134
and can't be admitted into the investigation.

261
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:50,134
On the other hand, we'll have to consider the possibility

262
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:53,234
that you two conspired together to destroy any evidence.

263
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,234
Hey, hey, Yokomizo.

264
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,434
Because if that isn't the case,

265
00:15:57,434 --> 00:16:01,234
we can't really explain this locked room mystery.

266
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:05,234
There's even a blood stain over there.

267
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:08,834
Take a look at the bottom of the bed sheet.

268
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,934
Blood?

269
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:15,234
But why isn't there any blood on the carpet below?

270
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:17,534
Could it be that the bed was moved,

271
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,234
and that's why the blood stain is there?

272
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,534
It was done to hide the body.

273
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:22,734
That's possible.

274
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:25,434
The culprit concealed the body by moving the bed

275
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:28,734
and hid right beside the body.

276
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,934
And while I was taking a shower,

277
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:34,134
he moved the bed back into position to reveal the body,

278
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:37,334
and he escaped from this room unnoticed.

279
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:40,834
But if you hadn't taken a shower,

280
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,034
the culprit wouldn't have been able to use that trick.

281
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:48,234
Yeah, if you had gone to bed in a drooling mess as usual,

282
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:50,034
the culprit would have been all out of luck.

283
00:16:50,034 --> 00:16:54,334
Drooling? Aren't you talking about yourself?

284
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,934
That mess wasn't from drooling.

285
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,234
It was from coke, right?

286
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:01,534
See, there are spots on the carpet in front of the fridge

287
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,934
that seem to be coke stains.

288
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:07,234
And I can still see a pool of coke

289
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,134
on the lid of the can sitting on top of the fridge.

290
00:17:10,134 --> 00:17:12,234
-Is that true? -Yes.

291
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:14,434
I decided to drink it after I came back,

292
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,434
but it sprayed all over me.

293
00:17:18,134 --> 00:17:20,934
And I forgot I had put it on the refrigerator.

294
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:25,834
But don't you usually only drink water, tea or coffee?

295
00:17:25,834 --> 00:17:29,934
The only drink available inside was carbonated drink.

296
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:34,234
Anyway, if the body was hidden under the bed,

297
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:38,734
there must have been at least two culprits.

298
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,934
Why is that so?

299
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,534
It would be quite difficult for one person to lift

300
00:17:43,534 --> 00:17:46,234
and move something this heavy.

301
00:17:46,234 --> 00:17:49,434
There aren't any skid marks on the carpet either.

302
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:53,634
There are blood stains by the foot of the bed.

303
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:55,234
The large ones are most likely from the blood splattered

304
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:56,934
when the victim was struck.

305
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:58,834
But what's with these small ones in the foreground

306
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:03,034
that are equally spaced and gradually fade?

307
00:18:03,034 --> 00:18:05,334
Inspector Yokomizo!

308
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,234
We discovered that shortly before the time of the crime around 9:30 pm,

309
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:12,534
several calls were made to this room.

310
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:15,534
-Is that so? -Wasn't it the victim's husband...

311
00:18:15,534 --> 00:18:17,934
who was asked to come pick her up?

312
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:21,134
One of the calls was from the victim's Room 309,

313
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,134
so that must be true.

314
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,834
However, another call was made from Room 302.

315
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,534
Room 302?

316
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,434
It's Mrs. Hino's room.

317
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:30,934
You know that?

318
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,534
Yeah.

319
00:18:32,534 --> 00:18:36,534
She's the mother of the stalker I told you earlier.

320
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:40,234
But why would she call this room?

321
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:43,134
My wife was murdered?

322
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:45,734
Who... Who did it? And why?

323
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:48,534
We're currently investigating that.

324
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:53,134
But why didn't you pick your wife up?

325
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:56,734
I did call and say I'd pick her up,

326
00:18:56,734 --> 00:19:00,334
but she bellowed that she wouldn't let me in even if I came over.

327
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:03,834
That why despite feeling sorry to the attorney, I thought it'd be best

328
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:05,934
for her to keep my wife in her room for the night

329
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:09,934
so I could come by in the morning after she cooled down.

330
00:19:09,934 --> 00:19:12,234
What was the cause of your argument?

331
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,034
Well, it was...

332
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,834
Was it about this?

333
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:18,534
Conan.

334
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:23,934
It's a bunch of mini cars.

335
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:26,234
I've loved cars since I was a kid,

336
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,434
and lining them up helps me feel calm.

337
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:32,034
But how could this have caused the fight?

338
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,634
See.

339
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:36,734
The side mirror was tossed onto the floor.

340
00:19:36,734 --> 00:19:40,734
A man who loves cars wouldn't do something this violent, right?

341
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:42,534
So your wife did this?

342
00:19:42,534 --> 00:19:45,834
Yeah. She told me to quit this childish and disgusting hobby

343
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:47,334
and threw it.

344
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:51,534
Sir, which one of these cars is your favorite?

345
00:19:52,934 --> 00:19:57,734
It's the beloved car of the legendary actor, James Dean.

346
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,334
This Porsche.

347
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:05,334
By the way, was it only you and your wife in this room?

348
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:09,834
Yeah. I'd only let show this kind of hobby to my wife.

349
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,434
That woman was murdered?

350
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:17,934
Well, I've always figured one of the foolish men she deceived

351
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:21,634
would eventually kill her.

352
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,534
On that note, it's my understanding that you called the victim.

353
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:29,634
Yeah, I called the attorney to see

354
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:32,734
if we could slightly change the time of our negotiation tomorrow.

355
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:35,934
But I was shocked when that woman picked up the phone.

356
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,434
Why did you wish to change the time?

357
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:43,934
The golf appointment I had with a friend got moved up.

358
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:46,734
So you plan to play golf soon after

359
00:20:46,734 --> 00:20:48,334
your stalker son's settlement negotiations.

360
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,634
Why not?

361
00:20:49,634 --> 00:20:53,034
After all, there's a good golf course nearby.

362
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:56,534
By the way, are you staying in this room by yourself?

363
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:57,734
Yes, that right.

364
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,134
Can't you tell this is a single room?

365
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:04,234
There's another occupant in this room.

366
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:05,534
What?

367
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:09,534
There aren't lipstick marks on these cigarette butts.

368
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:14,334
And the filter is still damp.

369
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:16,134
It really is.

370
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:17,734
Is that right?

371
00:21:20,434 --> 00:21:22,134
That's enough, Seiji!

372
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:23,834
Get out here!

373
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:28,934
So that's your stalker son?

374
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:31,634
I told you that my son was only deceived.

375
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:36,334
But you were instructed not to bring your son here, were you not?

376
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:40,134
Well, he happened to be here

377
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:42,834
because he'll be touring with his friends

378
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,934
on their bikes tomorrow morning.

379
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,634
Then show us that bike.

380
00:21:47,734 --> 00:21:48,934
Right here.

381
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:53,334
Look.

382
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,534
A road bike?

383
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:01,634
But, why did you hide your son?

384
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:06,234
I thought that woman called the police to arrest my son, so...

385
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:10,034
Incidentally, please tell us your whereabouts and what you did

386
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:12,634
between 10.00 pm and 11.00 pm.

387
00:22:12,634 --> 00:22:14,634
I was drinking with my mom.

388
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:17,234
If you think we're lying, verify it yourself.

389
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:20,034
We were at the hotel lounge on the top floor.

390
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:26,834
Attorney Kisaki's client, Akiho Kokubu was murdered in her room.

391
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,734
There are three suspects.

392
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:32,234
Akiho's husband, Takehiko Kokubu.

393
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:35,734
The man who stalked Akiho, Seiji Hino.

394
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:38,634
And his mother, Midori Hino.

395
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:42,834
The person who murdered Akiho Kokubu

396
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:45,734
should be among these three people.

397
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,334
There's something under the pillow.

398
00:24:11,334 --> 00:24:13,334
A present?

399
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:17,034
You have to lower the expectation, then raise it for a surprise.

400
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:21,434
Why can't I find the key to solving this case

401
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:23,434
at such a critical moment?

402
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:25,234
Darn it.

403
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:28,234
Well, since this special day only comes once a year,

404
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,934
I'll let Pops show off this time.

405
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:35,534
Next Conan, "The Worst Birthday (Part 2)"

406
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:53,636
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,636
"Sports Day"

408
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:57,236
She became a suspect on her own birthday!

409
00:24:57,236 --> 00:24:58,836
Conan, hurry up and solve the case!

410
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:00,736
Got it... Me?
