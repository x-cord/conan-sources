1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.210
Conan, here goes!

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.710
"Naoko Kokubo"

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.010
Nice pass, Mitsuhiko!

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.710
Over here, this way!

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.210
Genta!

6
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.010
I got it!

7
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.710
Call the police!

8
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

9
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.810
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

10
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.610
The foul-mouthed myna bird

11
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.810
lets slip something unexpected.

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.610
He sees through the one and only truth.

13
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

14
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.410
His name is Detective Conan!

15
00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:32.868
"The Foul-Mouthed Myna Bird"

16
00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:41.468
Did the victim have a pet bird?

17
00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:42.768
Yes.

18
00:02:42.768 --> 00:02:44.568
A myna bird.

19
00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:48.568
From the looks of this bird cage...

20
00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:51.468
Yes. And since that window was opened...

21
00:02:51.468 --> 00:02:54.268
It must've fled outside.

22
00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:55.668
Hello.

23
00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:57.968
Is this the Kokubo residence?

24
00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:00.568
This is the Midoridai Ekimae Police Station calling.

25
00:03:00.568 --> 00:03:05.168
Your pet Myna bird, Nine, is here at the station.

26
00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:06.668
I see.

27
00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:08.568
So your name's Nine?

28
00:03:08.568 --> 00:03:11.368
Your name's Santaro the Great Dunce, right?

29
00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:12.968
What?

30
00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:14.868
I'm Kogoro Mouri!

31
00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:17.768
Come on, don't pick a fight with a myna bird.

32
00:03:17.768 --> 00:03:20.468
What? She was killed?

33
00:03:20.468 --> 00:03:21.668
Mrs. Kokubo?

34
00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.568
You fool, idiot, imbecile, stu...

35
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:27.068
It flew away.

36
00:03:30.368 --> 00:03:34.268
Mr. Mouri, are you the one who caught the myna bird?

37
00:03:34.268 --> 00:03:36.468
We were just looking for it.

38
00:03:36.468 --> 00:03:38.368
Will you bring it over?

39
00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:40.768
What? You let it go?

40
00:03:40.768 --> 00:03:43.368
You idiot! You don't have to come!

41
00:03:45.968 --> 00:03:48.368
Even the Inspector called me an idiot.

42
00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:52.968
What seems to be the matter?

43
00:03:54.068 --> 00:03:55.968
He sprained his ankle while drinking

44
00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.268
and today we were on the way to the hospital.

45
00:03:58.268 --> 00:04:02.168
I told you, I don't need to go to the hospital...

46
00:04:04.568 --> 00:04:05.868
See?

47
00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:08.768
Excuse me.

48
00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:13.068
Apparently, that young man is Mrs. Kokubo's nephew.

49
00:04:13.068 --> 00:04:15.168
She was always angry

50
00:04:15.168 --> 00:04:17.968
because he always asked for allowance.

51
00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:20.468
But she used to always smile

52
00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.768
and watch us even when we were noisy.

53
00:04:22.768 --> 00:04:24.068
How sad that she passed away.

54
00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:32.368
"Mamoru Kokubo (30)"

55
00:04:32.368 --> 00:04:35.568
The man who came to visit the victim

56
00:04:35.568 --> 00:04:38.268
is the person who discovered the corpse.

57
00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:41.368
Yes. The ones who were living in this house

58
00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:46.368
were the victim and the live-in house maid, Emi Yahagi.

59
00:04:46.368 --> 00:04:49.968
And where is that house maid right now?

60
00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:51.768
According to a housewife living in the neighborhood,

61
00:04:51.768 --> 00:04:53.868
she always goes shopping at this time

62
00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:56.668
because it's the victim's afternoon nap.

63
00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:00.568
It's a daily routine that is repeated every day.

64
00:05:00.568 --> 00:05:03.168
But it's way past 2:00 already.

65
00:05:04.268 --> 00:05:07.168
How was the relationship between the victim and Ms. Emi Yahagi?

66
00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:09.668
There are no bad rumor about them.

67
00:05:09.668 --> 00:05:12.568
But it seems that Ms. Emi Yahagi's mother

68
00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:14.868
was sick for a long time,

69
00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:17.868
so Emi was asking for a raise in pay.

70
00:05:20.268 --> 00:05:23.668
There are no traces of intrusion from the outside?

71
00:05:26.168 --> 00:05:28.268
The kitchen door is a semi-auto lock

72
00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:30.368
and that door was locked.

73
00:05:30.368 --> 00:05:32.068
There are two keys.

74
00:05:32.068 --> 00:05:35.368
The victim and Ms. Emi Yahagi had one each.

75
00:05:35.368 --> 00:05:37.968
It seems like the keys cannot be duplicated.

76
00:05:37.968 --> 00:05:41.168
So the only place to go in and out of here is the front entrance.

77
00:05:41.168 --> 00:05:44.168
Is her nephew, Mamoru Kokubo, a student?

78
00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:47.868
No, he's studying juvenile literature or something.

79
00:05:47.868 --> 00:05:50.468
In other words, he's still unemployed.

80
00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:52.268
What time was the victim found?

81
00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.368
13:55.

82
00:05:54.368 --> 00:05:57.068
What? That's rather accurate.

83
00:05:57.068 --> 00:05:58.768
Did he say so?

84
00:05:58.768 --> 00:06:01.968
No, the elementary school students said so.

85
00:06:01.968 --> 00:06:03.368
Elementary school students?

86
00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:04.668
Are you sure they're reliable?

87
00:06:04.668 --> 00:06:06.268
Yes, we are!

88
00:06:07.568 --> 00:06:10.168
Don't underestimate kids!

89
00:06:12.168 --> 00:06:15.168
See, Inspector.

90
00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:16.668
I see.

91
00:06:18.168 --> 00:06:20.168
Nine escaped.

92
00:06:20.168 --> 00:06:23.068
You know that myna bird, too?

93
00:06:23.068 --> 00:06:24.068
Yes.

94
00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:26.668
Because rude Nine was notorious.

95
00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:33.268
No! It's my fault that the window is opened.

96
00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:42.268
I'm sorry!

97
00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:47.468
I see. The myna bird flew away from there.

98
00:06:47.468 --> 00:06:51.668
We were playing at the park in front of the entrance.

99
00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:53.868
Nobody seems to have gone in or out of the house

100
00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:57.168
after Ms. Emi Yahagi left the house.

101
00:06:57.168 --> 00:06:58.168
Yes.

102
00:06:59.468 --> 00:07:02.268
"Emi Yahagi (18)" -Gosh.

103
00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:09.368
Madam...

104
00:07:10.368 --> 00:07:11.968
You ran into an abandoned baby

105
00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:14.168
and went looking for the baby's mother?

106
00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:17.168
Yes, the baby was asleep in the stroller.

107
00:07:17.168 --> 00:07:19.068
And what happened to the mother?

108
00:07:19.068 --> 00:07:22.568
Two girls that passed by found her for me.

109
00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:25.568
It seems like she was going after her hat that flew away.

110
00:07:25.568 --> 00:07:29.968
You were late because you were watching the baby in the stroller?

111
00:07:29.968 --> 00:07:33.468
I was worried that madam would scold me, though.

112
00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:36.068
I didn't expect this to happen.

113
00:07:36.068 --> 00:07:40.068
The problem is whether you can prove your story or not.

114
00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:41.068
What?

115
00:07:41.068 --> 00:07:42.768
You are the only one besides the victim

116
00:07:42.768 --> 00:07:45.668
who has the key to the kitchen door.

117
00:07:45.668 --> 00:07:48.068
You could've secretly returned to the house and killed her

118
00:07:48.068 --> 00:07:51.468
and gone back to shopping afterwards.

119
00:07:51.468 --> 00:07:53.068
I didn't do it!

120
00:07:53.068 --> 00:07:55.768
What is the name of the baby's mother?

121
00:07:55.768 --> 00:07:58.068
Well, I don't know because I didn't ask.

122
00:07:58.068 --> 00:07:59.768
Then what about the girls?

123
00:07:59.768 --> 00:08:01.068
I didn't...

124
00:08:01.068 --> 00:08:02.968
You didn't get their names?

125
00:08:04.468 --> 00:08:06.168
If I knew, I would've told you!

126
00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:09.168
Inspector Megure!

127
00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:12.768
Pops Kogoro!

128
00:08:12.768 --> 00:08:14.068
Conan?

129
00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:17.468
What are you kids doing here?

130
00:08:17.468 --> 00:08:18.868
Mr. Sayama?

131
00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:20.368
Well, hello.

132
00:08:20.368 --> 00:08:22.168
What a terrible thing to have happened.

133
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:26.068
Madam was enraged that you sold her a forgery.

134
00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:28.668
Who is he?

135
00:08:28.668 --> 00:08:31.768
"Yotaro Sayama (60)" -He's Mr. Sayama, the owner of an antique shop.

136
00:08:31.768 --> 00:08:33.568
I met him at the hospital.

137
00:08:34.568 --> 00:08:36.668
Please don't push yourself too far.

138
00:08:36.668 --> 00:08:39.768
I'll give you a prescription right away.

139
00:08:39.768 --> 00:08:41.468
Doctor.

140
00:08:41.468 --> 00:08:43.668
What seems to be the matter, Mr. Sayama?

141
00:08:43.668 --> 00:08:46.868
Isn't there anything you can do so I can drive?

142
00:08:46.868 --> 00:08:49.468
I can't work like this.

143
00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:52.668
No way. You'll have to wait at least three more days.

144
00:08:56.968 --> 00:08:57.968
"Haido Hospital"

145
00:08:57.968 --> 00:08:59.668
Is that the one we just saw a while ago?

146
00:08:59.668 --> 00:09:03.568
That's a crow, not a myna bird.

147
00:09:03.568 --> 00:09:05.268
Myna bird?

148
00:09:05.268 --> 00:09:08.968
You mean the one that's flying around pulling the red yarn along?

149
00:09:08.968 --> 00:09:13.668
I just thought it was Mrs. Kokubo's myna bird.

150
00:09:15.468 --> 00:09:16.968
What is it?

151
00:09:16.968 --> 00:09:20.768
I see. Of course, you haven't heard.

152
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.068
What?

153
00:09:22.768 --> 00:09:26.768
I brought him because he seemed to know the victim.

154
00:09:26.768 --> 00:09:28.068
Despite what he says,

155
00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:30.568
he just wants to stick his nose in the case.

156
00:09:30.568 --> 00:09:32.968
But I think he was right

157
00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:34.668
to have brought that person here.

158
00:09:34.668 --> 00:09:35.868
What?

159
00:09:35.868 --> 00:09:39.468
Madam used to collect rare old books.

160
00:09:39.468 --> 00:09:42.568
But the book that she bought from Mr. Sayama...

161
00:09:42.568 --> 00:09:45.868
No. As to that, I was also deceived.

162
00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:48.668
That's why I immediately told her the truth.

163
00:09:48.668 --> 00:09:52.068
But you didn't pay her back yet, did you?

164
00:09:53.568 --> 00:09:56.268
I heard just before I left the house.

165
00:09:57.268 --> 00:10:00.768
Madam, would you like me to put the potted flower plant outside

166
00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:02.768
back into the kitchen?

167
00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:03.968
"Naoko Kokubo (70)"

168
00:10:03.968 --> 00:10:06.068
You can do that later.

169
00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:08.668
Enough of your excuses already, Mr. Sayama!

170
00:10:09.568 --> 00:10:11.368
It's this late already.

171
00:10:11.368 --> 00:10:14.468
Come here immediately and give me back my money!

172
00:10:16.168 --> 00:10:17.268
I feel sorry for him.

173
00:10:18.168 --> 00:10:21.768
I can't raise money with this kind of injury.

174
00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:23.768
Enough of your excuses.

175
00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:26.868
In other words, are you saying that you can't pay her back?

176
00:10:26.868 --> 00:10:30.668
You get angry just like Madam, little Emi.

177
00:10:30.668 --> 00:10:33.168
Don't call me little!

178
00:10:33.168 --> 00:10:36.068
Inspector! We got a report from forensics.

179
00:10:37.068 --> 00:10:40.168
There is an apparent strangulation mark on the neck of the victim.

180
00:10:41.368 --> 00:10:44.068
The murder weapon was the white shawl

181
00:10:44.068 --> 00:10:46.668
that the victim was wearing around her neck.

182
00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:52.268
The estimated time of murder is between 12:55 and 13:55.

183
00:10:52.268 --> 00:10:58.168
No, the actual time of murder is between 13:35 to 13:55.

184
00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.368
I have to go to the restroom.

185
00:11:01.368 --> 00:11:03.568
Come right back, okay?

186
00:11:03.568 --> 00:11:04.568
Sure thing.

187
00:11:05.468 --> 00:11:07.168
Excuse me.

188
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.768
What is the function of this room?

189
00:11:10.768 --> 00:11:13.868
Yes. This was my aunt's office.

190
00:11:13.868 --> 00:11:16.068
She used to write children stories.

191
00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:18.468
It was a long time ago, though.

192
00:11:24.668 --> 00:11:27.368
All these books are written by Mrs. Naoko Kokubo?

193
00:11:30.668 --> 00:11:33.568
I knew that her name sounded familiar.

194
00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.768
If I remember correctly, she stopped writing because of a scandal.

195
00:11:36.768 --> 00:11:38.768
I see. Thank you.

196
00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:42.168
Mr. Sayama was seen talking on his cell phone

197
00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:48.068
in front of Midoridai Station at 12:55.

198
00:11:48.068 --> 00:11:50.468
It matches Ms. Yahagi's testimony.

199
00:11:50.468 --> 00:11:51.868
How long does it take from the station to here?

200
00:11:51.868 --> 00:11:54.568
Since there is no evidence that a cab was used,

201
00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:57.168
I'm sure it took at least 45 minutes on foot.

202
00:11:58.068 --> 00:11:59.168
Excuse me.

203
00:12:00.768 --> 00:12:02.368
Yes?

204
00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:03.768
What?

205
00:12:03.768 --> 00:12:06.568
Gosh. What's this party for?

206
00:12:06.568 --> 00:12:08.668
You're the children I met a while ago!

207
00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:11.468
Wait. You work as a maid here?

208
00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:13.768
Yes!

209
00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:15.068
Nine is with you, too?

210
00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.468
We knew he belonged here because he's so famous.

211
00:12:17.468 --> 00:12:18.868
Thank you!

212
00:12:20.768 --> 00:12:24.468
Conan and his friends can be the witnesses for Mamoru Kokubo,

213
00:12:24.468 --> 00:12:26.668
but what about Mr. Sayama's?

214
00:12:26.668 --> 00:12:29.468
We've got the victim's incoming call history

215
00:12:29.468 --> 00:12:34.068
from 12:50 to 13:35.

216
00:12:34.068 --> 00:12:35.868
It sure is a long conversation.

217
00:12:35.868 --> 00:12:38.568
So he went to the hospital after that.

218
00:12:38.568 --> 00:12:40.468
I wonder if he could've committed the crime?

219
00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:44.368
The hospital is about halfway between here and the station.

220
00:12:45.468 --> 00:12:47.868
After Mr. Sayama called from the station,

221
00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:52.268
he headed for Mrs. Kokubo's residence and killed her.

222
00:12:52.268 --> 00:12:54.468
And if he were to head for the hospital after that,

223
00:12:54.468 --> 00:12:59.368
the time of murder and Mr. Mouri's testimony don't match.

224
00:12:59.368 --> 00:13:01.868
The answer is clear.

225
00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:06.568
The only one without a witness for her alibi is Ms. Emi Yahagi.

226
00:13:06.568 --> 00:13:08.668
This time,

227
00:13:08.668 --> 00:13:11.968
I guess the Sleeping Kogoro won't be needed.

228
00:13:23.235 --> 00:13:26.635
They all have alibis?

229
00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:30.535
Yes! I'll be witness to testimony anytime!

230
00:13:30.535 --> 00:13:33.035
Was that an inconvenience?

231
00:13:33.035 --> 00:13:35.935
Why don't you go hang yourself with spaghetti?

232
00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:44.135
Go bash your head against the corner of a block of tofu and die!

233
00:13:45.735 --> 00:13:47.035
Rude bird!

234
00:13:52.435 --> 00:13:55.935
I wonder why Nine has such a foul mouth?

235
00:13:55.935 --> 00:13:59.035
Nine let us catch him without putting up a fight a while ago.

236
00:13:59.035 --> 00:14:01.135
He's domesticated and clever,

237
00:14:01.135 --> 00:14:05.135
but all the words he's been taught are foul.

238
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:07.735
He could've been influenced by Madam.

239
00:14:07.735 --> 00:14:10.535
She was betrayed by the Sensei that she trusted

240
00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:13.435
and ended up not being able to trust anybody.

241
00:14:13.435 --> 00:14:16.235
That's why she figured all compliments were lies.

242
00:14:16.235 --> 00:14:21.435
To her, bad mouthing was more trustable.

243
00:14:21.435 --> 00:14:22.635
You mean the scandal of

244
00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:25.535
when Mrs. Kokubo plagiarized the work of her Sensei.

245
00:14:25.535 --> 00:14:30.135
But according to insiders, it was the other way around.

246
00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:32.735
Madam isn't the one who plagiarized.

247
00:14:32.735 --> 00:14:35.635
It was Sensei who couldn't come up with an idea.

248
00:14:35.635 --> 00:14:39.135
But the media favored the great writer

249
00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:41.535
and wouldn't listen to Madam's story.

250
00:14:42.735 --> 00:14:45.535
They're all blind.

251
00:14:45.535 --> 00:14:48.535
Well, it's the usual.

252
00:14:48.535 --> 00:14:53.535
Who of the three murdered Naoko?

253
00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:59.335
That's why she told me to stop being a writer.

254
00:14:59.335 --> 00:15:02.735
But Mamoru, she used to always tell me

255
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:08.235
that one day, you would become successful.

256
00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:15.735
I see.

257
00:15:17.435 --> 00:15:20.235
What? That potted plant...

258
00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:24.335
This...

259
00:15:24.335 --> 00:15:27.235
Did you put this inside for me, Mamoru?

260
00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:29.335
No, I didn't.

261
00:15:29.335 --> 00:15:31.335
I see.

262
00:15:31.335 --> 00:15:34.935
Hey, how bad were granny's legs?

263
00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:38.435
She told me that she could barely ride the wheelchair.

264
00:15:38.435 --> 00:15:41.235
I can't stand the stench. It stinks.

265
00:15:41.235 --> 00:15:43.235
Stink?

266
00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:44.735
Is it about the perp?

267
00:15:44.735 --> 00:15:47.135
Who knows?

268
00:15:47.135 --> 00:15:49.035
Nine's only a bird.

269
00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:51.335
I want eels over rice.

270
00:15:53.835 --> 00:15:55.735
I'm hungry.

271
00:15:55.735 --> 00:15:57.735
He's mimicking me.

272
00:16:00.735 --> 00:16:04.035
Come to think of it, what is this yarn for?

273
00:16:04.035 --> 00:16:06.235
Madam put it on this morning

274
00:16:06.235 --> 00:16:09.135
so that he would be easily visible even if he flew off again.

275
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:11.035
It sure does stand out.

276
00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:15.535
Because Mr. Sayama also said the bird is pulling the red yarn.

277
00:16:16.535 --> 00:16:20.635
Hey. Is there anything that smells in this house?

278
00:16:20.635 --> 00:16:23.635
If you're referring to pickled vegetables, there are all kinds.

279
00:16:23.635 --> 00:16:25.835
Because it was aunt's hobby.

280
00:16:25.835 --> 00:16:29.235
I don't smell anything, though.

281
00:16:29.235 --> 00:16:31.235
It's because it's being made in the basement.

282
00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:32.935
Where is that?

283
00:16:35.135 --> 00:16:37.035
Over here.

284
00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:38.435
Did you find something?

285
00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:46.035
I can't stand the stench. It stinks.

286
00:16:47.735 --> 00:16:49.935
So that's the story after all!

287
00:16:53.335 --> 00:16:55.535
Rude bird!

288
00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:57.835
He doesn't look like he's going to sleep.

289
00:16:59.335 --> 00:17:00.635
Excuse me.

290
00:17:03.735 --> 00:17:06.835
Inspector! Mr. Mouri is...

291
00:17:06.835 --> 00:17:08.635
We've been waiting for this.

292
00:17:08.635 --> 00:17:12.235
Everyone, thanks for waiting.

293
00:17:12.235 --> 00:17:15.235
This case was indeed a difficult one.

294
00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:20.535
Because all three suspects have an alibi.

295
00:17:20.535 --> 00:17:25.235
But there's just one person whose alibi cannot be established.

296
00:17:25.235 --> 00:17:27.635
Alibi that cannot be established?

297
00:17:27.635 --> 00:17:29.935
Whose alibi is that?

298
00:17:29.935 --> 00:17:33.435
The owner of Sayama Bookshop,

299
00:17:33.435 --> 00:17:36.035
Mr. Yotaro Sayama.

300
00:17:36.035 --> 00:17:38.035
What do you think you're saying?

301
00:17:38.035 --> 00:17:42.335
You're the one who established my alibi.

302
00:17:42.335 --> 00:17:44.735
Then let me ask you.

303
00:17:44.735 --> 00:17:47.435
It seems that you saw the myna bird

304
00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:49.235
with the red yarn attached to it.

305
00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:50.535
I did. So?

306
00:17:50.535 --> 00:17:52.935
Nine left the leg ring with the red yarn on it

307
00:17:52.935 --> 00:17:55.935
back at the police station when he flew away.

308
00:17:55.935 --> 00:17:57.635
When did you see the myna bird

309
00:17:57.635 --> 00:18:00.735
with the red yarn attached to it?

310
00:18:00.735 --> 00:18:03.735
That's right. Dad, you're fantastic.

311
00:18:03.735 --> 00:18:06.335
I saw it on the way to the hospital!

312
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.635
The myna bird was flying with a red yarn attached to it!

313
00:18:09.635 --> 00:18:13.635
I see. But how could you tell

314
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:17.835
that it was a red yarn and not a red string?

315
00:18:17.835 --> 00:18:19.435
It seems that the victim

316
00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:22.635
had attached the yarn to Nine just this morning.

317
00:18:22.635 --> 00:18:26.435
I guess... I just happened to misuse the word.

318
00:18:26.435 --> 00:18:28.335
But Mr. Mouri,

319
00:18:28.335 --> 00:18:33.335
Mr. Sayama was witnessed at 12:55 at Midoridai Station.

320
00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:37.735
If he came here after he talked to Naoko at 13:55

321
00:18:37.735 --> 00:18:40.635
as we can see on his incoming call history and killed her,

322
00:18:40.635 --> 00:18:43.235
it would've been impossible for him

323
00:18:43.235 --> 00:18:45.335
to meet Mr. Mouri at the hospital.

324
00:18:45.335 --> 00:18:50.235
What if Mr. Sayama took the call he got from the victim

325
00:18:50.235 --> 00:18:54.235
and talked to her while moving along?

326
00:18:55.835 --> 00:18:58.435
The victim told him to come immediately on the phone.

327
00:18:58.435 --> 00:19:01.335
He did as he was told. That's all there is to it.

328
00:19:01.335 --> 00:19:02.935
I see.

329
00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:04.435
By the time he finished talking on the phone,

330
00:19:04.435 --> 00:19:07.235
he was already at this house.

331
00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:11.035
But he couldn't have used the front door,

332
00:19:11.035 --> 00:19:13.935
based on Conan and his friends' testimonies.

333
00:19:13.935 --> 00:19:17.335
If so, how on earth did he get into house?

334
00:19:17.335 --> 00:19:19.435
The kitchen door.

335
00:19:19.435 --> 00:19:21.535
It should've been locked, though?

336
00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:24.835
The one who opened the door was the victim,

337
00:19:24.835 --> 00:19:27.035
Mrs. Naoko Kokubo herself.

338
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:29.035
What?

339
00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:31.635
The potted flower plant is the proof.

340
00:19:31.635 --> 00:19:34.535
That's why it was moved over.

341
00:19:35.235 --> 00:19:37.935
The victim who called you to come through the kitchen door

342
00:19:37.935 --> 00:19:40.935
told you to move the potted flower plant at the back door inside

343
00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:42.735
since you were there, anyway.

344
00:19:43.935 --> 00:19:45.435
I see.

345
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:47.835
After committing the crime, going out was easy

346
00:19:47.835 --> 00:19:50.535
because the door is semi-automatic.

347
00:19:50.535 --> 00:19:53.635
All you had to do was push the button to lock the door,

348
00:19:53.635 --> 00:19:55.335
Mr. Sayama.

349
00:19:55.335 --> 00:19:57.535
But look at me!

350
00:19:57.535 --> 00:20:00.435
I can't use my right hand!

351
00:20:00.435 --> 00:20:02.135
Right?

352
00:20:02.135 --> 00:20:04.035
I couldn't have done it.

353
00:20:04.035 --> 00:20:07.035
You heard what the doctor told me, didn't you?

354
00:20:07.035 --> 00:20:09.135
I did.

355
00:20:09.135 --> 00:20:11.735
That was your last resort.

356
00:20:13.235 --> 00:20:15.935
Then let me ask you again.

357
00:20:15.935 --> 00:20:21.135
You're the one that said this room stinks, right?

358
00:20:22.435 --> 00:20:26.035
Clever Nine mimicked even your tone of voice.

359
00:20:26.035 --> 00:20:29.935
Then what on earth smelled so bad?

360
00:20:29.935 --> 00:20:31.835
Conan, are you there?

361
00:20:31.835 --> 00:20:32.835
I'm here!

362
00:20:35.835 --> 00:20:38.335
I got it. I'll try.

363
00:20:47.235 --> 00:20:48.435
All done!

364
00:20:51.635 --> 00:20:53.235
In other words,

365
00:20:53.235 --> 00:20:56.235
this is how you choked and killed her using one hand.

366
00:21:30.935 --> 00:21:32.735
She was crazy.

367
00:21:32.735 --> 00:21:36.135
"But paying me back isn't enough."

368
00:21:36.135 --> 00:21:38.735
"Post a notice of apology on the door of you shop."

369
00:21:38.735 --> 00:21:41.535
"Publish an apology in the papers."

370
00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:44.635
"Go the basement and stir the pickled vegetables."

371
00:21:45.635 --> 00:21:48.335
I couldn't take it anymore!

372
00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:54.135
We'll hear you out at the station.

373
00:23:26.235 --> 00:23:29.835
She wrote such beautiful stories and yet...

374
00:23:29.835 --> 00:23:32.235
I couldn't imagine

375
00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:36.235
that she had such a frightening side to her.

376
00:23:36.235 --> 00:23:37.435
In other words,

377
00:23:37.435 --> 00:23:39.735
women are not what they look on the outside, right?

378
00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:45.335
Conan.

379
00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:55.535
"Next Episode"

380
00:23:55.535 --> 00:23:57.335
Traitors...

381
00:24:05.135 --> 00:24:07.935
shall be punished.

382
00:24:13.835 --> 00:24:16.635
So you came too,

383
00:24:16.635 --> 00:24:18.335
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

384
00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:24.235
Next Conan, "The Traitor's Stage (Part 1)"

385
00:24:25.178 --> 00:24:27.878
Next Conan's Hint:

386
00:24:27.878 --> 00:24:29.478
"Rope"

387
00:24:29.478 --> 00:24:30.978
-Myna bird. -Myna bird...

388
00:24:30.978 --> 00:24:32.378
-Traitor. -Traitor...

389
00:24:32.378 --> 00:24:34.378
You're just parroting each other.
