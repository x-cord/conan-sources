1
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:07,424
As times change,
difficult cases increase in number!

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,925
Today's stage is a coffee shop!

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,177
Is a customer to blame?!

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,513
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,390
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,309
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,076
The Coffee Shop Murder Case.

8
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,256
Where are you going,
Ran-neechan?

9
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:13,340
Conan-kun!

10
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,510
Are you going to the movies?
I wanna come too!

11
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,762
No! I have a date!

12
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:19,680
A date?

13
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,015
With Shinichi!

14
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,017
Oh, with Shinichi?

15
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:26,729
Dad would get mad
if he found out,

16
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,272
so keep it a secret, okay?

17
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,690
Sure! Have fun!

18
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:37,239
Ran sure is dressed up...

19
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,784
Is she really that happy
to go on a date with me?

20
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,162
She can't do that!

21
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:45,247
I'm Kudo Shinichi!

22
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,875
Then who is she going out with?!

23
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,793
Why would she lie like that?!

24
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:55,257
I sound stupid.

25
00:02:55,257 --> 00:02:58,969
Ran can go out
with whoever she wants...

26
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,312
Didn't I tell you
I was going on a date today?

27
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:10,648
Why did you follow me?

28
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:14,902
I wanted to see Shinichi too!

29
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:18,030
But he sure is late...

30
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,618
The truth is, the person coming
isn't actually Shinichi--

31
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:28,415
Eh? Then who
are you really meeting?

32
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:30,209
Well?

33
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:34,797
Somebody really dear to me,
I guess you can say!

34
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,009
Even more so than Shinichi?

35
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,346
Don't be silly!
I can't compare the two!

36
00:03:42,346 --> 00:03:44,890
Say, can't you go home now?

37
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:48,852
I suddenly don't
feel like going home...

38
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:52,106
I know! You like cake, don't you?

39
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,024
I'll go buy you some now,

40
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:56,819
so be a good boy
and take them home!

41
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,363
Sorry, I'll be right back!

42
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,280
Sure!

43
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,825
It's pointless, Ran.

44
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,369
With my powers of
perception and deduction,

45
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:10,291
I'll figure out exactly who it is you're
meeting and get a good look at 'em!

46
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:16,213
'Cuz there's always only one truth!

47
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,674
Welcome!

48
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,509
Oh, it's just a woman.

49
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,929
Are you by yourself?
If so, then please sit--

50
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:24,763
Miss!

51
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:27,308
Coffee.

52
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:27,933
Huh?

53
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:31,395
Haven't you ever heard of coffee?!
Go get me some!

54
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:34,523
Talk about a bad attitude!

55
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:37,318
Oh? She's fixated on her watch.

56
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,236
Could it be her?

57
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:42,781
Yeah, right. After all...

58
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,242
It's somebody really dear to me!

59
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,660
...so I doubt it.

60
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:50,748
Welcome! Are you by yourself?

61
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,415
If so...

62
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:55,461
I, uh, have a paper
I have to write...

63
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,588
I'd like a quiet seat, if possible...

64
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,173
A college student...

65
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,342
I don't think it's him, either...

66
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,634
Cafe au lait, please...

67
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:04,928
Nobody would write a paper

68
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,639
in front of a
person they're meeting...

69
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,101
A lady this time...

70
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,603
Welcome!

71
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:17,316
I'm meeting someone,
but they don't seem to be here yet...

72
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,447
May I get you something?

73
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:27,409
Kisaki Eri (37)
- I guess I'll have some coffee.

74
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:30,371
Man, she's pretty!

75
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:35,584
A law office?
Is she an attorney?

76
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:38,337
Ran wouldn't be
meeting with a lawyer.

77
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:42,091
Yikes! I got her mad!

78
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:45,177
Eh? Mad?

79
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:48,305
All I did was look at her...

80
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,434
Hey there!

81
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,352
Oh, Tonoyama-san!

82
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,187
What happened to your finger?

83
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,565
Sprained it during rugby practice.

84
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,485
Can't fit my wedding ring on it now!

85
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,071
No! It's not him!

86
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,074
It's unlikely that someone
who's going to meet someone else

87
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,910
would go straight to the
counter without looking around first.

88
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,287
Oh? Did you cut your hair?

89
00:06:12,287 --> 00:06:14,623
Yeah, I was gettin' kinda shaggy...

90
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:17,626
Hey, where's the bathroom?

91
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:19,044
Right back there.

92
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:19,878
I see.

93
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:22,089
But it's unisex here.

94
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,590
I know.

95
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,843
Eh? Why would she know it's unisex

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,804
but not know where it is?

97
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,014
I guess it doesn't matter...

98
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,516
Back to Ran's meeting!

99
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,603
The fact they haven't shown up yet
must mean they're already here...

100
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:37,938
Welcome!

101
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:40,482
Are you by yourself?

102
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:43,485
I'm meeting a girl here,

103
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,195
but I guess she's not here yet.

104
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:46,905
Then please take that seat!

105
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:47,781
Yeah.

106
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,411
Some coffee for now.

107
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,290
Don't tell me it's this loser!

108
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:03,130
Wakaoji here! Oh, hey, Yoshio...

109
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,759
Don't be callin'
when I'm about to meet a girl!

110
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,514
It's that cute chick who toured
the TV station the other day.

111
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,433
TV station?!

112
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,019
The one where
that producer was killed?!

113
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,438
She's strangely innocent
for girls these days!

114
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,649
What do you mean, watch myself?

115
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,486
Just treat girls like
objects and they'll be all yours!

116
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,947
Bastard!

117
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,742
Yeah, I'll make sure
none of my other girls find out.

118
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,951
See ya.

119
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:35,954
Alright, watch this!

120
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:40,792
I'll use these Power Kick Shoes to
bust that pretty face of yours!

121
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,502
Edogawa-sama!

122
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,464
Is there an Edogawa-sama here?

123
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:47,674
That's me...

124
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:48,967
You have a call, little boy!

125
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,010
Thanks.

126
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,428
Hello?

127
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,596
Conan-kun?

128
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:53,680
Ran-neechan!

129
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,892
I'm sorry! I won't
be back right away!

130
00:07:56,892 --> 00:08:00,896
The cash register broke,
so I can't get my change!

131
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:03,857
Say, has anybody
come looking for me?

132
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:07,194
I saw 'em. They had long hair.

133
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:09,321
Yeah, that's them!

134
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,075
But that's strange--
their hair is usually tied...

135
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,744
Yeah they just tied it up.

136
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:19,248
Forget about meeting them,
Ran-neechan.

137
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,084
The register's fixed!
I'll be back soon!

138
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,418
Wait!

139
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:28,340
Darn it! When that long-haired
jerk leaves the bathroom--

140
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,932
What is it?!

141
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,309
Blood?!

142
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,560
Wait, kid!

143
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:44,856
Huh? Something's blocking it!

144
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:49,736
What the--?!

145
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:59,663
I'm late! I bet they're mad!

146
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,290
Huh? What's this?

147
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:04,626
Did something happen here?

148
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,878
There was a murder!

149
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:09,923
A murder?!

150
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:13,176
Don't tell me
that person was involved?!

151
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:17,973
Just as this photo shows,
the victim fell to the floor

152
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:20,517
with her body up against the door.

153
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:22,769
Is that right, Conan-kun?

154
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,106
Yeah. The door was unlocked
but it wouldn't open

155
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,733
so I looked from above.

156
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:31,903
The victim was
Himeno Yayoi, 24 years old.

157
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,239
A single stab to the heart...

158
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:35,198
Inspector.

159
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:38,744
There's a thin mark on her throat,
as if she had been choked!

160
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,247
Judging from the blood splatter,

161
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:46,835
the killer probably strangled
her unconscious, stabbed her,

162
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:48,670
and then drew the knife out
to induce blood loss.

163
00:09:49,212 --> 00:09:51,882
She had probably seen
the killer's face...

164
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,259
This was the work of a mugger...

165
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,636
The open window and stall door...

166
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,597
The back alley just outside...

167
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:03,560
The empty wallet
next to the murder weapon...

168
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,522
And then the victim's body,
which blocked the stall door...

169
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:09,900
In other words, the killer
entered through the window,

170
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,735
waited for someone to come,

171
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:14,780
killed Himeno-san,
who just happened to come in,

172
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,450
stole her money, and quickly
escaped out the window.

173
00:10:18,742 --> 00:10:20,744
Alright!
This was an outside job!

174
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,496
Investigate the surrounding area!

175
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,414
Hold on a second, Inspector!

176
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:28,251
Look at that window!
Doesn't it seem too clean?

177
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,879
What's wrong
with a clean bathroom?

178
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,714
That's not what I mean!

179
00:10:32,714 --> 00:10:36,051
He's right,
Assistant Inspector Megure.

180
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,012
Oh, is it just "Inspector" now?

181
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,431
Oh, you're Ms. Kisaki!

182
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:42,974
What are you doing here?

183
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:46,186
I just happened
to be in the coffee shop.

184
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:48,188
Do you know her, Inspector?

185
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:50,399
Yes, she's--

186
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:54,027
At any rate, judging from
the amount of blood loss,

187
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:57,197
the killer should have been
sprayed with blood.

188
00:10:57,197 --> 00:11:01,284
Yet there are no traces of
blood on the window used to escape.

189
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,577
This is unnatural!

190
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:06,289
But the killer
could've wiped it off!

191
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:10,335
Would a killer who hastily
escaped without the murder weapon

192
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,504
do something like that?

193
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:17,050
They left it there because
they couldn't take it with them!

194
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,469
Yes. This was an inside job!

195
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,930
It was someone
in this restaurant!

196
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:25,392
That's what you want to say,
right, little boy?

197
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:27,144
But Kisaki-san!

198
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,731
The body was
blocking the stall door!

199
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,732
There are no signs
of the body being moved,

200
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,985
and the other stall
doesn't have a window!

201
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:38,572
How did the
killer leave the stall?!

202
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,408
There is only one way.
From above.

203
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:44,119
Above? You mean that gap?!

204
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:47,247
No adult could fit through that--

205
00:11:47,247 --> 00:11:50,292
You. Could you try climbing it?

206
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,168
Eh?!

207
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,837
In the next stall, so as
not to disturb the evidence.

208
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:59,301
I can just manage to fit...

209
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,427
See?

210
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:03,388
But if the killer
was covered in blood,

211
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,265
there should be
blood on the wall too!

212
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:10,145
Luckily, there's water
and paper in here to wipe it off.

213
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:14,149
They could've had it planned
out to not leave any traces!

214
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:18,069
But what if someone accidentally
walked in and saw them?!

215
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,906
Oh, you didn't notice?

216
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,784
The restroom door has a lock.

217
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:27,704
Locking it would make
this room impenetrable.

218
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:32,209
Alright! Find everyone who came
in here around the time the victim did!

219
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,211
I know who did!

220
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,962
I just happened to see!

221
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:37,172
Really?

222
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,843
There was that
big guy over there,

223
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,803
that guy who didn't shave,

224
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:46,264
and that snobby ponytail guy!

225
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,726
And this lady too!

226
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:54,523
You used the restroom too?!

227
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,149
I did, now that you mention it.

228
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,821
You have a
good memory, little boy...

229
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,615
Thanks...

230
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,954
Now then, can you tell
us why you came here today,

231
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,123
in order of who
used the restroom?

232
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:16,086
Yes, I came here
today to write my paper...

233
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:21,132
I went in next,
while the victim was still inside.

234
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:24,302
I came here to meet someone.

235
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,471
I went in next.

236
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:30,267
I come here almost everyday
to chat with the bartender.

237
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,228
I was the last one to go in.

238
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,230
I was waiting for a girl.

239
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,650
Is that the order
they went in, Conan-kun?

240
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,693
Yes...

241
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:41,653
What could it be?

242
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,281
Something seems
different from before...

243
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,786
That was an easy fit.

244
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,871
You're next, Wakaoji-san.

245
00:13:51,871 --> 00:13:52,998
Yeah.

246
00:13:56,793 --> 00:14:00,046
Doesn't look like I can fit!

247
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:01,047
Ow!

248
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,882
Hey, now!

249
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,969
I guess you really couldn't, huh?

250
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:08,179
Do I have to do it too?

251
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,432
No. You'd never fit.

252
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:13,518
Kisaki-san, I take it
you don't need to?

253
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:16,354
Yes, I'm sure I could easily fit.

254
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:20,400
It would seem this narrows the
suspects down to Sumeragi-san and myself.

255
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,321
No, of course
I don't suspect you!

256
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:25,822
Inspector!

257
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,991
We found this rope
on Sumeragi-san's table!

258
00:14:27,991 --> 00:14:29,075
What?!

259
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,453
Sumeragi-san! Is this yours?!

260
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,624
That's just some string
I use to tie my books together!

261
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,585
I'm not the killer! Honest!

262
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,297
He entered the
restroom before the victim;

263
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,174
he didn't do it.

264
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,135
She asked the bartender
where the restroom was.

265
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,554
This was probably a sign
to let the killer know

266
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:51,598
that she was going
into the restroom!

267
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:54,434
Which means the only person
in the coffee shop then

268
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:57,479
who could have done it...

269
00:14:57,896 --> 00:15:00,065
...was Ms. Kisaki!

270
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:11,910
Inspector.

271
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,662
Can we take the
knife down to the station?

272
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,164
Yes, that's fine.

273
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:15,748
Understood.

274
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,041
Let me see that!

275
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,042
Hey, kid!

276
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,918
This knife is odd!

277
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,421
Why is there blood on the handle?!

278
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:26,008
And why is there no
blood on this narrow part?!

279
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,886
There's blood on my palm!

280
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,138
But I never even touched the body!

281
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,391
I must've gotten it when
I looked over the stall!

282
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,101
What was blood doing up there?

283
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,565
I seriously doubt
the body put it there!

284
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,527
Now I understand
the killer's real trick!

285
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,987
No doubt about it!

286
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,073
Only that person
could've done this!

287
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,785
But I have no proof!

288
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,412
That's enough of your
detective game, little boy!

289
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,583
This is grownup work!

290
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,585
Learn your place as a child!

291
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,670
But, uh--

292
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,091
A wedding ring!

293
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,052
This is it!
If my logic is correct,

294
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,845
it'll be definitive proof!

295
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,639
Alright, Sumeragi-san.

296
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,849
I have to ask you
to come to the station.

297
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,477
Eh?! I didn't kill anyone!

298
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,397
Oh! There's blood up here!

299
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,610
Oh, I found that too when
I was taking photos of the scene.

300
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,113
Why didn't you say so sooner?!

301
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:31,490
Anyway, Sumeragi-san.

302
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,451
You're starting to look
more and more suspicious...

303
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,620
You can't be serious...

304
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,872
But isn't it strange?

305
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:42,835
The blood was on the top of
the door that the body was blocking.

306
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,129
If it were me,
I would use the toilet

307
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,548
to climb into
the next stall over.

308
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,925
You do have a point...

309
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,179
And I wonder if the killer
really was sprayed with blood...

310
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:54,930
Eh?

311
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,349
Just take a look at that bag!

312
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,352
Even the handle
is covered in blood!

313
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,772
Yes, that is strange.

314
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,859
But what's this part
that has no blood on it?

315
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,654
Something might've been tied there.

316
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,450
Aha! The killer tied
a string to it, stabbed her,

317
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,120
and then pulled it
out after leaving the stall!

318
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,873
The blood sprayed out
when the knife was removed!

319
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:25,586
But then why is there blood up there
if the killer wasn't sprayed with any?

320
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,589
Because it wasn't the killer
who went over the stall,

321
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,508
it was the body that did.

322
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,385
The body went over it?!

323
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,637
The blood above
the door got there

324
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,850
when the victim was being
dumped into the stall.

325
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
The killer stabbed her
outside the stall,

326
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,566
threw the body into it,
and blocked the door.

327
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,278
The knife was then pulled out
with a tug on the string.

328
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,698
This way, if it were discovered
to be an inside job,

329
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,451
the killer could avoid suspicion

330
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,828
due to being unable
to fit over the stall door.

331
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,747
Are you saying the killer was--

332
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,709
You, Tonoyama-san!

333
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,048
Alright!
Take this man into custody!

334
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,885
Can you really arrest me
without proof?

335
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,679
Of course we have proof!

336
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,556
Right, Kisaki-san?

337
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,515
No.

338
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,435
Even if you did arrest him,

339
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:28,315
it would only take me a few
hours to prove his innocence.

340
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,816
Naturally!

341
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:33,403
I only came here today
to chat with the bartender!

342
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,447
Yeah, I heard you!

343
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,867
You sprained your finger playing rugby!

344
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,661
Now my wedding ring won't fit--

345
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:48,001
Oh? Don't people wear wedding
rings on their left ring finger?

346
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:52,130
Your bandage was on your ring
finger when you entered the coffee shop.

347
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,759
Maybe you refastened
it in the bathroom?

348
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,470
That's it! That bandage
was the string used

349
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,847
to strangle the victim
and it was tied to the knife!

350
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,685
Which means the victim's
blood should be on it!

351
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:08,272
My, my. What a
foolish criminal you are

352
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,817
to keep this kind
of evidence on you.

353
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,404
Not even I could defend you in court!

354
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,033
Move, woman!

355
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,585
Whoa! A one-armed shoulder throw!

356
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:32,170
Let go, damn you!

357
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,134
Huh? I've seen that shoulder
throw somewhere before...

358
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:41,304
Thanks to the female attorney,
the killer was arrested without incident.

359
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:45,100
Apparently, he did it because
he was having an affair with the victim,

360
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,147
and she threatened to tell
his wife if he didn't marry her.

361
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:58,697
Now to do something about
this snob who's meeting Ran.

362
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,075
Ran!

363
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,120
Sorry I'm so late! I didn't mean to!

364
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,246
Jerk!

365
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,081
Hey, what did you mean by,

366
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,501
"Just treat girls like objects
and they'll be all yours?!"

367
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,544
Eh?

368
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,587
Earlier, he said--

369
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,756
Wait! Kid!

370
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,965
Nice to meet you!

371
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,884
Who is this guy?

372
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,926
Eh?

373
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,304
Did he really say that, Conan-kun?!

374
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,680
Ah, Sonoko-chan!

375
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,850
You did, didn't you?!

376
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,478
There must be some mistake--

377
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,938
Wait, Sonoko-chan!

378
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,901
Oh, he was waiting for Sonoko?

379
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,362
Then who was Ran waiting for?!

380
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:41,823
Oh, are you
dressed like that again?

381
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,786
Didn't I tell you it's not
good to wear short skirts?

382
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:50,707
You don't need to keep
treating me like a kid, Mom!

383
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:55,796
M-Mo-- Eh?!

384
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,682
What are you
slinking behind me for?

385
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,185
He was very remarkable earlier!

386
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,813
The case was solved thanks to him!

387
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,148
Isn't that right, Conan-kun?

388
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,943
Oh, I don't think he likes me...

389
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,987
Of course I don't!

390
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:48,283
You yelled at me and Ran
all the time when we were kids!

391
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,912
I practically became allergic to you!

392
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,790
It's already been
ten years since you left...

393
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,875
What brought that up?

394
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,961
And in ten years,
you've forgotten my face...

395
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:05,258
I was just thinking you
should come back to Dad soon...

396
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:10,639
Forget that! I despise that lazy,
filthy, womanizing drunk!

397
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,352
The only things I've gained from him

398
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,772
are you and that shoulder throw...

399
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,024
Then why did you marry him?

400
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,109
We grew up together.

401
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,903
Then what's
with the wedding ring?

402
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,447
A bug repellant
to keep annoying men away.

403
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,407
You're so stubborn!

404
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,618
Not so fast, Matsuo-san!
I must ask you to--

405
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,206
This is a clip of when Dad
solved that case at the TV station!

406
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,583
Didn't you say
you wanted to see it?

407
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,464
Here is the phone call
that was the key to solving the case.

408
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,882
My wife?

409
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,343
It's alright!
We don't live together!

410
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,428
Let's have a
passionate night tonight!

411
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,973
It's not what you think!
He was--

412
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,892
It seems I can't go back just yet.

413
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,647
Ran. You be careful of that
detective you grew up with, too!

414
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,652
He'll only get you into trouble!

415
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,321
Wait, Mom!

416
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,659
Why, you!

417
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,207
Those guys
don't seem like hikers!

418
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,584
They have a shovel,
but they're wearing suits!

419
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:23,878
And what exactly is that map?!

420
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,672
On the next Conan--

421
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,174
"The Detective League Survival Case."

422
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,819
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,654
Treasure map.
