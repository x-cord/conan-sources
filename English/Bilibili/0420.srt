1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.840
Detective Conan will be going into its 10th year.

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.140
One down and more to come!

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.540
Thoughtfulness and kindness for the one you love.

4
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.040
Brings about misunderstanding,

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.740
but at long last, the true killer is found in the homeland of mythology.

6
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:47.145
We came on a sightseeing trip to Izumo, the homeland of mythology,

10
00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:51.045
and we become acquainted with a woman named Eiko Esumi there.

11
00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:56.245
The following day, Eiko's fiance is killed

12
00:01:56.245 --> 00:02:00.045
and a robbery case of a sword worth 10,000,000 yen occurs.

13
00:02:01.445 --> 00:02:05.345
And of the four suspects that were summoned to the police

14
00:02:05.345 --> 00:02:09.045
were Eiko and her childhood friend.

15
00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:12.845
Please tell me where and what each of you were doing

16
00:02:12.845 --> 00:02:14.745
at around 13:00 yesterday.

17
00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:17.745
It was my day off yesterday,

18
00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:21.045
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

19
00:02:21.045 --> 00:02:22.745
Lastly, Ms. Esumi?

20
00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:25.645
I was at Hinomisaki.

21
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.545
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma aren't the ones, are they?

22
00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:30.745
No.

23
00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:33.945
I wonder why there are no witnesses whatsoever.

24
00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.945
Could it be that they're lying?

25
00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:43.045
"The Sword of Yamatano Orochi (Part 2)"

26
00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:46.145
Are you sure you didn't see wrong?

27
00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.245
Of course not.

28
00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:50.345
I've known her since she was born.

29
00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:53.445
She was Eiko of Hinodeya.

30
00:02:53.445 --> 00:02:55.345
It was after noon yesterday?

31
00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:58.145
Yep. Just about 13:00.

32
00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.145
She always sits on that chair over there.

33
00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:06.445
Eiko was here at the time that Mr. Wanibuchi was killed?

34
00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:11.845
Since there's a witness, Eiko's alibi's been established.

35
00:03:11.845 --> 00:03:14.445
But why did she say she was at Hinomisaki?

36
00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:16.845
Let's go tell Pops and the others.

37
00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.845
It's just as she and Conan are saying.

38
00:03:20.845 --> 00:03:24.445
I was at Old Taisha Station.

39
00:03:24.445 --> 00:03:25.945
-What? -What?

40
00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:29.145
I go there a lot when I have time.

41
00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:33.145
I feel relaxed when I go there.

42
00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:36.145
It is also the place where the history of my mother and father started.

43
00:03:38.445 --> 00:03:41.345
My mother happened to stop by when on a trip and came here to Izumo.

44
00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:44.045
She just happened to spend the night at my father's inn.

45
00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:47.345
They were both attracted to each other and eventually got married.

46
00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:49.245
Then I was born.

47
00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:51.945
Although the railroad line has already been discontinued,

48
00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:53.345
when I go there,

49
00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:56.145
I feel like I can see the beginning of everything.

50
00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:59.245
I like that station.

51
00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:02.545
No matter how much you look for witnesses who've seen Eiko at Hinomisaki,

52
00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:04.745
you wouldn't find them

53
00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.045
because she didn't go there.

54
00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:10.445
If you were at Old Taisha Station,

55
00:04:10.445 --> 00:04:13.245
why didn't you say so to begin with?

56
00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:15.545
Why did you lie about it?

57
00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:17.245
Well...

58
00:04:17.245 --> 00:04:19.845
Because Mr. Fukuma said what he did, right?

59
00:04:19.845 --> 00:04:20.845
What?

60
00:04:20.845 --> 00:04:23.845
It was my day off yesterday,

61
00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:26.245
so I went to Old Taisha Station.

62
00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:29.745
You were more surprised than anyone else back then, weren't you, Eiko?

63
00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:34.845
Because you were there, but Mr. Fukuma wasn't.

64
00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:36.745
He killed Mr. Wanibuchi for me,

65
00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:40.345
that's the only thing I could think of.

66
00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:45.645
So I couldn't tell the truth if I mentioned Old Taisha Station.

67
00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:47.745
It would contradict his.

68
00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:51.345
But I was alone too, so there are no witnesses.

69
00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:54.145
If we were at the same place,

70
00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:56.745
there's no way that we wouldn't have seen each other.

71
00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:02.545
Since Mr. Fukuma lied before you, you couldn't help but lie.

72
00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:05.945
Hinomisaki just happened to cross my mind

73
00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:07.945
since I like it there, too.

74
00:05:07.945 --> 00:05:10.345
I see, so that's the story.

75
00:05:10.345 --> 00:05:12.745
But if Ms. Esumi is innocent,

76
00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.045
Mr. Fukuma's activities become questionable.

77
00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:22.845
He took the sword away from the murder site not to protect Ms. Esumi,

78
00:05:22.845 --> 00:05:26.045
but to hide what he did.

79
00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:27.845
I don't think that's right.

80
00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:34.045
Eiko as well as Mr. Fukuma just had a mutual misunderstanding.

81
00:05:34.045 --> 00:05:36.345
A mutual misunderstanding?

82
00:05:36.345 --> 00:05:39.545
If you tell Mr. Fukuma that Eiko has been cleared from suspicion,

83
00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:42.445
I'm sure he'll tell you everything.

84
00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:44.345
I'll bring Fukuma here.

85
00:05:47.245 --> 00:05:49.945
Eiko, it wasn't you?

86
00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:53.545
I was at Old Taisha Station right through.

87
00:05:53.545 --> 00:05:57.045
But then, why?

88
00:05:57.045 --> 00:05:58.345
Was this there?

89
00:05:59.845 --> 00:06:02.345
What is this?

90
00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:04.145
Where did you find this?

91
00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:05.945
Where else?

92
00:06:08.145 --> 00:06:12.045
Could you explain in chronological order please?

93
00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:13.245
Yes.

94
00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:18.145
Yesterday at noon, I did go to Inome Cave.

95
00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:22.445
But it wasn't to kill Mr. Wanibuchi.

96
00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:26.045
The day before yesterday, Eiko told me that...

97
00:06:26.045 --> 00:06:28.445
she was called out by Wanibuchi.

98
00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:32.545
He told me to come to Inome Cave at 13:30.

99
00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:34.845
Why's he asking you to come to a lonely place like that?

100
00:06:34.845 --> 00:06:38.445
I'm sure he's up to no good.

101
00:06:38.445 --> 00:06:39.845
Don't go!

102
00:06:39.845 --> 00:06:41.445
I'll go in place of you.

103
00:06:41.445 --> 00:06:42.845
I'll have a good talk with him

104
00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:45.745
and make him give you up, once and for all.

105
00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:47.045
Ryo.

106
00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:49.645
Noon tomorrow, at 13:30.

107
00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.645
So yesterday, in order to talk it out with him...

108
00:06:54.845 --> 00:06:55.945
Wanibuchi?

109
00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:05.445
Eiko?

110
00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:09.045
You found this there?

111
00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:12.545
I recognized it right away because this is what I gave you.

112
00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:15.445
I will have to keep it for a while.

113
00:07:15.445 --> 00:07:18.245
The key is this pendant.

114
00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:22.345
I thought you went despite me telling you not to go.

115
00:07:22.345 --> 00:07:25.445
Thinking that Eiko had killed him,

116
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:29.245
you impulsively stole the sword to make it look like a robbery?

117
00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:31.745
Oh, yes.

118
00:07:31.745 --> 00:07:34.645
The story makes sense.

119
00:07:34.645 --> 00:07:36.145
I'm sorry, Ryo.

120
00:07:36.145 --> 00:07:40.145
I lost that pendant several days ago.

121
00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:41.845
I couldn't make myself tell you.

122
00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:44.745
So that's what you meant, Conan,

123
00:07:44.745 --> 00:07:47.545
when you said they had a mutual misunderstanding.

124
00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:50.545
They both thought that their partner was the killer.

125
00:07:50.545 --> 00:07:54.145
They both lied to protect each other.

126
00:07:54.145 --> 00:07:57.345
How cute. How so very cute.

127
00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:58.745
It's not cute!

128
00:07:58.745 --> 00:08:02.345
How dare you both confuse the case the way you did!

129
00:08:02.345 --> 00:08:06.345
Mr. Fukuma, you stealing the sword is nothing other than a crime!

130
00:08:06.345 --> 00:08:08.045
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

131
00:08:08.045 --> 00:08:09.545
If you didn't take the pendant away,

132
00:08:09.545 --> 00:08:14.045
maybe the fingerprints of the real killer were on them!

133
00:08:14.045 --> 00:08:18.045
I completely thought it was Eiko, so I...

134
00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:20.545
If so, the more so!

135
00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:23.645
Trying to cover up somebody else's crime is not love!

136
00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:26.945
Ryo.

137
00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:28.845
I understand.

138
00:08:28.845 --> 00:08:33.545
Which means that the one who killed Mr. Wanibuchi is Kazuya Ishitobi.

139
00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:38.045
That jittery attitude of Mr. Ishitobi sure is worth suspecting.

140
00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:40.645
The way Mr. Fujie acted surprised

141
00:08:40.645 --> 00:08:44.245
when I introduced myself also bothers me.

142
00:08:44.245 --> 00:08:47.945
The real killer had this pendant, right?

143
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:49.445
Probably.

144
00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:53.345
And he dropped it when he killed Mr. Wanibuchi.

145
00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:56.545
Rather, he deliberately put it near the corpse!

146
00:08:58.045 --> 00:09:01.045
You said you lost it several days ago, didn't you?

147
00:09:01.045 --> 00:09:05.545
Before that, did you see Mr. Ishitobi or Mr. Fujie?

148
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:06.845
Come to think of it...

149
00:09:06.845 --> 00:09:08.845
Come on, Eiko!

150
00:09:08.845 --> 00:09:12.745
If it's for you who he loves, I'm sure he'll listen.

151
00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:17.945
Marry him and please tell him not to take us over!

152
00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:19.145
Please!

153
00:09:19.145 --> 00:09:22.045
Just what do you think you're saying, Mr. Fujie?

154
00:09:22.045 --> 00:09:25.445
Are saying you want our daughter to sacrifice herself

155
00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:28.445
for the sake of saving your wedding hall?

156
00:09:28.445 --> 00:09:31.345
I'm pleading knowing what a selfish request this is.

157
00:09:31.345 --> 00:09:34.345
Please. Eiko, please!

158
00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:35.945
Please let me think it over.

159
00:09:35.945 --> 00:09:39.245
Eiko, there's no need to think it over!

160
00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.045
Please leave, Mr. Fujie.

161
00:09:42.045 --> 00:09:43.545
How cruel

162
00:09:43.545 --> 00:09:46.945
to tell you to sacrifice yourself for his own convenience. Eiko...

163
00:09:46.945 --> 00:09:49.145
Come to think of it,

164
00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:51.645
it was after that, I realized that I had lost the pendant.

165
00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:55.145
So, it's Mr. Fujie.

166
00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:59.045
But Mr. Fujie has the alibi of having been at Matsue Castle.

167
00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:01.945
His name was on the name list of the castle tower.

168
00:10:01.945 --> 00:10:06.045
Let's go take a look at Matsue Castle, Mr. Mouri.

169
00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:10.045
Right, if the killer didn't try to frame Eiko up as the killer,

170
00:10:10.045 --> 00:10:13.645
Mr. Fukuma wouldn't have had to steal the sword, too!

171
00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:25.945
This distinct way of writing is unmistakably Mr. Fujie's writing.

172
00:10:25.945 --> 00:10:28.145
Judging from what's written before and after his signature,

173
00:10:28.145 --> 00:10:31.045
13:05 doesn't seem to be a lie.

174
00:10:31.045 --> 00:10:32.845
I guess it was just a waste of time.

175
00:10:32.845 --> 00:10:35.645
I just thought there may be a possibility.

176
00:10:35.645 --> 00:10:37.745
Which means, there's only one person left.

177
00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:38.945
Let's hurry back.

178
00:10:41.845 --> 00:10:43.145
Conan?

179
00:10:43.145 --> 00:10:46.445
Okay! I'll catch up with you right away, so go ahead.

180
00:10:46.445 --> 00:10:48.345
Really? Right away, okay?

181
00:10:50.145 --> 00:10:52.545
Something is bothering me.

182
00:10:52.545 --> 00:10:54.345
The time here fits in too well.

183
00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:00.645
What is going on?

184
00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:03.545
Logging in the time suddenly started from yesterday?

185
00:11:03.545 --> 00:11:06.645
Hey, will you lend me your eraser?

186
00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:09.145
I can't seem to do it well.

187
00:11:09.145 --> 00:11:12.045
If written in a pencil, it could be erased.

188
00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:14.745
But this, you can't.

189
00:11:14.745 --> 00:11:16.345
No, maybe...

190
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.845
Hey, will you please lend me your eraser?

191
00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:24.645
Hey, Ran! Hurry up!

192
00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:26.445
Yep! Wait!

193
00:11:26.445 --> 00:11:28.445
Conan's not here yet!

194
00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:30.545
Not that brat again.

195
00:11:30.545 --> 00:11:32.545
Wait, Pops!

196
00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:33.645
We're leaving you behind!

197
00:11:35.745 --> 00:11:37.145
Yes, this is Yamane.

198
00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:38.145
What?

199
00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:40.745
Yeah, okay.

200
00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:43.445
Mr. Ishitobi couldn't have committed the crime.

201
00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:45.045
Yesterday, a little after noon time,

202
00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:46.645
in the suburbs of Izumo,

203
00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:51.045
there was a hit and run accident around 13:00.

204
00:11:51.045 --> 00:11:54.545
At about the same time, Mr. Wanibuchi was killed in Inome Cave.

205
00:11:54.545 --> 00:11:55.745
And?

206
00:11:55.745 --> 00:12:00.645
The driver was finally found through eye-witness reports

207
00:12:00.645 --> 00:12:02.745
and just arrested.

208
00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:04.645
It is Mr. Ishitobi.

209
00:12:04.645 --> 00:12:05.745
What?

210
00:12:07.145 --> 00:12:08.445
I get it.

211
00:12:08.445 --> 00:12:13.145
He wasn't jittery because he killed Mr. Wanibuchi,

212
00:12:13.145 --> 00:12:15.945
but because he was afraid we would find out about his hit-and-run case.

213
00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:18.945
But if so, what about this case?

214
00:12:18.945 --> 00:12:21.545
It's not Mr. Fukuma or Ms. Esumi.

215
00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:24.145
Mr. Fujie has a definite alibi

216
00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:27.645
and the possibility of Mr. Ishitobi being the suspect is gone.

217
00:12:27.645 --> 00:12:30.545
All the suspects are innocent.

218
00:12:30.545 --> 00:12:31.645
Right.

219
00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.245
Mr. Mouri!

220
00:12:35.245 --> 00:12:37.145
Dad, are you all right?

221
00:12:37.145 --> 00:12:39.745
So we're back where we started.

222
00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:41.045
Pops.

223
00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:57.245
Yes, I'm Fujie.

224
00:12:57.245 --> 00:13:00.745
This is Mouri, I'd like to see you.

225
00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:03.345
I'll leave the time and place up to you.

226
00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:05.945
I'll tell you the reason when I see you in person.

227
00:13:09.245 --> 00:13:10.745
Yes, Mouri here.

228
00:13:10.745 --> 00:13:13.545
This is Fujie. I have something I want to talk to you about.

229
00:13:13.545 --> 00:13:15.745
You want to talk to me?

230
00:13:15.745 --> 00:13:18.245
I'll be waiting for you at Hinomisaki.

231
00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:28.909
What a magnificent lighthouse it is!

232
00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:29.909
Yes.

233
00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:34.709
It's 43.65 meters and is said to be tallest in Japan.

234
00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:36.609
What a beautiful lighthouse!

235
00:13:36.609 --> 00:13:42.309
It was built in Meiji 36 or 1903.

236
00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:45.209
So it's been here for over 100 years.

237
00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:46.209
100 years.

238
00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:50.209
And he said to wait for him at Hinomisaki, but where?

239
00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:51.709
That's right.

240
00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:54.909
At this time, the lighthouse is already closed,

241
00:13:54.909 --> 00:13:57.209
so it must be that observatory up ahead.

242
00:13:57.209 --> 00:13:58.309
Let's go.

243
00:13:58.309 --> 00:13:59.309
Yes.

244
00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:00.809
What could he want to talk to me about?

245
00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:10.709
Mr. Fujie, thank you for waiting.

246
00:14:10.709 --> 00:14:12.409
What did you want to talk to me about?

247
00:14:12.409 --> 00:14:14.509
Aren't you the one who asked me to come?

248
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:19.609
Please, may I meet someone nice?

249
00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:21.809
He's here! The Sleeping Kogoro!

250
00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:23.509
Sleeping Kogoro?

251
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:25.009
So this is the rumoured...

252
00:14:30.109 --> 00:14:35.309
Mr. Fujie, you analogized Mr. Wanibuchi to the Eight-forked serpent.

253
00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:38.709
His name means crocodile, but his character is like that of a snake.

254
00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:41.809
A monster that swallows up whatever it targets as prey.

255
00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:44.609
Yes, he's just like the Eight-forked serpent.

256
00:14:44.609 --> 00:14:50.609
It's true that Mr. Wanibuchi may have been a hated existence.

257
00:14:50.609 --> 00:14:55.209
But that doesn't mean it's okay to kill him, Mr. Fujie.

258
00:14:56.909 --> 00:14:59.709
What a thing to say.

259
00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:02.209
Is it about that again, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:15:02.209 --> 00:15:04.009
That's right, Mr. Mouri.

261
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:09.309
You even confirmed his alibi at Matsue Castle yourself!

262
00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:11.809
That was a trick.

263
00:15:11.809 --> 00:15:13.709
A trick?

264
00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:15.809
You thought of killing Mr. Wanibuchi

265
00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:20.109
when you went to Eiko's house several days ago, isn't that right?

266
00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:26.109
You pleaded with Eiko, asking her to marry Mr. Wanibuchi

267
00:15:26.109 --> 00:15:30.709
and to ask him to quit taking over your wedding hall.

268
00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:36.609
But of course, the selfish plea was not heard.

269
00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.009
And in your grief...

270
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:44.109
You happened to pick up something you didn't expect to.

271
00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:51.109
A thought flashed through your mind.

272
00:15:51.109 --> 00:15:56.009
You made two calls the day before yesterday, didn't you?

273
00:15:56.009 --> 00:15:58.309
One was to Mr. Wanibuchi.

274
00:15:58.309 --> 00:16:00.309
It went something like this.

275
00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:03.909
I'll give you a great idea on how to make Ms. Eiko Esumi your very own.

276
00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:06.709
It's best for both of us to meet where there aren't many people.

277
00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:10.509
I'll see you at Inome tomorrow at 13:00 then.

278
00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:12.409
Your other call was to Eiko.

279
00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:14.109
You pretended to be Mr. Wanibuchi.

280
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:16.409
I want to see you tomorrow,

281
00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:19.209
please come to Inome at 13:30 tomorrow.

282
00:16:19.209 --> 00:16:22.109
That phone call wasn't from Mr. Wanibuchi?

283
00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:24.309
He used Mr. Wanibuchi's tone of voice.

284
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:26.709
Come to think of it, he said he had a cold.

285
00:16:26.709 --> 00:16:28.109
His voice was not like always.

286
00:16:28.109 --> 00:16:32.209
13:00 and 13:30, you designated different time

287
00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:37.209
because you didn't want Eiko to witness you killing Mr. Wanibuchi.

288
00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:40.309
And yesterday at 13:00,

289
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:41.909
you carried out your scheme.

290
00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:50.309
Mr. Wanibuchi's wristwatch stopping at 13:05 was not what you planned,

291
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:54.209
but you had no choice but to carry out what you did.

292
00:16:54.209 --> 00:16:57.509
So you sped over to Matsue Castle by car

293
00:16:57.509 --> 00:17:02.509
to log your name in on the name list and establish your alibi.

294
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:05.609
It would be impossible to log in from that time, Mr. Mouri.

295
00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:07.309
No matter how fast you drive there by car,

296
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:09.509
you can get to Matsue Castle only after 14:00!

297
00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:11.209
It's not impossible.

298
00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:15.509
You went to Matsue Castle twice yesterday, didn't you?

299
00:17:15.509 --> 00:17:16.509
Twice?

300
00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:20.309
First, it was early in the morning, in order to set up the trick.

301
00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:51.909
You used an alias and logged in your name and the time

302
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:54.909
and at the same time you switched the pens.

303
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:56.909
Switched the pens?

304
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.809
You switched the pen to one you could erase using an eraser.

305
00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:04.109
After killing Mr. Wanibuchi, you went back to Matsue Castle again

306
00:18:04.109 --> 00:18:07.609
and looked for a random log in around 13:00.

307
00:18:21.109 --> 00:18:26.009
So the very moment that Mr. Wanibuchi was killed,

308
00:18:26.009 --> 00:18:28.309
your alibi that you were at Matsue Castle,

309
00:18:28.309 --> 00:18:31.509
an hour away from the murder site was established.

310
00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:33.809
It was a false alibi.

311
00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:36.709
It can easily be proven if you try it out.

312
00:18:36.709 --> 00:18:39.009
There are ball pens that can be erased using erasers.

313
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:42.609
When you think about it,

314
00:18:42.609 --> 00:18:43.709
when logging in on name lists like these,

315
00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:46.909
the name, address and date are written,

316
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:48.909
but the time is usually not written.

317
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:50.609
The fact is, nobody was writing in the time

318
00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:52.309
until the day before yesterday.

319
00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:53.809
However, yesterday,

320
00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:56.109
since the first person wrote in the time,

321
00:18:56.109 --> 00:18:59.309
everyone started logging in the same way.

322
00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:01.409
If the first person writes something in a certain way,

323
00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:04.309
everyone who follows thinks that it is to be done this way

324
00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:08.409
and follows the first pattern without hesitation.

325
00:19:08.409 --> 00:19:11.709
You used this behaviour of people to carry out your trick.

326
00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:14.509
How about it, Mr. Fujie?

327
00:19:14.509 --> 00:19:17.009
What proof do you have

328
00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:19.709
that I am the first one who logged in yesterday morning?

329
00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:23.109
The name Icihiro Yamada sure sounds like an alias,

330
00:19:23.109 --> 00:19:26.409
but the problem is the address, Naruse-shi, Tokyo.

331
00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:28.209
Naruse-shi, Tokyo?

332
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:32.209
So what makes you say that I wrote it?

333
00:19:32.209 --> 00:19:34.709
Why is Naruse-shi a problem?

334
00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:39.809
Mr. Fujie, you used to live in Tokyo during your university days, right?

335
00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:42.509
Wanibuchi was an underclassman of mine

336
00:19:42.509 --> 00:19:45.009
of Teito University economics department in Tokyo.

337
00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:47.509
I confirmed and found out

338
00:19:47.509 --> 00:19:50.609
that the dormitory that you lived in four years ago

339
00:19:50.609 --> 00:19:52.609
was located in Naruse-shi.

340
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:54.309
That only shows that there is a point of contact.

341
00:19:54.309 --> 00:19:56.709
But that's no answer.

342
00:19:56.709 --> 00:19:59.709
It could be that a person by the name of Ichiro Yamada

343
00:19:59.709 --> 00:20:02.309
who actually came and wrote it, right?

344
00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:04.309
That's not possible,

345
00:20:04.309 --> 00:20:07.509
because a place called Naruse-shi does not exist in Tokyo anymore.

346
00:20:07.509 --> 00:20:08.509
What?

347
00:20:08.509 --> 00:20:10.909
It merged with Haido-cho that is next to it,

348
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:14.109
and the name Naruse-shi is gone since a year ago.

349
00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:19.009
You didn't know until now, did you?

350
00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:26.909
I see. Naruse-shi doesn't exist anymore.

351
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:29.509
Mr. Mouri, the fact is back then,

352
00:20:29.509 --> 00:20:31.109
I thought I was doomed already.

353
00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:33.009
I'm Mouri.

354
00:20:33.009 --> 00:20:35.409
That famed detective?

355
00:20:35.409 --> 00:20:40.309
I figured that you'd disclosed the truth in time.

356
00:20:40.309 --> 00:20:41.609
It's just as I thought after all.

357
00:20:52.409 --> 00:20:54.309
How beautiful.

358
00:20:54.309 --> 00:20:58.709
I love the sunset that is viewed from Hinomisaki.

359
00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:01.009
I won't be able to see it for some time now.

360
00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:04.109
I wanted to take a good look at it so I wouldn't forget it.

361
00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:11.809
I know how selfish I am.

362
00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:13.409
Despite knowing this,

363
00:21:13.409 --> 00:21:18.009
I didn't want Wanibuchi to take over my precious business.

364
00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:21.209
I didn't want the monster to swallow it.

365
00:21:21.209 --> 00:21:22.909
I was desperate.

366
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:24.609
I know.

367
00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:26.409
-Fukuma. -Yes?

368
00:21:26.409 --> 00:21:28.809
Be sure you protect Eiko.

369
00:21:28.809 --> 00:21:31.609
Who knows what monster would appear again in the future.

370
00:21:33.109 --> 00:21:34.509
I will.

371
00:21:37.809 --> 00:21:40.109
What a beautiful sunset!

372
00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:41.509
Conan!

373
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.109
Where were you this whole time?

374
00:21:44.109 --> 00:21:46.709
Hey, I hope things work out for the two.

375
00:21:46.709 --> 00:21:48.509
I'm sure they'll work out just fine.

376
00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:51.409
After all, they were born in the land where the God of matchmaking resides.

377
00:23:20.709 --> 00:23:22.309
There!

378
00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:28.809
I'm not going back to Tokyo until the coin makes it in there!

379
00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:30.609
This time for sure! There!

380
00:23:32.109 --> 00:23:33.109
I did it!

381
00:23:33.109 --> 00:23:34.109
No way.

382
00:23:36.609 --> 00:23:39.409
No! Oh, no!

383
00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:40.809
Dad.

384
00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:42.009
Hey, hey.

385
00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:45.009
I don't think it's cool to interfere with other people's wishes.

386
00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:47.409
"Next Episode"

387
00:23:47.409 --> 00:23:49.109
10 years later, on this day,

388
00:23:49.109 --> 00:23:52.809
before the sun sets at that memorable place.

389
00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:56.809
November 24th, 4th grade, class A,

390
00:23:56.809 --> 00:23:58.409
Kinoshita...

391
00:23:58.409 --> 00:24:02.409
"The Hint Is: Animal" -This could be a code that indicates the place.

392
00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:10.109
She's not wearing a hat, but I'm sure it's her.

393
00:24:11.109 --> 00:24:16.409
Next Conan, "Ginkgo Colored First Love (Part 1)"

394
00:24:17.277 --> 00:24:19.477
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:19.477 --> 00:24:21.777
"The promise of 10 years later"

396
00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:23.077
Next is the love story of you-know-who.

397
00:24:23.077 --> 00:24:24.577
It's not that way with Shinichi and me anymore.

398
00:24:24.577 --> 00:24:25.777
No, it's not about you, Ran.

399
00:24:25.777 --> 00:24:26.381
What?
