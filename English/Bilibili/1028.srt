1
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,480
I'm absolutely certain. It's this building.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,120
Just the thought of this mansion becoming
a factory that makes tasty cakes...

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,370
Is kind of exciting.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,310
I want shortcake and mont blanc.

6
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,390
In that case, I'd like
cheesecake and apple pie.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,040
Then I want chocolate cake,
roll cake, pancakes, and flapjacks.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,800
You're being too greedy, Genta-kun.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,010
Huh?

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,140
Hey, isn't that...?

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,890
Is that real?

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,520
Yeah, right.

This must be the place.

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,670
This must be the place.

16
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,340
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

17
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,060
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

18
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,810
The shadow of a woman moves
through a ruined building!

19
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,690
In the air is the smell of
something sweet and a case!

20
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,260
Always determining the one truth

21
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,120
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,930
his name is Detective Conan!

23
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Ballad of the Woman Who Loved Cake

24
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,540
Ballad of the Woman Who Loved Cake
"Ballad of the Woman Who Loved Cake!"

25
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,960
Ballad of the Woman Who Loved Cake

26
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,380
Pull yourselves together, guys.

27
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,040
What happened?

28
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,970
What? A corpse came back to life?

29
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,880
It's true, Conan!

30
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,280
A-A-A hand reached out from beneath the debris!

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,860
It started moving, and a
woman wearing red emerged!

32
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,740
Looks like that zombie is injured.

33
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,990
If we follow this trail of blood...

34
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,750
Then we'll learn the true
identity of that lady zombie.

35
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,250
How far does this trail go, though?

36
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,810
Western Confections

37
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,750
Western Confections
Huh? Isn't this place...

38
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,130
Western Confections Paradise.

39
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,610
Huh? Isn't that woman...

40
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,380
Apparently there's a desolate
building outside Haido City

41
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,770
where they're planning to establish
a new factory for this bakery.

42
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,280
A desolate building? What's that?

43
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,770
An old building no longer in use by anyone.

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,760
Sounds interesting. Let's check it out.

45
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,980
We don't have school next
Thursday, so let's go then.

46
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,910
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

47
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,240
Jeez.

48
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,270
The same woman is in the same seat
eating the same cake as last week.

49
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,090
She's pretty.

50
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,170
Yeah, but she's wearing really dirty clothes.

51
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,250
Those stains...

52
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,060
Aren't they a similar color to that debris?

53
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,810
Then maybe...

54
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,060
She's the lady zombie?

55
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,840
Thank you.

56
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,620
Her ankle is injured.

57
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,570
It's gotta be her.

58
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,860
The lady zombie is angry.

59
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,890
After her!

60
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,290
Wait, Conan-kun!

61
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,910
She entered a building.

62
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,850
This is Western Confections
Paradise's main factory.

63
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,070
This is Western Confections
Paradise's main factory.
Western Confections

64
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,350

67
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,710
The doorman will never let us in.

68
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,860
What should we do?

69
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,670
We came this far.

70
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,970
Hey, guys.

71
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,210
Over here.

72
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:57,510
Over here.
Service Entrance

00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,290
Service Entrance

74
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,030
What's the matter, Yayoi-san?

75
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,720
Th-The president!

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,100
Brother!

77
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,930
C-Call the police.

78
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,820
And let everyone in the
office know about this.

79
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,050
Understood.

80
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,040
I'll tell my wife.

81
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,910
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,760
This is my wife's handkerchief.

83
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,190
Could she have done this?

84
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,480
Hello? What's wrong?

85
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,320
What? The president's been murdered?

86
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,770
He drowned in red bean paste?

87
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,760
Yes. Anyway, where are you now?

88
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,280
I see. In that case...

89
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:12,410
What? Let's have lunch at the apartment?

90
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,840
Last night's leftover sukiyaki over rice?

91
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,400
Yeah, that'll do.

92
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,000
See you later.

93
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,920

He's creating an alibi.

95
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,110
Could he have done this?

96
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,950
This has turned into a serious situation.

97
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,650
Do you think the lady zombie
is connected to the case?

98
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,500
I don't know yet.

99
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,150
The Detective Boys are on the case.

100
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,550
What? Hey.

101
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,920
Let's split up and gather information.

102
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,650
Hey.

103
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,460
Conan, you watch the crime scene.

104
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,400
Wait.

105
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,900
Detective Boys, roll out!

106
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Yeah!

107
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:49,850
Western Confections

108
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:55,160
Western Confections
The deceased is Western Confections Paradise
company president Ogawa Akira-san, 35 years old.

109
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,900
He apparently suffocated
to death when his face

110
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,650
was pushed into a sink
filled with red bean paste.

111
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,130
What an eccentric murder.

112
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,420
Was the victim making a huge amount
of red bean soup or something?

113
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,860
Despite being the president of
a Western confections factory,

114
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,290
he apparently had become absorbed
in Japanese sweet-making recently.

115
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,610
Imagine being killed by the red
bean paste you made yourself.

116
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,430
Wh-What are you doing here?

117
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,450
I thought I'd assist with the investigation

118
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,970
since I'm already here to pick
up the kids as their guardian.

119
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,190
So, where's the boy?

120
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,440
He was around here until a moment ago.

121
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,870
Inspector, I've brought the
people who discovered the body.

122
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm sorry to trouble you when you're already
tired, but we have a few questions for you.

123
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:39,630
Ogawa Hiroshi (29)
Western Confections Paradise VP

124
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,870
Ogawa Hiroshi (29)
Western Confections Paradise VP
You're the victim Ogawa Akira-san's younger
brother and Vice President Ogawa Hiroshi-san

125
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,550
You're the victim Ogawa Akira-san's younger
brother and Vice President Ogawa Hiroshi-san

126
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,000
and the president's secretary
Ito Yayoi-san, correct?

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,090
and the president's secretary
Ito Yayoi-san, correct?
Ito Yayoi (31)
President's Secretary

128
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,520
The estimated time of death is 12PM.

129
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,340
It's not that you're suspects,
but where were you at that time?

130
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,600
Around that time, I was crushed
beneath some concrete.

131
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,840
What? C-Crushed beneath concrete?

132
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,530
At the ruined building where we're
planning to build our new factory.

133
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,600
Ruined building?

134
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,280
I was suppose to meet the president there.

135
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,490
We were going to elope.

136
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,190
What?!

137
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,380
We were in love.

138
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,420
But... no matter how long I waited,
the president never showed up.

139
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,860
I became overwhelmed by sadness
and went on a violent rampage.

140
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,760
Then the concrete fell,
crushing me beneath it.

141
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,110
Apparently I was unconscious for
some time until I was awoken

142
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,520
by the dreadful voices of the Detective Boys.

143
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,720
Those children can attest
to what happened after that.

144
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,830
I should thank them.

145
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,560
So she knew we were following her.

146
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,230
Hiroshi-san, what were you
doing around that time?

147
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,850
I returned to my apartment
to have lunch with my wife.

148
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,410
We had last night's leftover
sukiyaki over rice.

149
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,650
Conan-kun.

150
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,250
How'd it go?

151
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,790
A lot of facts have come to light.

152
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,870
The president was trying to develop Japanese
sweets to sell at Western Confections Paradise,

153
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,800
but the VP was strongly opposed,
which caused friction between them.

154
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,010
Hiroshi-san!

155
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,390
Ah, Hanako. Over here.

156
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,760
So, that's the VP's wife?

157
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,210
So, that's the VP's wife?
Ogawa Hanako (28)
Hiroshi's Wife

158
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,890
Ogawa Hanako (28)
Hiroshi's Wife
Yes.

159
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:31,900
His wife sided with the VP and
also opposed the president.

160
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,620
Ma'am, where were you around 12PM today?

161
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,650
I was at home with Hiroshi-san.

162
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,460
We were eating beef bowls for lunch.

163
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,660
She's matching her husband's
lie and fabricating an alibi.

164
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,670
The VP and his wife both think the other
did it and are protecting each other.

165
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,160
The VP's wife is a rude lady.

166
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,920
She bumped into me when she got out of
her red car at the bottom of the steps.

167
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,300
But she smelled nice, like she'd just gotten
out of the shower after shampooing her hair.

168
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,400
A red car, shampoo...

169
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,310
I got a bunch of information, too.

170
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,560
Apparently the murdered president
planned to convince the VP

171
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,570
and his wife who opposed him and build a
Japanese sweets factory in that ruined building.

172
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,640
The ruined building, debris...

173
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,790
Anyway, Ito-san, you seem to know a lot
about the situation at your company

174
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,580
and the condition of your employees.

175
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,570
Yes.

176
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,380
Though my title is the president's secretary, I'm
responsible for taking care of the entire company.

177
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,970
She always assists us with the details.

178
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,450
You know, that lady...

179
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,600
Isn't a zombie at all.

180
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,650
Yeah, she's an ordinary pretty lady.

181
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:55,580
Come to think of it, she said she was
grateful your terrified voices woke her up.

182
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,680
What?

183
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,930
The thing is...

184
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,100
It was actually...

185
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,490
The other way around.

186
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,720
The other way around?

187
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,020
She's not wrong.

188
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,220
We did scream in terror.

189
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,430
But it was because she came back to life.

190
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,680
Guys, tell me more about that.

191
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,010
Everyone, if you could
please wait down below.

192
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,130
Confirm their alibis.

193
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,970
Yes, sir.

194
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,890
Anyway, where did those kids go?

195
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,650
We need to discuss what
we're going to do next.

196
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,780
You're right.

197
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,700
Let's hold an emergency
meeting in your office.

198
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,440
Right now?

199
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,650
The sooner, the better.

200
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,970
I'm sure we'll come up with a good
solution while eating something sweet.

201
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,300
Wh-What's wrong with that kid?

202
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,410
How did you get in here?

203
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,880
Hiroshi-san, wait!

204
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,350
What's your problem?

205
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,100
Your wife didn't do it.

206
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Vice President's Office

207
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,880
Hiroshi-san, what was that about?

208
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,080
Apparently some kids had entered the woods,

209
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,300
but I couldn't find them.

210
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,830
It was probably the Detective Boys.

211
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,710
I need to contact someone
regarding something.

212
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,010
You two go ahead and eat without me.

213
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,560
I'll be right back.

214
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,390
Where did that kid go?

215
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,030
Hey, you kids.

216
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,760
Hello.

217
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,850
It's just you kids?

218
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,080
Where's four-eyes?

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,690
He went that way.

220
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,400
That way? All right.

221
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,060
Don't wander around too much, kids.

222
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,900
Okay.

223
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
Hey, Detective Takagi.

224
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,000
Conan-kun?! Mori-san's been looking for you.

225
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Yeah, sure.

226
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:15,030
Anyway, he said he wanted forensics
to look into something for him.

227
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,830
What?

228
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,930
Excuse me.

229
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,680
Oh, do the Detective Boys like cake as well?

230
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,700
Yeah.

231
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,610
I see.

232
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,630
I enjoy cake, too.

233
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,800
Or rather, I love it dearly.

234
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,000
I haven't thanked you yet.

235
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,440
Thanked us?

236
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,200
For testifying that you found me crushed
beneath concrete in the ruined building.

237
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,280
Thank you, Detective Boys.

238
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:14,010
I sensed you fearfully entering
the ruined building then.

239
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,400
We were laughing then.

240
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,410
Then a woman came back to life.

241
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,610
Oh, is that right?

242
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:35,280
You used the Detective Boys
to fabricate an alibi.

243
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,040
Isn't that right?

244
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,400
What are you talking about?

245
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,830
Hey!

246
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,300
I finally found you.

247
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:49,760
How dare you wandering around the crime
scene like some little wandering...

248
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,710
Hey! He's so heavy...

249
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:57,760
This case is the sad ballad
of a woman who loves cake.

250
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,280
The sad ballad of a woman who loves cake?

251
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,960
What is this old dude talking about?

252
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,770
Wait, where is his voice coming from?

253
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,280
Listen to what I have to say
as we dance a waltz together.

254
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,530
What?!

255
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,330
They're...

256
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,780
...dancing a waltz.

257
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,160
This ballad began one week ago at the Western
Confections Paradise cake shop in Haido City,

258
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,410
when the woman who loves cake learned of the
Detective Boys' plan to explore a ruined building.

259
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,880
This morning, the woman who loves
cake went to said ruined building.

260
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,900
Using a long thread and plywood boards,

261
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,420
she rigged some debris to fall automatically.

262
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,190
Conan found signs of this contrivance
in the ruined structure.

263
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,940
On the path between the ruined building
and Western Confections Paradise,

264
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,450
she left a trail of blood beforehand
so the Detective Boys would follow it.

265
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,700
She returned to the office and waited for
the right moment to speak to the VP's wife.

266
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,140
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,250
The president forgot some documents
at the new factory site.

268
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,350
No problem.

269
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,920
The VP's wife headed to the
ruined building in a red car,

270
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,640
where she triggered the tripwire
and was crushed beneath the debris.

271
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,150
And then...

272
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,160
Awoken by the laughter of the
Detective Boys who had arrived,

273
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,740
she failed to notice their presence
and hastily left out of fear.

274
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,920
At that time, Conan saw a red
car driving down the hill.

275
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,720
Since the VP's wife didn't return to
the office until after the murder,

276
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,550
she must've returned home and taken a shower.

277
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,830
Meanwhile, the woman who loves cake

278
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,020
headed to the president's office
as though nothing had happened.

279
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,950
She waited for an opportunity
to kill the president,

280
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,510
left behind the VP's wife's handkerchief
she'd stolen beforehand, and left.

281
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,560
The VP and his wife suspected each other.

282
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,210
The lies they told ultimately fabricated
an alibi for the woman who loves cake.

283
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,230
For the woman who loves cake,

284
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,260
predicting the VP and his wife's actions
and manipulating them was a simple task.

285
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,910
After all, she's the secretary.

286
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,440
Then the woman who loves cake waited.

287
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,420
She wore clothes similar to the VP's
wife, stained her ankle with blood,

288
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,000
and ate cake while she waited,

289
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,320
as though waiting for a lover,

290
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,940
for the Detective Boys to follow the trail.

291
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,190
And that's how the Detective Boys
were used to fabricate an alibi

292
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,770
for the sad woman who loves cake.

293
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

294
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,200
What proof is there that
I killed the president?

295
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,070
This is all just the nonsensical reasoning
of an old dude who reeks of cigarettes!

296
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,740
You're right. There's no evidence.

297
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,990
See? Told you so.

298
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,490
But what about the VP and
his wife's testimony?

299
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,120
There's no such testimony.

300
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,000
What makes the woman who loves cake say that?

301
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,780
What?

302
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,060
On what basis do you make that claim?

303
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,630
What basis? None, it's just what I think.

304
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,380
No, there is something.

305
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,890
This old dude who reeks of cigarettes knows.

306
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,640
He admitted it?!

307
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,640
What are you claiming to know?

308
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,640
I know the woman who loves cake poisoned
the VP and his wife and tried to kill them.

309
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,150
I've had enough of you!

310
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,450
Now you've said it! How dare you!

311
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,400
Stay away from me!

312
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,210
Get off of me!

313
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,400
A murderer has no right
to speak to me that way.

314
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,410
But don't worry.

315
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,500
What?

316
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,330
What do you see on the
other side of that glass?

317
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,160
The glass? What?

318
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,680
B-But how?

319
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,090
I told them.

320
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,800
The culprit is the secretary.

321
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,100
I had them pretend to be poisoned
without eating the matcha cake.

322
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,600
The police told me earlier that
they found poison in the cake.

323
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,060
And so, the ballad of
the woman who loves cake

324
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,180
ended with her betrayal
by the cake she loves.

325
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,620
I couldn't forgive the president.

326
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,130
How could my beloved Western Confections
Paradise make Japanese sweets of all things?

327
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,680
At first, they opposed the idea,

328
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,180
but the VP and his wife were just as guilty
for accepting the president's suggestion.

329
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,640
Western Confections Paradise was my dream.

330
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,100
And my precious Western Confections Paradise

331
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,150
needed to be a paradise of Western
confections, true to its name.

332
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,370
Shortcake, mont blanc, cheesecake.

333
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,920
My beloved Western sweets.

334
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,260
Apple pie, chocolate cake, éclairs.

335
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,180
A paradise of Western sweets.

336
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,380
We heard everything.

337
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,710
Ito Yayoi-san.

338
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,360
Could you tell us more about that elsewhere?

339
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,910
Ito-san?

340
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,810
Cream puff and maritozzo.

341
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,960
Shortcake.

342
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,760
Cheesecake, apple pie, chocolate cake.

343
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,320
Mont blanc, too.

344
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,680
Ito-san.

345
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,130
Ito Yayoi-san, is that all right?

346
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,710
We'd like to speak with you.

347
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,320
Yes.

348
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,240
I understand.

349
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,000
I wanted to create a true
paradise of Western sweets.

350
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,310
So they're making a Japanese sweets
factory instead of a cake factory.

351
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,470
Daifuku.

352
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,900
