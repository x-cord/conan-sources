1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,140
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,040
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,840
One who is obviously the culprit.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,940
The vital point of truth pierces through the paradox.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,740
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,267
On our way back from Izu,

9
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,067
Pops car broke down again

10
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:48,267
on a mountain road covered with thick fog.

11
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,267
We stopped for help at a study facility

12
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,567
of the Kuron Health Equipment Corporation

13
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:56,667
that happened to be nearby.

14
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:00,367
In the presence of a tyrant president called Shiro Umetani,

15
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:05,467
everyone is in the midst of a company competition of massage chairs.

16
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,667
However,

17
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:09,867
Mr. Umetani is suddenly found stabbed with a knife.

18
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:15,767
Fortunately, Mr. Umetani's life is saved.

19
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,967
The culprit Hiramatsu flees with his car

20
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:22,467
and while fleeing, falls over a cliff and dies.

21
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:28,267
It seems that there was a thick fog at the time of the accident

22
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:31,167
and besides this slope is steep and the curve is very sharp.

23
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:33,667
It's most likely that he couldn't steer fast enough

24
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,067
while he was on the run.

25
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:39,067
Yeah, most likely.

26
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,867
Strange.

27
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:42,967
There are too many strange things involved.

28
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,667
A person who gets enraged, stabs someone and flees,

29
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,867
flattens the tires of everyone's car

30
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,167
because he doesn't want anyone to come after him.

31
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:54,467
This same person panics and steers his car out of control,

32
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,567
and falls over the cliff to his death.

33
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:01,767
The curve mirror that was facing the wrong way.

34
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,567
Brake oil that was completely gone.

35
00:03:06,367 --> 00:03:08,467
Something smells fishy.

36
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:10,067
Very fishy!

37
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:20,067
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 2)"

38
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,167
Mr. Umetani,

39
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:25,367
at any rate, we'd better get you to a hospital quickly.

40
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:28,267
I'll ask you for details there.

41
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,767
No, I really can't be doing that.

42
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,567
I've got to decide what to do

43
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:34,867
since something like this has happened.

44
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:36,567
A one-man management is really a lot of hassle

45
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,467
at times like this.

46
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:41,967
Mr. Umetani?

47
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:44,367
I think it's better for you to go to the hospital after all.

48
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,467
This is really no big deal.

49
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:50,167
If I wasn't saved by this cigar case I had in my chest pocket,

50
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:52,467
I would've been in the world beyond by now.

51
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,967
If you think of it that way...

52
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,967
True.

53
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,467
It's indeed a cigar case of good luck.

54
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,967
Oh, how terrible.

55
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:05,267
The inside is wiped out.

56
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,567
That's a rare looking type of cigarette.

57
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:11,167
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?

58
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,567
Well, about 40, maybe...

59
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,867
Then, you must really have it tough without cigarettes.

60
00:04:17,867 --> 00:04:19,467
You can have mine, if it's okay with you.

61
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,167
No, thanks.

62
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,267
I've got some more in my car.

63
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:26,867
Besides I only smoke cigars.

64
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,167
Would you like to try one, Mr. Mouri?

65
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,967
A cigar?

66
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:36,767
Mr. Mouri, I'd like to ask about the accident.

67
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,467
Oh, right.

68
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:40,367
I've got something good that may be of help.

69
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,267
Something good?

70
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:45,967
A video taped the competition we had.

71
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:47,067
What?

72
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,567
You video taped it?

73
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,967
Don't tell me that...

74
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:50,967
Yes.

75
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:56,967
It shows what happened when Hiramatsu stabbed me.

76
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,567
Inspector Yokomizo!

77
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,767
Inspector!

78
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,667
Please come upstairs for a moment!

79
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:06,467
-What is it? -The thing is...

80
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,367
We found this in the closet

81
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:14,867
between the mattresses in Mr. Hiramatsu's room.

82
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,967
A rope, stun gun and a death note.

83
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,367
A death note? What's going on?

84
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,667
What's this?

85
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:29,067
What's wrong?

86
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,367
What's this...

87
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,667
I've completely lost confidence in keeping this company going.

88
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,767
Please forgive me for my selfishness.

89
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:38,467
President of Kuron Health Equipment Corporation,

90
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,367
Shiro Umetani.

91
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,767
What?

92
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,267
It's President Umetani's death note!

93
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:46,267
Absurd!

94
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,267
I would never write something like this!

95
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:51,267
There's no reason why I should commit suicide!

96
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,167
Just as I thought.

97
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,467
Mr. Hiramatsu probably was scheming to kill you

98
00:05:56,467 --> 00:05:59,467
using everything here.

99
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,967
How could he...

100
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:04,667
There's no doubt about it!

101
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,067
Before all else, let's take a look at the video tape!

102
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,467
I kept the video running just in case.

103
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,767
But, I sure had no idea

104
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:16,867
it would come in handy in a situation like this.

105
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:19,067
How ironic.

106
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,067
Oh, there!

107
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:28,267
After you all left the room, I tried AIMS out.

108
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:30,167
It was good, wasn't it?

109
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:33,667
Yes, I was definitely sure that it would be a hit.

110
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,667
Except for one problem.

111
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,267
Problem?

112
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,967
He demanded that I let him quit the company.

113
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,267
And that unless I take in his request,

114
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,567
he refused to give AIMS to me.

115
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,867
He said that unless the password is entered by midnight,

116
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,967
the program within AIMS would perish.

117
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,567
So, what did you do?

118
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:57,167
I was sure that I could make a great profit with AIMS.

119
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,367
But, I was more afraid of him going to another company

120
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:04,967
and developing something better than AIMS.

121
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:08,567
So, you chose Mr. Hiramatsu?

122
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,667
Yes.

123
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:14,867
At first, it seemed that he was convinced.

124
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:19,467
But he suddenly became enraged.

125
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:28,967
I was suddenly stabbed and fainted,

126
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,267
so I don't remember anything that followed.

127
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:37,567
I awoke when you people woke me up.

128
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,167
After that, Mr. Hiramatsu who afraid of

129
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,267
everybody finding out about what happened

130
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,267
fled from the window.

131
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:46,267
After he went through the trouble of preparing to kill you

132
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,067
under the pretense of suicide,

133
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,667
why would he lose his temper and use a knife because it was there?

134
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,667
That man had no patience.

135
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,867
He used to do only what he wanted to do.

136
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,867
He used to always wear a blank look and seemed like a quiet man,

137
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,667
yet he easily loses his temper.

138
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,867
You're pretty hard on him, aren't you?

139
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:03,867
How about you, Mr. Nakano?

140
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:08,867
Well, it's true that he had that inclination.

141
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,267
I see.

142
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:21,667
This is the place that Mr. Hiramatsu's car was parked.

143
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,167
Just as I thought!

144
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,267
Brake oil leaked.

145
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:34,167
Somebody removed the tube!

146
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:37,967
Try it, will you?

147
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:41,967
The aroma is very different from cigarettes.

148
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,267
Come on, have one!

149
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,467
Thank you, I'll have one then.

150
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:49,467
But, what a fine cigar case you have!

151
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,867
Yes, it's my father's keepsake,

152
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:54,467
and this is a one and only.

153
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,767
Oh my God!

154
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,067
Well, well.

155
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:04,567
There's no mistake that this is Mr. Hiramatsu's briefcase.

156
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:07,467
Yes, there's no mistake about it.

157
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:11,667
It's just like Mr. Hiramatsu to hide it in the closet.

158
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,867
What do you mean?

159
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,567
He was very secretive.

160
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,067
The 3rd development room is a single room.

161
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,367
Therefore, the door was always locked,

162
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:22,167
and he wouldn't let anybody in.

163
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,967
The only time he ever talks is during the competition.

164
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:30,467
Then, did anyone know that he was planning to kill the president?

165
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,867
How would we ever know a thing like that?

166
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,467
Gosh, we're the ones who'd want to kill him!

167
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:37,467
Huh?

168
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:39,767
Oh, well, I mean...

169
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:43,467
We understand very well his feeling of wanting to go independent!

170
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:47,667
Come to think of it, he was being yelled at even this morning.

171
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:53,967
Only Mr. Hiramatsu's AIMS was delayed being brought here.

172
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:56,567
The president went to the 3rd development room himself

173
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:59,067
and Hiramatsu was being yelled at from morning.

174
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,267
After a while, Hiramatsu came dashing out

175
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:05,567
and disappeared off somewhere.

176
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,767
Talk about troublemaker.

177
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,767
But, we finally find him and come back

178
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:15,167
only to find the president gone next!

179
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,267
He tells us that he can't take it any longer

180
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,267
and had to cool down for a while.

181
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:22,367
Then, he goes out to buy that cheap cigar case.

182
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,767
What the heck's going on?

183
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,967
Didn't any of you go out with your car?

184
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,767
Great, Pops!

185
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:35,167
Yeah. We went to eat and do some shopping.

186
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,667
Of course, Hiramatsu didn't come with us.

187
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,167
The president said he was going to stop by at the villa,

188
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,667
so I went with Nakano in his car.

189
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:46,567
We arrived here right after that.

190
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,667
I see.

191
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,767
I get it!

192
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,967
I've figured everything out!

193
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,767
It's this late already.

194
00:10:56,767 --> 00:11:00,867
Since I've more or less finished questioning all of you,

195
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,967
I guess we'll call it a day.

196
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,167
Mr. Mouri,

197
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,367
if your car's not repaired yet, let me give you a lift!

198
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,667
Oh, thanks.

199
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,967
It's been a long day.

200
00:11:14,767 --> 00:11:18,967
I guess I'll go try out that relax seat one more time.

201
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,967
Hey, dad!

202
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:23,667
It wasn't much of a case anyway.

203
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,667
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

204
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:31,667
Ran!

205
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:35,367
Call Yokomizo and the others and tell them to come back!

206
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,067
Mr. Hiramatsu didn't die of an accident!

207
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:39,467
Huh?

208
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:45,767
This is a cleverly schemed homicide case!

209
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:54,047
What do you mean that Mr. Hiramatsu's death

210
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,547
by accident is a homicide case, Mr. Mouri?

211
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:59,947
Well, the brakes weren't working, but...

212
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:03,447
It's true that the malfunction of the brakes

213
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:06,947
do not always lead to fatal death.

214
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:08,347
However, the killer

215
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:14,347
set up another trap to make sure that he dies in the accident!

216
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,447
What kind of trick was it?

217
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:21,247
Mr. Hiramatsu believed that he killed the president

218
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:24,147
and fled by car.

219
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:28,047
His brakes didn't work as he drove through the thick fog.

220
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,147
And, the car just kept going down the mountain.

221
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:34,347
Then suddenly the headlights of an oncoming car appear.

222
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:52,247
He loses control of the wheels and falls over the cliff.

223
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:54,547
Please wait, Mr. Mouri.

224
00:12:54,547 --> 00:12:56,847
Was there an oncoming car?

225
00:12:57,847 --> 00:12:59,647
The road uphill, all except for the private road

226
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,247
that's on the side here to this company lead up to the top

227
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,747
and is a dead end.

228
00:13:03,747 --> 00:13:05,847
And besides, after sundown,

229
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:08,347
this whole area is covered with thick fog

230
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:11,147
that there is always practically no one.

231
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,347
There doesn't seem to have been such a car.

232
00:13:13,347 --> 00:13:16,047
No, wrong.

233
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:19,547
The lights he thought were of an oncoming car was...

234
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:23,047
the headlights of his own car.

235
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:28,247
But unless there's a mirror or something in front...

236
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,047
Yes, do you remember that

237
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:33,047
there was something at the scene of the accident

238
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:36,247
that was reflecting the floodlight?

239
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,147
Yes! Yes!

240
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:43,047
The corner mirror that was on the road leading to this facility!

241
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,247
I see.

242
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:48,047
The angle of the corner mirror was changed

243
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:51,047
to reflect the headlights!

244
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:54,547
When Officer Shimada of the residential police box saw in the day time,

245
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:57,247
it seemed to be in the correct position.

246
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:02,447
And in the parking lot where Mr. Hiramatsu's car was parked,

247
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:05,347
there were traces of oil leak.

248
00:14:05,347 --> 00:14:07,947
The person who removed the brake oil

249
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,547
and the person who flattened the tires of the other cars

250
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:13,047
is probably one and the same.

251
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:15,247
Even if the brakes were to be tampered with,

252
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:18,947
there's no guarantee that Mr. Hiramatsu would flee with that car.

253
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,947
Besides, if someone goes after Mr. Hiramatsu

254
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:23,547
and catches him before he gets into the accident,

255
00:14:23,547 --> 00:14:26,147
everything will go to waste!

256
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:28,647
Which means, Mr. Mouri...

257
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,847
someone here did it?

258
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:33,647
Here, you mean us?

259
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:37,047
-No! -We don't have time long enough to be alone,

260
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,247
so it's impossible!

261
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,647
Only the president has time to himself, right?

262
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,747
You idiot! I'm the victim!

263
00:14:43,747 --> 00:14:46,947
Mr. Umetani, after the competition,

264
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:50,747
you went to take a smoke of cigar all by yourself.

265
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:53,247
And, you seem to have come home alone

266
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:55,947
when everyone went out to have dinner, didn't you?

267
00:14:55,947 --> 00:15:00,247
You went by the corner mirror with your car then, didn't you?

268
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:01,347
Hey, hold it!

269
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:03,847
Have you forgotten that I've extended my kindness to you?

270
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:05,447
One more thing.

271
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,147
The killer used a certain thing.

272
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:11,747
Just what is that certain thing?

273
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:14,447
The other thing is...

274
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,447
The other thing is...

275
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:21,947
The fog.

276
00:15:23,147 --> 00:15:24,247
The fog?

277
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:28,047
Yes, the thick fog that is unique to this area.

278
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,047
Without the fog,

279
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:33,047
it'd be easy to see through the corner mirror trick.

280
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,747
In other words, the one thing that was necessary

281
00:15:35,747 --> 00:15:39,347
to commit this murder was the fog.

282
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:44,247
And the only person who could use this fog to his advantage was you!

283
00:15:45,547 --> 00:15:46,947
President Umetani!

284
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,447
None other than you!

285
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:51,647
Don't be ridiculous.

286
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:53,447
The fog is a natural phenomenon!

287
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:56,247
Besides, the fact that Hiramatsu would stab me and flee

288
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,147
is not something I could've known beforehand!

289
00:15:59,147 --> 00:16:00,847
How dare you say something irresponsible like that?

290
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:04,147
No, you knew

291
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:08,647
that Mr. Hiramatsu was planning to kill you.

292
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:10,347
What?

293
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:14,547
I hear that you had it out with Mr. Hiramatsu before coming here

294
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:18,847
and Mr. Hiramatsu dashed out of the room.

295
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,947
You stayed back in the room

296
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:24,047
so I guess you saw it, didn't you?

297
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:28,147
The inside of the briefcase!

298
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:30,647
Therefore, thinking of getting back at him,

299
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:35,047
you went to buy yourself a cigar case just before leaving.

300
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:37,347
Because the one that you're always using

301
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:41,147
is a precious keepsake of your father.

302
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:44,747
Well, using all kinds of cigar cases is good for a change!

303
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:49,347
Then why would a person like you who smokes 40 cigars a day

304
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:56,347
choose a cigar case that can take only 4 or 5 cigars placed diagonally?

305
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,047
And...

306
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:02,847
you kept postponing the competition for one reason or another

307
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:06,047
till the night when a thick fog appeared.

308
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,047
In other words,

309
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:10,547
this homicide taking advantage of and envisioning this fog

310
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:14,647
can only have been committed by you, the one-man president!

311
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:19,147
Some renown detective you are.

312
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,947
All you said just now are nothing but assumptions!

313
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:22,847
Where the heck is the evidence?

314
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,747
The evidence is on the video tape.

315
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:32,247
Please look closely at Mr. Hiramatsu's facial expression.

316
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,847
When Mr. Hiramatsu

317
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:37,447
demanded you to make a choice between AIMS and him,

318
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:43,647
you selected Mr. Hiramatsu to AIMS, didn't you, Mr. Umetani?

319
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:45,247
Yeah, right!

320
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,647
Oh, stop right there!

321
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:51,847
If so, why would Mr. Hiramatsu

322
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:55,147
who couldn't get what he wanted be smiling?

323
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:56,547
Beats me.

324
00:17:56,547 --> 00:18:01,747
Isn't it a fact that you agreed to what he asked for?

325
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,147
Please move it on now.

326
00:18:07,447 --> 00:18:12,147
And, he's saying something to you, isn't he?

327
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:16,047
I'm sure he's giving you the password.

328
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:21,247
The password to stop the program of AIMS from being erased.

329
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:27,047
However, he is suddenly angered

330
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:29,847
and stabs you in the shoulder.

331
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,247
It's most likely that

332
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:36,947
he realized that you just pretended to take in his demand.

333
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:39,247
Hey, cut it out already!

334
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,147
You just made up your story

335
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:44,847
so that it looks to fit what's seen on the video tape!

336
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,647
Is this what you call evidence?

337
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,147
No, this video shows one more thing

338
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:53,547
that is not in keeping with what you're saying.

339
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,547
Not in keeping?

340
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,347
Please advance the tape.

341
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:57,347
Yes, sir.

342
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:00,047
Stop!

343
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:05,347
I thought you said that you passed out at this point,

344
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:07,447
but why does Mr. Hiramatsu

345
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,747
stop in place as if someone is calling him?

346
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:11,947
How should I know?

347
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:16,747
Isn't this what you said when you called out to him?

348
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:17,847
Come back!

349
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,247
If you don't finish me off,

350
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:22,347
it's going to be your turn next time around!

351
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,147
Or something to that effect.

352
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:27,347
You probably went on like this.

353
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:30,947
If you stab the "O" of Kuron, you'll finish me for sure!

354
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:34,847
Because it's right on the heart!

355
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,947
Mr. Hiramatsu did exactly as you provoked him to

356
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:41,847
and stabbed right through the letter, "O".

357
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:46,447
On the letter "O" right, on top the cigar case

358
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:48,347
that you had put inside your chest pocket!

359
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:49,847
What a bunch of baloney!

360
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:52,547
It's all just your imagination!

361
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:55,047
No thing like this is going to serve as evidence!

362
00:19:55,047 --> 00:19:56,447
Inspector Yokomizo.

363
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:59,047
-Yes, sir? -What time is it now?

364
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:02,747
One minute before midnight.

365
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,947
Mr. Umetani.

366
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:11,447
Will you turn on the switch for AIMS after midnight?

367
00:20:11,447 --> 00:20:16,047
If you didn't get the password from him as you say,

368
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:19,847
the device is not supposed to work, is it?

369
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:22,147
Mr. Umetani?

370
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,447
It's midnight.

371
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:39,447
Good evening, President Umetani.

372
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:43,247
I appreciate our wise choice.

373
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:46,747
Please make a lot of profit with my AIMS.

374
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,547
I guess we'll never be seeing each other ever again.

375
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,347
Goodbye, President Umetani.

376
00:20:55,947 --> 00:20:57,347
Darn.

377
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:38,047
Good job, Conan! More towards the shoulders!

378
00:22:41,747 --> 00:22:45,947
It feels like I'm being deliberately stepped on.

379
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,047
Pops, you're right!

380
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:52,347
Let's buy a massage chair after all!

381
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:55,247
If you want to buy something expensive like that,

382
00:22:55,247 --> 00:22:57,947
do work that will bring in enough cash, okay?

383
00:22:57,947 --> 00:23:02,147
But don't you feel sorry that Conan has to do all this hard work?

384
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:07,047
So, I'll massage you, then.

385
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:10,147
No thanks!

386
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:14,647
No, don't do this to me!

387
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:16,147
I'll cure you by putting your backbone in place.

388
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,947
I promise it'll make you feel way better.

389
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:21,747
I don't need anymore massage today.

390
00:23:31,147 --> 00:23:34,347
I'm going to get delicious food ready, then.

391
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,547
Talk about scary.

392
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:48,847
Oh, I've figured out who the culprit is!

393
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:53,847
Mr. Tsukigata, the culprit is your other disciple!

394
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,247
Alibi established, eh.

395
00:23:56,247 --> 00:23:58,847
Mysterious Centipede Ninja.

396
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,847
The enemy is your friend and your friend is your enemy.

397
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:04,647
One twist after the other.

398
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:06,147
Counterturn!

399
00:24:06,147 --> 00:24:07,347
Counter.

400
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:13,447
Next Conan, "Ninja Technique of Alibi Scheme"

401
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,315
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:16,315 --> 00:24:18,515
"Answerphone"

403
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:19,715
The next episode is a unique mystery.

404
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:21,215
It's show time for me again.

405
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:23,461
Is that a voicemail from answerphone?
