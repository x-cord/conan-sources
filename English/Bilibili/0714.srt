1
00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:04.782
Suspicious of Inspector Otaki's actions, we followed him

2
00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:08.482
and came to a mansion in the remote mountains.

3
00:00:08.482 --> 00:00:11.682
There, we encounter siblings in a disquieting atmosphere

4
00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:14.582
about to discuss the distribution of inheritance.

5
00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.282
Everyone who gathers in the dining room

6
00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:19.682
after receiving text mail from the owner of the mansion,

7
00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:22.382
witness the eerie image of the owner outside the window,

8
00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:24.382
and a monster flying through the sky.

9
00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:28.482
After that, the second son is found dead.

10
00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:34.282
Aim for a 100% solution.

11
00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:36.782
Clear all mysteries and codes.

12
00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:38.682
Danger closes in on Ran and Kazuha!

13
00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:40.782
Solve the mystery to haunting phenomenon!

14
00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:42.382
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:42.382 --> 00:00:44.282
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:46.882
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:36.521
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Three)"

18
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:41.121
This is bad, Kudo.

19
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.121
Yeah, if this murder was committed by Hikaru,

20
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:45.221
her motive is probably

21
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:47.321
to take revenge on the person who killed her mother,

22
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:48.921
making it look like an accident!

23
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:51.221
And the one who schemed this,

24
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:53.121
were Asanobu who was just found dead

25
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:56.121
and Ms. Shimizu the maid who died six months ago.

26
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:59.321
And if Kamiyo who hasn't been seen for a while,

27
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.421
also took part in it...

28
00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:04.421
She's probably already been killed and her body's

29
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.221
already in that locked freezer!

30
00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:11.921
Kazuha and Ran are about to open it just now.

31
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.821
Ran and Kazuha are in trouble!

32
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:18.521
Oh, it opened. It opened, Ran!

33
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:19.821
You did it!

34
00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:23.721
What a loud thunder burst.

35
00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:26.021
Yep. It's kind of scary.

36
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:28.021
But we cooked a lot of pot sticks!

37
00:03:28.021 --> 00:03:29.121
That's right, exactly!

38
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:32.021
We'll overcome this with garlic power!

39
00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:36.021
-Darn! -Just as I thought!

40
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:40.021
-Kazuha! -Are you all right? Ran?

41
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.221
Hikaru...

42
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.621
Hey, you!

43
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:51.321
Pot sticks?

44
00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:52.421
"Hikaru Hinohara (24), Torakura Family Maid"

45
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.821
Oh, I was hungry,

46
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:58.621
so when I smelled the pot sticks, I just couldn't help myself.

47
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:01.121
I'm sorry! For eating without permission.

48
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.321
But, it was really delicious!

49
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:08.021
Thank you...

50
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:10.321
And? Did you look inside the freezer?

51
00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:11.421
Yep.

52
00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:13.921
Something strange was inside.

53
00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.421
Huh?

54
00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:18.921
See, a large can of laver.

55
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:24.121
My mom always also puts laver in the freezer so it doesn't go stale.

56
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:25.921
But, usually not the entire can.

57
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:27.121
True.

58
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.121
Wasn't there anything else inside?

59
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:32.521
Nope. It's such a large freezer and yet...

60
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.821
To think that all that was in here was this can.

61
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:39.021
Then, what was that anyway?

62
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:42.021
The trace of something being dragged along

63
00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:45.021
that was found on the floor.

64
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:46.921
How about up there?

65
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:50.121
The one on top is also a freezer and it wasn't locked.

66
00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:52.621
But it was packed fully with food.

67
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:57.021
Are you the only person who had the key to this freezer, Hikaru?

68
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:59.521
I think Hakuya has it too...

69
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:02.121
Which means that he entrusted you

70
00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:03.721
with all the keys to this mansion?

71
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:05.821
No. The only keys I have

72
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:09.521
are the ones for this kitchen and the rooms nearby.

73
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:13.621
The other maids and the butler have the rest of the keys.

74
00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:18.221
-Is everyone still up, right? -Yes.

75
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:20.321
If so, will you please tell them to come to the kitchen?

76
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:23.421
So, we can serve them pot sticks for a late-night snack.

77
00:05:23.421 --> 00:05:26.021
But, after such an incident,

78
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:28.321
I wonder if they'll be up to eating?

79
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:30.921
I was starved, though.

80
00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:33.021
After such an incident?

81
00:05:33.021 --> 00:05:34.021
Do you want to know about it?

82
00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:36.021
No, I don't want to hear about it, no!

83
00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:38.421
Well, don't worry.

84
00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:42.521
Half the haunted phenomenon that occurred here today's been solved.

85
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:47.221
I'll bet everyone will regain his appetite after hearing so.

86
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:54.821
Hey. I hope you're serious?

87
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.721
About the problem having been solved.

88
00:05:56.721 --> 00:05:59.021
Yeah, most of it.

89
00:05:59.021 --> 00:06:02.521
Mystery? It's obvious who the culprit is.

90
00:06:02.521 --> 00:06:06.221
It's Hakuya, isn't it? The one who killed my husband?

91
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:09.421
Don't tell me you figured out the cause of why Hakuya

92
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:10.621
turned into a vampire?

93
00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:13.321
Well, since too many strange things have been happening,

94
00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:16.021
I can understand that you can't help feeling that way but...

95
00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:17.021
-"Rikushige Koga (71), Butler" -I wonder if such a thing

96
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:19.321
as vampires really do exist?

97
00:06:19.321 --> 00:06:21.321
Well, you can decide for yourself as to that

98
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:23.921
after you watch this trick and tell me what you think.

99
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:25.321
This room is...

100
00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:27.221
Are you also referring to the time

101
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.521
when Hakuya vanished from inside that coffin?

102
00:06:29.521 --> 00:06:32.121
Yeah. At first, there was nothing visibly done

103
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:37.821
to the tile under the coffin so it was a mystery, but...

104
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:40.021
The position of where the coffin was placed was different to begin with!

105
00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:42.221
-Huh? -The position was different?

106
00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:43.821
See.

107
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:46.521
The carpet is slit

108
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:50.521
so that when you pull on it, this part can be pulled off.

109
00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:53.721
And, if you pull the part of the carpet that has been pulled off...

110
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:58.121
The entrance of the hidden corridor appears.

111
00:06:58.121 --> 00:07:00.421
A hidden corridor?

112
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:03.121
The entrance door is a sliding door

113
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:05.421
and the hidden corridor is connected to the 1st floor storeroom.

114
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:09.621
But, there are no stair in the storeroom!

115
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:11.621
You just didn't realize there

116
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:13.521
since it was camouflaged by the hidden door

117
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:15.221
that moves shelf and all.

118
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:17.921
Come to think of it, after that trip,

119
00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:22.221
I felt like the storeroom sort of seemed a bit more cluttered.

120
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:23.421
A trip?

121
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:25.821
Yes. About six months ago,

122
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:28.721
just before the incident of Ms. Shimizu occurred,

123
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:32.621
the owner told everyone in the mansion to take a break

124
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:35.021
so we all went abroad for about a week.

125
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:39.621
Which means, this hidden corridor was built during that week.

126
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:41.021
Hey, hold it.

127
00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:42.621
I understand the corridor,

128
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:45.221
but how did Hakuya come out of the coffin?

129
00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:46.521
That's simple.

130
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.321
There's a sliding door at the bottom of the coffin too.

131
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.921
And besides, on the place of the lid that matches,

132
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:57.721
there is a strong magnet embedded

133
00:07:57.721 --> 00:08:01.121
and it seems that once you close it, the lid locks.

134
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:03.421
Until you undo it, using this remote controller

135
00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:05.821
that was here in the storeroom.

136
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.321
In other words...

137
00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:11.521
If you use this trick,

138
00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:17.221
you can go in and out of the coffin at will.

139
00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:19.221
Of course, it's possible to go out

140
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:21.821
and murder the maid Ms. Shimizu too.

141
00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:25.621
Which means Ms. Shimizu was killed by Hakuya?

142
00:08:25.621 --> 00:08:27.421
Yeah, probably so.

143
00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:29.021
The gate guard of this mansion

144
00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:30.621
seems to have positioned there,

145
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:32.421
after the incident of Ms. Shimizu occurred.

146
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:35.621
If he could somehow lure Ms. Shimizu to come to the site,

147
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:38.021
it would be easy for him to go out to kill her,

148
00:08:38.021 --> 00:08:41.321
still pretending to be asleep in the coffin.

149
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:43.821
And? Where's Hakuya now?

150
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:45.221
Beats me.

151
00:08:45.221 --> 00:08:49.121
He may be hiding somewhere, ambushing his next prey.

152
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:50.521
Oh, no.

153
00:08:50.521 --> 00:08:53.721
But, if we all stay together we'll be fine,

154
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:56.121
because he's no monster.

155
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:58.021
Because a vampire who can go through walls

156
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:00.721
and fly through the sky

157
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.321
wouldn't have to use hidden corridor, would he?

158
00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:09.221
Wow, what a downpour!

159
00:09:09.221 --> 00:09:11.121
What bum weather for sure.

160
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:15.021
Right. Everyone's late, don't you think?

161
00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.321
And, we've cooked so many pot sticks.

162
00:09:17.321 --> 00:09:20.221
By the way, Ran. I wonder what's up?

163
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.421
The thing that Hikaru mentioned a while ago.

164
00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:26.521
I wonder but I'd rather not think about it.

165
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:29.221
If by chance, if the owner of this mansion that we saw

166
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.321
is really a vampire,

167
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.621
maybe Heiji and Conan's been bitten,

168
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:35.921
and transformed one after the other into vampires...

169
00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:41.021
No way! You mean we're the only humans in this mansion?

170
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:43.121
It can't be.

171
00:09:43.121 --> 00:09:44.621
No, it can't.

172
00:09:44.621 --> 00:09:46.521
No good. After all this ridiculous talk,

173
00:09:46.521 --> 00:09:48.421
I'm starting to get hungry.

174
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.321
Then, shall we take a bite?

175
00:09:50.321 --> 00:09:53.221
We can just cook more after everyone gets here!

176
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.321
Which means that the psychic picture

177
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.621
we took in this room is also a trick?

178
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:01.521
Yep! Will you all get into the same position that you were in

179
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:03.421
when the picture was being taken?

180
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:04.821
Okay.

181
00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:08.221
Come on, smile everybody!

182
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:10.821
Heiji relax more too!

183
00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:13.121
-Huh? -Heiji?

184
00:10:13.121 --> 00:10:14.421
What're you talking about?

185
00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:17.021
There are only five of us here in this room including you.

186
00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:19.121
There is another person behind you!

187
00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:22.721
What's going on?

188
00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.121
Isn't this a mirror?

189
00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:26.921
It's a magic mirror!

190
00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:30.521
If one side of it is dark, it looks like a mirror.

191
00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:34.621
But if you light up the dark side, it becomes like glass!

192
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:36.721
It's easy to see right through the trick.

193
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:39.021
All you have to do is stick your finger on to it.

194
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:40.421
Finger?

195
00:10:40.421 --> 00:10:42.421
With a normal mirror, there'll be a gap

196
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:44.421
between your finger and its reflection,

197
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:50.121
since a reflective coating is applied to the glass's back surface.

198
00:10:50.121 --> 00:10:52.021
But in a magic mirror, the reflective surface

199
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:53.521
is on the front surface of the glass,

200
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:55.021
the real image and the image in the mirror

201
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.621
look as if they are stuck together!

202
00:10:57.621 --> 00:11:00.721
Well, when we lit the light from this side,

203
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:03.421
we could see all the clothes that were hanging!

204
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:05.421
All the clothes hanging?

205
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:07.721
I get it!

206
00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:09.721
The closet of the next room!

207
00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:12.121
Exactly!

208
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:15.521
There's a sliding door on the closet's back wall.

209
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:18.621
If opened, the magic mirror will appear at the spot

210
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:21.221
where the mirror frame of the next room is.

211
00:11:21.221 --> 00:11:23.621
All that needs to be done after this is,

212
00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:25.421
just before taking the picture, the person in the closet

213
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:27.821
shines light on his own face.

214
00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:30.421
Then a psychic picture of that person's blurry face

215
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:33.721
emerging in the mirror is completed.

216
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:35.721
So, now you know.

217
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:38.621
The culprit desperately used the trick

218
00:11:38.621 --> 00:11:41.121
to make himself look like a monster.

219
00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:43.821
It means that he's merely human!

220
00:11:43.821 --> 00:11:46.821
So is the culprit Hakuya after all?

221
00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:50.021
Yeah! There's no doubt, he's one of the culprits!

222
00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:51.721
One of the culprits?

223
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:53.521
Does he have an accomplice?

224
00:11:53.521 --> 00:11:56.421
Hakuya's got a serious illness, doesn't he?

225
00:11:56.421 --> 00:11:58.021
He wouldn't be able to move around

226
00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:01.121
without getting help from someone else, would he?

227
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.921
And for now, the prime suspect of being an accomplice

228
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:08.321
is the oldest daughter who has been gone for several hours now.

229
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:11.921
I just got word from the gate guard

230
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:13.521
that a person was found dead in the forest

231
00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:15.821
in front of the mansion.

232
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:17.221
What?

233
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:26.721
It's the oldest daughter, Kamiyo!

234
00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:28.521
She's tied to a pole...

235
00:12:28.521 --> 00:12:29.521
Strangulation.

236
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:32.821
You're guards, aren't you?

237
00:12:32.821 --> 00:12:36.021
Haven't you seen who left to go out with her?

238
00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:39.021
No. The thing is after the man called Otaki

239
00:12:39.021 --> 00:12:41.721
and the man with a mustache drove away in the car,

240
00:12:41.721 --> 00:12:44.721
no one left out the gate.

241
00:12:44.721 --> 00:12:48.121
That can't be! Then, how did she go out of the gate?

242
00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:50.321
Are you telling me she flew through the sky or what?

243
00:12:59.713 --> 00:13:00.813
Really?

244
00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:04.013
You really didn't open the gate of the mansion

245
00:13:04.013 --> 00:13:06.113
since Mr. Otaki left with his car?

246
00:13:06.113 --> 00:13:07.613
Oh, well...

247
00:13:07.613 --> 00:13:09.513
We did open the gate once.

248
00:13:09.513 --> 00:13:12.213
Because the furniture company truck came.

249
00:13:12.213 --> 00:13:14.413
The owner had ordered the chairs

250
00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:17.913
he wanted to buy newly from several days ago

251
00:13:17.913 --> 00:13:20.213
but when we checked the package, they mistakenly

252
00:13:20.213 --> 00:13:22.413
had brought a sofa.

253
00:13:22.413 --> 00:13:25.613
So, we told them to take it back with them for today,

254
00:13:25.613 --> 00:13:27.813
and that's when there was that explosion.

255
00:13:27.813 --> 00:13:30.713
You mean of the tunnel collapsing?

256
00:13:30.713 --> 00:13:34.513
Yeah. I watched for a while.

257
00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:36.513
If the culprit used that split moment,

258
00:13:36.513 --> 00:13:40.013
it may have been possible to go out the gate without being noticed.

259
00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:42.413
But after tying the corpse to the pole,

260
00:13:42.413 --> 00:13:45.713
whoever went out would be noticed when coming back.

261
00:13:45.713 --> 00:13:49.113
Besides, why did the culprit stop part way?

262
00:13:49.113 --> 00:13:50.513
Part way?

263
00:13:50.513 --> 00:13:53.913
Look! There's a hole near the corpse.

264
00:13:53.913 --> 00:13:57.113
I think the culprit was planning to stand her corpse.

265
00:13:57.113 --> 00:13:58.213
True.

266
00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:02.913
If it's the same culprit who killed Ms. Shimizu six months ago,

267
00:14:02.913 --> 00:14:06.413
the culprit might've done it to drain her blood.

268
00:14:06.413 --> 00:14:08.213
The strange bruise on the right upper arm

269
00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:11.513
of the corpse bothers me too.

270
00:14:11.513 --> 00:14:13.013
The thing that bothers me most though

271
00:14:13.013 --> 00:14:17.213
is that the fingertips of both her hands are wounded badly.

272
00:14:17.213 --> 00:14:20.313
True. It doesn't look like something that was incurred

273
00:14:20.313 --> 00:14:22.613
when she tried to fight the culprit off either.

274
00:14:26.513 --> 00:14:28.713
Kamiyo...

275
00:14:28.713 --> 00:14:31.913
Was found killed in the forest?

276
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:34.013
Was it really Honey?

277
00:14:34.013 --> 00:14:35.313
Yeah.

278
00:14:35.313 --> 00:14:38.913
Oh, no. Why?

279
00:14:38.913 --> 00:14:41.813
More than that, who's the culprit?

280
00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:43.613
The gate guards should've witnessed somebody, right?

281
00:14:43.613 --> 00:14:46.313
They say that after Inspector Otaki left by car,

282
00:14:46.313 --> 00:14:49.113
no one went in or out of the gate.

283
00:14:49.113 --> 00:14:50.413
Nobody did?

284
00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:51.713
It can't be.

285
00:14:51.713 --> 00:14:53.913
Maybe there are other hidden corridors or something

286
00:14:53.913 --> 00:14:56.513
and the culprit could've gone out of the gate from there?

287
00:14:56.513 --> 00:14:59.513
I looked once around the fences of the mansion,

288
00:14:59.513 --> 00:15:02.113
but there was nowhere that you could go out from.

289
00:15:02.113 --> 00:15:05.213
The gate guards said that there are sensors on top of the fence

290
00:15:05.213 --> 00:15:09.613
and if someone were to go over it, they would be caught right away.

291
00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:13.013
Then, maybe from a tunnel or something from the mansion?

292
00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:17.313
The owner made renovations on the mansion in just a week.

293
00:15:17.313 --> 00:15:21.413
There's no way that a tunnel can be dug in such a short time.

294
00:15:21.413 --> 00:15:23.013
That's ridiculous?

295
00:15:23.013 --> 00:15:26.113
Then how did the culprit make it out of the gate?

296
00:15:26.113 --> 00:15:28.013
Moreover, take Kamiyo along?

297
00:15:28.013 --> 00:15:30.013
They flew.

298
00:15:30.013 --> 00:15:35.713
Hakuya who turned into a vampire with those abhorrent wings.

299
00:15:36.913 --> 00:15:38.413
Cool head, Ruri.

300
00:15:38.413 --> 00:15:40.513
This young police detective said that

301
00:15:40.513 --> 00:15:42.713
there're no such things as vampires, didn't he?

302
00:15:42.713 --> 00:15:44.813
Police detective? No, wrong.

303
00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:48.513
I'm Heiji Hattori! A high school detective from Osaka!

304
00:15:48.513 --> 00:15:50.113
A detective?

305
00:15:50.113 --> 00:15:52.713
I thought you were too young to be a police detective.

306
00:15:52.713 --> 00:15:54.813
You're only a high school kid?

307
00:15:54.813 --> 00:15:57.113
Well, I'm going to check things a bit more,

308
00:15:57.113 --> 00:15:59.813
so will you all wait in the dining room again?

309
00:15:59.813 --> 00:16:02.213
-Hey. -You've gotta be kidding!

310
00:16:02.213 --> 00:16:04.513
I was listening to you because I thought you were an officer but...

311
00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:07.313
Honey was killed after all too!

312
00:16:07.313 --> 00:16:10.713
I'll protect myself on my own.

313
00:16:10.713 --> 00:16:12.713
Everyone... Hey, hold it!

314
00:16:12.713 --> 00:16:16.413
Oh. So you're not a police officer.

315
00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:20.213
But if you're a detective, are you training under Mr. Mouri?

316
00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:24.313
Huh? Why should I train under that goofy?

317
00:16:26.813 --> 00:16:28.413
That's right!

318
00:16:28.413 --> 00:16:30.413
I'm supposed to be getting a certificate of proficiency

319
00:16:30.413 --> 00:16:32.113
from my trainer Mouri soon.

320
00:16:33.313 --> 00:16:34.913
Then, can you figure out

321
00:16:34.913 --> 00:16:38.213
the trick of how the owner swung his body around?

322
00:16:38.213 --> 00:16:39.313
Swung?

323
00:16:39.313 --> 00:16:42.413
Remember, the time when the owner stuck his head out

324
00:16:42.413 --> 00:16:46.113
from the window of the dining room hanging.

325
00:16:46.113 --> 00:16:48.513
But, before the curtains were opened,

326
00:16:48.513 --> 00:16:49.813
the owner's silhouette that was lit up

327
00:16:49.813 --> 00:16:51.313
the flash of lightning came from below

328
00:16:51.313 --> 00:16:53.513
and wasn't upside.

329
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:57.313
Moreover, his body seemed to be like that of a ghost!

330
00:17:02.213 --> 00:17:03.513
If I remember correctly, it was here, wasn't it?

331
00:17:03.513 --> 00:17:05.213
The place where the owner's neck was seen through the window.

332
00:17:05.213 --> 00:17:06.413
Yeah.

333
00:17:10.413 --> 00:17:12.113
How about it, Kudo?

334
00:17:12.113 --> 00:17:14.013
Just as we figured!

335
00:17:14.013 --> 00:17:16.613
Which means that the thing in question...

336
00:17:23.413 --> 00:17:25.713
Great idea.

337
00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:29.213
But this large-scale trick...

338
00:17:29.213 --> 00:17:31.013
Isn't something that can be done right after

339
00:17:31.013 --> 00:17:32.913
coming to his mansion.

340
00:17:32.913 --> 00:17:36.613
Uh, the foursome, do they come to this mansion often?

341
00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:43.013
They were here when I was a child and my mother brought me here.

342
00:17:43.013 --> 00:17:46.013
But after becoming a maid, it's the first time I've met them.

343
00:17:46.013 --> 00:17:50.313
It's been a year since they've all been here.

344
00:17:50.313 --> 00:17:53.013
Everyone asks about how Hakuya is doing

345
00:17:53.013 --> 00:17:56.313
or about his health on the phone.

346
00:17:56.313 --> 00:17:59.213
But they rarely come here.

347
00:17:59.213 --> 00:18:03.713
That's why I thought that somebody among them was "pregnant"

348
00:18:03.713 --> 00:18:07.613
and gathered here to celebrate.

349
00:18:07.613 --> 00:18:09.113
Pregnant?

350
00:18:09.113 --> 00:18:13.513
Because the owner was buying a pool for children

351
00:18:13.513 --> 00:18:16.013
and toy planes by internet shopping

352
00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:19.613
which I thought were gifts for the coming baby!

353
00:18:19.613 --> 00:18:20.913
Before I became a maid here,

354
00:18:20.913 --> 00:18:24.113
he used to often buy me clothes and such, too.

355
00:18:24.113 --> 00:18:27.513
Is that airplane one that flaps its wings and flies?

356
00:18:27.513 --> 00:18:30.813
Yes, it was written so on the invoice.

357
00:18:30.813 --> 00:18:35.613
I thought the box was quite large to be a child's toy.

358
00:18:35.613 --> 00:18:39.313
But, when I asked Kamiyo who came with Mr. Hagawa,

359
00:18:39.313 --> 00:18:41.913
whether she was pregnant,

360
00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:45.213
they said, "No, no way" while laughing.

361
00:18:45.213 --> 00:18:50.013
Then, Kishiharu who came later, was holding a big bag,

362
00:18:50.013 --> 00:18:53.213
so I thought that maybe he had brought a gift.

363
00:18:53.213 --> 00:18:55.213
But, he told me that he had his camera

364
00:18:55.213 --> 00:18:57.013
and tools for developing films inside.

365
00:18:57.013 --> 00:18:59.413
I also asked Mr. and Mrs. Asanobu Torakura

366
00:18:59.413 --> 00:19:02.113
who came a bit earlier than you did, about it,

367
00:19:02.113 --> 00:19:03.513
And Ruri remarked,

368
00:19:03.513 --> 00:19:06.813
"I wonder if Mina and Mr. Hagawa got back together again?"

369
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:09.113
Then, did you ask everybody else too?

370
00:19:09.113 --> 00:19:13.213
Yes, because they came a bit later than you did.

371
00:19:13.213 --> 00:19:15.313
I was given the cold shoulder, though.

372
00:19:15.313 --> 00:19:17.313
Get back together again? Does that mean that...

373
00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:20.013
Mina and Mr. Hagawa were going with each other?

374
00:19:20.013 --> 00:19:23.013
Yes. But, it seems that passionate Mina

375
00:19:23.013 --> 00:19:27.013
came on too strong for Mr. Hawgawa.

376
00:19:27.013 --> 00:19:29.613
And, before we knew it, Mr. Hagawa had changed partners to Kamiyo.

377
00:19:29.613 --> 00:19:32.413
Then, what about Kishiharu and Ruri?

378
00:19:32.413 --> 00:19:36.413
Those two were engaged to begin with

379
00:19:36.413 --> 00:19:39.213
but after Yoko passed away because of the accident,

380
00:19:39.213 --> 00:19:41.713
Kishiharu became deeply depressed

381
00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:43.913
and called off the engagement.

382
00:19:43.913 --> 00:19:48.513
Then, Asanobu proposed to Ruri and they got married.

383
00:19:48.513 --> 00:19:50.213
It seems that Kishiharu

384
00:19:50.213 --> 00:19:56.913
really liked Yoko who was the owner's fiance.

385
00:19:56.913 --> 00:19:58.713
On the day of Yoko's funeral,

386
00:19:58.713 --> 00:20:01.313
he was crying more than the owner.

387
00:20:01.313 --> 00:20:04.513
But, I heard the maids say that

388
00:20:04.513 --> 00:20:06.813
you were crying a lot too, Mr. Koga.

389
00:20:06.813 --> 00:20:09.513
They say it was probably because you got along very well with her.

390
00:20:09.513 --> 00:20:11.513
No.

391
00:20:11.513 --> 00:20:13.513
Things sort of seem so messed up.

392
00:20:13.513 --> 00:20:17.713
Yeah. Everyone seems to have a motive.

393
00:20:19.813 --> 00:20:22.813
Oh, it's text mail from Kishiharu.

394
00:20:22.813 --> 00:20:25.813
He wants me to bring sake up to his room.

395
00:20:25.813 --> 00:20:28.813
Does he know your mail address?

396
00:20:28.813 --> 00:20:31.113
Not only does Kishiharu know!

397
00:20:31.113 --> 00:20:33.013
On the day before they came here,

398
00:20:33.013 --> 00:20:34.613
I sent everyone text mail

399
00:20:34.613 --> 00:20:36.513
that we'd be waiting for them to arrive.

400
00:20:36.513 --> 00:20:38.413
Why go out of your way to do so?

401
00:20:38.413 --> 00:20:39.413
Because the other day,

402
00:20:39.413 --> 00:20:43.613
the owner gave me everyone's mail address so...

403
00:20:43.613 --> 00:20:45.613
I thought he meant for me to greet all

404
00:20:45.613 --> 00:20:49.513
who were coming beforehand, so I sent out the text mail.

405
00:20:49.513 --> 00:20:52.513
I often exchange text mail with the owner, you see.

406
00:20:52.513 --> 00:20:56.213
Then, when he told you to come to the European room also...

407
00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.513
Yes. I got texted!

408
00:20:58.513 --> 00:21:00.313
-See! -After breakfast,

409
00:21:00.313 --> 00:21:03.113
come to the European room, without telling anyone about it.

410
00:21:03.113 --> 00:21:06.313
Make sure that the butler doesn't see you coming.

411
00:21:06.313 --> 00:21:09.713
But, I saw this mail after noon,

412
00:21:09.713 --> 00:21:13.813
so, I ended up standing him up.

413
00:21:13.813 --> 00:21:15.913
You didn't notice the mail?

414
00:21:15.913 --> 00:21:17.913
I had completely forgotten that

415
00:21:17.913 --> 00:21:20.913
I was charging my cell phone in the bathroom.

416
00:21:20.913 --> 00:21:23.313
It's from Kishiharu, asking me to come ASAP!

417
00:21:23.313 --> 00:21:24.913
I've got to go!

418
00:21:25.213 --> 00:21:27.513
From the text mail...

419
00:21:27.513 --> 00:21:32.313
It doesn't sound like the owner doesn't like her at all.

420
00:21:32.313 --> 00:21:35.913
No joke, you mean nobody's coming to eat the pot sticks?

421
00:21:35.913 --> 00:21:37.313
Have they all gone to sleep?

422
00:21:37.313 --> 00:21:41.413
No. I think that everyone is up

423
00:21:41.413 --> 00:21:43.713
but doesn't feel up to eating.

424
00:21:43.713 --> 00:21:47.213
I think it's best that both of you hurry and get to bed.

425
00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:51.113
Oh, no. When the pot sticks came out so deliciously...

426
00:21:51.113 --> 00:21:54.913
But we ate most of it already.

427
00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:56.613
True.

428
00:21:56.613 --> 00:21:59.313
What shall we do if Conan and Heiji come to eat some?

429
00:21:59.313 --> 00:22:03.513
We've got more ingredients, so we could just make more, right?

430
00:22:06.013 --> 00:22:08.513
I'm sure the culprit is that person.

431
00:22:08.513 --> 00:22:10.013
Right, Kudo?

432
00:22:10.013 --> 00:22:13.313
Yeah. But we have no proof.

433
00:22:13.313 --> 00:22:14.613
Besides...

434
00:22:14.613 --> 00:22:18.013
The way that Kamiyo was killed.

435
00:22:18.013 --> 00:22:21.513
Unless we can figure out that trick, our hands are tied.

436
00:22:21.513 --> 00:22:24.913
How did that person go pass the gate

437
00:22:24.913 --> 00:22:27.813
and kill Kamiyo in the forest?

438
00:23:52.313 --> 00:23:54.813
I hope my daughter's okay?

439
00:24:02.813 --> 00:24:05.413
Now we know for sure

440
00:24:05.413 --> 00:24:10.313
that we're not dealing with a vampire with wings.

441
00:24:10.313 --> 00:24:13.813
Yeah. It's an evil creature all right.

442
00:24:13.813 --> 00:24:16.513
But it's a murderer rather than a vampire!

443
00:24:16.513 --> 00:24:18.013
Next Conan,

444
00:24:18.013 --> 00:24:22.113
"Heiji Hattori and the Vampire Mansion (Four)"

445
00:24:37.813 --> 00:24:39.413
Next Conan's Hint:

446
00:24:39.413 --> 00:24:42.213
"Hidden Corridor"

447
00:24:42.213 --> 00:24:43.413
Hattori, doesn't something smell?

448
00:24:43.413 --> 00:24:45.113
Sorry, it's the pot sticks. I ate them.

449
00:24:45.113 --> 00:24:47.113
I'm talking about the case.
