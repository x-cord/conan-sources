1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,599
Memories!

2
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:04,699
I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:06,999
The last page of a book and a stone disappears.

4
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:08,799
Where will everyone's deduction turn to?

5
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:10,299
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:11,999
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,299
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,959
"Library"

9
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,359
Bummers, how long has it been since I wrote my last book report?

10
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,759
Hey, Conan.

11
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,259
You don't look like you want to write your book report.

12
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,759
What? Not really.

13
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:15,459
What do you mean by not really?

14
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:18,359
Haibara has gone home long ago.

15
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:22,159
Ayumi and Genta are both working seriously on it.

16
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,159
I can understand that Ayumi is working hard, but Genta?

17
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,859
What a thing to say.

18
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:30,459
Conan, you're the only one that's not taking it seriously.

19
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,059
See, look at Genta.

20
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,859
This looks delicious!

21
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,059
Hey, Genta.

22
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,659
Hey, hey.

23
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,959
Okay! I've decided this is what it's going to be.

24
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,459
Hey, Genta!

25
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,359
Do you know what a book report is?

26
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:52,459
Oh, come on.

27
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,159
Huh?

28
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,659
What's the matter?

29
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,559
Something's strange.

30
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,659
What?

31
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,759
Conan, look at this.

32
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,859
See!

33
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:08,159
Maybe somebody's just playing a prank?

34
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,859
Why would someone do something like this?

35
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,659
Why don't you choose another book then?

36
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,759
No!

37
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,359
I want to write a book report on this book.

38
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,559
But...

39
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:20,159
Conan, you'll help me look for it, won't you?

40
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:22,659
There's a hint.

41
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,659
Maybe if we ask this kid, we'll find out something.

42
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,059
"Tsukasa Naito, 1st grade class A"

43
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:33,159
You mean, I have to go, too?

44
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:36,559
I think it's very wrong to rip a page out of a school book.

45
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,859
Give me a break.

46
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:47,259
"The Missing Page"

47
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,859
What's wrong? I mean it looks so good.

48
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:54,259
That's why I've been explaining from a while ago.

49
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,759
Listen, Genta.

50
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,859
A book report is...

51
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,359
That hurts.

52
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,659
Ouch!

53
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,659
Hold it, mister!

54
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,559
Are you all right, Genta?

55
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,759
How rude can he get?

56
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,459
He didn't even apologize after bumping into you.

57
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,059
I've never seen him before.

58
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,159
No.

59
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,359
What's going on over there?

60
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,959
-Let's go and see. -Huh?

61
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,259
"1st grade class A"

62
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,559
I wonder which one he is.

63
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,259
Maybe he already went home?

64
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:36,059
Is there a Tsukasa Naito here?

65
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,659
Tsukasa is absent today.

66
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,459
I guess it can't be helped then.

67
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:43,159
Let's go home, too.

68
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,859
He's absent without calling in sick,

69
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:47,159
so the teacher's worried about him, too.

70
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,859
You mean nobody called from his house?

71
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:55,559
I'm not sure because he just transferred to our school since autumn.

72
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,959
I see.

73
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,459
It looked like he wasn't too happy though.

74
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,159
I wonder if anything happened?

75
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,559
"The Adventures of Aleck" -I wonder...

76
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,559
if it has anything to do with this book?

77
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,259
Oh, that book!

78
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,559
Do you know about it?

79
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,459
Yes. Tsukasa told me about it.

80
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,059
Tsukasa did?

81
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:18,059
Even though school was over, he was still reading it.

82
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:20,659
So I was kind of curious

83
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:23,159
and asked him what he was reading.

84
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,359
It's about Aleck.

85
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:28,659
Oh, Aleck is the name of the main character.

86
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,459
One day, he lost the harmonica that he cherished.

87
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,359
So he finds a knowledgeable turtle,

88
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,859
who tells him that if he can find the "Again Stone",

89
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:41,259
he can get back what he lost.

90
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,859
But in order to find that stone,

91
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:46,059
one must have a kind and courageous heart.

92
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:50,159
Aleck tries everything he can and finally found the stone.

93
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,459
When he raises that stone in the air,

94
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,359
the harmonica that he lost comes falling from the sky.

95
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,759
I said that it would be nice if such a stone really existed,

96
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,259
and Tsukasa answered, "Yeah" with a smile.

97
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,459
Hey, let's go there.

98
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,959
Go where?

99
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,559
Where else?

100
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,259
To Tsukasa's house, of course.

101
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:12,959
What?

102
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,859
Excuse me, excuse me!

103
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,559
Is this a case or something?

104
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,159
Of course not.

105
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,359
Hey, did something happen?

106
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:24,059
The precious stone that was inside was stolen.

107
00:06:25,659 --> 00:06:26,959
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

108
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,859
-The guy we saw just a while ago. -Huh?

109
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:30,559
Don't you get it?

110
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,559
I'm sure that he's the stone thief!

111
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,759
What? Are you sure about that?

112
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,859
That's why he fled the way he did.

113
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:41,359
All right, it's time for Youth Detective Squad to get to work!

114
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,359
Genta!

115
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,859
Here goes!

116
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,459
Hey, Genta!

117
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,159
We've got the map too, so I guess we have nothing to worry about.

118
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,159
Yeah.

119
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,459
What's the matter, Ms. Kobayashi?

120
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,559
Conan.

121
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:58,859
Actually, something troublesome happened.

122
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:00,559
Troublesome?

123
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,159
Yes. The truth is...

124
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,059
a stone was lent to us from Beika Museum

125
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,059
for a limited period of a week to be put on exhibit.

126
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:10,559
It has been stolen.

127
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,859
It's a very valuable stone.

128
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:15,859
And today is the day we promised to return it.

129
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:17,159
Ms. Kobayashi.

130
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,359
May I look inside the science room?

131
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:27,559
It was definitely there during yesterday's class.

132
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,659
This is pretty audacious.

133
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,659
It doesn't look like something a professional would do.

134
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,659
"Advent Stone"

135
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,359
Advent Stone?

136
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,159
That's right, the book.

137
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,059
Ayumi, will you please show me that book?

138
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,359
Huh?

139
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,559
Yes.

140
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,559
Here you go!

141
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,259
Thank you.

142
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,459
A stone is definitely here, too.

143
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:56,559
The Again Stone and the Advent Stone.

144
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,659
"Again Stone"

145
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,659
"Advent Stone"

146
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:03,959
I see.

147
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,959
The one who stole the stone probably read this book.

148
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,359
Tsukasa returned this book yesterday.

149
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,159
And there's probably no doubt that the stone was stolen

150
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,859
between after school yesterday and today.

151
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:20,359
What's the matter, Conan?

152
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:21,859
All right.

153
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:23,459
Let's go, Ayumi.

154
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,159
To look for the stone thief?

155
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:28,059
To Tsukasa's house.

156
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,359
I'm starved.

157
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,659
We lost him.

158
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,259
He was just in front of us a second ago.

159
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,259
What is it?

160
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,559
That's the stone thief.

161
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,659
Let's go, Mitsuhiko!

162
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,659
Okay!

163
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,859
We lost him again.

164
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,859
No, I'm almost certain he went this way.

165
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,959
"Yakitori Naito"

166
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,659
It could be over here.

167
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:05,859
Okay!

168
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,159
Hey!

169
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,659
Who are you guys?

170
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,759
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,159
Please spare my life!

172
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,859
Are you saying that Tsukasa is the one who stole the stone?

173
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,059
If Tsukasa is the one who ripped the page off the book,

174
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,059
the probability is high.

175
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:31,559
If so, Tsukasa's a bad boy.

176
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,659
Like I said, I'm not sure yet.

177
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,159
Here it is.

178
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,359
"Yakitori Naito"

179
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,359
Excuse me.

180
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,159
What are you guys doing here?

181
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:56,759
Conan?

182
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,959
If you like, why don't you guys have some, too?

183
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,859
Excuse me, sir.

184
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,959
You found out that Tsukasa didn't go to school

185
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,559
after Ms. Kobayashi called you, right?

186
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,959
Don't you have any idea where he could've gone?

187
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,059
Aren't you worried about Tsukasa?

188
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,059
I am, but I'm still going to eat.

189
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,859
It's true that we ended up here by mistake

190
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,259
and is eating thanks to you,

191
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,759
but now that things are out in the light, it's another story.

192
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,959
I'm going to have to open the shop soon, so I'm busy.

193
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
Isn't your wife helping you?

194
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,759
It's none of your business!

195
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,959
Hey, sir.

196
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,559
May we take a look at Tsukasa's room?

197
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,659
We may be able to get a clue or something.

198
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,759
Why would you want to do something like that?

199
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,159
Because we're worried about Tsukasa.

200
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,759
What are you doing, Tsukasa?

201
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:10,859
Nothing.

202
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:14,059
You're a boy, why don't you go play soccer with your friends or something?

203
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,259
I don't have any friends.

204
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,559
You're Tsukasa's...

205
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,459
Friends.

206
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,359
If my deduction is correct,

207
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:41,259
after reading that book, Tsukasa found the stone in the science room

208
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,359
and believed that the stone on exhibit was the "Again Stone."

209
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:49,759
He came to school this morning, stole the stone and disappeared.

210
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,559
But why?

211
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,259
What on earth is Tsukasa trying to get back?

212
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:56,659
Conan.

213
00:11:56,659 --> 00:11:59,359
Maybe this is...

214
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,559
Tsukasa's mother?

215
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,259
She passed away.

216
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,459
She looks kind.

217
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,759
But now she's no longer around.

218
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:26,059
Maybe...

219
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:40,268
How was it?

220
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:43,768
His father doesn't seem to know where this beach is.

221
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:46,468
Something about it being a secret place that he shared with his mother.

222
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:47,768
I see.

223
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,468
Could Tsukasa be at this beach?

224
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:51,968
We still can't know for sure.

225
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,368
Hey, Conan.

226
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:54,668
Did you find anything?

227
00:12:54,668 --> 00:12:56,568
There were a lot of things.

228
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:05,068
Ayumi, bring me the book.

229
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:06,568
Okay.

230
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,168
Flipped to the ripped page.

231
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,168
Okay.

232
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:13,768
All right.

233
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:18,668
There's no mistake that Tsukasa is the one who ripped the page off.

234
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:23,068
He brought this page home and cut off the unneeded parts.

235
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:27,268
Which means that Tsukasa is the one who stole the stone, too?

236
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,268
Yeah. You did it, Genta!

237
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:33,068
The stopper's been removed.

238
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:35,168
Let's open it.

239
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:40,868
What's this memo about?

240
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:42,168
Something's written on it.

241
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,468
What does it say?

242
00:13:43,468 --> 00:13:45,068
Crab is scissors, scissors.

243
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:46,368
The orange is paper.

244
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,868
The green caterpillar is rock.

245
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,668
Paper scissors.

246
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:50,668
What do you think it is?

247
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:54,168
It looks like some kind of code.

248
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,268
Sure does.

249
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,068
Genta, you should think about it, too.

250
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,068
This could be a hint.

251
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,168
Crab scissors, scissors?

252
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,268
What is this?

253
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,068
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

254
00:14:06,068 --> 00:14:07,968
Genta, keep it up.

255
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:09,668
Keep it up, please.

256
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:12,168
Keep it up? You mean this?

257
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:17,068
Crab scissors, scissors.

258
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:18,368
I've figured it out.

259
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:21,068
I know what that code means.

260
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,468
This ocean is a secret place that Tsukasa shared

261
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:25,368
only with his mother, right?

262
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:28,268
And a code is written on a paper inserted behind the picture.

263
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,668
That code means map.

264
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:33,068
In other words, it shows what direction to go.

265
00:14:33,068 --> 00:14:35,068
That's right, Mitsuhiko.

266
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,468
Therefore, well...

267
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:38,468
You see...

268
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:42,168
You mean he rode a crab to get there?

269
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:43,268
That's right.

270
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:45,068
A crab is red, isn't it?

271
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:48,268
This stands for the TR Tohto Line.

272
00:14:48,268 --> 00:14:49,568
Keep going.

273
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,568
To make scissors, scissors, you use four fingers.

274
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:53,268
Therefore...

275
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,368
Station.

276
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:56,768
I think it stands for the number of stations.

277
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:58,768
-Okay! -What do you plan to do?

278
00:14:58,768 --> 00:15:00,868
Let's hurry and go before it starts to get dark!

279
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,068
All right.

280
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:08,068
Four stations on the Tohto Line from Beika Station.

281
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:11,768
Hey, that could work for either inbound or outbound.

282
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:13,668
The next is orange.

283
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,568
The colour of the train is orange.

284
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,968
The Sakaimachi Line and Minato Line are both orange.

285
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:19,968
Wait a second.

286
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:22,168
Why did he put the honorific "san" on the crab?

287
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,968
Maybe because the crab is a big shot?

288
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:25,568
It's platform number 3.

289
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:27,168
The super express leaves from platforms 1 and 2, right?

290
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,168
So if it's platform 3...

291
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:29,268
It's the train going up.

292
00:15:29,268 --> 00:15:30,268
Yeah.

293
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:36,068
We transfer to the Minato Line from the next station

294
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,668
and since it's paper from there, we ride five stations.

295
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,668
The problem is after that.

296
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:41,668
Yes.

297
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:49,368
"Yakitori Naito"

298
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:50,468
Yes.

299
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:52,168
Yes, all right.

300
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,968
Thank you for your help.

301
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:17,868
I'm home!

302
00:16:20,268 --> 00:16:22,468
I really had a lot of fun, Daddy.

303
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:27,368
Mommy was really funny.

304
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:29,268
When the wave came...

305
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,368
I keep telling you to come in from the back!

306
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:33,968
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:35,968
This is a gift for you.

308
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:38,468
Next time, let's go together, Daddy.

309
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:47,068
"Ohama"

310
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:55,368
We're in trouble, Conan.

311
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,868
There seems to be no train we can transfer to from this station.

312
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:00,668
Stone stands for zero, right?

313
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:03,368
But there's no such thing as a platform zero, is there?

314
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,868
That's true.

315
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,868
I wonder what the green caterpillar stands for?

316
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:12,268
A bus terminal.

317
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:14,468
Bus stop Number 0.

318
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:17,468
If the green caterpillar stands for a bus, it's possible, right?

319
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:18,568
That's right!

320
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:19,568
Let's go.

321
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,268
So it wasn't a real caterpillar...

322
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:22,268
Wait up!

323
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:27,268
Isn't this the green caterpillar?

324
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:28,668
I'm sure it is!

325
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:30,168
I'll go ask.

326
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:33,668
Are you sure this is right, Conan?

327
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,168
What if Tsukasa isn't there?

328
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:38,468
Don't worry about it.

329
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:39,668
How was it?

330
00:17:39,668 --> 00:17:41,168
No doubt about it.

331
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:42,968
We go paper, then scissors on that bus.

332
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:45,968
That is, we ride seven stations to Ohama Beach!

333
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:48,568
That settles it, then.

334
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:59,868
I'm sure that Tsukasa is at that beach.

335
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:03,868
The ocean's come into view.

336
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:05,868
Okay, we're almost there.

337
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:15,068
It's the ocean, the ocean!

338
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,468
We didn't come here to have fun, you know!

339
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,368
Let's split up and look for him.

340
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:20,868
Let me know as soon as you find him.

341
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,768
-Okay! -Let's go, too.

342
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,768
Okay.

343
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,668
Please! We've got to find him!

344
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,368
Tsukasa.

345
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:54,868
We've finally found the last page.

346
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,168
Tsukasa?

347
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:59,868
You're Tsukasa Naito from 1st grade class A, right?

348
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,168
Who are you two?

349
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:05,668
We're from Teitan Elementary School, just like you.

350
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:07,268
I'm Conan Edogawa.

351
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:09,568
I'm Ayumi Yoshida.

352
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:10,568
We...

353
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:11,768
The ocean, the ocean!

354
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:14,168
So there you are, Tsukasa!

355
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,368
We've come all the way here, so let's play here for a while.

356
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:19,368
Why not?

357
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:20,468
You too, Tsukasa!

358
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,568
-Huh? Okay. -Let's sumo wrestle!

359
00:19:24,668 --> 00:19:28,268
Okay. Let's play sumo!

360
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,768
You're not going to get me!

361
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:33,168
He's fired up!

362
00:19:35,268 --> 00:19:37,168
Bring it!

363
00:19:37,168 --> 00:19:38,268
I'm ready when you are!

364
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:40,768
Tsukasa looks to be having fun.

365
00:19:40,768 --> 00:19:42,268
Yeah.

366
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:45,368
But how did you figure out he was here?

367
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:46,968
The ocean in that picture

368
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,968
looked just like the padded cloth page in the book.

369
00:19:50,168 --> 00:19:51,168
Is that all?

370
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:52,468
I thought that there must a reason

371
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:56,068
for Tsukasa to rip a page off the book and steal the stone.

372
00:19:56,068 --> 00:20:00,768
So I thought of what he might want back despite doing all that he did.

373
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:02,668
The conclusion was...

374
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:03,868
His mother?

375
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,568
Yes.

376
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:10,968
Tsukasa wanted to use the power of the stone to get his mother back.

377
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:14,068
I guess all the rest was thanks to Mitsuhiko's deduction.

378
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:16,968
-Hey. -Tsukasa!

379
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:22,068
Daddy?

380
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:25,268
What about the shop?

381
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:26,968
It's okay.

382
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:28,268
How?

383
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,368
How did you know I was here?

384
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,468
This led me here.

385
00:20:32,468 --> 00:20:36,468
"Ohama Beach"

386
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,368
I'm sorry, Daddy.

387
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:43,368
I thought that I could see Mommy if I came here.

388
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:00,368
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:07,468
Tsukasa.

390
00:21:19,968 --> 00:21:22,868
Now that I'm here, I'm hungry again.

391
00:21:22,868 --> 00:21:25,368
Mr. Naito, will you make me some grilled chicken again?

392
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,368
Come on, Genta!

393
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:28,468
It's okay.

394
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:30,268
Be friends with Tsukasa from now on too, okay?

395
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:33,168
Yeah, you can count on me!

396
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:04,368
Did you find this, Tsukasa?

397
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:05,368
Ms. Kobayashi.

398
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:08,868
-Well... -Thank you.

399
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:12,168
We were all looking for it too, but we couldn't find it anywhere.

400
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,468
Ms. Kobayashi, I took the stone.

401
00:23:26,968 --> 00:23:29,868
I'm happy you decided to tell the truth.

402
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,368
But don't ever do something like this again, okay?

403
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:35,768
I'm sorry.

404
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:42,468
Ms. Kobayashi, please look through my homework.

405
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,768
How fast.

406
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:45,968
"Delicious!"

407
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,568
Is this your book report?

408
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:50,268
Doesn't it look good?

409
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:52,268
Come on, Genta!

410
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:54,568
Our homework is to hand in a book report.

411
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:57,568
That's more like a picture diary.

412
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:59,068
Just as would be expected of Genta.

413
00:23:59,068 --> 00:24:02,368
I mean, is eating all he has in mind?

414
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,168
"Next Episode"

415
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:09,468
A popular musician is found dead by a river.

416
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:11,568
"Roku Itagaki (22)"

417
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:16,468
Then suddenly, a father and child shows up at Pops' detective agency.

418
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:20,068
The boy says that he witnessed the killer.

419
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:24,468
He says that he saw the picture of a nail on the killer's arm, but...

420
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:33,968
Next Conan, "The Shadow of the Black Organization: The Little Witness"

421
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,568
Next Conan's Hint:

422
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,168
"A hammer that flashes"

423
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:55,368
The Black Organization appears!

424
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,968
Each and every colour is mixed.

425
00:24:56,968 --> 00:24:58,868
That's the colour of the organization.
