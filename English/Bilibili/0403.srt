1
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.140
Stars are for some reason attractive.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.840
They can be the culprit or an actor.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.540
A smile-less angel is the client.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.040
The Youth Detective Squad go into a mansion

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.740
and find themselves in a bizarre labyrinth.

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.940
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:09.425
Hey.

10
00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:12.025
Look at this lonely girl.

11
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:17.125
Hey, Conan! Come over here! Right now!

12
00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:20.525
We got a client for the Youth Detective Squad!

13
00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:22.225
Just come, we got a nice one.

14
00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:31.425
Hey, she's really cute, isn't she?

15
00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:32.625
She gives me high motivation, man.

16
00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:33.925
Yeah.

17
00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:46.325
"Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 1)"

18
00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:49.725
One day, this man named "Clock" came to me.

19
00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:52.625
Clock, you mean, that clock?

20
00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.525
Yes.

21
00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:56.625
He doesn't have either a first or last name.

22
00:02:56.625 --> 00:02:58.525
Just "Clock".

23
00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:00.825
He is your mother's grandfather,

24
00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:03.125
and your great-grandfather.

25
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:05.525
He name is Gozo Isegawa.

26
00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:07.425
My great-grandfather.

27
00:03:07.425 --> 00:03:09.325
I didn't know I had a great-grandfather.

28
00:03:10.525 --> 00:03:14.525
With his resilience, he dominated the Japanese stock market after the war.

29
00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:16.525
He was a legendary market player

30
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:19.725
who achieved numerous wealth in one generation.

31
00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:21.325
People called him "Raging Bull".

32
00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.325
However unfortunately,

33
00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:27.925
last winter...

34
00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:32.925
Clock.

35
00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.125
Yes.

36
00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.725
Master.

37
00:03:41.725 --> 00:03:44.325
I, the Raging Bull, shall give my entire fortune

38
00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:48.525
to whoever solves this riddle.

39
00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:52.325
However, the time limit is 24 hours.

40
00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:53.925
Once the time is over,

41
00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:58.225
one will lose the right of both inheritance and challenge forever.

42
00:03:58.225 --> 00:04:01.525
The challengers will be restricted to my sons, wife,

43
00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:04.925
and grandchildren, with the ones with closer blood relationship first.

44
00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:08.725
And I want you to see it through.

45
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:11.225
Please, you're not dying, Master.

46
00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:16.325
In the end, nobody ever visited me.

47
00:04:16.325 --> 00:04:17.825
Well, one gets what one deserves,

48
00:04:17.825 --> 00:04:21.225
I know that, but still, dying alone is a lonely thing.

49
00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:23.425
What the heck is my family for?

50
00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:26.925
Please, calm down. You should completely rest.

51
00:04:26.925 --> 00:04:30.325
The Raging Bull was a miserable cow, after all.

52
00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:45.825
So, that was my great-grandfather's end.

53
00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:46.825
And...

54
00:04:46.825 --> 00:04:49.325
As the secretary and executor of Mr. Gozo Isegawa,

55
00:04:49.325 --> 00:04:51.925
I'm here to tell you something.

56
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.525
Ms. Yuriko Matsunaka.

57
00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:55.125
Ah, yes.

58
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.725
You are the one with the 17th right of inheritance.

59
00:04:57.725 --> 00:04:59.425
Now it is your turn.

60
00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:01.425
Me?

61
00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:04.325
Of course you have the right to abstain.

62
00:05:04.325 --> 00:05:05.725
It is up to you.

63
00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.525
By the way, I have heard that the Youth Detective Squad,

64
00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:14.325
the smart kids, are at the same school as yours.

65
00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:17.825
That's why you asked us?

66
00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:21.125
So he is actually trying not only Yuriko,

67
00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:24.425
but us to solve the riddle.

68
00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:26.825
What does your family say about that?

69
00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:30.225
My father died in a car accident right after I was born.

70
00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:32.225
So as my mother with a sickness last year.

71
00:05:32.225 --> 00:05:34.225
So I'm the only one left.

72
00:05:34.225 --> 00:05:36.925
Oh, I'm sorry.

73
00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:41.425
All my relatives disagreed with my parents' marriage.

74
00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:43.925
So they eloped and got married.

75
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:48.125
So I really don't know my relatives

76
00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:50.525
and you are the only people I could talk to.

77
00:05:50.525 --> 00:05:53.825
Okay. How do you feel about it now?

78
00:05:53.825 --> 00:05:55.325
I kind of afraid.

79
00:05:55.325 --> 00:05:58.025
But if I challenge to solve the riddle,

80
00:05:58.025 --> 00:05:59.325
I can see the house that my mother

81
00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:02.025
and great-grandfather once lived together when she was young.

82
00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:03.125
Mr. Clock told me that.

83
00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:08.025
That house is called the Angel's Mansion.

84
00:06:08.025 --> 00:06:11.325
Ms. Yuriko and the Youth Detective Squad.

85
00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:12.825
Mr. Clock!

86
00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:14.025
He's the man.

87
00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:18.025
Pleasure to meet you all.

88
00:06:19.825 --> 00:06:21.225
It's pretty far, isn't it?

89
00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:23.125
That Angel's Mansion.

90
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:27.025
It's not far once we get out of this forest.

91
00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:34.825
Oh, yes. I told your parents

92
00:06:34.825 --> 00:06:37.625
that you were going to be camping tonight,

93
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:39.525
and I have already got permission from them.

94
00:06:39.525 --> 00:06:40.625
-What? -What?

95
00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:43.525
So you've done a research on us already.

96
00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:48.725
It's there. Look.

97
00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:01.125
That's the South Angel.

98
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.225
That's the West Angel.

99
00:07:03.225 --> 00:07:05.525
That's the East Angel.

100
00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:08.425
And that's the North Angel.

101
00:07:08.425 --> 00:07:10.025
They are named this way

102
00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:13.125
since they are located in the four cardinal points precisely.

103
00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:14.225
And also...

104
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.625
I've heard that the statues' faces

105
00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:19.425
are made to look like Mr. Isegawa's wife, who happened to die young.

106
00:07:19.425 --> 00:07:21.825
My great-grandmother?

107
00:07:21.825 --> 00:07:28.025
Yes. He spent all of his earnings just to see his wife's face again.

108
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:31.925
Probably he looked like a cold father to his little sons.

109
00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:35.325
They left the house as soon as they became adults.

110
00:07:35.325 --> 00:07:37.825
In the end, he was the only one left in the house.

111
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:41.425
Sure, his sons visited him sometimes,

112
00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:44.125
but always ended up with a big fight.

113
00:07:45.225 --> 00:07:49.125
It was very sad that the people couldn't understand him well.

114
00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:58.125
"South Mansion" -See the house with the South Angel?

115
00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:00.425
We call it the South Mansion.

116
00:08:00.425 --> 00:08:03.725
That's where Mr. Isegawa spent his last moment.

117
00:08:03.725 --> 00:08:05.125
And the East Mansion over there,

118
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:07.825
"East Mansion" -was mainly his workplace.

119
00:08:07.825 --> 00:08:09.425
"North Mansion" -And that North Mansion,

120
00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:12.925
was where his sons and housekeepers used to live.

121
00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:16.425
No one lives there now but it still looks pretty neat.

122
00:08:16.425 --> 00:08:19.425
I'm trying to keep it clean all the time.

123
00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:20.925
What about that one though?

124
00:08:20.925 --> 00:08:23.925
The East Mansion is like a haunted house.

125
00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:26.025
"East Mansion" -Actually it is Mr. Isegawa's will that

126
00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:29.125
nobody goes in there, so...

127
00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.225
Why?

128
00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:31.725
I have no idea.

129
00:08:33.725 --> 00:08:35.125
What is that?

130
00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:37.325
Oh, that's Minotaur?

131
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:38.925
Minotaur?

132
00:08:38.925 --> 00:08:43.425
It's an imaginary monster, half human and half bull.

133
00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:45.125
You're really knowledgable.

134
00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:48.225
He had been called "Raging Bull".

135
00:08:48.225 --> 00:08:51.025
What else could decorate this house better?

136
00:08:51.025 --> 00:08:57.125
Oh, yeah. There are bull everywhere!

137
00:08:57.125 --> 00:09:00.725
In the stock market, the bull is a symbol of power.

138
00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:03.525
You can find statues of bulls in Wall Street, New York,

139
00:09:03.525 --> 00:09:05.225
which is the center of the stock market.

140
00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:08.725
Bulls are like guardian angels for market players.

141
00:09:10.725 --> 00:09:12.525
What's that?

142
00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:15.825
It's one of the security systems Mr. Isegawa left.

143
00:09:15.825 --> 00:09:19.325
It starts up automatically when the sun sets.

144
00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:28.725
Even after Mr. Isegawa passed away?

145
00:09:28.725 --> 00:09:33.525
Right. Until somebody solves his riddle and finds the treasures.

146
00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:35.125
The security is going to be on.

147
00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:37.225
And so am I.

148
00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:39.125
The angel is scary.

149
00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:45.125
It's an Angel's mansion under the daylight

150
00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:47.325
and a witch's mansion under the moonlight, I guess.

151
00:09:47.325 --> 00:09:50.125
There are two faces.

152
00:09:54.925 --> 00:09:57.825
"Mansion of the Raging Bull"

153
00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:01.925
Don't worry! I'm with you!

154
00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:04.125
Me too! Kind of.

155
00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:07.425
Here is the fifth mansion, the "Mansion of the Raging Bull".

156
00:10:07.425 --> 00:10:10.425
We are at the center of Mr. Isegawa's property.

157
00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:14.025
So my mother was living in this house, right?

158
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:16.625
After your parents left the mansion,

159
00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:18.525
Mr. Isegawa was always worried about them,

160
00:10:18.525 --> 00:10:21.525
so he would always visit this place alone.

161
00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:23.725
Hey, Mr. Clock.

162
00:10:23.725 --> 00:10:25.625
I think it's time for you to tell us

163
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.825
about the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

164
00:10:28.825 --> 00:10:32.525
Right. That's what we're here for.

165
00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:36.125
I'm sorry but it's not time yet, so please.

166
00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:40.525
I guess time really matters in this riddle, doesn't it?

167
00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:47.025
Well, it's time for me to serve you dinner.

168
00:10:47.025 --> 00:10:49.125
To the North Mansion, please.

169
00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:51.925
"North Mansion"

170
00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:01.925
I'm stuffed!

171
00:11:01.925 --> 00:11:03.525
Yeah, it was delicious.

172
00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:09.125
Now it's time.

173
00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:12.825
Here is the riddle Mr. Isegawa left behind.

174
00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:13.925
-What? -What?

175
00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:21.725
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

176
00:11:21.725 --> 00:11:24.925
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

177
00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:28.325
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

178
00:11:28.325 --> 00:11:29.925
That's all?

179
00:11:29.925 --> 00:11:31.625
Yes.

180
00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:35.025
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head,"

181
00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:37.925
"an angel will come down and play the flute."

182
00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:39.725
And...

183
00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:43.225
"The song of the angel is my very treasure."

184
00:11:43.225 --> 00:11:45.525
24 hours from now.

185
00:11:45.525 --> 00:11:48.325
So the time limit is 9 pm tomorrow.

186
00:11:48.325 --> 00:11:51.025
More important is, which bull he's talking about?

187
00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:57.425
Now, please, be careful.

188
00:11:57.425 --> 00:12:02.625
Some of the security systems are actually quite dangerous.

189
00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:05.725
I've seen the previous challengers getting severely injured.

190
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.225
Some of them have never returned.

191
00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:18.525
Keep in mind, this Angel's Mansion is a huge labyrinth.

192
00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:28.547
That must be it.

193
00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:31.447
That humongous bull gotta be the one, man!

194
00:12:31.447 --> 00:12:32.647
Yeah, it could be.

195
00:12:32.647 --> 00:12:35.847
But shouldn't we go with everybody else?

196
00:12:35.847 --> 00:12:39.447
Hey, you'll never beat Conan if you're like that.

197
00:12:39.447 --> 00:12:42.547
That bull's gotta be the one in Gozo's riddle!

198
00:12:42.547 --> 00:12:44.647
But, Genta...

199
00:12:47.847 --> 00:12:50.447
That bull looks to be raging, you know.

200
00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:53.447
I'm gonna find the treasure map inside its horn, and then...

201
00:12:55.847 --> 00:12:57.447
Genta, you're amazing!

202
00:12:59.047 --> 00:13:00.347
Yuriko.

203
00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:02.647
I don't think it's that simple.

204
00:13:02.647 --> 00:13:04.247
"Mansion of the Raging Bull" -We should go with the boys.

205
00:13:04.247 --> 00:13:05.947
It's dangerous.

206
00:13:05.947 --> 00:13:07.347
Yeah, but did you see Yuriko's face?

207
00:13:07.347 --> 00:13:09.747
She didn't show a smile, not even once.

208
00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:11.447
She's really sad.

209
00:13:11.447 --> 00:13:13.847
I want to solve this riddle her great-grandfather left her,

210
00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:15.547
so she can smile again.

211
00:13:15.547 --> 00:13:18.447
All right, then how come you are not checking this bull?

212
00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:20.447
Because I'm scared.

213
00:13:22.247 --> 00:13:26.547
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head."

214
00:13:26.547 --> 00:13:28.947
"When the bull's horn disappears..."

215
00:13:29.647 --> 00:13:30.847
It disappeared!

216
00:13:32.647 --> 00:13:33.747
What?

217
00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:35.947
Ai, you're fantastic!

218
00:13:40.847 --> 00:13:43.147
I get it! It must be the West Angel

219
00:13:43.147 --> 00:13:44.947
that's coming down, isn't it?

220
00:13:48.947 --> 00:13:52.247
Ayumi and Ai are saying that the West Angel is the one.

221
00:13:53.747 --> 00:13:55.847
We need to be the director to our original goals.

222
00:13:55.847 --> 00:13:57.147
Director?

223
00:13:57.147 --> 00:14:00.147
Director from where?

224
00:14:00.147 --> 00:14:01.847
You don't know?

225
00:14:01.847 --> 00:14:04.547
It means to achieve the original intentions.

226
00:14:04.547 --> 00:14:07.847
It should be carry out through to our original goals, Genta.

227
00:14:09.547 --> 00:14:11.347
But as a matter of fact,

228
00:14:11.347 --> 00:14:14.547
I smell something fishy from the East Mansion.

229
00:14:14.547 --> 00:14:20.047
It is Mr. Isegawa's will that nobody goes in there, so...

230
00:14:20.047 --> 00:14:22.147
Maybe the riddle is a lie

231
00:14:22.147 --> 00:14:25.147
and the treasures are in the East Mansion?

232
00:14:25.147 --> 00:14:27.147
Genta.

233
00:14:34.747 --> 00:14:36.747
"East Mansion"

234
00:14:46.447 --> 00:14:48.347
Thank you, Mitsuhiko.

235
00:14:48.347 --> 00:14:49.647
No problem.

236
00:14:59.347 --> 00:15:00.447
What is this thing?

237
00:15:02.747 --> 00:15:05.147
"West Angel"

238
00:15:05.647 --> 00:15:06.647
Hey.

239
00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:08.247
Ai.

240
00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:12.147
How should we make the angel come down?

241
00:15:12.147 --> 00:15:15.347
That is what we are trying to find out.

242
00:15:16.447 --> 00:15:17.547
Watch out!

243
00:15:19.247 --> 00:15:20.447
Electric shock.

244
00:15:22.647 --> 00:15:25.647
Ai?

245
00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:27.947
I guess we better go back.

246
00:15:33.447 --> 00:15:36.247
AS I expected, it is at the East Mansion.

247
00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:38.147
The treasures is somewhere in here.

248
00:15:41.747 --> 00:15:44.147
This bull has no horns!

249
00:15:44.147 --> 00:15:45.847
"When the bull's horn disappears"...

250
00:15:51.047 --> 00:15:53.347
"The tail becomes the head".

251
00:15:53.347 --> 00:15:54.847
The tail is the head...

252
00:15:54.847 --> 00:15:56.047
Head?

253
00:16:07.147 --> 00:16:08.847
Why aren't you moving?

254
00:16:08.847 --> 00:16:12.447
You! Cow!

255
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:17.247
Oh, my God!

256
00:16:17.247 --> 00:16:18.947
Help!

257
00:16:18.947 --> 00:16:20.647
Somebody help!

258
00:16:34.947 --> 00:16:36.947
Hello, anybody?

259
00:16:36.947 --> 00:16:38.647
Is anybody here?

260
00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:54.347
Mitsuhiko!

261
00:16:55.447 --> 00:16:57.947
Mr. Clock. Genta!

262
00:16:57.947 --> 00:16:59.147
You have to believe this.

263
00:16:59.147 --> 00:17:01.347
I found human bones in there.

264
00:17:01.347 --> 00:17:02.947
Bones?

265
00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:04.247
Is that true?

266
00:17:04.247 --> 00:17:07.347
I guess that's how rats end up in this labyrinth.

267
00:17:07.347 --> 00:17:10.347
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to call the police?

268
00:17:10.347 --> 00:17:12.847
Certainly, I will.

269
00:17:12.847 --> 00:17:17.247
Now you, focus on what you have to do. Time is money.

270
00:17:18.647 --> 00:17:20.947
"North Mansion"

271
00:17:22.947 --> 00:17:24.247
Where's everyone?

272
00:17:24.247 --> 00:17:25.947
They said they're going to the washroom.

273
00:17:25.947 --> 00:17:27.947
It's been too long.

274
00:17:31.047 --> 00:17:32.747
Yuriko?

275
00:17:32.747 --> 00:17:34.947
I can't sleep.

276
00:17:34.947 --> 00:17:37.047
So I'm gonna go for a little walk, okay?

277
00:17:37.047 --> 00:17:39.847
But...

278
00:17:39.847 --> 00:17:42.147
Don't worry. Just for a while.

279
00:17:48.347 --> 00:17:51.147
In the end, nobody ever visited me.

280
00:17:51.147 --> 00:17:54.647
Dying alone is a lonely thing.

281
00:18:10.247 --> 00:18:11.947
Where is this?

282
00:18:11.947 --> 00:18:13.247
Conan?

283
00:18:13.247 --> 00:18:14.947
Oh! I'm going to pee in my pants!

284
00:18:14.947 --> 00:18:16.647
Mr. Clock, where's the washroom?

285
00:18:18.447 --> 00:18:19.647
Come here!

286
00:18:32.747 --> 00:18:36.847
I don't know if we should trust what Mr. Clock told us.

287
00:18:36.847 --> 00:18:38.647
What do you mean?

288
00:18:38.647 --> 00:18:41.747
You know, this Gozo guy left the riddle,

289
00:18:41.747 --> 00:18:45.447
Yuriko was the 17th challenger. Things like that.

290
00:18:45.447 --> 00:18:46.947
That's make sense.

291
00:18:46.947 --> 00:18:51.147
There have been 16 challengers in the past few months,

292
00:18:51.147 --> 00:18:54.547
but nobody left a memo or whatsoever.

293
00:18:54.547 --> 00:18:55.847
It is strange.

294
00:18:55.847 --> 00:18:58.347
Yeah. Maybe this "riddle" thing is a lie

295
00:18:58.347 --> 00:19:03.347
and is something he used to get Yuriko to come here.

296
00:19:03.347 --> 00:19:05.347
Getting her to come here and then what?

297
00:19:05.347 --> 00:19:06.647
Yeah.

298
00:19:06.647 --> 00:19:10.447
Actually, I don't know.

299
00:19:10.447 --> 00:19:14.047
I don't think Mr. Clock was lying.

300
00:19:14.047 --> 00:19:15.847
Just my guess.

301
00:19:15.847 --> 00:19:17.647
That's one sure thing.

302
00:19:17.647 --> 00:19:20.547
Even if the previous challengers left some kind of hint to the riddle,

303
00:19:20.547 --> 00:19:23.547
that Clock guy could've cleaned them all up.

304
00:19:23.547 --> 00:19:26.447
For the sake of being fair to all the challengers?

305
00:19:26.447 --> 00:19:27.647
Yeah.

306
00:19:27.647 --> 00:19:30.947
But the thing is what does he gain from doing so?

307
00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:42.647
Shoots! 10 hours left.

308
00:19:42.647 --> 00:19:43.947
I'm so sorry.

309
00:19:43.947 --> 00:19:47.047
For causing you a trouble. Maybe I should just...

310
00:19:47.047 --> 00:19:51.547
Don't you worry, Yuriko.

311
00:19:51.547 --> 00:19:55.247
There're still many other bulls to see!

312
00:19:55.247 --> 00:19:56.547
We got 10 hours.

313
00:19:56.547 --> 00:20:00.047
It's long enough for me to break all the horns!

314
00:20:02.447 --> 00:20:05.247
Wait a minute. Why is it the Bull?

315
00:20:05.247 --> 00:20:07.747
And why does it have to be the horn?

316
00:20:07.747 --> 00:20:12.447
Simple. Yuriko's great-granddad was called "Raging Bull".

317
00:20:12.447 --> 00:20:14.647
And, there's a bull with horns,

318
00:20:14.647 --> 00:20:16.747
which Genta got hanged on last night

319
00:20:16.747 --> 00:20:18.847
in the Mansion of the Raging Bull.

320
00:20:18.847 --> 00:20:21.547
And there's a gold bull with no horns in the East Mansion,

321
00:20:21.547 --> 00:20:24.747
where Mitsuhiko pissed in his pants, right?

322
00:20:24.747 --> 00:20:28.047
What are you talking about?

323
00:20:28.047 --> 00:20:30.147
I didn't pee in my pants!

324
00:20:30.147 --> 00:20:31.947
The "bull" in riddle does not refer

325
00:20:31.947 --> 00:20:34.847
to any of the bulls in this mansion. That is...

326
00:20:37.947 --> 00:20:39.847
"Bull" -A kanji character?

327
00:20:39.847 --> 00:20:42.747
"The bull's horn disappears", that means...

328
00:20:42.747 --> 00:20:44.247
"Noon"

329
00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:45.847
Sheep?

330
00:20:45.847 --> 00:20:47.747
Oh, please, Genta!

331
00:20:47.747 --> 00:20:50.147
It's "Go". Like when you write "noon" in Japanese.

332
00:20:50.147 --> 00:20:52.347
In the Chinese zodiac, it means "horse".

333
00:20:52.347 --> 00:20:55.147
Horse? There's no horse in here.

334
00:20:55.147 --> 00:20:56.847
It's not just animal.

335
00:20:56.847 --> 00:20:59.447
This "horse" also indicates a direction.

336
00:20:59.447 --> 00:21:01.347
And one more thing.

337
00:21:01.347 --> 00:21:02.547
Shoots!

338
00:21:05.947 --> 00:21:07.147
"South Angel"

339
00:21:07.147 --> 00:21:08.847
The South Angel.

340
00:21:08.847 --> 00:21:10.847
Horse is the symbol of the south.

341
00:21:10.847 --> 00:21:13.647
You have to be careful. There's an electric shock security system.

342
00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.647
No, there's no electric shock if I'm right.

343
00:21:16.647 --> 00:21:20.247
Because the character of "horse" also means 12 pm.

344
00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:22.847
Like the word "Go" that means noon.

345
00:21:30.447 --> 00:21:31.647
It's opened!

346
00:21:44.947 --> 00:21:47.547
It's weird. It's glued onto the floor.

347
00:21:47.547 --> 00:21:48.847
Why?

348
00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:57.847
Is that the Raging Bull's treasure?

349
00:21:57.847 --> 00:22:02.047
No, this black crystal is the key to solve the next riddle.

350
00:22:02.047 --> 00:22:05.147
"When the bull's horn disappears and the tail becomes the head"

351
00:22:05.147 --> 00:22:08.447
It means the opposite of "horse" which is "rat",

352
00:22:08.447 --> 00:22:10.547
and the direction of the "rat" is north!

353
00:22:10.547 --> 00:22:13.947
There must be something in the North Angel Tower!

354
00:22:17.947 --> 00:22:19.047
What are you doing?

355
00:22:21.147 --> 00:22:23.647
That's it! Guys, get off the floor...

356
00:22:23.647 --> 00:22:25.247
Yuriko!

357
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:02.147
"Next Episode" -You found human bones

358
00:24:02.147 --> 00:24:03.547
in the East Mansion, right?

359
00:24:03.547 --> 00:24:05.647
Which direction was the head facing?

360
00:24:06.747 --> 00:24:10.347
Maybe the thief wandered through this tunnel and ended up there.

361
00:24:10.347 --> 00:24:12.447
The time is over now, isn't it?

362
00:24:12.447 --> 00:24:14.947
No, I just solved the second riddle.

363
00:24:17.647 --> 00:24:18.847
You wanna fight?

364
00:24:22.147 --> 00:24:23.947
Stop!

365
00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "Labyrinth in the Angel's Mansion (Part 2)"

366
00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.374
Next Conan's Hint:

367
00:24:32.374 --> 00:24:34.474
"Direction"

368
00:24:34.474 --> 00:24:36.174
I'm going to solve the mystery then Yuriko and I will...

369
00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.374
What are you saying, Genta?

370
00:24:37.374 --> 00:24:38.374
That's a lot of bulls.

371
00:24:38.374 --> 00:24:39.478
I'm fired up!
