1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
"Tokiwa Hotel"

2
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.440
Come in.

3
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.340
Taiko Meijin, you'd better get going.

4
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.840
Please don't call me that.

5
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.840
I'm going to win that title today, you see.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.440
But everybody already knows you as Taiko Meijin.

7
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.240
You've already won the Sextuple Crown!

8
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.040
You can't be too careful.

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.340
I've taken this Meijin match to a 3-3 tie,

10
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.440
but I barely beat the Meijin in yesterday's final game.

11
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.540
But last night,

12
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540
the commentator was saying that you,

13
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.640
who won the Sextuple Crown, had the advantage because you beat his attack!

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.540
That Meijin seemed to be thinking really hard over his sealed move!

15
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.740
Really?

16
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.540
Oh, a photo.

17
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.040
Your girlfriend?

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.140
Yes, sort of.

19
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.340
Yumi.

20
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.140
That shabby envelope?

21
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.540
"Two days ago" -I don't know where it is.

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.740
What?

23
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.140
Because you never called me at all after that, Chukichi.

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.640
I told you when I gave you that envelope, didn't I?

25
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.740
To please don't open it until I get a hold of all seven.

26
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.140
Yes, so I disposed of it without opening it.

27
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.840
Disposed of it?

28
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.240
I meant you to keep it with you till the time came and yet!

29
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.540
And so, what was so important that you called beautiful police officer Yumi

30
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.540
out on her day off?

31
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.440
What?

32
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.740
Well, I'm about to get a hold of all seven,

33
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.340
so I wanted to confirm if you had the envelope on you.

34
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.340
Is that it?

35
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.640
Yes. Well, for now.

36
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.340
-I'm leaving! -Yumi!

37
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.740
Hey, wait!

38
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.540
Taiko Meijin?

39
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.040
I thought so!

40
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.640
I'm a huge fan of yours!

41
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.740
If you don't mind, I'd like your autograph.

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.740
Thank you very much.

43
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.840
Huh?

44
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.240
Yumi?

45
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.040
Yumi!

46
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.940
Okay, game start.

47
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.640
Shukichi Haneda.

48
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.040
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

49
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.440
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

50
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.140
A ruthless blackmail declaring abduction.

51
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.140
There is a lapse in both Shogi and the case.

52
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.640
He sees through the one and only truth.

53
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

54
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.740
His name is Detective Conan!

55
00:04:35.603 --> 00:04:41.403
"Taiko's Meijin Match of Love (Part 1)"

56
00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:46.803
It's about time.

57
00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:48.403
About time?

58
00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:49.703
For what?

59
00:04:49.703 --> 00:04:52.703
Well, you saw him once before too, didn't you?

60
00:04:57.103 --> 00:04:58.303
It seems that currently,

61
00:04:58.303 --> 00:05:01.103
the only title he doesn't have is Meijin, though.

62
00:05:01.103 --> 00:05:04.103
So he's the winner of the Sextuple Crown.

63
00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:07.603
Is that like the Triple Crown in baseball?

64
00:05:07.603 --> 00:05:10.603
Yeah. If he regains the Meijin title today,

65
00:05:10.603 --> 00:05:12.003
he'll be the winner of the Septuple Crown!

66
00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:14.603
He'll be the second person to achieve it in the history of mankind.

67
00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:18.903
Then, maybe the seven that Yumi was referring to before is...

68
00:05:18.903 --> 00:05:20.603
About that?

69
00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:22.503
Yeah, most likely.

70
00:05:22.503 --> 00:05:24.803
Now that he'll have all seven,

71
00:05:24.803 --> 00:05:28.003
she gets to look inside the envelope!

72
00:05:28.003 --> 00:05:29.803
I wonder what's inside.

73
00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:35.603
Well, the most likely would be a marriage certificate.

74
00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:38.403
Which means Yumi's getting married?

75
00:05:38.403 --> 00:05:41.403
That's amazing!

76
00:05:41.403 --> 00:05:44.303
But we don't know that for sure yet.

77
00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:48.903
Yes, hello?

78
00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:51.703
Hey, Conan, howzit?

79
00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:54.003
Sera... I mean, Masumi?

80
00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:55.703
What's up?

81
00:05:55.703 --> 00:05:59.303
I moved to a new hotel, you see.

82
00:05:59.303 --> 00:06:02.303
I was wondering if you wanted to come visit.

83
00:06:02.303 --> 00:06:04.103
I'm at Hotel Hyde Pride!

84
00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:06.803
It's pretty close from the detective agency, you know.

85
00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:10.203
I can't. Because I'm on the move by car now.

86
00:06:12.303 --> 00:06:14.203
Another case or something?

87
00:06:14.203 --> 00:06:17.703
No, we're going around visiting power spots.

88
00:06:17.703 --> 00:06:20.903
Taiko Meijin! Taiko Meijin!

89
00:06:20.903 --> 00:06:23.003
Taiko Meijin!

90
00:06:23.003 --> 00:06:25.503
Haven't I told you? I'm not a Meijin yet,

91
00:06:25.503 --> 00:06:27.903
and I'll have to go because the match will start already.

92
00:06:27.903 --> 00:06:30.603
But I was told to give you this just before the match

93
00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:32.703
is about to re-start on the second day.

94
00:06:32.703 --> 00:06:35.303
A letter?

95
00:06:35.303 --> 00:06:39.003
A strange man brought this yesterday morning.

96
00:06:39.003 --> 00:06:40.803
He said that you'd take it

97
00:06:40.803 --> 00:06:43.003
if I showed you the name of the sender.

98
00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:44.803
"Yumi Miyamoto" -From Yumi?

99
00:06:46.503 --> 00:06:49.203
But why would she send me a letter?

100
00:06:51.503 --> 00:06:54.403
I shall reveal the sealed move.

101
00:07:00.703 --> 00:07:04.303
The sealed move is 5-6 silver.

102
00:07:18.803 --> 00:07:20.503
I need to think.

103
00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:28.403
Sextuple Crown Haneda!

104
00:07:30.803 --> 00:07:32.403
Where are you going?

105
00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:34.203
Sextuple Crown Haneda!

106
00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:37.703
-Tokyo, please. -Huh?

107
00:07:37.703 --> 00:07:39.703
What?

108
00:07:45.403 --> 00:07:48.203
I have your girlfriend.

109
00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:51.703
If you want to save her, read my game record and decipher it.

110
00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:54.703
I will wait until your clock time runs out.

111
00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:58.203
Tell no one, and of course, not the police.

112
00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:00.303
Signed, the Headless Shogi Player.

113
00:08:02.203 --> 00:08:03.803
First game.

114
00:08:03.803 --> 00:08:07.003
One of the seven shrines is attacked by thieves

115
00:08:07.003 --> 00:08:09.203
and the sanctuary is emptied on the second day.

116
00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:10.603
The priest's daughter who is hiding in the well

117
00:08:10.603 --> 00:08:13.503
is kidnapped as well.

118
00:08:13.503 --> 00:08:15.803
Photo enclosed.

119
00:08:20.203 --> 00:08:22.703
Yu... Yumi.

120
00:08:26.303 --> 00:08:28.303
I used 4 hours and 2 minutes

121
00:08:28.303 --> 00:08:30.903
in the final game of the first day.

122
00:08:30.903 --> 00:08:33.303
Even with the hour I took for lunch,

123
00:08:33.303 --> 00:08:36.303
I have less than 6 hours!

124
00:08:36.303 --> 00:08:39.103
I'm sorry that all I do is make you wait all the time.

125
00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:41.303
But I promise...

126
00:08:41.303 --> 00:08:45.303
I promise I'll go to get you. So hang on, okay?

127
00:08:55.603 --> 00:08:58.203
I'm sure this is the place.

128
00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:01.203
But where is it? The well in question?

129
00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:04.503
There's only 4 hours and 10 minutes to go.

130
00:09:04.503 --> 00:09:07.803
I've got to find the well in question by then or...

131
00:09:07.803 --> 00:09:10.303
Taiko Meijin?

132
00:09:10.303 --> 00:09:12.203
You... you're...

133
00:09:12.203 --> 00:09:15.803
What's the matter? Today's your Meijin match, isn't it?

134
00:09:15.803 --> 00:09:18.703
Oh, well, the thing is...

135
00:09:18.703 --> 00:09:21.203
"Tell no one."

136
00:09:21.203 --> 00:09:24.503
I just thought I'd get some fresh air.

137
00:09:24.503 --> 00:09:27.303
But your match

138
00:09:27.303 --> 00:09:30.403
is supposed to be at a hotel in Yamanashi Prefecture, right?

139
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:35.203
Yes, so I used 2 hours to get here to ask God for help.

140
00:09:35.203 --> 00:09:37.803
Wow! It's Taiko Meijin!

141
00:09:37.803 --> 00:09:39.303
Can I have your autograph?

142
00:09:39.303 --> 00:09:43.103
-What... Hey... -Autograph, please!

143
00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:46.303
Isn't that Taiko Meijin?

144
00:09:46.303 --> 00:09:48.903
No joke? I'm a huge fan of his.

145
00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:50.603
It can't be him.

146
00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:52.903
The Meijin match is today, you know.

147
00:09:52.903 --> 00:09:56.803
Oh, just a look alike.

148
00:09:56.803 --> 00:09:59.703
See? This way, no matter who's watching you,

149
00:09:59.703 --> 00:10:02.203
he'll just think that a fan called out to you.

150
00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:03.703
And because there's no way

151
00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:05.903
you'd be in a place like this on the day of your match,

152
00:10:05.903 --> 00:10:09.003
everybody would just take you as being a look alike, right?

153
00:10:09.003 --> 00:10:11.403
True.

154
00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:13.303
Then, will you please tell me what's going on

155
00:10:13.303 --> 00:10:14.603
while pretending to give me your autograph?

156
00:10:14.603 --> 00:10:17.803
What did you really come here for?

157
00:10:17.803 --> 00:10:19.203
Okay.

158
00:10:19.203 --> 00:10:21.903
-No way! -Yumi was kidnapped?

159
00:10:21.903 --> 00:10:23.703
No joke?

160
00:10:25.903 --> 00:10:28.403
I tell you, these guys...

161
00:10:28.403 --> 00:10:31.403
And did you find anything at the well?

162
00:10:31.403 --> 00:10:35.203
No. See, I can't find the well.

163
00:10:35.203 --> 00:10:38.703
I mean, do you know where this well is?

164
00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:43.103
Yes. In this shrine, that's the only well there is.

165
00:10:43.103 --> 00:10:46.903
We just went there, you see.

166
00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:52.103
It's said to be a power spot that brings you good luck.

167
00:10:52.103 --> 00:10:56.403
"3 hours and 58 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda"

168
00:11:04.978 --> 00:11:07.778
The famous well in this shrine

169
00:11:07.778 --> 00:11:10.678
is this well that is said to have been dug by Kiyomasa Kato,

170
00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:13.178
Kiyomasa's well.

171
00:11:13.178 --> 00:11:16.578
Kiyomasa served Hideyoshi!

172
00:11:16.578 --> 00:11:19.278
He was a valorous warrior

173
00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:22.378
and also a master castle builder who built the Kumamoto Castle!

174
00:11:22.378 --> 00:11:25.578
I heard he even beat a tiger!

175
00:11:25.578 --> 00:11:28.978
And a TV star who used that photo of Kiyomasa's well

176
00:11:28.978 --> 00:11:31.778
as the stand by screen for her cell phone,

177
00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:33.478
suddenly became popular,

178
00:11:33.478 --> 00:11:37.178
so now it's known as a power spot for good luck.

179
00:11:37.178 --> 00:11:41.078
But Taiko refers to Hideyoshi Toyotomi, right?

180
00:11:41.078 --> 00:11:42.878
How come you're called Taiko Meijin

181
00:11:42.878 --> 00:11:45.378
and yet know anything about it?

182
00:11:45.378 --> 00:11:47.178
How come you don't know?

183
00:11:47.178 --> 00:11:50.278
Well, Taiko is my nickname, you see.

184
00:11:50.278 --> 00:11:53.378
But I don't get it.

185
00:11:53.378 --> 00:11:57.678
How do you know that this sentence indicates this shrine?

186
00:11:57.678 --> 00:12:01.378
One of the shrines was attacked by thieves,

187
00:12:01.378 --> 00:12:04.178
and the sanctuary is emptied on the second day.

188
00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:07.178
The priest's daughter who hid in the well

189
00:12:07.178 --> 00:12:09.178
is kidnapped as well.

190
00:12:09.178 --> 00:12:13.278
Seven refers to the seven major shogi titles.

191
00:12:13.278 --> 00:12:21.278
Meijin, Ryuo, Kio, Osho, Oza, Kisei and Oui.

192
00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:23.178
In the first letter,

193
00:12:23.178 --> 00:12:26.378
the perp called himself the Headless Shogi Player,

194
00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:29.778
and said to decipher his game record.

195
00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:32.078
Shogi was originally not about sogyoku,

196
00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:35.078
capturing your opponent's king but rather, about gyoku,

197
00:12:35.078 --> 00:12:38.478
stealing his treasure.

198
00:12:38.478 --> 00:12:41.878
Which means, since the sanctuary was emptied,

199
00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:44.678
the treasure, in other words the king disappeared.

200
00:12:44.678 --> 00:12:46.278
Of the seven major titles,

201
00:12:46.278 --> 00:12:47.978
the ones without the character "ou" (king)

202
00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:50.378
are the Meijin and Kisei Match.

203
00:12:50.378 --> 00:12:53.378
If it took two days for the treasure to disappear,

204
00:12:53.378 --> 00:12:55.078
then it must be one of the matches played across two days.

205
00:12:55.078 --> 00:13:00.678
The Meijin Match, Ryuo Match, Oui Match, or Osho Match.

206
00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:02.178
The only one without the character "ou" (king) in it

207
00:13:02.178 --> 00:13:05.278
that is played across two days is the Meijin Match!

208
00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:08.878
In other words, it points to the shrine with the name "Meijin" in it.

209
00:13:08.878 --> 00:13:11.678
So, it's the Meiji Shrine.

210
00:13:11.678 --> 00:13:13.778
That's why you slipped away from the match

211
00:13:13.778 --> 00:13:17.678
and rushed over here, right? Taiko Meijin?

212
00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:18.878
Yeah.

213
00:13:18.878 --> 00:13:22.778
Since the priest's daughter who was hiding in the well was kidnapped,

214
00:13:22.778 --> 00:13:25.078
I figured that I could find a clue to Yumi's abduction

215
00:13:25.078 --> 00:13:28.778
near the well of this shrine too.

216
00:13:28.778 --> 00:13:33.778
It says here that the perp will wait till your time's up,

217
00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:35.878
but how much longer is that?

218
00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:38.778
About 3 hours and 50 minutes.

219
00:13:38.778 --> 00:13:42.578
So, the time limit's about 3:00 in the afternoon.

220
00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:45.478
There's no time to lose.

221
00:13:45.478 --> 00:13:47.978
Let's go back to Kiyomasa's well!

222
00:13:47.978 --> 00:13:50.878
-Okay! -Okay!

223
00:13:50.878 --> 00:13:52.878
But if there's a long line,

224
00:13:52.878 --> 00:13:54.378
I'd better go there alone.

225
00:13:54.378 --> 00:13:58.978
Don't worry. It was popular some time ago.

226
00:13:58.978 --> 00:14:02.678
Kiyomasa and Taiko both loved festivals and shogi.

227
00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:05.778
If we go together, we may get lucky.

228
00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:08.378
It seems that the real Taiko

229
00:14:08.378 --> 00:14:12.778
wasn't as strong as you are, though.

230
00:14:12.778 --> 00:14:16.678
What? Sextuple Crown Haneda went on a cab to Tokyo?

231
00:14:16.678 --> 00:14:18.678
Is... is that true?

232
00:14:18.678 --> 00:14:20.278
And? Where in Tokyo?

233
00:14:20.278 --> 00:14:23.678
I don't know. I've been calling his cell phone repeatedly

234
00:14:23.678 --> 00:14:25.878
but I'm getting no response what so ever.

235
00:14:25.878 --> 00:14:28.478
He doesn't have it.

236
00:14:28.478 --> 00:14:30.978
There's an unspoken rule

237
00:14:30.978 --> 00:14:35.278
forbidding the usage of cell phones during a match.

238
00:14:35.278 --> 00:14:38.678
The cell phone is like a mini computer.

239
00:14:38.678 --> 00:14:39.878
In this day and age,

240
00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:42.578
you can look up various moves, you see.

241
00:14:42.578 --> 00:14:45.278
I don't know what came upon him,

242
00:14:45.278 --> 00:14:49.578
but he left saying, "I need to think".

243
00:14:49.578 --> 00:14:55.278
So, he hasn't thrown in the towel to me, Meijin Chikara Katsumasa yet.

244
00:14:56.578 --> 00:14:59.578
Let's wait for the man attempting to defeat me,

245
00:14:59.578 --> 00:15:03.578
take all seven titles and become a living god.

246
00:15:04.978 --> 00:15:06.978
The line's pretty long!

247
00:15:06.978 --> 00:15:09.178
There are more people there than there was a while ago.

248
00:15:09.178 --> 00:15:12.778
It seems we have to wait a while before getting to the well.

249
00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:16.578
I'm sorry, you guys. For getting you involved.

250
00:15:16.578 --> 00:15:18.778
I'm really hopeless.

251
00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:20.378
There's no waiting in shogi

252
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:22.778
and yet all I do is make her wait.

253
00:15:22.778 --> 00:15:25.878
It was that way from the first time I met Yumi.

254
00:15:25.878 --> 00:15:27.478
What're you talking about?

255
00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:30.378
Is it about how you got to know Yumi?

256
00:15:30.378 --> 00:15:32.078
Tell us, tell us!

257
00:15:32.078 --> 00:15:36.878
You guys, Yumi's been kidnapped, you know.

258
00:15:36.878 --> 00:15:40.378
Maybe it's a good way to kill time while waiting, though.

259
00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:42.178
Will you tell us about it?

260
00:15:42.178 --> 00:15:46.278
Yeah. It was about ten years ago.

261
00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.978
I'd just finished my ranking match

262
00:15:47.978 --> 00:15:51.378
and was riding the Tohto Loop Line.

263
00:15:51.378 --> 00:15:54.178
The match left such a bad aftertaste

264
00:15:54.178 --> 00:15:56.678
that I was mentally totally exhausted.

265
00:15:56.678 --> 00:15:57.978
When I got up...

266
00:15:57.978 --> 00:16:01.178
Hey, mister. Hey, you.

267
00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:06.678
I... I'm sorry! Did I fall asleep?

268
00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:10.478
Yes. Drooling on my shoulder, too.

269
00:16:10.478 --> 00:16:12.578
Drooled...

270
00:16:12.578 --> 00:16:14.678
-Never mind that. -Huh?

271
00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:16.078
Hurry and get off!

272
00:16:16.078 --> 00:16:18.378
You're getting off here, aren't you?

273
00:16:18.378 --> 00:16:21.778
Yes. But how did you know?

274
00:16:21.778 --> 00:16:23.778
You're holding a ticket, aren't you?

275
00:16:29.178 --> 00:16:31.878
See you, since I'm going this way.

276
00:16:31.878 --> 00:16:34.178
Thank you so very much!

277
00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.478
Inner loop?

278
00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:40.878
The train she just got on was outer loop, wasn't it?

279
00:16:43.478 --> 00:16:44.678
Miwako?

280
00:16:44.678 --> 00:16:47.878
-I'm sorry, I dozed off in the train, -It... it can't be.

281
00:16:47.878 --> 00:16:50.278
so I over rode five or six stations.

282
00:16:50.278 --> 00:16:53.178
I'm going to go back on the inner loop train now.

283
00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:55.178
So go on ahead to the karaoke box.

284
00:16:55.178 --> 00:16:58.678
-You waited for me? -What?

285
00:16:58.678 --> 00:17:02.278
You stayed on the train and didn't get off at your station.

286
00:17:02.278 --> 00:17:06.378
You mean you waited for me to get up?

287
00:17:06.378 --> 00:17:11.678
Yes. Because you looked so cute sleeping.

288
00:17:11.678 --> 00:17:15.578
Well, I guess it sounds just like a mere sappy story to you.

289
00:17:15.578 --> 00:17:18.878
For me, who lives in the shogi world of no waiting,

290
00:17:18.878 --> 00:17:22.278
her smile back then was...

291
00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:25.278
Yumi...

292
00:17:25.278 --> 00:17:26.878
She's a nice person.

293
00:17:26.878 --> 00:17:28.478
I was touched.

294
00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:32.078
You've got to rescue Yumi no matter what!

295
00:17:32.078 --> 00:17:34.278
In the name of your Meijin title!

296
00:17:34.278 --> 00:17:37.278
A Meijin is not supposed to lose!

297
00:17:37.278 --> 00:17:41.278
So like I was saying, I... I'm not a Meijin.

298
00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:46.078
We're next.

299
00:17:47.778 --> 00:17:51.178
Keep your hands out of the well.

300
00:17:51.178 --> 00:17:52.978
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

301
00:17:52.978 --> 00:17:56.478
Which means it's somewhere around the well.

302
00:17:58.178 --> 00:18:00.578
There's something among the pebbles.

303
00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:04.178
This is...

304
00:18:04.178 --> 00:18:05.878
the lance!

305
00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:09.778
Is that the clue that the perp left behind?

306
00:18:09.778 --> 00:18:10.978
Yeah.

307
00:18:10.978 --> 00:18:14.678
Because "Second game" is carved on the bottom of the piece.

308
00:18:14.678 --> 00:18:17.878
Does the word lancer ring a bell?

309
00:18:17.878 --> 00:18:20.078
No, not really.

310
00:18:21.378 --> 00:18:22.978
Look! On the back of the piece,

311
00:18:22.978 --> 00:18:24.578
there's a weird looking diagram.

312
00:18:24.578 --> 00:18:25.678
Diagram?

313
00:18:28.578 --> 00:18:30.478
This is...

314
00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:37.078
So, it's check. Shukichi Haneda.

315
00:18:37.078 --> 00:18:40.378
You've got no choice but to take my promoted pawn.

316
00:18:40.378 --> 00:18:44.978
If you do, my captured rook

317
00:18:44.978 --> 00:18:46.378
will shatter your offense

318
00:18:46.378 --> 00:18:48.878
and your tactical formation will totally collapse.

319
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:52.378
My victory is definite.

320
00:18:52.378 --> 00:18:54.978
This was determined to begin with...

321
00:18:57.278 --> 00:19:00.378
since ten years ago.

322
00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:07.178
Doesn't this sort of look like a face?

323
00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:09.678
A... a face ace?

324
00:19:09.678 --> 00:19:12.278
See! Like this.

325
00:19:12.278 --> 00:19:14.078
Maybe.

326
00:19:14.078 --> 00:19:17.278
Right? Maybe it's the face of the perp?

327
00:19:17.278 --> 00:19:18.878
It can't be!

328
00:19:18.878 --> 00:19:20.378
It seems the meaning of the figures

329
00:19:20.378 --> 00:19:23.378
inside the circles have to be deciphered first.

330
00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:25.278
Seven and three.

331
00:19:25.278 --> 00:19:27.078
The seven maybe stands for the seven titles,

332
00:19:27.078 --> 00:19:28.078
but what about the three?

333
00:19:28.078 --> 00:19:29.478
The only thing that comes to mind

334
00:19:29.478 --> 00:19:33.078
is the third level professional league.

335
00:19:33.078 --> 00:19:34.778
It's from Officer Sato.

336
00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:37.378
Officer?

337
00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:38.978
Hello, Conan?

338
00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:42.678
Sato here. Do you have any idea where Yumi is?

339
00:19:42.678 --> 00:19:44.878
She missed work two days in a row without calling in,

340
00:19:44.878 --> 00:19:46.478
and hasn't been home either.

341
00:19:46.478 --> 00:19:48.378
She's not answering her cell phone too.

342
00:19:48.378 --> 00:19:49.678
You wouldn't know, would you?

343
00:19:49.678 --> 00:19:51.178
"Don't contact the police."

344
00:19:51.178 --> 00:19:53.178
Hello, Conan?

345
00:19:53.178 --> 00:19:56.678
I know! We're looking for her too now.

346
00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:58.078
What?

347
00:19:58.078 --> 00:20:00.178
Yumi says that the night before yesterday,

348
00:20:00.178 --> 00:20:02.278
she got drunk and caught a cab,

349
00:20:02.278 --> 00:20:04.278
then was dropped off in an unfamiliar town.

350
00:20:04.278 --> 00:20:08.178
She lost her cell phone and wallet too,

351
00:20:08.178 --> 00:20:10.078
so she called me from a pay phone

352
00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:13.478
with the coins she had in her pocket.

353
00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:16.978
But she seems to have run out of coins part way through the call.

354
00:20:16.978 --> 00:20:20.278
You mean she's wandering around in some town for two days?

355
00:20:20.278 --> 00:20:25.478
Well, I'm sure that Yumi will find a way to contact us, though.

356
00:20:25.478 --> 00:20:27.478
I think you should have

357
00:20:27.478 --> 00:20:30.378
the mini patrol car on standby for when that time comes.

358
00:20:30.378 --> 00:20:33.278
I guess so! Okay!

359
00:20:33.278 --> 00:20:35.278
So, do you think you can do that?

360
00:20:35.278 --> 00:20:38.578
Oh, yes, ma'am. I'll go talk to my superiors.

361
00:20:38.578 --> 00:20:40.078
I'm counting on you, then.

362
00:20:40.078 --> 00:20:41.278
Sure thing!

363
00:20:41.278 --> 00:20:43.478
That Yumi...

364
00:20:43.478 --> 00:20:46.978
Yumi should just go to a police box.

365
00:20:46.978 --> 00:20:50.878
So, dispatching the police car's all done.

366
00:20:50.878 --> 00:20:53.778
All we need to do now is decipher this code.

367
00:20:53.778 --> 00:20:56.978
I don't understand what the seven and three stands for.

368
00:20:56.978 --> 00:21:00.278
Isn't there another meaning to lance?

369
00:21:00.278 --> 00:21:03.878
It's supposed to be a sort of lucky blessing for safe births.

370
00:21:03.878 --> 00:21:06.078
I hear that in the past that's what they used

371
00:21:06.078 --> 00:21:07.878
to call the whiz of the red-light districts.

372
00:21:07.878 --> 00:21:09.778
What's a red-light district?

373
00:21:09.778 --> 00:21:11.078
A fun place?

374
00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:14.578
It sounds kind of morally questionable.

375
00:21:14.578 --> 00:21:16.278
Oh, well...

376
00:21:16.278 --> 00:21:20.578
And why is the lance the whiz of the red-light district?

377
00:21:20.578 --> 00:21:22.878
I... I'm not all that sure,

378
00:21:22.878 --> 00:21:26.278
the lance is sometimes referred to as the spear too.

379
00:21:26.278 --> 00:21:28.578
You mean the one that's used as a weapon?

380
00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:31.478
The spear and lance that are used in games.

381
00:21:31.478 --> 00:21:33.478
But why are they called that?

382
00:21:33.478 --> 00:21:37.578
That's because the lance moves straight all the way.

383
00:21:37.578 --> 00:21:39.978
Just like a spear.

384
00:21:41.878 --> 00:21:46.378
Wait a sec. Wasn't Kiyomasa Kato...

385
00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:49.078
If so, the seven and three are...

386
00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.678
I see.

387
00:21:53.678 --> 00:21:56.178
I see the picture now!

388
00:21:56.178 --> 00:21:59.878
Oh, you both look like you've figured it out.

389
00:21:59.878 --> 00:22:04.078
But I hope you're telling us what the answer is too.

390
00:22:04.978 --> 00:22:08.278
Doc, bring the car to the entrance, will you?

391
00:22:08.278 --> 00:22:09.678
Okay.

392
00:22:10.978 --> 00:22:14.978
We'll tell when we get there if you want to know.

393
00:22:14.978 --> 00:22:19.378
It's in the middle of a hill with a terrifying name though.

394
00:22:19.378 --> 00:22:21.478
Are you sure you guys want to come too?

395
00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:31.178
"3 hours and 4 minutes left for Shukichi Haneda"

396
00:23:50.978 --> 00:23:53.378
"Next Episode"

397
00:23:53.378 --> 00:23:55.978
Yuureizaka? (Ghost Hill)

398
00:23:55.978 --> 00:23:58.978
This move will fork his king and silver general.

399
00:23:58.978 --> 00:24:01.078
Yes...

400
00:24:01.078 --> 00:24:02.778
The victorious 4-8 rook!

401
00:24:02.778 --> 00:24:04.878
The pieces on this board...

402
00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:06.878
Indicate the seven!

403
00:24:06.878 --> 00:24:09.678
Judging from the position of this rook...

404
00:24:09.678 --> 00:24:13.478
The place that Yumi is being confined is probably...

405
00:24:13.478 --> 00:24:14.978
To the car. Hurry!

406
00:24:15.978 --> 00:24:17.278
Next Conan,

407
00:24:17.278 --> 00:24:21.178
"Taiko Meijin's Match of Love (Part 2)"

408
00:24:36.778 --> 00:24:39.178
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:39.178 --> 00:24:41.278
"Seven"

410
00:24:41.278 --> 00:24:42.578
What shogi piece do you like?

411
00:24:42.578 --> 00:24:43.578
-Rook. -Bishop.

412
00:24:43.578 --> 00:24:46.178
-Eels over rice. -He's the knight.
