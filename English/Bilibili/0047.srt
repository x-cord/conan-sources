1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,380
As times change, difficult cases
will increase in number!

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,020
Today's stage is a sports club!

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,630
Let's train both
our minds and bodies!

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,690
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,810
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,600
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:33,159
The Sports Club Murder Case.

8
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:43,769
After winning a raffle,
we were invited to a sports gym

9
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:48,439
the day before its
grand re-opening.

10
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,019
I-- I can't go on...

11
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,989
I'm exhausted... I can't move...

12
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,639
How pathetic.

13
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,889
Your booze and lack of
exercise has gotten to you!

14
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:00,849
Don't be stupid!

15
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,749
Detectives fight from the neck up!

16
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,769
More like from the
neck down in your case...

17
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:13,519
These renovations have been
the earnest wish of our sports club!

18
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,059
As a former high-diver,

19
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:19,139
I really understand
the greatness of sports!

20
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:24,809
So it was my hope to help others
get in shape and better their health...

21
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,479
Hey, Conan-kun.

22
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:30,269
Let's ditch my dad
and check out the pool!

23
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,359
Yeah!

24
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,139
The glass exterior is so wonderful!

25
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:44,249
They're doing high-diving up there!

26
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:58,059
That's a high-diver from this club;

27
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:00,889
I think his name is Saijo-san!

28
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,229
High-Dive Competitor Saijo Naoya

29
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,189
You're up, Naruse!
Don't mess up now!

30
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,229
What was that?!

31
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,309
And you wanna be team captain, Naruse?!

32
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:23,099
High-Dive Competitor Naruse Keiichi

33
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,909
I haven't gotten enough practice
with all the preparations lately.
High-Dive Competitor Naruse Keiichi

34
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,209
I haven't gotten enough practice
with all the preparations lately.

35
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,309
That the only reason you
haven't practiced enough?

36
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:31,669
What's that supposed to mean?!

37
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:34,889
In any case, diving like that,

38
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:37,379
it's clear how the
tournament'll turn out.

39
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,219
W-What did you say?!

40
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,729
Stop it, you two!

41
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,349
There are people here!
And the media!

42
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:47,059
You sure you should
be acting all big, Kijima?

43
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:47,889
I-- I'm not trying to act big...

44
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:50,349
Competitive Swimmer Kijima Hisashi
I-- I'm not trying to act big...

45
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,889
With that lame earring...

46
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,689
Are you really fit
to boss people around?

47
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:00,019
Hey, Naruse!
Get back to practice!

48
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:07,949
I think that's Kijima-san,
Saijo-san's former rival...

49
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:11,349
Saijo-san took his
place as team captain,

50
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,749
so he switched to
competitive swimming...

51
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:20,059
Here we have our prized competitive
swimming and high-diving pool.

52
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,179
They're in the middle of
high-dive practice as we speak!

53
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:30,479
Look out!

54
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,489
I know the tournament's soon,
but don't go overboard, Saijo-kun!

55
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:48,729
You're our ace, you know!

56
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,289
I wonder.

57
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:54,209
Your look says,
"What a pity he survived."

58
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,689
Oh, you're such a kidder, Saijo-kun!

59
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,419
Nothing compared to you, though.

60
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,729
You're low!

61
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,309
I know that you want to say

62
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:20,389
the re-opening will
fail if even a rumor

63
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,659
hits the media or tax office!

64
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:24,819
Tax office?

65
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,219
Conan-kun.

66
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,289
What're you doing here?

67
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,749
Oh, uhh...

68
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,389
Saijo-kun.

69
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,059
We're having a job-well-done
party in my office at 8:00!

70
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:38,959
Don't forget!

71
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:49,309
Well, guess I'll get
a little more practice in.

72
00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,569
A hidden camera photo?
The man is that Naruse guy...

73
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:02,649
Hey, you dropped something!

74
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,809
Hey, you dropped this!

75
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:08,639
Oh, sorry. I always wear
earplugs during practice, you see.

76
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:11,349
Thanks.

77
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,809
This is my pay dirt.

78
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:16,179
Pay dirt?

79
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:43,279
And another!

80
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,739
That smarts...

81
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:49,849
You brought it on yourself!

82
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,159
You should work out instead
of smoking and drinking!

83
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,919
Yeah, that's about the only
thing you have going for you...

84
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:00,389
But that club sure was great!

85
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,129
We should join, Conan-kun!

86
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,139
Yeah!

87
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:06,469
Right, Dad?

88
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,159
Eh?

89
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:12,099
Oh! I have a call on
my answering machine!

90
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,849
Come on, Dad!

91
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,729
Let's see, is it about work?

92
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,689
Ugh...

93
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,599
Mori-kun. It's me, Megure.

94
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,649
The Inspector?

95
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,069
I hate to ask, but could you come
to the Saeki Sports Club right away?

96
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,349
Along with Ran-kun and Conan-kun.

97
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,199
One of the instructors,
Saijo Naoya-san,

98
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,659
was found dead in the pool!

99
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,579
What?!

100
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,549
Inspector!

101
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,509
Oh! You came, Mori-kun!

102
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:52,469
Sorry I'm late.
So, what do we have?

103
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,479
It's just as it looks.

104
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,389
We'll need to wait for an autopsy,

105
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,229
but the estimated time of death

106
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,479
is between 8:00 and 9:00 pm.

107
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,479
It appears that--

108
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:04,939
He drowned.

109
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:07,959
Just because you've
been in water before

110
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,489
doesn't make you an expert!

111
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,159
He's absolutely correct.

112
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:16,659
After all, the body's condition
points entirely to a drowning.

113
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:20,169
See the foam coming
from his nose and mouth?

114
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:23,079
And the slight bit
of blood from his ears.

115
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,229
The water in his mouth and nose

116
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:28,349
produced pressure on the inner ears.

117
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,519
They're both characteristics
of a drowning, right?

118
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,799
T-That's right,
but how did you know that?

119
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:38,979
Eh? Oh, I think it was on a
suspense TV show the other day...

120
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,229
But he was a professional swimmer.

121
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,859
It's hard to see him drowning...

122
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,779
Huh? Did he hit his
forehead on something?

123
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,239
See? There's a mark on his cap!

124
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,359
Exactly. It seems he messed up
during his high-diving practice.

125
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:11,139
I hear it's quite a
dangerous practice indeed...

126
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:15,519
I asked you here because you
saw him practicing this afternoon,

127
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,189
and I wanted your testimonies.

128
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:21,189
It was a very close call then;

129
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:23,939
I guess he wasn't so lucky this time...

130
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,229
Say, was there nobody else here?

131
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:29,979
Was Saijo-san practicing alone?

132
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:32,689
Hey, you! Shut up for a minute!

133
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:33,399
So?

134
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:34,729
I'm certain of it.

135
00:09:34,729 --> 00:09:37,229
Everyone else had finished
preparing for tomorrow

136
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:39,599
and were in the back office

137
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,349
at 8:00 for a job-well-done party.

138
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,389
A tournament is coming up,

139
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:47,599
so Saijo-san practiced
whenever he could.

140
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,839
Probably tonight, too...

141
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:52,299
We also have a witness.
There's no question about it.

142
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,589
A witness?

143
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:59,009
Yes. An old man on the
second floor of those apartments

144
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:03,979
says he saw someone doing
high-dive practice all alone.

145
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,309
But he didn't see
the accident itself, right?

146
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,479
W-Well, no, but...

147
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,149
Shut up!

148
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:18,069
Say, I think Saijo-san always
wore earplugs when practicing.

149
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:22,059
Yes, the examiners
removed them earlier...

150
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,869
Here they are.

151
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:29,289
He had different
ones this afternoon.

152
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,229
Probably switched 'em.

153
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:36,439
There's nothing unusual about that!

154
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:37,839
Then what about his cap?

155
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,269
What about his cap, Conan-kun?

156
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,809
High-divers don't usually
wear caps, you know?

157
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,099
So? People can do
different things sometimes!

158
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:49,309
Quit looking at every little thing!

159
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,379
Conan-kun!

160
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,689
Let him go.

161
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:02,579
Say, was Saijo-san's locker locked?

162
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:07,059
Huh? No, it was unlocked...
But who're you, little boy?

163
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,849
You know, he's the kid staying
with Detective Mori.

164
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:11,849
Oh yeah?

165
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:13,089
What's this smell?

166
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,939
This is chloroform!

167
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,139
No question about it!
This was a murder!

168
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:25,729
A couple details are a bit fuzzy,

169
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:29,939
but it appears this was an accident.

170
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,229
What?! You gotta be kidding me!

171
00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:34,819
This was clearly a murder!

172
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:37,389
Thanks for coming, Mori-kun.

173
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:40,489
No, I'm glad I could help, Inspector!

174
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:42,229
Hold on, now!

175
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:44,739
Are we just gonna leave like this?!

176
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:50,169
Umm, this won't affect our
re-opening tomorrow, will it?

177
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:55,059
Hmm, well, the police
will be finished tonight,

178
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:56,129
so it should be all right.

179
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,639
Hear that, everyone?

180
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,389
What happened to
Saijo-kun was terrible,

181
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,259
but it was an accident!

182
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,189
We'll re-open
tomorrow as scheduled!

183
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:09,139
Just to be on the safe side,
do your final checks--

184
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:10,979
Damn! I have to hurry!

185
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,889
The incident occurred after we left.

186
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,359
It would be hard for
an outsider to get inside.

187
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:25,789
Therefore, it's highly likely that
the killer was someone on the inside!

188
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,829
Hey, you guys!

189
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:34,169
What is it, little boy?

190
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,559
The job-well-done
party was here, right?

191
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,629
Did anyone leave during it?

192
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:41,939
I dunno...

193
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,889
If so, I didn't notice.

194
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,099
It was a pretty lively party.

195
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,809
Thank you!

196
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:52,559
In other words, it wouldn't
have been impossible to sneak out.

197
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:56,019
Those three who opposed Saijo-san...

198
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,529
Saeki Reiko,
blackmailed over tax evasion...

199
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,989
Kijima Hisashi, who had
his leadership position stolen...

200
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,489
Naruse Keiichi, blackmailed
with adultery photos...

201
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:10,309
The killer is definitely one of them!

202
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,139
The problem is
that old man's testimony...

203
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,979
It greatly hinders my theory...

204
00:13:21,189 --> 00:13:23,139
Guess I'll have to go there myself!

205
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,979
Yes, little boy?

206
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,099
Hello! My name is Edogawa Conan!

207
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:40,359
A detective told me
to come hear your story.

208
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:43,309
My story?

209
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,199
You're a painter!

210
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:54,539
It's just an old man's hobby.

211
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:04,509
Did you paint this based
on what you saw from here?!

212
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:06,849
That's right.

213
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:11,469
Painting at a set time everyday
is an old man's excitement!

214
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:13,309
A set time?!

215
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,849
Yes. I drew that picture tonight, too...

216
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:18,559
Saijo-kun, was his name?

217
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,529
What a pity...

218
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:22,889
Turning off the lights,

219
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:25,449
practicing intensely...
He brought it on himself.

220
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,239
He turned off the lights?!

221
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,229
Yes. His diving form made a silhouette
with the full moon behind him.

222
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:35,919
So you didn't actually see
Saijo-san's face tonight, then?!

223
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:39,389
That's right.
It was very beautiful...

224
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:42,979
It sparkled so beautifully...

225
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,179
The image came right to
me so I painted it right away.

226
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:49,139
I call it, "Diving Against the Moonlight."

227
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:54,049
Beautiful? If he hit his head,

228
00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:56,019
he would've lost his balance and fallen!

229
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:05,649
This is! Ah, now I get it!
That person was the killer!

230
00:15:12,808 --> 00:15:15,488
Hey, you! Where were you?!

231
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:17,248
You had us worried, Conan-kun!

232
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:18,668
Uh oh!

233
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,128
You're in trouble now!
Get over here!

234
00:15:21,628 --> 00:15:23,398
No!

235
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:26,378
Stop! Get back here!

236
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,008
No!

237
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:44,988
Get back here!

238
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,568
Give yourself up!

239
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:48,278
Sorry, old man!

240
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:53,118
It's my butt today...

241
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:54,958
Uh oh!

242
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:01,378
Are you all right?! Dad!
Conan-kun!

243
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,548
Ran! Gather everyone here on the double!

244
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:05,688
Eh?!

245
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:11,718
What's this about, Mori-kun?

246
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:15,188
I know who's
responsible for this incident.

247
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,618
Responsible?

248
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:18,228
You mean it wasn't an accident?!

249
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:22,148
That's right. This was a murder
made to look like an accident!

250
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,398
What?!

251
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:28,308
Those earplugs were my first suspicion.

252
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:30,778
That was the killer's oversight.

253
00:16:31,768 --> 00:16:35,478
After knocking Saijo-san out
with a chloroform-soaked rag,

254
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,328
the killer plugged his ears

255
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:42,208
with earplugs different from his own.

256
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,148
As for the cap...

257
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:45,358
Inspector.

258
00:16:45,358 --> 00:16:47,978
Was there any blood, hair, or signs

259
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:49,548
of a strike on the diving platform?

260
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:51,978
No, nothing of the sort.

261
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:55,558
Wait, was the cap
meant to fool us about that?!

262
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,018
Precisely.

263
00:16:57,018 --> 00:17:04,898
It was meant to make the poolside
murder look like a diving accident.

264
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:05,938
M-My word!

265
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:10,898
The killer then threw the removed
clothes into Saijo-san's locker

266
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:13,408
and left... without locking it!

267
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:18,558
But that's nothing more than
circumstantial evidence, Mori-kun!

268
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:20,878
Besides, what about the witness?!

269
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:25,398
Actually, if that witness were
to always look out the veranda

270
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:29,798
at a set time every day,
that changes things substantially.

271
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:32,908
What?! The veranda, at a set time?!

272
00:17:32,908 --> 00:17:34,098
What do you mean?!

273
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:37,478
In short, the witness
didn't coincidentally see it;

274
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,308
he was made to see it!

275
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:43,808
W-What?! Made to see his death?!

276
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:45,398
Don't tell me this was suicide?!

277
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:50,778
If so, there'd be no need to turn
off the lights and create a silhouette.

278
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,648
He turned the lights off?

279
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:53,738
What for?

280
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:57,228
He didn't want his face to be seen...

281
00:17:57,228 --> 00:18:01,208
That's it! He saw someone
completely different!

282
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:07,628
Yes. And it was that person
who killed Saijo-san!

283
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:12,478
Kijima Hisashi-san.

284
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:18,098
You used to be a diver,
but switched to swimming.

285
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:24,058
Might you have hated Saijo-san
for taking your role as team captain?

286
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:27,688
Competitive swimmers never
swim without caps, correct?

287
00:18:27,688 --> 00:18:34,028
Putting a cap on to avoid suspicion,
even if no marks were left...

288
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:37,738
That's something only a
competitive swimmer would think of!

289
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:39,538
So it was him?

290
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:40,808
That's right.

291
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:44,538
He killed Saijo-san and
made it look like an accident!

292
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:46,478
H-Hold on!

293
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:50,298
You're going to accuse
me based on some guess?!

294
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,558
What proof do you have?!

295
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:54,758
Inspector.

296
00:18:54,978 --> 00:19:00,728
At the bottom of the platform
stairs is a painting the witness made.

297
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,508
Unwrap it and have a look.

298
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:11,818
T-This painting!

299
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,858
Saijo-kun...

300
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:18,828
That was done while
watching tonight's diving practice.

301
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:21,288
Meaning... this is the killer?!

302
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:23,308
Look closely.

303
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:27,248
Never mind that he cut
the lights to show off his diving,

304
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:31,898
there was other definitive
evidence that shone in the moonlight...

305
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:35,548
The old man painted
that faithfully to what he saw...

306
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,158
Faithfully...

307
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:48,868
An earring!

308
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:49,818
T-That can't be!

309
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:51,148
One other thing--

310
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,658
if the killer was an insider,
he hasn't left yet!

311
00:19:56,808 --> 00:20:03,558
Which means the murder weapon
must be in this building somewhere.

312
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:11,588
But why would he murder him
over the role as team captain?

313
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:15,808
It probably wasn't about skill.

314
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:18,218
He blackmailed you, didn't he?

315
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:22,148
T-That's right...

316
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:25,768
Half a year ago,
I caused a motorcycle accident

317
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:29,238
and severely injured my girlfriend
who was sitting behind me.

318
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:34,558
I dunno how he found out,

319
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:37,308
but he threatened to tell the owner
and the tournament committee!

320
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:42,198
So I used my health as a reason to
give him my place as captain!

321
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:44,808
But I couldn't forgive him!

322
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:47,898
He was no sportsman!

323
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,378
He had to pay...

324
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:57,088
It seems your mistake was
making too perfect of a dive.

325
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:01,728
It was a once-in-a-lifetime
performance for me.

326
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,978
I knew I should have,

327
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:07,098
but I just couldn't
lose my balance during it!

328
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,808
My pride wouldn't let me...

329
00:22:48,648 --> 00:22:54,498
A concrete block was later
found in an office trash can.

330
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:59,148
Upon examination, it matched
with Saijo-san's forehead injury,

331
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:02,058
and Kijima's fingerprints
were found on it.

332
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:06,848
Dad! Earth to Dad!

333
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:10,598
Oh, crap! I forgot about him!

334
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:14,348
Dad! We should get going now!

335
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,778
What a nice nap! Upsy-daisy!

336
00:23:28,938 --> 00:23:32,038
W-What am I doing up here?!

337
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,618
Oh no!

338
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:53,898
Oh, you're the son of Hattori Heizo-san,

339
00:23:53,898 --> 00:23:57,188
Osaka's chief of police!

340
00:23:57,188 --> 00:24:02,028
That's it! I figured out
the locked room trick! And--

341
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,738
Conan-kun! Conan-kun, what's wrong?!

342
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,728
On the next Conan--

343
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,978
The Diplomat Murder Case (Part 1).

344
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,383
Next Conan's Hint:

345
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:16,386
Next Conan's Hint:
Needle and Thread.

346
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:18,854
Needle and Thread.
