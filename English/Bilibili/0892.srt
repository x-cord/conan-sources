1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,140
The old man received a letter from someone named Komakichi Kurataya

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,140
saying he'd like to give him his family treasure,

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,540
so Ran and I accompanied him to Yamaguchi Prefecture.

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,140
However, the old man was mistaken

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,540
for the accomplice of a robber and was arrested.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,840
It turned out Komakichi Kurataya was the name of a robber

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,540
who stole millions of yen worth of gold coins.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,840
Fortunately, news site reporter Asuka Natsume

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,540
was able to get him released.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,340
Unbelievably enough, Asuka was the one

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,940
who sent the old man the letter using the name Komakichi Kurataya.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,440
She intended to hire Pops to secretly investigate the robbery.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
So in search of clues,

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
we left Yamaguchi City for Hagi, but...

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,840
What a nice view.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Ran, get down!

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,540
Hey, don't touch that!

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,840
Hey, what are you...

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,840
Hide inside the rickshaw!

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,440
What happened?

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,240
Are you okay, Ran?

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Yeah.

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,540
-Is Komakichi Kurataya trying to kill... -Looks like he ran.

24
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,840
Pops?

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,940
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,040
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,940
Fearsome bullets are being aimed at the old man!

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,340
Where will the restoration's treasure take us?

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,740
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:35,897
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour (Hagi Part)"

33
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:46,197
Wait, dad?

34
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:49,597
Darn it. We shouldn't be wasting time here.

35
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,797
Where are you going?

36
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:54,297
We haven't been questioned yet.

37
00:03:54,297 --> 00:03:56,997
I appeared on Asuka's news site

38
00:03:56,997 --> 00:04:00,897
to soothe her over-anxious nerves.

39
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:04,597
Instead I provoked the culprit.

40
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:05,797
You mean...

41
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:10,497
Yeah. Asuka could be in danger, too.

42
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:14,097
Ran, we need to notify Asuka immediately.

43
00:04:14,097 --> 00:04:15,097
Yeah.

44
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:23,497
-Hello, Asuka? -I can't come to the phone right now.

45
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,097
It's no use. It went to her messages.

46
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:28,997
We need to get to Asuka quickly.

47
00:04:28,997 --> 00:04:30,097
Yeah.

48
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:38,097
You...

49
00:04:38,097 --> 00:04:39,897
Where are you going?

50
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:42,497
Someone's trying to kill you.

51
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:44,097
So, what?

52
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:46,697
We can guarantee your safety.

53
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:49,497
We'll protect you.

54
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,197
I don't need your protection.

55
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,497
Let's go, Ran.

56
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:58,497
Darn it. You...

57
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,297
Stay there.

58
00:05:01,597 --> 00:05:05,397
Dad, what should we do about Asuka?

59
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:08,197
We'll wait for an opportunity to...

60
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:09,397
Inspector Takajo!

61
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:19,297
Got it. I'll let headquarters know.

62
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,797
You boys watch...

63
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,497
Darn it. That incompetent detective...

64
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:25,797
Why are you just standing there?

65
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:26,797
Hurry up and find them!

66
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:27,897
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

67
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:32,797
"Hagi Reverberating Furnace"

68
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,997
"Hagi Reverberating Furnace" -This is...

69
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:38,097
the Hagi Reverberating Furnace of Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution

70
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:40,097
that was made a world heritage site.

71
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:41,797
A reverberating furnace

72
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:46,497
is a metal melting furnace for refining cannonballs.

73
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,497
The young members of the Choshu Domain

74
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:50,897
poured their hearts

75
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:53,997
into constructing this reverberating furnace themselves.

76
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:58,697
But ultimately, their passion failed to achieve results.

77
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:03,497
Years later, you can still feel the passion of the young patriots

78
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,897
who never stopped working towards their dream.

79
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,497
This is Natsume.

80
00:06:17,497 --> 00:06:19,397
Asuka, are you all right?

81
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:21,697
What? Mr. Mouri.

82
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,297
I'm fine.

83
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,397
Good.

84
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:28,197
Did something happen?

85
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:33,597
Someone shot at me with a gun earlier.

86
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:36,597
With a gun? Are you all right?

87
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,497
Yes. Fortunately, I'm fine.

88
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:43,997
It must have been Komakichi Kurataya.

89
00:06:43,997 --> 00:06:47,297
Komakichi Kurataya...

90
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:50,397
Asuka, you could be in danger, too.

91
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:52,997
You're at the reverberating furnace right now, right?

92
00:06:52,997 --> 00:06:54,197
Yes.

93
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:57,097
I'm at the parking lot at the bottom of the steps.

94
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,397
Got it.

95
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:01,497
I'll be right there, so don't move.

96
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:05,097
Understood. Please hurry...

97
00:07:06,797 --> 00:07:08,897
What's wrong, Asuka?

98
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:09,997
Asuka?

99
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,997
Are you all right, Asuka?

100
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:14,397
"Kogoro Mouri, In call" -Answer me, Asuka!

101
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:15,397
Asuka!

102
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:23,497
Asuka!

103
00:07:23,497 --> 00:07:25,397
Where are you?

104
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:27,797
If you're here, answer us!

105
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,797
Asuka!

106
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:39,397
This is...

107
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:41,097
Asuka's phone.

108
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,097
"Takarada, Incoming call"

109
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:45,797
A video call from Takarada?

110
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,797
What? Where's Asuka?

111
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:50,497
Takarada.

112
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:53,497
Asuka has been kidnapped.

113
00:07:53,497 --> 00:07:54,997
What?

114
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:57,797
We heard she was at the parking lot at the reverberating furnace.

115
00:07:57,797 --> 00:08:01,497
But when we got here, we only found her phone.

116
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:04,697
Mouri.

117
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:08,897
It may have been the lawyer Fujiki.

118
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:10,497
Fujiki?

119
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:16,597
Asuka believed Komakichi Kurataya's true identity is Fujiki.

120
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,897
Even if that's true, where could he have taken her?

121
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:21,597
I don't know.

122
00:08:21,597 --> 00:08:24,897
But I heard Fujiki asked Asuka

123
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:28,597
to meet him at Shizuki Park several times.

124
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:31,497
-Shizuki Park? -Yes.

125
00:08:31,497 --> 00:08:34,697
"Hagi Castle Shizuki Park" -It's the park where Hagi Castle is.

126
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:38,397
There are moats and stone walls.

127
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:42,597
He could be hiding the coins he stole there.

128
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:45,497
You think he took Asuka there?

129
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:48,097
I'll head there now,

130
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,497
but it takes about an hour by car to get to Hagi.

131
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,597
Got it.

132
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,597
We'll head there first.

133
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:59,497
Why, though?

134
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:05,697
The old man was shot at with a gun, but Asuka wasn't.

135
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:12,097
Maybe he only shot at the old man to scare him.

136
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:18,097
Does that mean he kidnapped Asuka so he could actually kill her?

137
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:20,597
But where did he take her?

138
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:23,897
Someplace he could kill her without anyone noticing...

139
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:29,697
Keicho coins have a nearly 90 percent gold content.

140
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,697
If melted down into gold bars,

141
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,097
they could be sold.

142
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:38,597
Is he going to...

143
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,597
Ran, let me see Asuka's phone!

144
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:47,397
-What? -I'm going to examine the videos

145
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,897
she previously uploaded to her news site.

146
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,497
Found it.

147
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:55,397
I consider the Hagi Reverberating Furnace a power spot.

148
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,197
A power spot?

149
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,397
The Choshu Domain attempted to construct

150
00:10:00,397 --> 00:10:03,397
the reverberating furnace without any plans.

151
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:07,497
I come here often during my walks to feel the power

152
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:09,897
of those men who faced such difficulties.

153
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:11,197
Oh, right.

154
00:10:11,197 --> 00:10:16,097
"Yuichi Fukuhara (32), Metalworking Researcher" -Your foundry is nearby.

155
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:17,697
Yes.

156
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,697
Driver, stop the car!

157
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:24,197
What are you doing, kid?

158
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:27,497
You guys go to Shizuki Park.

159
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:29,897
There's something I want to check out.

160
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:33,697
Hey! What are you going to check out?

161
00:10:53,597 --> 00:10:54,797
Oh, no! Get down!

162
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:56,697
-What? -It's the cops!

163
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:03,297
That was close.

164
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:07,397
It's like we've done something wrong.

165
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,097
We can't help it.

166
00:11:09,097 --> 00:11:10,797
They want to...

167
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:13,397
We can guarantee your safety.

168
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:16,197
We'll protect you.

169
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:20,897
Wait a minute. Hagi should be outside their jurisdiction.

170
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:24,697
So why did they respond to the shooting?

171
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:29,897
Is that half-wit Komakichi Kurataya?

172
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:45,097
Where is it?

173
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:46,797
Where is the foundry?

174
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:51,097
There it is!

175
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:52,397
I hope I make it in time!

176
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,564
Conan!

177
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,264
This is bad! I need to stop the conveyor belt!

178
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:53,364
-That's it! -Conan, hurry!

179
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:57,164
Stop the belt!

180
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:58,764
Go!

181
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:12,664
I made it in time.

182
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:22,264
You wait here.

183
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:25,364
-What? -He has a gun.

184
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,464
Whatever you do, don't follow me.

185
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:29,864
Dad.

186
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,864
Conan, where are you?

187
00:13:35,864 --> 00:13:38,864
Ran, I found Asuka.

188
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,764
Really? Is she okay?

189
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,764
Yeah. Where's Pops?

190
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:47,864
He just headed into Shizuki Park alone.

191
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,364
Fujiki.

192
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:10,264
That's that half-wit.

193
00:14:10,264 --> 00:14:11,964
So they really are...

194
00:14:38,664 --> 00:14:40,064
Dad!

195
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:49,364
Don't move, you incompetent detective.

196
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,764
Takajo.

197
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,564
I knew it was you.

198
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:57,764
Dad!

199
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:02,664
Don't move.

200
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:12,064
What?

201
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:17,264
-Hey. -Darn. He got away.

202
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:19,864
I thought you were aiming for me.

203
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:23,464
Why would I shoot you?

204
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,664
Someone was trying to shoot you from these bushes.

205
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,664
What?

206
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,864
He dropped this in his panic.

207
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:36,364
Which means the culprit is...

208
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:40,464
Hello?

209
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:42,864
Hey, kid!

210
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,064
Where and what are you...

211
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:47,364
What?

212
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:57,664
I'm sorry I'm late, Mouri.

213
00:15:57,664 --> 00:16:00,164
I've been waiting for you, Takarada.

214
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:04,364
It really does take over an hour from Yamaguchi.

215
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,964
Yes.

216
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:10,564
"Akihiko Takarada (45)" -Anyway, were you able to find Asuka?

217
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:11,564
What?

218
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:17,764
What are the police and Fujiki doing with you?

219
00:16:17,764 --> 00:16:20,864
What's going on?

220
00:16:20,864 --> 00:16:22,664
Takarada.

221
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:28,964
Did you know Fujiki had become Fukuhara Yuichi's lawyer?

222
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:29,964
What?

223
00:16:29,964 --> 00:16:35,764
Apparently Fukuhara believes you may be Komakichi Kurataya.

224
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:38,164
What? Who, me?

225
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:43,464
You expressed disapproval of your father's will.

226
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:47,764
The will stated that all the artworks and knickknacks

227
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:51,864
in the storehouse should be donated to local institutions.

228
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:55,064
So you wanted at least the coins for yourself.

229
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:59,864
After all, if you melted them down, you could sell them.

230
00:16:59,864 --> 00:17:01,164
Wait a minute.

231
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:04,664
Do you have any proof it was me?

232
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,464
There is no evidence.

233
00:17:06,464 --> 00:17:09,564
But weren't you beginning to notice

234
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:12,164
that Asuka suspected you?

235
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,864
So you kidnapped her and attempted to silence her.

236
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:20,364
Officer, don't tell me you believe them.

237
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:23,164
I was shot in the arm by the robber.

238
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:24,464
You were,

239
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:29,664
but the bullet barely scratched your left arm.

240
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:34,864
It's possible you shot yourself so you could pretend to be a victim.

241
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,364
What are you talking about?

242
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:37,764
You don't even have proof.

243
00:17:37,764 --> 00:17:39,164
There is proof.

244
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:43,664
-What? -You tried to kill me twice.

245
00:17:43,664 --> 00:17:46,664
What are you talking about?

246
00:17:46,664 --> 00:17:49,764
About an hour and a half ago, you shot at me once.

247
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:55,364
Then again an hour ago.

248
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:01,264
I have an alibi.

249
00:18:01,264 --> 00:18:04,664
I just got here.

250
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:07,264
I was in Yamaguchi City until then.

251
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:10,164
I called you from my garage.

252
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:14,564
Was that actually the garage at your home?

253
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:19,264
There was a flashy sports car behind you.

254
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:24,064
Anyone would assume it was your garage.

255
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:25,364
I don't understand.

256
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:27,364
The culprit Komakichi Kurataya deliberately appeared

257
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:31,364
on your webcam dressed as a Kiheitai soldier.

258
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:36,664
A memorable outfit diminishes your impression of the actual culprit.

259
00:18:36,664 --> 00:18:39,664
Did you not employ the same technique to make us believe

260
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:45,764
you were in your garage by having a flashy sports car in the background?

261
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:49,664
If it wasn't my garage, where was I?

262
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:51,664
-Ran. -Okay.

263
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,164
Conan, are you ready?

264
00:18:54,164 --> 00:18:56,564
Yeah. I'm ready anytime.

265
00:18:56,564 --> 00:18:57,864
You're facing him now.

266
00:19:00,164 --> 00:19:02,264
Hello, Takarada.

267
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:05,464
You said the construction next to your shop is noisy

268
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:08,464
from morning until night,

269
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:10,964
but when you called us earlier,

270
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:13,764
we didn't hear any construction sounds.

271
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:20,964
That's how I knew you weren't inside your garage,

272
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:23,264
but inside a truck.

273
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:30,264
You pretended you were calling us from your garage,

274
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:33,364
but you've actually been here in Hagi

275
00:19:33,364 --> 00:19:36,164
calling us from inside this truck.

276
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:39,164
What? Where's Asuka?

277
00:19:39,164 --> 00:19:40,764
Takarada.

278
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,964
Asuka has been kidnapped.

279
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,364
What?

280
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:50,264
And you brought Asuka here when you kidnapped her.

281
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,464
Takarada.

282
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:58,364
You really are the robber Komakichi Kurataya!

283
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,364
Darn it!

284
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:01,664
He's not getting away!

285
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:13,764
Darn!

286
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:02,864
Yuichi.

287
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:06,464
Asuka.

288
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:09,864
Welcome back.

289
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:12,964
I'm back.

290
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:19,464
What's going on?

291
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:23,564
I thought Asuka and Fukuhara were just acquaintances.

292
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:25,664
Too bad, Pops.

293
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:27,764
Shut up.

294
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:32,264
Anyway, I'm glad he was released after exactly one year.

295
00:22:32,264 --> 00:22:39,364
Asuka probably wanted to find the culprit before his sentence was up.

296
00:22:39,364 --> 00:22:41,664
That's right.

297
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,664
Fukuhara said he'd find

298
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:47,264
the culprit himself once he got out.

299
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:51,864
Asuka didn't want him to do anything dangerous.

300
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:58,364
You knew about Asuka's plan from the beginning.

301
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:00,864
You finally figured it out, you incompetent detective?

302
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,064
What was that, you half-wit?

303
00:23:04,064 --> 00:23:08,964
I'm the one who told Asuka to get you involved.

304
00:23:08,964 --> 00:23:10,764
What?

305
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,964
I told her this case could only be solved

306
00:23:12,964 --> 00:23:15,164
by Japan's greatest detective,

307
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:20,564
The Great Kogoro Mouri.

308
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,764
Why not celebrate

309
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:28,464
by eating some of Yamaguchi's famous Kawara Soba noodles?

310
00:23:28,464 --> 00:23:32,964
A delicious meal should satisfy your empty stomach.

311
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:35,464
I can't be satisfied by food.

312
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:38,064
There's lots of good local sake, too.

313
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,564
Well, then I guess I can let you off the hook.

314
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:48,664
A half-wit police officer and an incompetent detective?

315
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:52,764
They make a good team.

316
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:56,364
"Next Episode"

317
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,464
Isn't it wonderful, Conan?

318
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,064
It really is.

319
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:05,764
This is kind of like what happened to that ship.

320
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:08,864
You mean the Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

321
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,964
The Mystery of the Mary Celeste?

322
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:12,064
"Curse"

323
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:19,064
Did they walk into the lake like the five passengers?

324
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:20,964
Next Conan,

325
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:24,264
"The Mystery of the Michelin Starred Restaurant"

326
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:27,007
Next Conan's Hint:

327
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,607
"Mary Celeste"

328
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:31,407
I want to eat at a Michelin starred restaurant!

329
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,107
Starred? The suspect could be there.

330
00:24:33,107 --> 00:24:34,207
He's right?
