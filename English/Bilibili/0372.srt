1
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.240
Today's stage is also Okinawa!

2
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.840
An alibi trick that goes through the sky.

3
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.540
See through the case with deduction from a different angle.

4
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.740
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.425
A TV program is to be aired with

8
00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:00.125
professional baseball player, Toshizou Nose,

9
00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.825
sports reporter, Masaharu Motoyama and Pops in a talk show,

10
00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.525
so we all head off to Okinawa.

11
00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:10.325
We join Mr. Motoyama at Naha Airport,

12
00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:13.225
and go to see Mr. Nose,

13
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:14.625
however, on the way...

14
00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:18.125
That is...

15
00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:19.925
The uniform of the Jaguars.

16
00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:26.625
-Hey! Isn't that Mr. Nose? -No way.

17
00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:30.225
Hurry and contact the police and get an ambulance!

18
00:02:30.225 --> 00:02:31.725
The police?

19
00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:40.225
At any rate, please arrest the murderer as soon as possible.

20
00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.325
The devil who got in the way of my best friend

21
00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:45.725
making his Japan record of saves.

22
00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:47.425
No, not right.

23
00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:49.125
He's the killer.

24
00:03:00.025 --> 00:03:01.125
What the...

25
00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:15.625
"The Silent Route (Part 2)"

26
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:19.125
Conan...

27
00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:22.225
What's the matter?

28
00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:23.225
Are you all right?

29
00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:24.725
What a frightening look you have on your face.

30
00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:26.625
It's nothing.

31
00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:28.425
Really?

32
00:03:28.425 --> 00:03:31.125
Yeah. I was surprised too.

33
00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:34.425
-Well, I'll tell you the details again later. -What was that just now?

34
00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:38.025
Oh, right! Mr. Teranishi, please lend me the car key.

35
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:39.925
I forgot something in the car.

36
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:55.725
Excuse me!

37
00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.225
May I ask you something?

38
00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:04.725
What is it, sonny?

39
00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:08.525
The key of the hotel of Miyazaki that you just had

40
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:10.325
isn't disposable, is it?

41
00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:14.725
Why didn't you return it to the front desk

42
00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:16.925
when you checked out?

43
00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:20.125
I haven't checked out yet.

44
00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:23.825
I've got another interview in Miyazaki day after tomorrow.

45
00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:28.625
But, you were planning to have an interview tomorrow too, right?

46
00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:31.425
Going back to the hotel in Miyazaki, then coming back again,

47
00:04:31.425 --> 00:04:34.525
isn't that a waste of plane fare?

48
00:04:34.525 --> 00:04:35.825
You couldn't have known before hand

49
00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:39.425
that the interview tomorrow was going to be cancelled, did you?

50
00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.925
This brat.

51
00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:45.625
Did you find what you forgot?

52
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:47.425
No.

53
00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:49.925
It must've been my mistake.

54
00:04:49.925 --> 00:04:50.925
Thanks for this.

55
00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.325
By the way, why are you all here?

56
00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:01.625
Well, they say they're doing another circumstantial investigation,

57
00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:03.925
where Mr. Nose was found dead.

58
00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:06.425
Well... It's just to be sure.

59
00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:11.125
Excuse me.

60
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.825
Are you left handed?

61
00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:15.025
No.

62
00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:17.625
But you caught the key with your left hand just a while ago.

63
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.225
It's a habit!

64
00:05:19.225 --> 00:05:20.925
I used to be an ace number 4 player of the baseball club

65
00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:22.325
until high school.

66
00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:27.225
And...

67
00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:32.125
Why did you use such a back street to go to Mr. Nose's hotel?

68
00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:36.025
The main roads around that area are crowded just about that time of day.

69
00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:39.025
That's why although it's the long way around,

70
00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:40.625
we can get to our destination faster using the back road.

71
00:05:42.525 --> 00:05:44.025
Wait a second.

72
00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:45.225
If I remember correctly...

73
00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:49.525
I'm sure that...

74
00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:53.625
This is it!

75
00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:57.525
I get it.

76
00:06:04.325 --> 00:06:05.925
So, that's what it was.

77
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:10.625
It's not that he didn't check-out of the hotel.

78
00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:11.925
He couldn't.

79
00:06:13.025 --> 00:06:14.525
No doubt about it.

80
00:06:14.525 --> 00:06:17.325
The killer is Mr. Motoyama.

81
00:06:17.325 --> 00:06:20.025
He's the one who killed Mr. Nose.

82
00:06:21.525 --> 00:06:24.225
He used the back road of the sky to his advantage.

83
00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:32.525
Inspector!

84
00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:35.225
I've finished asking around!

85
00:06:35.225 --> 00:06:37.425
And, did you find any witnesses?

86
00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:38.425
Well...

87
00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:41.525
there was no one who passed by here

88
00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:45.125
just about the time Mr. Nose was killed around 9:30 am.

89
00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:49.825
No witness, weapon nor evidence?

90
00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:52.425
Let's take it easy and take our time, Inspector!

91
00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:53.925
There's still a lot of time

92
00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:56.325
before it's time for us to board our plane for Tokyo,

93
00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:58.125
If you think carefully,

94
00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:01.125
you may come up with evidence

95
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:05.625
that the killer inadvertently forgot to get rid of!

96
00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:08.725
You brat, cut out your irresponsible comments.

97
00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:16.925
Excuse me.

98
00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:18.425
I'm sorry...

99
00:07:18.425 --> 00:07:21.325
but could I be excused to get something to eat?

100
00:07:21.325 --> 00:07:24.725
I haven't had a bite since I've come here.

101
00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:27.825
True.

102
00:07:27.825 --> 00:07:29.325
No problem.

103
00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:30.625
I'll wait here.

104
00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:31.925
So go ahead.

105
00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:34.425
Would you like to come along too?

106
00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:35.825
I guess so.

107
00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:39.225
Let's take my car and go all together then!

108
00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:41.025
Thank you.

109
00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:48.825
This is a restaurant that I come to often,

110
00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:50.225
and it's quite delicious!

111
00:07:51.425 --> 00:07:55.225
Let's eat and return as soon as we can then!

112
00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:01.025
It's from the producer of the TV station.

113
00:08:01.025 --> 00:08:03.925
We'll wait for you inside the restaurant then.

114
00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:06.925
So when you're done could you lock the car and come.

115
00:08:08.725 --> 00:08:10.125
We'll go on ahead.

116
00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:14.525
Conan!

117
00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:16.725
-Okay. -Hello, Motoyama here.

118
00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:18.125
What's up?

119
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:23.125
I got a call on my cell from you that rang once and hung up,

120
00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:24.625
that's why I'm returning your call.

121
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:25.725
I thought that maybe something new came up

122
00:08:25.725 --> 00:08:28.125
regarding Nose's case.

123
00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:29.225
Oh, sorry,

124
00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:32.025
I think I may have mistakenly pushed the button.

125
00:08:35.325 --> 00:08:38.025
I'll contact you if anything comes up.

126
00:08:38.025 --> 00:08:39.125
Goodbye.

127
00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.725
What are you doing, Conan?

128
00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:48.525
Oh, well.

129
00:08:48.525 --> 00:08:53.125
I was just thinking what a great detective Mr. Motoyama is.

130
00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:54.425
Idiot!

131
00:08:54.425 --> 00:08:56.525
You're talking about him sensing that Mr. Nose was killed

132
00:08:56.525 --> 00:08:59.525
just as soon as he saw him lying on the ground, right?

133
00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:03.025
Didn't I tell you that Mr. Motoyama sensed it

134
00:09:03.025 --> 00:09:07.425
because he knew that somebody had been threatening Mr. Nose!

135
00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:08.925
No!

136
00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:14.725
Remember what Mr. Motoyama told me at the airport?

137
00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:16.025
What?

138
00:09:16.025 --> 00:09:18.125
He said, let's go, sonny!

139
00:09:25.425 --> 00:09:27.025
Hey! Let's go, sonny!

140
00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:34.425
So why does that make him a great detective?

141
00:09:34.425 --> 00:09:39.225
Because I was away from you and Ran back then

142
00:09:39.225 --> 00:09:41.825
and I was talking to the security guard.

143
00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:46.825
But you still could tell that I was supposed to be with you.

144
00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:49.425
That's what you call super deduction, right?

145
00:09:49.425 --> 00:09:52.625
Come to think of it...

146
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:55.625
That's strange because this is the first time we ever met.

147
00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:58.125
Well, I guess we can talk it over having a meal.

148
00:09:59.225 --> 00:10:01.525
The place is packed!

149
00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:04.625
I wonder if there are any empty seats?

150
00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:05.825
Everyone!

151
00:10:05.825 --> 00:10:08.025
This way! Over here!

152
00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:11.625
He's found us seats but it's hard to get straight over there.

153
00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.125
Okay, then...

154
00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:15.325
The back road!

155
00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:21.425
There, I'm already here!

156
00:10:23.925 --> 00:10:26.925
Taking the longer way, got me here faster!

157
00:10:40.088 --> 00:10:41.588
This is it.

158
00:10:41.588 --> 00:10:43.688
As long as I get rid of this...

159
00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:50.788
Nobody will ever be able to see through the crime that I...

160
00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:52.588
I'm sorry,

161
00:10:52.588 --> 00:10:57.088
but will you please get the timetable from my bag?

162
00:10:57.088 --> 00:10:59.288
I forgot what time our flight is.

163
00:11:03.988 --> 00:11:07.288
-Is this it? -Thank you.

164
00:11:12.988 --> 00:11:14.888
Oh, that's right!

165
00:11:14.888 --> 00:11:18.788
An acquaintance asked me to get him a souvenir from Okinawa.

166
00:11:18.788 --> 00:11:20.488
Will you tell everyone

167
00:11:20.488 --> 00:11:23.088
to go ahead and finish the meal without me,

168
00:11:23.088 --> 00:11:24.788
because I want to go get the souvenir first?

169
00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:30.288
Well, after I'm done,

170
00:11:30.288 --> 00:11:33.388
I'll buy some bread or something and join you all.

171
00:11:33.388 --> 00:11:35.688
Oh, all right!

172
00:11:49.288 --> 00:11:52.888
"Naha Airport Parking Lot"

173
00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:15.888
My...

174
00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:19.088
You seem to be enjoying yourself a lot.

175
00:12:19.088 --> 00:12:21.188
Your best friend passed away

176
00:12:21.188 --> 00:12:24.088
and you look to be quite over the grief already.

177
00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:26.588
Well, I guess it's only natural.

178
00:12:26.588 --> 00:12:29.288
Because you're the one who killed him.

179
00:12:29.288 --> 00:12:32.088
What? Don't be ridiculous.

180
00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:35.688
You even said I have an alibi.

181
00:12:38.488 --> 00:12:40.288
Nose was killed

182
00:12:40.288 --> 00:12:42.988
if I remember correctly at about 9:30 this morning.

183
00:12:42.988 --> 00:12:45.888
I arrived on the 9:50 am,

184
00:12:45.888 --> 00:12:49.088
flight from Miyazaki to Okinawa, you know?

185
00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:55.588
Moreover, that is the only flight from Miyazaki,

186
00:12:55.588 --> 00:13:00.188
and I was on the program that was aired live in Miyazaki, wasn't I?

187
00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:04.588
So, how could I have killed Nose?

188
00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:08.088
It's true that you couldn't come directly from Miyazaki but...

189
00:13:12.488 --> 00:13:15.388
But if you take the long way around via Tokyo.

190
00:13:15.388 --> 00:13:19.688
It's possible for you to set foot on Okinawa before 9:30 am!

191
00:13:20.788 --> 00:13:22.988
Yes, you avoided the crowded main road

192
00:13:22.988 --> 00:13:27.788
and took the back road which got you faster to your destination.

193
00:13:27.788 --> 00:13:32.788
You took the 8:35 pm flight from Miyazaki to Tokyo

194
00:13:32.788 --> 00:13:38.088
and headed for Okinawa on the 6:55 am morning flight from Tokyo.

195
00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:41.688
This would allow you to arrive here at 9:20 am!

196
00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:45.188
Then you went with that rental car

197
00:13:45.188 --> 00:13:48.488
from the airport to Mr. Nose's jogging route,

198
00:13:48.488 --> 00:13:50.288
ambushed and killed him.

199
00:13:50.288 --> 00:13:53.288
You returned to the airport by 9:50 am

200
00:13:53.288 --> 00:13:56.388
and pretended that you just arrived in Okinawa,

201
00:13:56.388 --> 00:13:59.388
then, came to see us!

202
00:13:59.388 --> 00:14:01.788
Wait!

203
00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:04.288
I came out of the Naha Airport arrival gate

204
00:14:04.288 --> 00:14:07.888
this morning at 09:50 am, right?

205
00:14:09.388 --> 00:14:12.388
Let's say I did come in on the 09:20 am flight

206
00:14:12.388 --> 00:14:14.688
and left the gate going outside once,

207
00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:19.588
how was I supposed to enter the arrival lobby again?

208
00:14:19.588 --> 00:14:22.088
-Well... -Well...

209
00:14:22.088 --> 00:14:23.988
That's true.

210
00:14:25.188 --> 00:14:27.188
-See. -Hey.

211
00:14:27.188 --> 00:14:29.688
Mr. Mouri.

212
00:14:29.688 --> 00:14:32.788
We came here because you said you figured out who the killer was.

213
00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:33.988
Oh, well.

214
00:14:33.988 --> 00:14:37.188
-Talk about hopeless. -Right, that's right.

215
00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:42.888
Why were the people in the store a while ago giving us strange looks?

216
00:14:42.888 --> 00:14:44.388
Of course!

217
00:14:44.388 --> 00:14:46.588
We went into the store,

218
00:14:46.588 --> 00:14:49.088
sat down and left without ordering anything.

219
00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:51.088
I'll bet you're hungry.

220
00:14:51.088 --> 00:14:53.088
Would you like my juice?

221
00:14:53.088 --> 00:14:54.888
Oh, yes, please!

222
00:14:54.888 --> 00:14:58.488
You went into the store and left without ordering anything?

223
00:14:58.488 --> 00:15:00.288
Hey!

224
00:15:00.288 --> 00:15:03.888
Come to think of it, the embarkation and arrival floors of Naha Airport

225
00:15:03.888 --> 00:15:06.188
are connected on the inside?

226
00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:08.288
Yes, that's right.

227
00:15:08.288 --> 00:15:10.088
Which means...

228
00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:11.888
you could've just bought any ticket

229
00:15:11.888 --> 00:15:13.488
and go inside from the embarkation gate

230
00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:17.188
and come out from the arrival gate without boarding the plane.

231
00:15:17.188 --> 00:15:19.588
That's right, exactly!

232
00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:22.888
Which means you still not being checked out

233
00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:26.688
from the hotel in Miyazaki suspicious too.

234
00:15:26.688 --> 00:15:29.988
If you came from Miyazaki to Okinawa on this morning's flight,

235
00:15:29.988 --> 00:15:33.888
you would've checked out from the hotel in Miyazaki.

236
00:15:33.888 --> 00:15:36.488
If you also have an interview scheduled in Okinawa tomorrow,

237
00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:39.188
it's only natural for you to spend the night here.

238
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.988
But you couldn't do so

239
00:15:40.988 --> 00:15:45.288
because you were already away from Miyazaki at that time.

240
00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:49.888
Isn't it because you're on a flight last night and already in Tokyo?

241
00:15:49.888 --> 00:15:51.488
Any evidence?

242
00:15:51.488 --> 00:15:54.488
Of course we've got evidence!

243
00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:56.388
Right, Mr. Mouri?

244
00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:59.088
What?

245
00:15:59.088 --> 00:16:00.388
Now, what was it?

246
00:16:00.388 --> 00:16:03.688
Let's leave the rest up to the famous detective!

247
00:16:06.988 --> 00:16:09.388
Pops!

248
00:16:09.388 --> 00:16:11.088
You want juice, don't you?

249
00:16:18.888 --> 00:16:20.188
Right!

250
00:16:20.188 --> 00:16:21.488
That's right!

251
00:16:21.488 --> 00:16:24.088
Please check the flight from Tokyo to Okinawa

252
00:16:24.088 --> 00:16:28.188
that Mr. Motoyama used to carry out his trick

253
00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:30.688
because we were on board that flight too.

254
00:16:31.988 --> 00:16:36.088
My daughter happened to spill tennis balls on board this flight.

255
00:16:36.088 --> 00:16:40.088
And the passenger in the next seat helped pick up the balls.

256
00:16:40.088 --> 00:16:43.088
He was among the passengers,

257
00:16:43.088 --> 00:16:46.088
a suspicious man that caught the tennis ball

258
00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.888
with his left hand.

259
00:16:47.888 --> 00:16:50.388
Was that Mr. Motoyama?

260
00:16:50.388 --> 00:16:53.588
But, isn't he right-handed?

261
00:16:53.588 --> 00:16:57.388
A habit since he caught so many balls with his left hand.

262
00:16:57.388 --> 00:17:02.488
Moreover, his job required him to protect is right hand.

263
00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:05.588
That's why he used his left hand

264
00:17:05.588 --> 00:17:06.988
without thinking.

265
00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:11.488
So, please give it to me.

266
00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:15.688
The stuff that you took out from Ran's bag and hid in your pocket.

267
00:17:15.688 --> 00:17:17.688
Mr. Masaharu Motoyama,

268
00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:19.588
the baseball player who in the past,

269
00:17:19.588 --> 00:17:21.588
was awarded the King of rookie and save.

270
00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:24.288
Just what are you talking about?

271
00:17:24.288 --> 00:17:26.788
You're sweating! You must be hot?

272
00:17:26.788 --> 00:17:29.188
How about some juice?

273
00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:47.888
Yes.

274
00:17:47.888 --> 00:17:51.188
Your fingerprints on the tennis ball that you picked up back then

275
00:17:51.188 --> 00:17:54.188
is evidence that you are the killer.

276
00:17:56.288 --> 00:17:57.288
That is what I'd like to say

277
00:17:57.288 --> 00:17:59.388
but that's not how it is.

278
00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:04.788
The surface of a hard tennis ball is fluffy making it difficult

279
00:18:04.788 --> 00:18:07.388
for fingerprints to remain.

280
00:18:07.388 --> 00:18:08.988
And, even if it were found on the ball,

281
00:18:08.988 --> 00:18:13.488
it would only serve as proof that you were on the same flight as we were.

282
00:18:13.488 --> 00:18:17.288
It won't serve as proof that you killed Mr. Nose.

283
00:18:17.288 --> 00:18:20.688
That's why we deliberately made you steal the can of tennis balls

284
00:18:20.688 --> 00:18:22.288
and made you swim.

285
00:18:25.388 --> 00:18:27.388
Because we figured you would undoubtedly lead us

286
00:18:27.388 --> 00:18:30.888
to the weapon you used for the murder

287
00:18:30.888 --> 00:18:32.288
and the place you hid the clothes splotched

288
00:18:32.288 --> 00:18:34.688
with blood when you killed the victim!

289
00:18:34.688 --> 00:18:37.188
This is unmistakably immovable evidence!

290
00:18:37.188 --> 00:18:39.588
But, how amazing that you saw through everything

291
00:18:39.588 --> 00:18:41.688
just by watching him catch the can with his left hand!

292
00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:43.088
Well...

293
00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:45.488
I happened to remember that Mr. Motoyama,

294
00:18:45.488 --> 00:18:46.888
though we met for the first time,

295
00:18:46.888 --> 00:18:50.088
called out to this boy knowing that

296
00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.588
he was with us and everything fell in place!

297
00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:54.188
I figured that maybe Mr. Motoyama saw us all together somewhere

298
00:18:54.188 --> 00:18:58.488
before seeing us at the airport.

299
00:18:59.988 --> 00:19:05.188
Well, even a snotty kid like him can be of use at times.

300
00:19:05.188 --> 00:19:08.488
I should've put him to sleep with the tranquilizer gun after all.

301
00:19:08.488 --> 00:19:10.488
Talk about ironic.

302
00:19:10.488 --> 00:19:13.288
To think that my habit ended my baseball career,

303
00:19:13.288 --> 00:19:16.388
and again with this habit of mine, I dug my own grave.

304
00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:21.588
Nose told me that I got a habit when pitching on my first season off

305
00:19:21.588 --> 00:19:24.588
after I received the King of Rookie and King of Save.

306
00:19:24.588 --> 00:19:26.488
I checked myself over and over.

307
00:19:26.488 --> 00:19:28.188
To the point of going neurotic.

308
00:19:29.288 --> 00:19:31.588
But I couldn't find any habit.

309
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.888
Not only that, I damaged my shoulder

310
00:19:32.888 --> 00:19:35.288
because of over pitching during the off season.

311
00:19:36.688 --> 00:19:39.788
I thought that it was strange that after I resigned,

312
00:19:39.788 --> 00:19:41.388
Nose suddenly became very friendly

313
00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:45.288
and introduced me to TV jobs and such.

314
00:19:45.288 --> 00:19:46.688
Then last month,

315
00:19:46.688 --> 00:19:47.688
after coincidentally seeing the VTR

316
00:19:47.688 --> 00:19:49.688
of a sports variety program before editing,

317
00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:52.688
I finally understood why he did so.

318
00:19:53.888 --> 00:19:56.688
Are there any other interesting stories?

319
00:19:56.688 --> 00:19:58.888
Mr. Nose, please tell us!

320
00:19:58.888 --> 00:20:03.588
Well, it's easy to get rid of a young pitcher.

321
00:20:03.588 --> 00:20:05.488
All I did was whisper that he had a habit

322
00:20:05.488 --> 00:20:07.488
and he self-destructed.

323
00:20:07.488 --> 00:20:08.888
-What? -What?

324
00:20:08.888 --> 00:20:10.688
Cut the part out!

325
00:20:10.688 --> 00:20:11.788
I don't want trouble.

326
00:20:11.788 --> 00:20:13.088
Are you serious?

327
00:20:13.088 --> 00:20:15.888
No, it's something I heard from somebody else!

328
00:20:17.788 --> 00:20:21.188
Yes, I never had a habit to begin with.

329
00:20:21.188 --> 00:20:23.288
But I felt obligated to him and swayed between joy and sorrow

330
00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:26.988
because he became the guardian of the Jaguars after me.

331
00:20:26.988 --> 00:20:29.988
I supported him as if he was myself.

332
00:20:29.988 --> 00:20:32.388
That's why I'm so vexed and wretched.

333
00:20:32.388 --> 00:20:34.888
Is that why you killed him?

334
00:20:34.888 --> 00:20:41.388
Yes. I kept him from making his Japan save record.

335
00:20:41.388 --> 00:20:44.888
Using Hideyoshi's "great revenge" trick.

336
00:20:44.888 --> 00:20:46.688
Because the real person to break the national record

337
00:20:46.688 --> 00:20:49.388
and have worldwide fame should have been me.

338
00:20:49.388 --> 00:20:52.088
I wanted to make him realize that!

339
00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:55.888
No.

340
00:20:55.888 --> 00:20:58.788
You would've never made the Japan record.

341
00:20:58.788 --> 00:21:00.388
What?

342
00:21:00.388 --> 00:21:03.688
I feel sorry for the fact that you were deceived

343
00:21:03.688 --> 00:21:07.688
but a stopper is the last stockade for the team.

344
00:21:07.688 --> 00:21:09.188
Even if you're beaten and battered,

345
00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:11.288
no mattered if you're jeered at or what,

346
00:21:11.288 --> 00:21:13.188
if your turn to play comes up in the next game,

347
00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:16.588
you've got to stand on the mound as if nothing happened!

348
00:21:16.588 --> 00:21:20.188
I don't think a guy who loses himself

349
00:21:20.188 --> 00:21:23.988
and commits murder can shoulder the fate of a team.

350
00:21:25.788 --> 00:21:27.488
Pops.

351
00:21:27.488 --> 00:21:28.688
Dad.

352
00:21:30.788 --> 00:21:34.488
I'm the one who wants to cry!

353
00:21:34.488 --> 00:21:37.588
Thanks to you doing something like this.

354
00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:39.688
After I went all out to...

355
00:21:39.688 --> 00:21:41.188
No, forget it.

356
00:21:42.488 --> 00:21:44.988
Do the rest of your repenting behind bars.

357
00:21:46.688 --> 00:21:49.288
What were you going to say, dad?

358
00:21:49.288 --> 00:21:50.888
It's nothing.

359
00:23:25.988 --> 00:23:27.088
Darn it.

360
00:23:33.588 --> 00:23:36.488
I went out of my way to get it and then.

361
00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:47.288
Now, I can't give to her even if I wanted to.

362
00:23:47.288 --> 00:23:48.988
No, wait a second.

363
00:23:48.988 --> 00:23:52.388
If this is going to be his final autograph,

364
00:23:52.388 --> 00:23:55.188
this is be a super rare item.

365
00:23:55.188 --> 00:23:56.888
Dad?

366
00:23:59.588 --> 00:24:02.188
"Next Episode" -That's a red-back spider, isn't it?

367
00:24:09.688 --> 00:24:11.288
Don't touch it!

368
00:24:11.288 --> 00:24:14.288
We have to leave it that way until the police get here.

369
00:24:14.288 --> 00:24:15.688
This is not an accident!

370
00:24:18.088 --> 00:24:19.888
Pops Kogoro said that,

371
00:24:19.888 --> 00:24:23.988
it's strange that only the serum for the Black Widow Spider is missing.

372
00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:29.588
Next Conan, "Deadly Venom Spider Trap"

373
00:24:30.215 --> 00:24:32.515
Next Conan's Hint:

374
00:24:32.515 --> 00:24:34.315
"Telephone"

375
00:24:34.315 --> 00:24:35.915
Finally in the next episode is the new semester

376
00:24:35.915 --> 00:24:37.515
Conan and school will start off energetically!

377
00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:39.215
Ran, your face is black with tan.
