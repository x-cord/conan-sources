1
00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:04.191
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:05.991
After the tears is "A Ramen Shop Owner".

3
00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:07.591
He was definitely there, but has disappeared.

4
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.391
What is the identity of the outrageous police officer?

5
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:11.791
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.491
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:15.191
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:57.143 --> 00:02:00.343
It was in the morning, the first Monday of the month.

9
00:02:00.343 --> 00:02:02.143
Where are those guys?

10
00:02:02.143 --> 00:02:03.743
Man! They're late.

11
00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:05.443
Genta!

12
00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:07.443
Hey! Hurry up!

13
00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:08.743
Genta!

14
00:02:08.743 --> 00:02:09.743
What is it?

15
00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:13.643
What's this about some great information you have for us?

16
00:02:14.743 --> 00:02:19.343
So, did you guys see the Saturday Drama last night?

17
00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:23.343
You mean, "Run! The 100 Police Officer Dragnets"?

18
00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:24.943
Yeah! That's the one!

19
00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:26.143
Well, I saw it, but... So?

20
00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:28.743
What's up with the show?

21
00:02:28.743 --> 00:02:31.143
As soon as I saw it, I came straight here.

22
00:02:31.143 --> 00:02:35.343
Here, Beika Park, is where they shot that show! No doubt about it!

23
00:02:35.343 --> 00:02:38.443
That's it? Anyone could have told you that!

24
00:02:38.443 --> 00:02:40.943
Yeah, I knew it was this park as soon as I saw the show.

25
00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:44.343
-What? -"There's some case in the park!"

26
00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:47.743
As soon as I heard the main character

27
00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:49.643
say that lame line.

28
00:02:49.643 --> 00:02:52.143
I knew the show was shot right there.

29
00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:56.343
It was just a bud when it was filmed.

30
00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:59.443
So they shot the show about a couple of weeks ago, perhaps.

31
00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:02.743
So, Genta saying he had something great to tell us was true after all.

32
00:03:02.743 --> 00:03:04.343
Yeah.

33
00:03:04.343 --> 00:03:08.243
I thought I was the only one who knew that they shot the show here!

34
00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:16.443
You know, turning it all into a drama is just the worst, you know?

35
00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:18.343
Really.

36
00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.143
They were just trying to make things look cool

37
00:03:20.143 --> 00:03:21.443
by having a scene with a whole bunch

38
00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:25.643
-of uniformed officers. -Enough. No more about that show.

39
00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:27.343
Hey, Yasuyo!

40
00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:30.043
Ayumi, how's everything?

41
00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.243
Good.

42
00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:32.743
This is Yasuyo Akimoto.

43
00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:34.943
"Yasuyo Akimoto (24)" -She is living in 3-chome now,

44
00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.943
but before, she lived in an apartment close to me.

45
00:03:37.943 --> 00:03:39.643
So, Yasuyo, you were out shopping?

46
00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:41.043
Oh, this?

47
00:03:41.043 --> 00:03:43.443
They're just some sweets I had sent that my hometown is famous for making.

48
00:03:43.443 --> 00:03:46.243
I was thinking of giving some to this police officer.

49
00:03:46.243 --> 00:03:48.143
A police officer?

50
00:03:54.743 --> 00:03:56.443
I don't know his name,

51
00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.643
but he seems like a really decent guy.

52
00:03:58.643 --> 00:04:00.443
Even if he does have a beard.

53
00:04:06.343 --> 00:04:07.943
So, he's got a beard?

54
00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:10.443
I'd like to see this guy.

55
00:04:10.443 --> 00:04:13.543
-Right, Conan? -Yeah.

56
00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:15.443
"Komehana Station"

57
00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:17.043
"Komehana Station Police Box" -You've never seen that kind

58
00:04:17.043 --> 00:04:19.243
of police officer?

59
00:04:19.243 --> 00:04:21.343
He has a beard and wears glasses.

60
00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:23.743
Yeah, there's no such police officer

61
00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:26.343
in the Komehana Police Department, and of course this police box.

62
00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:30.443
But I, when you were on patrol, we would see each other all the time.

63
00:04:30.443 --> 00:04:33.543
But, that's when I'm not at the station.

64
00:04:33.543 --> 00:04:35.143
What's going on?

65
00:04:35.143 --> 00:04:36.243
Hard to say.

66
00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.943
-Just what is going on here? -Just as I thought.

67
00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:44.543
There's no way a beard is allowed under the police dress code.

68
00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:47.543
Therefore, this guy is only posing as a police officer.

69
00:04:49.943 --> 00:04:55.643
"The Police Officer Who Disappeared"

70
00:04:56.543 --> 00:04:58.143
Man, oh man!

71
00:04:59.443 --> 00:05:02.243
Do you have to call on me so often?

72
00:05:02.243 --> 00:05:04.643
Yeah, but you're the only one we can depend on.

73
00:05:04.643 --> 00:05:06.643
What with officer impersonators in the police department.

74
00:05:06.643 --> 00:05:08.043
Isn't this a big deal?

75
00:05:08.043 --> 00:05:10.243
Officer impersonators?

76
00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:15.343
Impersonating an officer of the law,

77
00:05:15.343 --> 00:05:20.243
even for a con artist, is the lowest of the low.

78
00:05:20.243 --> 00:05:23.543
Ms. Akimoto, you've seen this man a number of times before, right?

79
00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:25.243
Yeah.

80
00:05:25.243 --> 00:05:28.743
Things were busy at work, and I had been staying late this whole week

81
00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:33.343
up until yesterday, I was coming home every night on the last train.

82
00:05:33.343 --> 00:05:37.643
I first met that police officer the first night I stayed late at work,

83
00:05:37.643 --> 00:05:40.043
it was late Monday night.

84
00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:41.343
I had just gotten off the last train home,

85
00:05:41.343 --> 00:05:43.743
and was heading towards my house in the third chome.

86
00:05:43.743 --> 00:05:46.943
It's not safe for a woman to be walking outside alone so late, you know.

87
00:05:47.943 --> 00:05:50.543
You take care, OK?

88
00:05:52.543 --> 00:05:54.743
Then, the next day, and the next.

89
00:05:54.743 --> 00:05:57.843
Well, at any rate, for the week, every night

90
00:05:57.843 --> 00:06:00.743
when I was coming home from work,

91
00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:03.543
I ran into this officer one of the nights,

92
00:06:03.543 --> 00:06:05.543
he was helping this elderly couple.

93
00:06:05.543 --> 00:06:09.543
You know, it's not safe. You really shouldn't be walking around at night.

94
00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:12.543
Well, she was the one who up and said that she wants some soda.

95
00:06:12.543 --> 00:06:14.943
You were the one who said you could go for some custard.

96
00:06:14.943 --> 00:06:18.243
Good evening!

97
00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:20.243
Good evening, ma'am.

98
00:06:20.243 --> 00:06:22.843
Last night, he was helping a drunk guy.

99
00:06:23.843 --> 00:06:27.543
Hey, watch it, watch it. Your house far from here?

100
00:06:28.843 --> 00:06:30.543
You know, you'd better take a cab home.

101
00:06:30.543 --> 00:06:34.043
I'm fine! I can make it home on my own!

102
00:06:34.043 --> 00:06:37.943
But you're not fine. Oh, here we go. Let's get you up.

103
00:06:37.943 --> 00:06:40.143
You always seem to have your work cut out for you.

104
00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:42.343
Well, it's just that... It's my job, ma'am.

105
00:06:42.343 --> 00:06:43.943
You be careful yourself, OK?

106
00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:45.543
Yes, sir!

107
00:06:45.543 --> 00:06:48.243
Listening to all of this, he sounds like an absolute dream.

108
00:06:49.243 --> 00:06:52.343
No kidding, right? How can this guy not be an officer?

109
00:06:52.343 --> 00:06:55.043
Yeah, but, why did he go through all of the trouble

110
00:06:55.043 --> 00:06:58.643
of pretending to be a police officer?

111
00:06:58.643 --> 00:07:00.643
Yeah, why'd he do it?

112
00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:03.443
I think he was pretending to be a police officer

113
00:07:03.443 --> 00:07:06.743
and planning some sort of bad thing!

114
00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:08.543
What do you mean, 'bad thing'?

115
00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:11.343
Well, I'm not quite sure yet.

116
00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:15.643
Hello. This is...

117
00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.443
So you say you had a break-in the other day.

118
00:07:18.443 --> 00:07:20.643
No, we still haven't caught the guy yet.

119
00:07:20.643 --> 00:07:21.643
Considering the MO,

120
00:07:21.643 --> 00:07:23.343
it looks like the work of the same guy

121
00:07:23.343 --> 00:07:25.343
committing all of the other break-ins

122
00:07:25.343 --> 00:07:26.643
that have been going on for about a week.

123
00:07:26.643 --> 00:07:29.643
So it's a break-in crime spree?

124
00:07:29.643 --> 00:07:33.043
So, someone must have seen this guy.

125
00:07:33.043 --> 00:07:35.743
Like the old couple, or perhaps the drunk guy.

126
00:07:35.743 --> 00:07:36.743
That's it!

127
00:07:36.743 --> 00:07:39.443
One of them might help shed some light on all of this!

128
00:07:39.443 --> 00:07:40.543
Ms. Akimoto,

129
00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.443
do you know where any of these people might be?

130
00:07:42.443 --> 00:07:44.843
I don't know about the drunk guy from last night,

131
00:07:44.843 --> 00:07:46.543
but as far as the elderly couple goes,

132
00:07:46.543 --> 00:07:49.243
I've seen them a number of times at Tetsuryu.

133
00:07:49.243 --> 00:07:50.743
Tetsuryu?

134
00:07:50.743 --> 00:07:52.643
"Tetsuryu"

135
00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:54.443
"Tetsuji Odawara (33)"

136
00:07:54.443 --> 00:07:56.043
Police officer impersonator?

137
00:07:56.043 --> 00:07:59.243
-He looks really upset, right? -Totally.

138
00:07:59.243 --> 00:08:02.343
I'm not upset! It's nothing.

139
00:08:02.343 --> 00:08:04.543
The guy who runs the place isn't the most easy-going person in the world,

140
00:08:04.543 --> 00:08:06.943
but he does make great ramen, for sure.

141
00:08:06.943 --> 00:08:09.643
So that's why I always come here to eat.

142
00:08:10.743 --> 00:08:12.143
See, right here.

143
00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:14.743
You're right.

144
00:08:16.543 --> 00:08:18.743
So this is it. The secret ingredient!

145
00:08:18.743 --> 00:08:21.743
Hey, you can't do that.

146
00:08:22.743 --> 00:08:24.543
No.

147
00:08:24.543 --> 00:08:27.743
Oh, my goodness. Genta, you got it all over me.

148
00:08:27.743 --> 00:08:29.443
The sauce spilled out?

149
00:08:30.543 --> 00:08:34.343
It's like I've been swimming in ramen.

150
00:08:34.343 --> 00:08:38.043
-Genta! -It's not like I did it on purpose!

151
00:08:39.043 --> 00:08:42.043
So, do you think you might know anything

152
00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:43.743
that might help us find this officer impersonator?

153
00:08:43.743 --> 00:08:47.343
Sometimes I see that old couple in here.

154
00:08:47.343 --> 00:08:49.443
They seem to really like you.

155
00:08:49.443 --> 00:08:51.043
The Takayanagis?

156
00:08:51.043 --> 00:08:53.743
Yeah, they live...

157
00:08:55.943 --> 00:08:57.843
That's them.

158
00:08:58.843 --> 00:09:00.543
Police officer impersonator?

159
00:09:00.543 --> 00:09:03.743
There has to be some sort of mistake? Right?

160
00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:06.643
Yes, you're right.

161
00:09:06.643 --> 00:09:09.743
He was such a kind and gentle police officer.

162
00:09:09.743 --> 00:09:11.143
Is that so?

163
00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:13.143
So he has a good reputation in this place.

164
00:09:13.143 --> 00:09:16.143
I don't think what people say could get any better.

165
00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:19.143
Who on earth is this guy?

166
00:09:19.143 --> 00:09:20.243
Detective Takagi.

167
00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:22.043
Just now, I heard of another burglary

168
00:09:22.043 --> 00:09:26.943
at a home late last night in the second chome.

169
00:09:26.943 --> 00:09:30.743
There was some talk earlier about a spate of burglaries?

170
00:09:30.743 --> 00:09:33.943
Yes. So this officer impersonator seems to be showing his true colors.

171
00:09:33.943 --> 00:09:35.443
Pretending to be on patrol,

172
00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:37.643
he's looking for houses that he can break into,

173
00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:40.443
then robbing people blind.

174
00:09:42.543 --> 00:09:43.743
You mean...

175
00:09:43.743 --> 00:09:44.943
A burglar?

176
00:09:44.943 --> 00:09:47.943
There is a possiblity that that's what is happening.

177
00:09:47.943 --> 00:09:49.243
No, it can't be.

178
00:09:49.243 --> 00:09:52.243
I just cannot believe that he would be doing such terrible things!

179
00:09:52.243 --> 00:09:56.143
Then, for what reason do you think he posing as a fake police officer?

180
00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:57.743
Officer Arai.

181
00:09:57.743 --> 00:10:01.743
No, I think the one who broke into the house is someone else.

182
00:10:07.943 --> 00:10:09.743
I'm going to the scene of the crime.

183
00:10:09.743 --> 00:10:11.743
Excuse me.

184
00:10:13.643 --> 00:10:17.543
I thought you were a really nice police officer.

185
00:10:17.543 --> 00:10:19.643
Yasuyo.

186
00:10:19.643 --> 00:10:22.343
It's no wonder people lose trust in others.

187
00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:25.543
Good luck looking for the fake police officer.

188
00:10:25.543 --> 00:10:26.743
What about you, Haibara?

189
00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:28.943
I pass.

190
00:10:31.843 --> 00:10:35.243
So the fake police officer was a thief.

191
00:10:35.243 --> 00:10:37.143
No, he somehow doesn't fit the profile

192
00:10:37.143 --> 00:10:40.043
that Yasuyo and the others are giving us.

193
00:10:40.043 --> 00:10:42.143
-Right! -We've got to look for the person

194
00:10:42.143 --> 00:10:43.543
who witnessed the fake police officer.

195
00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:46.443
We've got no choice but to gather whatever information we can.

196
00:10:46.443 --> 00:10:48.943
I guess you should find out

197
00:10:48.943 --> 00:10:51.543
where he got the police officer's outfit from, too, right?

198
00:10:51.543 --> 00:10:54.543
Right, but that's strange, too.

199
00:10:54.543 --> 00:10:55.743
If a police officer's outfit were to be stolen,

200
00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:58.643
there should already be a big fuss, but...

201
00:10:58.643 --> 00:11:00.843
It's hard to get hold of the real thing,

202
00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:03.343
but if it's one that was used to shoot a drama or something?

203
00:11:03.343 --> 00:11:04.843
Something used for a drama?

204
00:11:06.343 --> 00:11:08.043
-That's it! -That's it!

205
00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.743
What do you mean?

206
00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:14.343
The 2-hour drama that you broadcasted last night.

207
00:11:14.343 --> 00:11:17.043
Yes, "Run! The 100 Police Officer Dragnets".

208
00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:18.843
Could you please check to see

209
00:11:18.843 --> 00:11:22.143
if a set of one of the police outfits used back then is missing?

210
00:11:22.143 --> 00:11:24.743
While waiting for the TV station to get back to us,

211
00:11:24.743 --> 00:11:29.543
we gathered eye-witness information on the bearded police officer.

212
00:11:29.543 --> 00:11:31.143
As a result...

213
00:11:32.143 --> 00:11:35.243
That fake police officer first appeared a week ago,

214
00:11:35.243 --> 00:11:38.643
from Monday last week, right?

215
00:11:38.643 --> 00:11:42.643
Last Monday is when Yasuyo began working over-time, right?

216
00:11:42.643 --> 00:11:44.343
Yeah, now that you mentioned it.

217
00:11:44.343 --> 00:11:48.043
Besides, there are no witnesses who saw that fake policeman during the day.

218
00:11:48.043 --> 00:11:50.243
He only appears late at night.

219
00:11:50.243 --> 00:11:52.543
Just when the last train pulls into Beika Station.

220
00:11:52.543 --> 00:11:54.143
Does that have any meaning?

221
00:11:54.143 --> 00:11:56.043
One person said that

222
00:11:56.043 --> 00:11:57.443
he saw the policeman in front of the Beika Station.

223
00:11:57.443 --> 00:11:59.543
There are 5 eye-witness reports in 2-chome.

224
00:11:59.543 --> 00:12:02.443
Moreover, there are three reports in 3-chome.

225
00:12:02.443 --> 00:12:05.243
If we trace all the eye-witness reports.

226
00:12:06.343 --> 00:12:09.043
It's the road that Yasuyo who lives in 3-chome takes to walk home.

227
00:12:09.043 --> 00:12:10.143
True!

228
00:12:10.143 --> 00:12:13.143
In other words, the period of time and place

229
00:12:13.143 --> 00:12:14.843
that the fake police officer started appearing...

230
00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:17.843
Is connected to Yasuyo Akimotos over-time work?

231
00:12:17.843 --> 00:12:18.843
That's right.

232
00:12:18.843 --> 00:12:21.143
And do you remember what she said?

233
00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:24.243
At any rate, I've seen that police officer every night

234
00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.943
on my way home from work this past week.

235
00:12:26.943 --> 00:12:29.643
It can't be coincidence that she saw every day for a week...

236
00:12:29.643 --> 00:12:33.643
The fake police officer appeared before Yasuyo deliberately?

237
00:12:33.643 --> 00:12:35.943
I don't know for what reason though.

238
00:12:35.943 --> 00:12:37.343
But, if so,

239
00:12:37.343 --> 00:12:39.943
it's understandable why he wore a beard and glasses.

240
00:12:39.943 --> 00:12:41.843
I see! He disguised himself!

241
00:12:41.843 --> 00:12:43.843
Does that mean that the Yasuyo Akimoto

242
00:12:43.843 --> 00:12:45.943
knows the real face of the fake police officer?

243
00:12:45.943 --> 00:12:48.743
You mean the fake police officer is someone who is intimate with Yasuyo?

244
00:12:48.743 --> 00:12:50.643
And just who could that be?

245
00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:54.543
-What makes you think I would know? -Oh, you don't know.

246
00:12:54.543 --> 00:12:57.343
Oh, come on! Not again, Genta.

247
00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:59.943
-Did it get on your dress? -Where's my handkerchief?

248
00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:01.343
Did you drop it?

249
00:13:01.343 --> 00:13:03.243
It could be at that ramen shop.

250
00:13:03.243 --> 00:13:05.843
Im afraid to go to that shop alone.

251
00:13:05.843 --> 00:13:07.643
We'll all go with you.

252
00:13:07.643 --> 00:13:09.743
Right, Conan?

253
00:13:10.843 --> 00:13:12.843
"Preparation"

254
00:13:15.443 --> 00:13:18.243
Maybe he's not in after all?

255
00:13:18.243 --> 00:13:20.243
Yes.

256
00:13:20.243 --> 00:13:21.943
Of Nichiuri TV.

257
00:13:21.943 --> 00:13:23.343
And, how was it?

258
00:13:23.343 --> 00:13:25.143
Yes.

259
00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:26.943
It seems he went out a while ago.

260
00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:29.443
Maybe he went home for lunch or something?

261
00:13:29.443 --> 00:13:32.543
He seems to live very close to Beika Park.

262
00:13:32.543 --> 00:13:34.643
What do you want to do? Do you want to wait?

263
00:13:37.143 --> 00:13:38.443
I found it.

264
00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:40.443
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:43.743
Thank you so very much.

266
00:13:43.743 --> 00:13:45.543
About the police officers outfit,

267
00:13:45.543 --> 00:13:48.143
they checked on it and found one missing.

268
00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:51.343
So, he got hold of the fake police officers uniform

269
00:13:51.343 --> 00:13:53.643
when they were shooting the film at Beika Park after all.

270
00:13:53.643 --> 00:13:54.743
Most likely.

271
00:13:54.743 --> 00:13:57.143
It was on a Sunday a half a month ago, yeah.

272
00:13:58.143 --> 00:14:00.843
Was that film shot on a Sunday a half a month ago?

273
00:14:00.843 --> 00:14:02.843
That's what they said, but what about it?

274
00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:06.243
It was the 3rd Sunday last month, wasn't it?

275
00:14:06.243 --> 00:14:09.743
It just so happens to be the day this shop is closed.

276
00:14:09.743 --> 00:14:13.643
You said that the man who works here lives near Beika Park, right?

277
00:14:13.643 --> 00:14:15.243
-Yes. -If it was his day off,

278
00:14:15.243 --> 00:14:17.743
he could've gone to watch the shooting of the film.

279
00:14:17.743 --> 00:14:19.143
I'm sure anyone would,

280
00:14:19.143 --> 00:14:22.143
if they're shooting a film for a flashy drama right close by.

281
00:14:22.143 --> 00:14:24.143
If he wanted to, I'm sure there was a chance for him

282
00:14:24.143 --> 00:14:25.943
to steal the police officers uniform.

283
00:14:25.943 --> 00:14:28.943
And the fake police officer is someone close enough to Yasuyo

284
00:14:28.943 --> 00:14:30.843
that she knows his face.

285
00:14:30.843 --> 00:14:32.343
Conan, don't tell me that...

286
00:14:32.343 --> 00:14:33.943
He is the fake police officer?

287
00:14:33.943 --> 00:14:36.843
-Really? -But, why would he?

288
00:14:36.843 --> 00:14:38.843
Conan?

289
00:14:38.843 --> 00:14:40.843
Maybe...

290
00:14:51.652 --> 00:14:53.652
"Publisher"

291
00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:57.652
Then, is that man the one who choose that picture?

292
00:14:57.652 --> 00:14:59.752
Yes, he seems to have said that

293
00:14:59.752 --> 00:15:00.852
he wants to use this picture on the magazine.

294
00:15:00.852 --> 00:15:03.952
She looks really good in this picture, doesn't she?

295
00:15:03.952 --> 00:15:09.652
Does he like her? Maybe that's why he chose this picture.

296
00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:14.252
I see. It was about her.

297
00:15:14.252 --> 00:15:17.152
His name is Tetsuji Odawara.

298
00:15:17.152 --> 00:15:19.652
The fact is, he's was my classmate in high school.

299
00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:22.952
And, after the interview, when we were drinking together...

300
00:15:24.052 --> 00:15:26.452
You mean you have somebody you care for?

301
00:15:26.452 --> 00:15:28.252
But, it'll end in one-sided love.

302
00:15:28.252 --> 00:15:30.652
Why?

303
00:15:30.652 --> 00:15:32.752
I mean, my looks are not the greatest.

304
00:15:32.752 --> 00:15:36.352
Come on, you're just psyched into thinking that way.

305
00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:39.852
I don't mind, as long as I can watch over her without being noticed.

306
00:15:39.852 --> 00:15:41.952
I tell you...

307
00:15:41.952 --> 00:15:44.652
Odawara's face looks grumpy when he's not talking,

308
00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:46.552
so at first glance he seems difficult to approach.

309
00:15:46.552 --> 00:15:49.452
But in fact, there couldn't be a nicer guy around.

310
00:15:49.452 --> 00:15:51.652
And he's also a very timid guy.

311
00:15:53.252 --> 00:15:55.652
At Tetsuryu?

312
00:15:55.652 --> 00:16:00.352
Yes, I did, with an acquaintance.

313
00:16:00.352 --> 00:16:02.452
It seems that I'm going to have to start working over-time

314
00:16:02.452 --> 00:16:04.252
from the end of this month.

315
00:16:04.252 --> 00:16:05.852
Oh, gosh.

316
00:16:05.852 --> 00:16:09.152
I mean it's quite dangerous coming home every night on the last train.

317
00:16:10.352 --> 00:16:12.952
I think it was about a half a month ago.

318
00:16:12.952 --> 00:16:15.652
So, that's what he heard.

319
00:16:15.652 --> 00:16:16.952
Anything?

320
00:16:16.952 --> 00:16:19.452
So, the fake police officer that you saw every night

321
00:16:19.452 --> 00:16:23.352
wasn't there to steal something from you after all.

322
00:16:23.352 --> 00:16:25.252
Did you find out?

323
00:16:25.252 --> 00:16:27.652
All we have for now is circumstantial evidence.

324
00:16:27.652 --> 00:16:30.452
But, we're going to confirm things with the person himself from now.

325
00:16:31.652 --> 00:16:34.552
He is worry because he heard that

326
00:16:34.552 --> 00:16:37.752
the woman he cared for was going to have to come home late

327
00:16:37.752 --> 00:16:40.052
for a week.

328
00:16:40.052 --> 00:16:44.352
He probably wanted to watch over her in secret if at all possible.

329
00:16:44.352 --> 00:16:47.252
But because he thinks that his looks are frightening,

330
00:16:47.252 --> 00:16:48.752
he figured that if he did something like that,

331
00:16:48.752 --> 00:16:50.952
she would misunderstand him for being a weirdo,

332
00:16:50.952 --> 00:16:52.452
so he decided against it.

333
00:16:52.452 --> 00:16:55.752
"Close" -But, soon after that.

334
00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:03.152
The incident happened at the park!

335
00:17:03.152 --> 00:17:07.352
And, he saw the police officers outfit at the park.

336
00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:10.752
It's at that time that he thought up a way

337
00:17:10.752 --> 00:17:14.652
to guard Yasuyo fair and square.

338
00:17:17.252 --> 00:17:21.952
So, he appeared before Yasuyo as a police officer.

339
00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:25.852
Walking the streets at night is dangerous.

340
00:17:25.852 --> 00:17:28.552
Please be very careful.

341
00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:30.952
He's not back yet.

342
00:17:31.952 --> 00:17:33.352
I wonder what happened?

343
00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.252
Maybe he fled?

344
00:17:35.252 --> 00:17:38.052
No. Maybe he...

345
00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:40.752
is planning to catch the thief with his own hands

346
00:17:40.752 --> 00:17:44.652
for the sake of Yasuyo who believed in his innocence.

347
00:17:44.652 --> 00:17:47.352
That's too reckless and dangerous.

348
00:17:47.352 --> 00:17:48.452
Let's split up and look for him!

349
00:17:48.452 --> 00:17:49.552
Okay...

350
00:17:49.552 --> 00:17:52.152
Hey! You kids.

351
00:17:57.652 --> 00:17:59.752
It's impossible to begin with

352
00:17:59.752 --> 00:18:01.452
because even if I want look for the thief,

353
00:18:01.452 --> 00:18:04.052
I've got no clue to go on what so ever.

354
00:18:08.052 --> 00:18:10.752
I can go home! I'm fine!

355
00:18:10.752 --> 00:18:13.452
Oh, so he's the guy I saw yesterday.

356
00:18:14.952 --> 00:18:19.352
I haven't eaten ramen and yet I smell like I did.

357
00:18:19.352 --> 00:18:21.452
The smell of his clothes.

358
00:18:28.552 --> 00:18:30.052
He's not here.

359
00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:32.352
Where did he go?

360
00:18:50.252 --> 00:18:52.152
Do you remember me?

361
00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:53.552
We saw each other last night.

362
00:18:53.552 --> 00:18:55.052
Last night?

363
00:18:55.052 --> 00:18:58.852
I'm sorry, I was really wasted last night, you see...

364
00:18:58.852 --> 00:19:02.552
Yes, you really smelled of alcohol back then.

365
00:19:02.552 --> 00:19:05.852
But, it was your clothes that smelled,

366
00:19:05.852 --> 00:19:08.152
not your breath.

367
00:19:08.152 --> 00:19:10.652
Just what are you talking about?

368
00:19:10.652 --> 00:19:12.552
You staggered along as if you were drunk

369
00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:15.552
and went looking for a house you could break into!

370
00:19:16.752 --> 00:19:19.652
Don't move!

371
00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:21.652
Stand right there!

372
00:19:22.952 --> 00:19:25.652
Stop! You thief!

373
00:19:25.652 --> 00:19:27.152
Thief?

374
00:19:27.152 --> 00:19:28.952
Stop!

375
00:19:28.952 --> 00:19:30.152
Get out of my way!

376
00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:49.152
I would like to question you regarding the series of thefts

377
00:19:49.152 --> 00:19:52.152
that have been occurring lately.

378
00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:55.252
Okay.

379
00:19:55.252 --> 00:19:56.652
Officer Arai, can you take care of him for me.

380
00:19:56.652 --> 00:19:57.852
Yes, sir.

381
00:20:00.852 --> 00:20:04.352
You're Mr. Tetsuji Odawara?

382
00:20:08.452 --> 00:20:10.352
Yes.

383
00:20:14.352 --> 00:20:16.452
Yasuyo.

384
00:20:19.952 --> 00:20:23.552
Who on earth are you?

385
00:20:25.952 --> 00:20:27.952
Ms. Akimoto, he is...

386
00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:29.552
In order to protect

387
00:20:29.552 --> 00:20:32.352
a woman going home late at night,

388
00:20:32.352 --> 00:20:35.852
in order to see that she gets safely home,

389
00:20:35.852 --> 00:20:37.652
you became a fake police officer, right?

390
00:20:37.652 --> 00:20:39.352
How did you know that?

391
00:20:39.352 --> 00:20:40.952
What are you talking about?

392
00:20:40.952 --> 00:20:43.652
But, you know, sir, a person whos not a police officer

393
00:20:43.652 --> 00:20:47.252
should never disguise as a police officer.

394
00:20:47.252 --> 00:20:50.352
No matter what the reason is.

395
00:20:50.352 --> 00:20:51.552
Do you understand

396
00:20:51.552 --> 00:20:54.652
what Conan just said?

397
00:20:57.852 --> 00:21:01.552
You did it the wrong way.

398
00:21:13.452 --> 00:21:14.652
Yasuyo.

399
00:21:14.652 --> 00:21:17.852
I'm arresting you for faking identity

400
00:21:17.852 --> 00:21:19.652
and stealing the outfit.

401
00:21:19.652 --> 00:21:21.652
Shall we go then?

402
00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:28.952
Wait.

403
00:21:32.252 --> 00:21:36.052
I'll go to eat ramen again.

404
00:23:14.952 --> 00:23:18.552
"Tetsuryu"

405
00:23:20.452 --> 00:23:21.852
Really!

406
00:23:21.852 --> 00:23:23.952
It was his first time stealing something

407
00:23:23.952 --> 00:23:26.752
and he didn't steal the uniform to carry out a crime.

408
00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:30.152
He was acquitted considering that

409
00:23:30.152 --> 00:23:31.952
he also captured the thief.

410
00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.852
Of course he was severely reprimanded.

411
00:23:33.852 --> 00:23:37.652
In other words, he was scolded very severely.

412
00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:41.152
Thank you for waiting!

413
00:23:47.152 --> 00:23:49.152
Thank you.

414
00:23:52.852 --> 00:23:53.852
A man and woman

415
00:23:53.852 --> 00:23:57.052
who are awkward at living a smooth life despite their age.

416
00:23:57.052 --> 00:23:59.952
I don't think those two would like to hear something like that from you.

417
00:23:59.952 --> 00:24:01.952
Did you say something?

418
00:24:04.052 --> 00:24:09.452
"Next Episode"

419
00:24:09.452 --> 00:24:11.952
I've got to nab the culprit who snuck into this room

420
00:24:11.952 --> 00:24:14.852
and get it back.

421
00:24:14.852 --> 00:24:16.352
Which means the culprit snuck in

422
00:24:16.352 --> 00:24:19.252
from a place other than this room.

423
00:24:19.252 --> 00:24:22.252
Moreover, just until a while ago.

424
00:24:23.352 --> 00:24:25.352
-What? -Doc.

425
00:24:28.752 --> 00:24:33.552
Next Conan, "The Whereabouts of the Black Picture (Part 1)"

426
00:24:49.752 --> 00:24:51.952
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:24:51.952 --> 00:24:54.252
"A whole lot of sweat"

428
00:24:54.252 --> 00:24:57.752
I'm sweating so much that I might drown.

429
00:24:57.752 --> 00:24:59.252
Just drown then.
