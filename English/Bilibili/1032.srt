00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,500
Kasuga Ryuji (30)
Artist

2
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,030
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

3
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,830
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

4
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,460
Facing an artist, Ran smiles!

5
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,210
But her prim pose hints at a case!

6
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,700
Always determining the one truth

7
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,320
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,780
his name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,450
Mori Ran, the Model

10
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,630
Mori Ran, the Model
"Mori Ran, the Model!"

11
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,020
Mori Ran, the Model

12
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,340
A modeling job, huh?

13
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,840
Rokui Riko (28)
Kasuga's Assistant

Conan-kun, you must be bored.

15
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,080
Conan-kun, you must be bored.

16
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,480
No, this is super interesting.

17
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,950
Professional artists are incredible.

18
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,690
Really? I'm glad to hear that.

19
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,770
Kasuga-sensei and Ran-san,
why don't we take a break?

20
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,400
I've made some tea.

21
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,940
Yes, let's.

22
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,230
Thank you.

23
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,130
I should be able to finish today as planned.

24
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,280
It was quite the twist of fate.

25
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,750
I went out to do some shopping that day.

26
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,180
My ideal model happened to show up there.

27
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,380
E-Excuse me.

28
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,940
Yes?

29
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,060
But you didn't know who he was.

30
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,860
I'm sorry that I didn't know at the time
that you were a famous artist.

31
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,950
It's fine. It just means I
still have a long way to go.

32
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,200
Your works are special, Kasuga-sensei.

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,450
What was that?

34
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,950
Komiyama Yoshio (24)
Kasuga's Apprentice

35
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,990
Komiyama Yoshio (24)
Kasuga's Apprentice
Hello.

36
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,340
Komiyama Yoshio (24)
Kasuga's Apprentice

37
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,760
Hey.

38
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
Hello.

39
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,550
Uh...?

40
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,600
This is Conan-kun.

41
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,260
He came to watch since Ran-san's
painting will be finished today.

42
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,480
Hello.

43
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,840
Hello. I'm Kasuga-sensei's
apprentice Komiyama Yoshio.

44
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,560
Conan-kun, you must like art, too.

45
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,830
Yeah.

46
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,070
I can't tell them I came because
I was worried about her.

47
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,070
Well, I'm going to get started on my work.

48
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,920
Really? Why don't you join us?

49
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,540
Thank you, but I'm fine.

50
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,640
Has Komiyama-san been an
apprentice for a long time?

51
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,000
What? No.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,310
He's a new artist who just
recently became an apprentice.

53
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,310
Huh.

54
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,660
Sir, we should get back to work soon.

55
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,060
Got it. Thank you.

56
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,860
But first, I'm going to
check on Komiyama-kun.

57
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,080
Kasuga-sensei really trusts you, Riko-san.

58
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,790
I don't know about that.

59
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,930
For him, keeping track of time
is just an assistant's job.

60
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,600
Why?

61
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,670
Kasuga-sensei becomes absorbed in
his ideas when they come to mind,

62
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,860
so he often loses his belongings.

63
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,320
That's why he doesn't
carry anything with him.

64
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,400
He doesn't even wear a watch.

65
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,460
I see.

66
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,960
Nice colors.

67
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,080
Thank you.

68
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,220
Sir, there's something I've
always wanted to ask you.

69
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,420
Why have you been drawing
portraits recently?

70
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,040
You're opposed to the idea, too?

71
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,930
Sometimes I feel like
drawing whatever I want.

72
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,060
I didn't mean it like that.

73
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,710
I was just wondering why you suddenly switched to
drawing portraits—of all female models, no less.

74
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,560
Is there some criteria you
use to choose your models?

75
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,020
No. They're all strangers
I scout around town.

76
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,080
I guess I follow my intuition.

77
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,160
I see.

78
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,470
Models aren't important to me.

79
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,050
They're simply tools used to evoke an image.

80
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,970
In the end, my art is everything to me.

81
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,400
But it would seem some realities
can't be improved upon.

82
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,360
There they are.

83
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,490
Hey, who are you?

84
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,830
Hello. I'm Edogawa Conan.

85
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,780
I'm visiting the studio.

86
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,770
I see.

87
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,780
Nothing's happened to the
model this time, right?

88
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,830
What?

89
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,280
The truth is, there are some shady
circumstances concerning his models.

90
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,330
Shady circumstances?

91
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,190
Well, he had two previous female models...

92
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,800
Tell me more about that.

93
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,760
Huh? Come to think of it...

94
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,930
Conan-kun said he was going
to check out the yard.

95
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,070
I'm sorry. He always runs
off before I know it.

96
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,930
The weather's nice today.

97
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,060
I understand the desire to go outside.

98
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,220
Let's hurry up and finish
this for his sake, too.

99
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,310
Nagahata

100
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,530
Nagahata
This is the place.

101
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,160
Nagahata

102
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,250
Nagahata Ayu (22)
Kasuga's Painting Model

103
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,960
Nagahata Ayu (22)
Kasuga's Painting Model
Someone pushed me from behind here.

104
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,200
Someone pushed me from behind here.

105
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,590
Is something the matter?

106
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,140
No. How about witnesses?

107
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,880
Did they see anyone suspicious?

108
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,490
No.

109
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,600
Apparently not.

110
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,690
Come to think of it, I saw Kasuga-san
on my way here that day.

111
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,700
What?

112
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,580
I saw him from behind, so I'm not 100% sure.

113
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,960
I think he was sitting on the
riverbank and looking at the river.

114
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,830
I was scouted to model for
him around here, too.

115
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,220
I thought he must come here often
and didn't think much of it.

116
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,080
Don't let it bother you.

117
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,590
Huh?

118
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,840
Riko-san isn't too fond of me making these
paintings that don't bring in any money.

119
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,680
I-I see.

120
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,550
Riko-san isn't just my assistant.

121
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,610
She's also my manager.

122
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,550
As someone who handles money,
I'm sure it's a nuisance.

123
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,860
I understand that, but...

124
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,380
This is the place.

125
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,930
Nogami Machiko (19)
Kasuga's Painting Model

126
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,250
Nogami Machiko (19)
Kasuga's Painting Model
I was waiting for the light to change
here when someone pushed me from behind.

127
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,140
I was waiting for the light to change
here when someone pushed me from behind.

128
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,310
You didn't see the culprit?

129
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,180
No. This place is deserted at night.

130
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,700
The police said there weren't any witnesses.

131
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,950
The only clue to the culprit's
identity is the sound that I heard.

132
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,180
What sound?

133
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,910
Like a clattering sound.

134
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:22,710
I felt like I'd heard it before,
but I don't know what it was.

135
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:28,450
I see. Where were you
scouted for modeling work?

136
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,200
What? Oh, at a nearby café.

137
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,250
Come to think of it,

138
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,350
I might've seen Kasuga-sensei around
here on the day of the incident.

139
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,500
What?

140
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,340
I thought Kasuga-sensei had gone
home after he finished working,

141
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,510
but maybe he was on his way to that café.

142
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,740
It seems like he's a regular there.

143
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,020
But that random attack ruined everything.

144
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,090
I'm on my university's track team.

145
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,470
Because of my injury, I'm not sure
I'll be able to run like I used to.

146
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,850
My brother's really bitter about it

147
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,160
and says he'll do whatever it
takes to catch the culprit.

148
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,030
Your brother?

149
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,690
Komiyama-san?

150
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,680
Oh, uh...

151
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,560
I'm sorry. I'm looking for materials.

152
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,310
What is this room?

153
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,420
It's Kasuga-sensei's late wife's room.

154
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,070
What? Really?

155
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,540
There aren't any materials in
here. You should head back.

156
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,310
A-All right.

157
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,970
Our Standard Date Route

158
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,970
Evening at the Riverbank

159
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,970
Our Usual Vienna Coffees at the Café

160
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,840
This is my brother.

161
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,230
So that's how it is.

162
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,250
All right.

163
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,110
Hey, Machiko-san. By any chance...

164
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,120
It's done.

165
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,330
Did the incident occur...

166
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,170
Let's sign this and call it done.

167
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,010
Yes, sir.

168
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,010
...the day your painting was completed?

169
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,810
Thank you for modeling.

170
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,650
That better be true.

171
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,890
It definitely is.

172
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,680
Kasuga-sensei lost his wife six
months ago in an accident.

173
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,800
Since they were such lovebirds,
he was terribly depressed about it.

174
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,800
He couldn't even enter his studio.

175
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,680
After a while, he suddenly started
finding models and painting again.

176
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,230
But both models were attacked
by someone on their way home.

177
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,320
I learned that the incidents always occurred
on the day their paintings were finished.

178
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,830
And Ran's painting will be finished today.

179
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,530
Damn it. Hurry, kid!

180
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,300
Yeah!

181
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,390
Kasuga Ryuji.

182
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,910
We need to talk.

183
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,880
What's the matter?

184
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:17,140
You're the one who pushed my sister.

185
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,130
Huh?

186
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,290
My real name is Nogami Yoshio.

187
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,030
I'm the brother of Nogami
Machiko, one of your models!

188
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,080
What?

189
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,730
On her way home from this studio,

190
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,070
my sister was attacked by
someone and badly injured.

191
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,200
I've been searching for the culprit.

192
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,580
I joined your studio,
looking for information.

193
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,410
I've been watching you.

194
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,550
It was shortly after joining your studio

195
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,030
that I learned my sister
wasn't the only victim.

196
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,210
Another model suffered an accident, too.

197
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,220
What?

198
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,100
Today, after seeing a room in your
studio that I hadn't investigated yet,

199
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,480
I finally learned what your motive is.

200
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,170
The shock of losing your
wife drove you crazy!

201
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,940
You're approaching women in locations
that were important to you and your wife,

202
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,990
having them model for you, and then hurting
them once the painting is complete.

203
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,490
Sir, that can't possibly be—

204
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,910
No, wait!

205
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,570
Kasuga, you're coming with
me to see the police.

206
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,920
It's true that in my heart,
I was painting my wife.

207
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,670
I thought it might help me get over her.

208
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,510
That much is true.

209
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,770
But attacking models? I have no
idea what you're talking about.

210
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,030
You're playing dumb?

211
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,090
Because of you, my sister's
dream was shattered.

212
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,810
Hey, what are you doing?

213
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,710
I'm glad you're all right.

214
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,480
Are you Mori Kogoro?

215
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,990
Dad.

216
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,290
You're Ran-san's father?

217
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,040
I see. Mori...

218
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,650
I'm surprised. I didn't know
Detective Mori was on the case.

219
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,490
What? Uh, yeah, sure.

220
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,090
But I just...

221
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,790
Just happened to...

222
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,920
Sorry, old man.

223
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,980
That's right.

224
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,430
I looked into the place where my
precious daughter was working.

225
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,680
Komiyama-san, you believed the following
to be true about the attacks:

226
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:35,500
Both models were attacked on their way
home from the studio in deserted areas.

227
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,260
Therefore, the culprit must've followed
the victims since they left the studio.

228
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,830
In other words, you believed the culprit
must be someone from the studio.

229
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,900
Yes, that's right. That's why Kasuga is—

230
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,610
As you deduced, the culprit
is someone from this studio.

231
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,960
But it's not Kasuga-san.

232
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,360
It's not me. Don't do that. What are you—

233
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,850
Unfortunately, there's
proof, Rokui Riko-san.

234
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,720
At first I suspected Kasuga-san as well.

235
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,490
After all, he was spotted near both crime
scenes when the attacks took place.

236
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,120
However, I found the testimony of Nogami
Machiko-san, the second victim, strange.

237
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,890
She heard a certain sound
when she was attacked.

238
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,870
That's right. Kasuga-san doesn't
carry anything with him.

239
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,120
If he'd done it, the victim
wouldn't have heard anything.

240
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,010
Apparently it was a clattering sound.

241
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,440
I believe it may have been the
sound of a sketching pencil.

242
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,520
As an artist's assistant, you carry
those around with you all the time.

243
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,700
But that's not enough to—

244
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,650
Of course, that's not all.

245
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,700
I have proof that you're the culprit.

246
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,450
The pole of the steps Ayu-san
was pushed down was scratched.

247
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,880
Some paint had come off.

248
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,710
You probably grabbed onto that pole
when you tried to push Ayu-san.

249
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,270
Your wristwatch has a metal band,

250
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,550
but one part is shaped
differently from the others.

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,340
Not only that, but it seems rather new.

252
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,100
Perhaps you damaged it during the attack
and had it repaired in a hurry.

253
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,300
This is, uh...

254
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,020
We'll know once we check
with the watch repairman.

255
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,090
No way. You're kidding, right?

256
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,880
W-Wait a minute. Why would you attack them?

257
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,050
Because I hated the models.

258
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:13,910
I was a fan of Kasuga-sensei and
asked him to make me his assistant.

259
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,650
Spending time together while he
was working made me so happy.

260
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,910
But that was taken from me.

261
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,790
I wondered why I couldn't be his model.

262
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,160
Before I knew it, I was following them.

263
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,410
And then...

264
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,130
How wonderful.

265
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,060
I can't allow someone who doesn't
even know who Kasuga-sensei is

266
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,810
to have this painting made of her!

267
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,070
Crap!

268
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:16,450
Kasuga-sensei told me that I was
the last portrait he'd paint.

269
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,770
Once he finished,

270
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,170
he wanted to paint for work with you again

271
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,010
because you supported him.

272
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,680
No...

273
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,820
Kumagaya

274
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,910
Rice crackers!

275
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,140
So this is her new job.

276
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,190
Perfect for me, right?

277
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,600
Yeah. It's important to choose for yourself.
