1
00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:02.324
We came on a sightseeing tour

2
00:00:02.324 --> 00:00:05.824
to the old Battle of Kawanakajima at Nagano Prefecture.

3
00:00:05.824 --> 00:00:07.424
We coincidentally ran into Inspector Kansuke Yamato

4
00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:08.424
and other Nagano Prefectural Police officers

5
00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:09.724
and they had taken us around.

6
00:00:09.724 --> 00:00:12.224
Just as we were about to arrive at the Chikuma River,

7
00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:15.024
we found the head of a person come drifting along the river.

8
00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:20.224
The head that had the mark of a woodpecker footprint on its forehead

9
00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:23.524
belonged to Squad Chief Takeda of the Nagano Prefectural Police.

10
00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:26.524
Furthermore, another officer of the Takeda Squad,

11
00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:31.824
Police Lieutenant Kano was also found hung to death at his residence.

12
00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:36.824
Likewise, Police Sergeant Akiyama of the Takeda Squad was also killed.

13
00:00:38.024 --> 00:00:39.924
The perpetrator that is indicated by the various evidence

14
00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:41.524
that comes up all point to...

15
00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:43.024
"Kansuke Yamato"

16
00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:45.824
Kansuke's the one who sent the mail?

17
00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:48.524
I'm calling a search out for him as a murder suspect!

18
00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:52.624
But Inspector Yamato would never commit murder!

19
00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:55.824
We should prioritize justice over emotions right now.

20
00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:58.924
If we let him get away, we may regret it.

21
00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.024
Okay. We'll set up checkpoints immediately

22
00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:03.624
and get custody of Yamato at all costs.

23
00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:06.524
Don't go easy on him just because you know him.

24
00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:11.024
Remember that he's a serial killer that killed three officers in a row!

25
00:01:14.724 --> 00:01:16.324
Investigation First Section Chief Kuroda,

26
00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:19.424
we got a tip just now that a man resembling Yamato was witnessed.

27
00:01:19.424 --> 00:01:23.424
I want to go and confirm it, but there's no car available.

28
00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:24.524
Oh, good timing.

29
00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:27.324
Morofushi, will you lend me your car?

30
00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:29.724
No. I don't think so.

31
00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.824
Is there a problem?

32
00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:35.324
No. Mr. Saegusa's driving is a bit rough, you see.

33
00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.324
-Morofushi. -Yes, sir.

34
00:01:37.324 --> 00:01:40.124
This is an emergency. Let him use it.

35
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:41.524
It's an order.

36
00:01:41.524 --> 00:01:42.524
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:43.824
Go ahead.

38
00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:45.124
Sorry. Thanks.

39
00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:48.024
If the tip's credible, report back immediately!

40
00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.224
Roger!

41
00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:54.324
I'm Bishamonten.

42
00:01:54.324 --> 00:01:57.124
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

43
00:01:57.124 --> 00:01:59.024
I'm the God of War!

44
00:02:10.824 --> 00:02:11.924
"Flow forward like the river, Yamato"

45
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:15.324
"Flow forward like the river".

46
00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:16.524
Kansuke.

47
00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:19.824
What's the matter?

48
00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:21.024
Nothing.

49
00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:23.524
It's mail from Kansuke.

50
00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:25.924
What? This is...

51
00:02:25.924 --> 00:02:27.924
Morofushi, may I have a word with you?

52
00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:28.924
Yes, sir.

53
00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:31.524
Excuse me.

54
00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:34.024
Kansuke. Why?

55
00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:36.624
Officer Yui.

56
00:02:36.624 --> 00:02:37.624
What?

57
00:02:40.924 --> 00:02:42.824
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

58
00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:45.024
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

59
00:02:45.024 --> 00:02:47.024
The incidents that revolve around Shingen

60
00:02:47.024 --> 00:02:49.424
come together in an unexpected fashion.

61
00:02:49.424 --> 00:02:50.924
He sees through the one and only truth.

62
00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:52.724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

63
00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:54.724
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:45.546
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 3)"

65
00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:54.146
Darn it.

66
00:04:54.146 --> 00:04:56.746
That jerk Yamato.

67
00:04:56.746 --> 00:04:58.346
Since a search warrant's been issued,

68
00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:00.346
I know I can make it off on my own,

69
00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:02.846
so borrow Morofushi's car that can drive at high speed

70
00:05:02.846 --> 00:05:05.946
and come pick me up at the mountain shack in Mount Saijo

71
00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:08.746
and get me out of bounds of the prefecture.

72
00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:12.846
I'm going to expose X!

73
00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:15.646
How do you know about X?

74
00:05:29.546 --> 00:05:31.446
I'm Bishamonten.

75
00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:36.146
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

76
00:05:44.246 --> 00:05:45.946
I'm the God of War!

77
00:05:48.146 --> 00:05:50.046
X?

78
00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:53.546
You mean the Woodpeckers Club was called X?

79
00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:56.246
Yep. Taking into consideration what Officer Yui was saying,

80
00:05:56.246 --> 00:05:58.446
it's most likely so.

81
00:05:58.446 --> 00:06:01.046
The footprints of woodpeckers form and X too.

82
00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:03.246
But, wasn't The Woodpeckers Club

83
00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:07.446
a mysterious group that was supposed to be in the NPD?

84
00:06:07.446 --> 00:06:08.446
Right!

85
00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:10.046
The people who were killed

86
00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:13.046
belonged to that Woodpeckers Club!

87
00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:14.046
What?

88
00:06:14.046 --> 00:06:16.646
But Officer Yui was saying a while ago that.

89
00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:18.746
The people who were murdered this time

90
00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:21.746
were those who had names that resembled the generals

91
00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:23.846
who died in the Battle of Kawanakajima,

92
00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:27.346
and it'd be impossible to form a group with people who died in battle.

93
00:06:27.346 --> 00:06:31.546
Moreover, she told me that the one who told her that was you, Conan.

94
00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:33.846
That's what I thought at that time.

95
00:06:33.846 --> 00:06:38.046
I didn't know the Woodpecker Society was called X.

96
00:06:38.046 --> 00:06:40.646
So what if it's called X?

97
00:06:40.646 --> 00:06:44.146
X is the 24th letter of the alphabet.

98
00:06:44.146 --> 00:06:46.646
The number 24 when used with Takeda

99
00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:50.146
refers to the 24 Takeda Generals who served Shingen Takeda!

100
00:06:51.346 --> 00:06:53.546
The 24 Generals of Shingen Takeda.

101
00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:57.146
Right. The first one whose head was cut off and murdered...

102
00:07:00.446 --> 00:07:03.746
Chief Takeda, whose name was similar to Shingen's younger brother,

103
00:07:03.746 --> 00:07:05.446
Nobushinge Takeda.

104
00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:09.346
The next one who was strangled and hung from the ceiling...

105
00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:16.646
Lieutenant Shoji Kano's former surname was Tsuchiya,

106
00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:19.946
so he was Shingen's right hand man, Masatsugu Tsuchiya.

107
00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:22.746
And the one who fell off the cliff a while ago with his head hooked

108
00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:24.846
on to the car with a rope...

109
00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:30.846
Police Sergeant Shinsuke Akiyama was Nobutomo Akiyama

110
00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:33.646
who persuaded the senior vassals of Takeda

111
00:07:33.646 --> 00:07:37.946
who were against alliance with Nobunaga Oda

112
00:07:37.946 --> 00:07:40.246
Inspector Morofushi said it's possible

113
00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:41.846
that they were gathering people

114
00:07:41.846 --> 00:07:44.846
with names similar to the 24 generals of Takeda to join them.

115
00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:48.846
-Really? -So, the next target is probably...

116
00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:51.046
Inspector Mamoru Saegusa whose name resembles Yoritomo Saegusa,

117
00:07:51.046 --> 00:07:55.946
the samurai who was in command of Takeda's foot soldiers.

118
00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:57.446
Hey, hold it there.

119
00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:00.246
If it's the 24 Generals of Takeda,

120
00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.946
then most naturally the strategist of the Takeda force,

121
00:08:01.946 --> 00:08:04.346
Kansuke Yamamoto is also included, right?

122
00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:08.546
Yep! That's why Lieutenant Kano made that remark at the shrine.

123
00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:11.746
I think you're the perfect fit for our squad.

124
00:08:11.746 --> 00:08:13.146
Remember?

125
00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:17.846
Which means the entire Takeda Squad belonged to the Woodpecker Society.

126
00:08:17.846 --> 00:08:22.846
But didn't Inspector Saegusa leave to go somewhere?

127
00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:26.646
Yep. I think he was called out by the perpetrator.

128
00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:29.746
And? Who's the perpetrator?

129
00:08:29.746 --> 00:08:31.146
Well...

130
00:08:35.846 --> 00:08:36.946
Why?

131
00:08:44.546 --> 00:08:46.346
That's because...

132
00:08:46.346 --> 00:08:47.546
You're...

133
00:08:55.446 --> 00:08:58.046
Don't tell me Inspector Yamato...

134
00:08:58.046 --> 00:08:59.446
Kansuke.

135
00:09:04.846 --> 00:09:07.746
Hey! I came to pick you up as you told me to.

136
00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:08.946
Yamato?

137
00:09:11.746 --> 00:09:15.546
Right, Officer of the First Investigation Division of NPD.

138
00:09:15.546 --> 00:09:17.146
Kansuke.

139
00:09:17.146 --> 00:09:19.046
Hey, Yamato.

140
00:09:25.146 --> 00:09:26.546
Takeda Squad.

141
00:09:34.046 --> 00:09:37.046
Police Sergeant Shinsuke Akiyama.

142
00:09:37.046 --> 00:09:40.246
-What? -What?

143
00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.546
-Sergeant Akiyama's the perpetrator? -Sergeant Akiyama's the perpetrator?

144
00:09:43.546 --> 00:09:48.246
But, didn't you say that Sergeant Akiyama fell off the cliff car and all?

145
00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:52.346
Yeah, on his way down his body got stuck on the branch of a tree

146
00:09:52.346 --> 00:09:54.146
and his head was cut off by the rope that was wrapped around his neck

147
00:09:54.146 --> 00:09:56.246
and went falling down the cliff!

148
00:09:56.246 --> 00:09:58.546
But, that head was fake!

149
00:09:58.546 --> 00:10:02.346
I'm sure he used the mannequin's head from his parents' beauty salon,

150
00:10:02.346 --> 00:10:04.846
that is used to practice hair cuts

151
00:10:04.846 --> 00:10:07.146
and cut the hair that is similar his hair style,

152
00:10:07.146 --> 00:10:09.346
put the hood of his parker on it and took it with him.

153
00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:12.646
I think he threw the fake blood and fake head out of the hook

154
00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.546
as he went falling.

155
00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:17.546
But the rope that was hooked onto the car

156
00:10:17.546 --> 00:10:19.646
was wrapped around his neck, right?

157
00:10:19.646 --> 00:10:24.846
He was just holding the criss-crossed rope in front of his neck.

158
00:10:24.846 --> 00:10:27.646
So, once you let it go it becomes undone easily.

159
00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:31.246
And by setting up a headless corpse wearing his clothes

160
00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:32.546
on the tree beforehand,

161
00:10:32.546 --> 00:10:35.146
then dangle from a lifeline tied onto it,

162
00:10:35.146 --> 00:10:36.746
the people at the top of the cliff wouldn't be able to see

163
00:10:36.746 --> 00:10:39.046
because the tree would be in the way.

164
00:10:39.046 --> 00:10:42.746
So it'd look as if his head was cut off and fall off the cliff.

165
00:10:42.746 --> 00:10:45.146
A headless corpse?

166
00:10:45.146 --> 00:10:47.146
Chief Takeda's body was used.

167
00:10:47.146 --> 00:10:50.546
He probably used it because they both had similar physique.

168
00:10:50.546 --> 00:10:53.546
So the place where Chief Takeda got his head cut off

169
00:10:53.546 --> 00:10:55.546
was at Mount Saijo.

170
00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:58.846
Then... What about the burnt body that was found under the bridge?

171
00:10:58.846 --> 00:11:02.446
That was probably the body of the wanted robber that was on the run.

172
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:04.946
By cutting off the toe of Chief Takeda's leg

173
00:11:04.946 --> 00:11:07.846
and leaving that part behind as if it had been spared being burned,

174
00:11:07.846 --> 00:11:10.846
you can even deceive the DNA test.

175
00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:12.646
The head of the robber probably

176
00:11:12.646 --> 00:11:15.746
in the car that fell over the cliff and exploded.

177
00:11:15.746 --> 00:11:17.546
Once it's burned and becomes a skull,

178
00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:20.646
everybody would think that the head belongs to Sergeant Akiyama.

179
00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.446
Come to think of it...

180
00:11:22.446 --> 00:11:25.246
Officer Yui said that Sergeant Akiyama seems to have been asked to come

181
00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:26.946
by mail from Inspector Yamato.

182
00:11:26.946 --> 00:11:29.946
Sergeant Akiyama set that up too.

183
00:11:29.946 --> 00:11:33.146
He text mailed his own cell phone using his first victim,

184
00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:35.346
Chief Takeda's cell phone

185
00:11:35.346 --> 00:11:38.046
to make it look as if Inspector Yamato had summoned him.

186
00:11:38.046 --> 00:11:41.746
Then he added Inspector Yamato's number to his blocked contacts,

187
00:11:41.746 --> 00:11:46.446
to make it look like he was ensuring the message wouldn't be erased.

188
00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:51.146
He did all this to frame Inspector Yamato up as the perpetrator.

189
00:11:51.146 --> 00:11:52.246
What?

190
00:11:55.746 --> 00:11:57.146
Sergeant Akiyama also set it up

191
00:11:57.146 --> 00:11:59.546
so that Inspector Yamato's fingerprints would be detected from the rope

192
00:11:59.546 --> 00:12:01.946
that was wrapped around Lieutenant Kano

193
00:12:01.946 --> 00:12:04.346
who was hung from the ceiling,

194
00:12:04.346 --> 00:12:09.646
Assistant Inspector was hung from two loops of roped connected like this,

195
00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:13.446
and Inspector Yamato touched the top loop when he brought the body down.

196
00:12:13.446 --> 00:12:17.546
But if you grab the loop by the neck and pull it.

197
00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:22.246
See, the both of the loops switch place in the wink of an eye, right?

198
00:12:22.246 --> 00:12:24.346
Yeah, amazing!

199
00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:26.046
Sergeant Akiyama used this trick

200
00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:29.746
to switched the part of the rope that Inspector Yamato touched

201
00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:32.146
to the rope that was wrapped around the neck.

202
00:12:32.146 --> 00:12:34.146
He rang Lieutenant Kano's cell phone

203
00:12:34.146 --> 00:12:37.946
while everyone's attention was distracted.

204
00:12:37.946 --> 00:12:39.646
He also provoked Inspector Yamato and Inspector Morofushi

205
00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:42.846
to get into an argument for the same reason!

206
00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:44.646
Unless Inspector Yamato got angry

207
00:12:44.646 --> 00:12:46.546
and started investigations on his own,

208
00:12:46.546 --> 00:12:48.846
Sergeant Akiyama wouldn't have been able to frame him.

209
00:12:48.846 --> 00:12:51.446
Since they're crosspatches,

210
00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:53.446
when you mention that they're best friends

211
00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:56.746
they start bad-mouthing each other and arguing.

212
00:12:56.746 --> 00:13:00.746
But weren't the two on bad terms

213
00:13:00.746 --> 00:13:03.146
from even before Sergeant Akiyama said anything?

214
00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:05.546
Komei, don't tell me that you...

215
00:13:05.546 --> 00:13:09.746
Like they say, even parasites inside a lion will eat their host.

216
00:13:09.746 --> 00:13:11.446
I remember them arguing like so.

217
00:13:11.446 --> 00:13:14.946
That was a trap that the two had set up toward the perpetrator.

218
00:13:14.946 --> 00:13:18.446
If the perpetrator were trying to frame Inspector Yamato,

219
00:13:18.446 --> 00:13:20.846
they pretended to fall for what the perpetrator wanted them to do,

220
00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:23.446
so Inspector Yamato went off to investigate on his own.

221
00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:24.846
I think they did this to wait and see

222
00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:28.146
what the perpetrator was planning to do next.

223
00:13:28.146 --> 00:13:30.246
Because the fact that the perpetrator was trying to frame Inspector Yamato

224
00:13:30.246 --> 00:13:31.946
was obvious this morning

225
00:13:31.946 --> 00:13:36.446
when a witness appeared saying that Inspector Yamato was near the bridge.

226
00:13:36.446 --> 00:13:39.746
Then, the Inspector Yamato that the witness saw was...

227
00:13:39.746 --> 00:13:42.046
It was probably Sergeant Akiyama wearing a hood

228
00:13:42.046 --> 00:13:45.246
and walking using the same kind of cane that Inspector Yamato had.

229
00:13:45.246 --> 00:13:48.246
He was probably wearing secret boots that made him look tall.

230
00:13:48.246 --> 00:13:52.146
But if Inspector Yamato went around solely on his own,

231
00:13:52.146 --> 00:13:55.146
it would've been just what the perpetrator wanted him to do, right?

232
00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:58.246
Because he wouldn't be able to establish an alibi.

233
00:13:58.246 --> 00:14:00.646
He has a solid alibi.

234
00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:04.446
Inspector Morofushi had a car camera installed,

235
00:14:04.446 --> 00:14:08.046
and a spare tire was in the backseat of his car, you know?

236
00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:10.646
I see! The trunk of the car!

237
00:14:10.646 --> 00:14:12.346
If he stayed quietly in there,

238
00:14:12.346 --> 00:14:16.446
the image on the car camera would prove his alibi!

239
00:14:16.446 --> 00:14:18.546
You're amazing, Conan!

240
00:14:18.546 --> 00:14:22.746
Well... Inspector Morofushi told me all this.

241
00:14:22.746 --> 00:14:24.446
But hold it...

242
00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.546
Didn't Inspector Saegusa drive off

243
00:14:26.546 --> 00:14:30.446
with Inspector Morofushi's car when he was summoned?

244
00:14:53.013 --> 00:14:54.913
I'm Bishamonten.

245
00:15:01.313 --> 00:15:03.613
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

246
00:15:10.713 --> 00:15:12.913
I'm the God of War!

247
00:15:23.713 --> 00:15:26.113
I did it! I did it!

248
00:15:26.113 --> 00:15:32.113
Hiding in the trunk was a clever idea, Inspector Yamato.

249
00:15:32.113 --> 00:15:35.513
But I guess I was a cut above you.

250
00:15:37.013 --> 00:15:41.213
So, I'm going to take the gun from your corpse

251
00:15:41.213 --> 00:15:44.713
and shoot Saegusa with it

252
00:15:44.713 --> 00:15:46.913
to make it look as if you both shot and killed each other.

253
00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:49.513
After burning Takeda's corpse,

254
00:15:49.513 --> 00:15:52.113
I'll disappear.

255
00:15:55.613 --> 00:15:57.613
Are you stupid?

256
00:16:00.213 --> 00:16:08.713
There's no way I'd stay in a cramped up place like this without anything.

257
00:16:08.713 --> 00:16:12.713
The riot shield of the riot squad?

258
00:16:12.713 --> 00:16:14.313
You mean you used that to avoid the bullets?

259
00:16:14.313 --> 00:16:15.713
Akiyama.

260
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:20.013
I knew exactly what you're thinking!

261
00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:27.013
At the very moment that you said a witness saw somebody who looked like me

262
00:16:27.013 --> 00:16:30.313
walking near the bridge this morning.

263
00:16:31.413 --> 00:16:33.413
The only person who could've done that

264
00:16:33.413 --> 00:16:37.813
was someone who knew that I'd never cross that bridge this morning.

265
00:16:37.813 --> 00:16:41.113
In other words, somebody who knew about my friend,

266
00:16:41.113 --> 00:16:43.413
who got high on drugs and shot randomly in the city nine years ago,

267
00:16:43.413 --> 00:16:47.213
who was then killed by Pops Takeda

268
00:16:47.213 --> 00:16:51.213
that is the bereaved family of the victim struck by a stray bullet,

269
00:16:51.213 --> 00:16:58.613
who knew that I visited her grave every morning on the day that she died.

270
00:16:59.813 --> 00:17:01.313
Right.

271
00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:05.013
You're the older brother of Tsuyako Aburakawa, a middle school student

272
00:17:05.013 --> 00:17:06.713
who died instantly after being shot

273
00:17:06.713 --> 00:17:09.713
in the forehead by my friend.

274
00:17:09.713 --> 00:17:11.713
Shinsuke Aburakawa.

275
00:17:11.713 --> 00:17:15.413
You're the suspect in this serial murder case!

276
00:17:16.813 --> 00:17:18.313
You put the mark of the woodpecker's footprint

277
00:17:18.313 --> 00:17:21.813
on the foreheads of the corpses

278
00:17:21.813 --> 00:17:25.713
because your younger sister was shot in the forehead.

279
00:17:25.713 --> 00:17:28.413
You deliberately made Mr. Kano aware of this

280
00:17:28.413 --> 00:17:31.813
and made him go to his residence to check it out and killed him.

281
00:17:31.813 --> 00:17:36.213
You tried to frame me with that rope trick of yours.

282
00:17:36.213 --> 00:17:37.513
However,

283
00:17:37.513 --> 00:17:41.913
I don't know what was your motive for killing Pops Takeda and the others

284
00:17:41.913 --> 00:17:44.013
so I kept an eye on you,

285
00:17:44.013 --> 00:17:46.613
but after I overheard what Uehara said from inside the trunk of the car,

286
00:17:46.613 --> 00:17:49.113
I got an idea.

287
00:17:49.113 --> 00:17:51.513
Pops Takeda and the others stole the guns

288
00:17:51.513 --> 00:17:53.213
that they confiscated from premises search,

289
00:17:53.213 --> 00:17:59.413
branded them X, sold them off and were filling their pockets.

290
00:17:59.413 --> 00:18:02.213
Yes, I didn't know about it either.

291
00:18:02.213 --> 00:18:03.713
Until my surname changed to Akiyama

292
00:18:03.713 --> 00:18:07.613
and Chief Takeda invited me to join the Woodpecker Society.

293
00:18:07.613 --> 00:18:12.113
Then, I found out that the gun that killed Tsuyako

294
00:18:12.113 --> 00:18:15.613
was one of the guns they had sold through illegal channels!

295
00:18:15.613 --> 00:18:18.113
That's why I taught them a lesson.

296
00:18:18.113 --> 00:18:19.713
Takeda!

297
00:18:19.713 --> 00:18:21.013
Kano!

298
00:18:23.813 --> 00:18:25.613
Next, it's you.

299
00:18:25.613 --> 00:18:26.713
Akiyama.

300
00:18:26.713 --> 00:18:29.513
You're of the same flock, Inspector Yamato.

301
00:18:29.513 --> 00:18:32.713
You're to blame for having such a stupid friend.

302
00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:36.513
After I kill you, I'm killing Saegusa.

303
00:18:36.513 --> 00:18:39.513
Then, I've avenged Tsuyako's death.

304
00:18:39.513 --> 00:18:43.013
Cut it out already, Akiyama.

305
00:18:43.013 --> 00:18:45.913
You can't win.

306
00:18:45.913 --> 00:18:48.813
I wonder how long that shield will protect you.

307
00:18:53.613 --> 00:18:54.913
Akiyama.

308
00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:00.513
You're totally surrounded.

309
00:19:00.513 --> 00:19:02.013
Since when?

310
00:19:02.013 --> 00:19:06.513
"Without making a sound, they crossed the river at night."

311
00:19:06.513 --> 00:19:10.613
Like Kenshin Uesugi who sniffed out the woodpecker strategy,

312
00:19:10.613 --> 00:19:13.713
we approached you without a sound

313
00:19:13.713 --> 00:19:15.913
and were watching you

314
00:19:15.913 --> 00:19:20.513
from the time you were hanging halfway down the cliff.

315
00:19:20.513 --> 00:19:25.013
Well, we just got here about now though.

316
00:19:25.013 --> 00:19:27.813
Then, about issuing a search warrant on Inspector Yamato

317
00:19:27.813 --> 00:19:30.513
and leaving the dead body behind were...

318
00:19:30.513 --> 00:19:32.313
All to catch you off guard and nail you here.

319
00:19:32.313 --> 00:19:37.313
That's why we deliberately made sure you heard everything.

320
00:19:37.313 --> 00:19:38.713
I think it'll be too cluttered in Morufushi's car

321
00:19:38.713 --> 00:19:43.813
with the spare tire in the backseat and all.

322
00:19:43.813 --> 00:19:46.013
We figured that you'd make a move

323
00:19:46.013 --> 00:19:48.713
as soon as you found out where Yamato was.

324
00:19:48.713 --> 00:19:51.613
No way.

325
00:19:51.613 --> 00:19:53.013
Nab him!

326
00:20:00.313 --> 00:20:03.013
Hey, is Saegusa all right?

327
00:20:03.013 --> 00:20:05.513
He's all right. He's breathing.

328
00:20:05.513 --> 00:20:08.813
Okay. I guess we're going to have to give Saegusa

329
00:20:08.813 --> 00:20:11.613
a good interrogation later too, then.

330
00:20:13.113 --> 00:20:16.913
I guess I'll have to leave that up to you guys though.

331
00:20:16.913 --> 00:20:17.913
What?

332
00:20:19.413 --> 00:20:21.613
Are you all right, Kansuke?

333
00:20:21.613 --> 00:20:22.613
Yeah.

334
00:20:22.613 --> 00:20:24.813
I'm just fine, see.

335
00:20:24.813 --> 00:20:27.513
I tell you! I was so worried about you!

336
00:20:27.513 --> 00:20:29.513
When I heard from Conan about the situation

337
00:20:29.513 --> 00:20:34.513
and saw that ill omen mail that you sent to Inspector Morofushi, I...

338
00:20:34.513 --> 00:20:38.513
You mean the one about to flow like the river?

339
00:20:38.513 --> 00:20:40.413
Those were the words of Kansuke Yamamoto

340
00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:44.213
when he charged into enemy grounds, right?

341
00:20:44.213 --> 00:20:45.813
It was a joke! A joke!

342
00:20:45.813 --> 00:20:48.413
Stop nagging me.

343
00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:51.913
Are you my mother or what?

344
00:20:51.913 --> 00:20:53.113
Geez.

345
00:20:53.113 --> 00:20:54.613
Okay, I got it.

346
00:20:54.613 --> 00:20:56.413
I won't worry about you anymore!

347
00:20:56.413 --> 00:20:58.313
I'm sure you don't want a woman with an X on her marriage record

348
00:20:58.313 --> 00:20:59.913
brooding over you.

349
00:21:02.213 --> 00:21:05.813
Stupid, I've got an X on my face too.

350
00:21:05.813 --> 00:21:08.813
What?

351
00:21:08.813 --> 00:21:11.913
A huge mark of the footprint of a woodpecker!

352
00:21:11.913 --> 00:21:13.713
Kansuke.

353
00:21:13.713 --> 00:21:16.913
So well... you've got nothing to brood over.

354
00:21:22.813 --> 00:21:24.513
Come to think of it, Kansuke.

355
00:21:24.513 --> 00:21:25.713
What?

356
00:21:25.713 --> 00:21:28.313
What was the dull business you had to attend to this afternoon?

357
00:21:28.313 --> 00:21:32.713
I went to see the granny of my friend who fired at random.

358
00:21:32.713 --> 00:21:35.613
Since his grave is in a remote area

359
00:21:35.613 --> 00:21:37.513
where even cell phones are not in service,

360
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:40.513
I take her to his grave at that time every year.

361
00:21:40.513 --> 00:21:41.913
I see.

362
00:21:41.913 --> 00:21:46.413
Which means he knew about it too and tried to take advantage of it.

363
00:21:46.413 --> 00:21:47.513
Yeah.

364
00:21:51.213 --> 00:21:53.713
Gosh. I'm starving.

365
00:21:53.713 --> 00:21:55.513
You wanted go get some noodles before going home?

366
00:21:55.513 --> 00:21:57.713
No, I'll go have pasta.

367
00:23:26.013 --> 00:23:28.713
I'm satisfied! I'm totally satisfied.

368
00:23:28.713 --> 00:23:31.313
Dad, I think you ate too much, no?

369
00:23:31.313 --> 00:23:32.513
Don't be silly.

370
00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:34.413
One of the enjoyments of traveling

371
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:38.913
is eating local food that you can only eat there to your heart's content.

372
00:23:38.913 --> 00:23:41.513
When it comes to Nagano...

373
00:23:45.613 --> 00:23:48.513
I forgot to eat Shinshu noodles!

374
00:23:52.113 --> 00:23:56.613
"Next episode"

375
00:23:56.613 --> 00:23:58.513
He's looking at Amuro.

376
00:23:58.513 --> 00:24:00.813
Hey, we looked in all the shops, right?

377
00:24:00.813 --> 00:24:03.913
Yes, but he's nowhere.

378
00:24:03.913 --> 00:24:07.313
I'm sure that he vanished after all!

379
00:24:09.613 --> 00:24:11.713
Can I help you with something?

380
00:24:14.813 --> 00:24:15.813
Amuro!

381
00:24:16.813 --> 00:24:22.113
Next Conan, "Darkness Creeps Upon Amuro"

382
00:24:22.756 --> 00:24:25.056
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:25.056 --> 00:24:27.056
"Sandwich"
