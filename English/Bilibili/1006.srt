Allow me to propose a toast to the
continued growth of Sasano Finance.

00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,230
Cheers!

00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,420
Cheers!

Truly delicious. It's an excellent wine.

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,370
Truly delicious. It's an excellent wine.

11
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:19,630
Enoshima Akira (48)

12
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,880
Enoshima Akira (48)

I'm impressed that he was able to
acquire a wine of this caliber.

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,000
Enoshima Akira (48)
Enoshima Hospital Director
President Sasano is truly exceptional.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,870
President Sasano is truly exceptional.

15
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,440
Indeed.

16
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,430
There's no one quite like President Sasano.

Good grief. I'll be working until dawn again.

19
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,480
Good grief. I'll be working until dawn again.

20
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,870
You did have a busy week, Kimiyuki-san.

21
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,680
It looks like tonight won't be any easier.

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
Yeah.

23
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,230
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

24
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,590
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

25
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,680
Everyone's a suspect at
this problematic party!

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,040
Eliminate the impossible
and close in on the truth!

27
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,690
Always determining the one truth

28
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,450
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

29
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,030
his name is Detective Conan!

30
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,710
Who Poisoned the Victim?

31
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,900
Who Poisoned the Victim?
"Who Poisoned the Victim?"

32
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,020
Who Poisoned the Victim?

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,760
With all this wine available,
I'm on cloud wine!

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,180
You must be bored.

35
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,770
Huh?

36
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,030
Would you like some more juice?

37
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,550
Thanks.

38
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,910
Ugh, Dad's drinking enough wine
for three people all by himself.

39
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,610
He's completely forgotten why he came here.

40
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,920
Unbelievable.

41
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,360

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,420

I'm Kobayakawa, the secretary
for Sasano Finance.

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:15,900
Kobayakawa Rokuro (44)
Sasano Finance Secretary

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,340
Kobayakawa Rokuro (44)
Sasano Finance Secretary
The reason I came to hire your services
is because this was sent to our office.

45
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,730
The reason I came to hire your services
is because this was sent to our office.

46
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,050
Let me see. Allow me to take a look.

47
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,180
Is this a death threat?

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,850
Is this a death threat?
I'll kill Sasano
Prepare yourself

49
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,680
I'll kill Sasano
Prepare yourself
Yes.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Do you have any idea who
might have sent this?

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,940
Yes.

52
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,940
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

53
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,620
I'm asking you to identify the culprit.

54
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,070
I have three potential suspects in mind,

55
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,540
and I want you to determine
who sent this death threat.

56
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:54,710
Apparently all three of the guests invited to
this party have a grudge against the president.

57
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,990
I don't know the specifics,

58
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,530
but I've heard there were a
lot of problems between them

59
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,940
since the first president ran the company.

60
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,680
That guy with the mustache must
be the second president, then.

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,470
Yeah.

62
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,350
The first President Sasano
is that man in the photo.

63
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,850
That mustache looks just like
the current president's.

64
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,980
You're right.

65
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,730
Anyway, I'm terribly sorry about the car
accident that killed the first president.

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,940
Thank you.

67
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,680
The first president truly wasâ€”whoops.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,890
Hey, Oizumi-kun. Bring us
something to clean this up.

69
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,740
Yes, sir.

70
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,240
Don't worry about it.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,470
I've got a handkerchief.

72
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,160
You all right?

73
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,630
Yeah, it's fine.

74
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,130
They say it was his own maintenance error.

75
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,030
Truly unfortunate.

76
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,490
My father's hobby was his car.

77
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,020
I can't believe he ended up falling
off a cliff due to a defective brake.

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,770
It grieves me most deeply.

79
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,770
I appreciate everything he did
for me while he was alive.

80
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,530
I wish he could've seen Enoshima
Hospital prosper even more.

81
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,570
It doesn't look like anyone's
attempting anything for now.

82
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,940
Yeah.

83
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,210
I'm going to get more juice.

84
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,590
Okay.

85
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
Hello? This is Enoshima.

86
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,420
More juice, please.

87
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,800
You're quite the drinker.

88
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,550
What?

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,060
You didn't send me a
message? What do you mean?

90
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,870
Did something happen?

91
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,680
I don't know.

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,770
I see. I understand.

93
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,150
Thanks for handling the rest.

94
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,170
Thanks for waiting, Teshigawara-kun.

95
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,700
Tachikawa-san, it's Oizumi now.

96
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,870
Sorry, sorry.

97
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,840
Unbelievable. Be careful.

98
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,930
That's absolutely marvelous.

99
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,010
Would you like one?

100
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,880
Thank you.

101
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,430
Go ahead.

102
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,430
Delicious!

103
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,190
What's wrong, Sasano-san?

104
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,210
Sasano-san! Sir!

105
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,390
Hang in there.

106
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,460
Sir...

107
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,240
Excuse me.

108
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,090
It's too late.

109
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,970
He's already dead.

110
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,540
N-No...

111
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,560
Everyone, stay where you are.

112
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,810
This is a murder.

113
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,710
Damn it.

114
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,310
After the first president
died in an accident,

115
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,320
I never thought the second
would be poisoned today.

116
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,070
If the first had lived longer, the second
would've been disowned a long time ago.

117
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,220
Though their relationship was terrible, they
conducted their business exactly the same way.

118
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,200
Their methods were greedy and callous.

119
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,620
That's right.

120
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,580
Like father, like son. People resented them.

121
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,440
Tachikawa-san, I'm scared.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,840
I understand how you feel, but it's better
if you feign indifference for now.

123
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,590
Until the police arrive,

124
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,100
I, Mori Kogoro, shall manage the situation.

125
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,600
The truth is that the victim,
Sasano Shuji, had received a death threat.

126
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,860
What?

127
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,120
I apologize that we're requesting
your approval after the fact,

128
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,930
but we fully utilized this
structure's security cameras.

129
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,870
What do you mean, Mori-san?

130
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,720
Everyone, take a look at
these images we recorded.

131
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,880
What's this?

132
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,880
Mister, you're picking up something
that looks like medicine.

133
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,400
That's medicine for my blood pressure.

134
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,830
Here's the next image.

135
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,760
Hey, what is this?

136
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,520
You don't have poison hidden inside
that ring of yours, do you?

137
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,050
Hey, don't go falsely accusing me!

138
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,270
I had nothing to do with this!

139
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,760
Next image.

140
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,530
That's...!

141
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,530
It's a syringe.

142
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,550
S-So what? What's wrong with
a doctor carrying a syringe?

143
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,040
Besides, when the president collapsed, I
was standing on the other side of the room.

144
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,670
Well, I was just adjusting my ring.

145
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,180
There's no way I could've
killed the president.

146
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,050
I was just picking up the medicine I dropped.

147
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,550
It has nothing to do with the case.

148
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,490
More importantly, how can you treat
our personal information like this?

149
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,660
That's right! I'm going
to sue for defamation!

150
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,930
In any case, I'm leaving!

151
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,730
Quiet, please. This isn't a
matter of personal information.

152
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,980
A man has been murdered.

153
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,910
I suppose you're right.

154
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,190
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,670
What is it, Kobayakawa-san?

156
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,660
That's not me.

157
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,960
My name isn't Kobayakawa,
nor am I a secretary.

158
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,620
What?

159
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm actually the president Sasano Shuji.

160
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,770
Sasano Shuji (36)
Sasano Finance 2nd President
Kobayakawa Rokuro (44)
Sasano Finance Secretary

161
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,580
Sasano Shuji (36)
Sasano Finance 2nd President
Kobayakawa Rokuro (44)
Sasano Finance Secretary
A-A fake mustache? But...

162
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,260
Sasano Shuji (36)
Sasano Finance 2nd President
Kobayakawa Rokuro (44)
Sasano Finance Secretary
I shaved my own mustache off.

163
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,010
I shaved my own mustache off.

164
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,330
At Kobayakawa's suggestion, I lived in
disguise and traded places with him for a while.

165
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,610
I'm sorry for the confusion.

166
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,400
In other words, this is what happened.

167
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,910
The two of you planned to swap
places and see what would happen.

168
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,990
Yes.

169
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,520
Kobayakawa said that if the
death threat were real,

170
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,710
I would be safe this way.

171
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,600
I'd also be able to observe the reactions of
the other three from an impartial perspective.

172
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,920
I agreed to the plan because I believed
that, but I never thought this would happen.

173
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,290
What do you mean by that, sir?

174
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,580
Observe our reactions from
an impartial perspective?

175
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,040
You mean you treated us like
suspects from the very start?

176
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,890
That's why you used security
cameras to film us?

177
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,960
Was this party a farce to begin with?

178
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,450
How incredibly rude!

179
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,400
So what?

180
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,560
President Sasano received a death threat,

181
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,890
and Kobayakawa-san was murdered
while acting as his stand-in.

182
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,890
The police will arrive eventually.

183
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,330
They'll asking you to turn over the
possessions you have on you, so keep that in mind.

184
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,290
It's true that there wasn't a single
image of anyone poisoning the glass.

185
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,990
But a murder did occur.

186
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,840
How did the culprit poison him?

187
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,810
Excuse me.

188
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,930
I brought coffee.

189
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,520
Thank you, Teshigawara-san.

190
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,230
You're welcome.

191
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,240
I knew it was you, Teshigawara Nanase.

192
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,240
Teshigawara? You mean that Teshigawara?

193
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,120
I've heard that name before.

194
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,120
I know. It's the name of that distinguished
man who committed suicide.

195
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,870
Is there something the matter with that girl?

196
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,840
This woman was using a fake name.

197
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,750
Wait a minute!

198
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,670
My name changed because I was
adopted by the Oizumi family.

199
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,920
But your name before that was Teshigawara.

200
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,300
Am I wrong?

201
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,300
No, that's correct.

202
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,720
So you are the daughter of that family.

203
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,560
The family that was Sasano
Finance's first victim.

204
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,350
I heard the head of the family killed himself

205
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,230
over Sasano Finance's
aggressive collection methods.

206
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,740
It's true that my father killed
himself several years ago.

207
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,620
Does that mean the glass was poisoned by...?

208
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,560
It must've been this girl.

209
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,420
I don't know anything about that!

210
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,310
I was just handing out glasses!

211
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,250
That's right. She's the one
who handed out the glasses.

212
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,810
But from among several glasses,

213
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,170
Kobayakawa-san himself
selected the poisoned glass.

214
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,290
Isn't that right, Mori-sensei?

215
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,470
Huh? Uh, yeah.

216
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,640
For the time being, let's review
the security camera images again.

217
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,250
I hear magicians can make it look like
audience members have selected a card

218
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,720
while making them draw a
card of their choosing.

219
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,490
Hold on. Nanase isn't a magician!

220
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,330
I see.

221
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,890
You're her boyfriend, huh?

222
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,120
In other words, you were working together.

223
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,930
I just happened to invite Nanase here today!

224
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,000
This is the first time I've heard
about her history with Sasano Finance!

225
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,880
If you two were accomplices,
then it makes things simple.

226
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,630
First, you poison the glass.

227
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,140
Then your beloved Teshigawara-chan
simply hands it to him.

228
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,940
Hey!

229
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,750
Tachikawa-san, don't.

230
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,140
Now, now. Let's not lose our tempers.

231
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,790
You said at the start that
you'd let me handle this.

232
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,520
The police are already on their way, too.

233
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,980
Excuse me.

234
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,500
In any case, let's review the moment
the wine was handed off again.

235
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,410
Hey.

236
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,160
I'd like to see what happened
after he was handed the wine, too.

237
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,940
I'm always telling you not to
butt into my conversations.

238
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:40,290
But if that lady is the culprit, then I want
to see what kind of magic trick she used.

239
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,270
Sasano-san, could I ask
you to replay the video?

240
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,170
Yes, very well.

241
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,200
Take a look.

242
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,100
Haven't we seen enough?

243
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,560
Didn't Kobayakawa-san take a different glass
from the one he initially reached for?

244
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,590
You're right. It's like he changed his mind.

245
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,130
They're right.

246
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,200
Regardless of any attempt to influence him,

247
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,890
it was the victim himself
who selected the glass.

248
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,950
That's right.

249
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,340
What does that mean?

250
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,210
The culprit couldn't have predicted that the
victim would select a different glass on a whim.

251
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,460
You're right.

252
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,980
She didn't do it.

253
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,840
Wait a minute.

254
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,090
There were several glasses left on the tray.

255
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,300
What if the chef or that woman
had poisoned all of them?

256
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,430
Am I wrong, Detective Mori?

257
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,520
Huh?

258
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
I drank it.

259
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,030
This means all of the
glasses weren't poisoned.

260
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,260
That would mean the victim chose
the poisoned glass himself.

261
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,290
You mean an invisible culprit poisoned
the glass just before he drank from it?

262
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,680
Don't be ridiculous.

263
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,070
Hey, mister.

264
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,050
A little while before the murder, I
heard a message notification sound.

265
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,050
That would've been this.

266
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,760
Wow, that's a cool phone.

267
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,090
Can I see?

268
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,040
Sure.

269
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,940
Hooray. Wow, so cool.

270
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,170
You think so?

271
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,080
Don't play with it too much.

272
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,050
Okay.

273
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,110
I don't really understand how to use it.

274
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,970
I guess it was a little difficult for you.

275
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,380
Yeah, thanks.

276
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,220
In any case, you two are suspicious!

277
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,790
I'm turning you over to the police!

278
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,000
Dad?

279
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,700
When did I poison the glass?

280
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,380
We couldn't have done it.

281
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,930
You must've plotted something where
the security cameras couldn't see you.

282
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,340
Hold on, please.

283
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,640
Once again, I believe you
asked me to handle this case.

284
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,810
It's the Sleeping Kogoro.

285
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,680
It's the real thing.

286
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,910
Medically speaking, it's rather mysterious,
but he does appear to be speaking.

287
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:12,650
This is quite the puzzling case, but at the very
least, Tachikawa-san and Oizumi-san did not do it.

288
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,340
I was wondering what you were going to say.

289
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,040
Are you saying someone else could've done it?

290
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,970
Indeed, yes.

291
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,230
It was someone else who poisoned the glass.

292
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,170
Naturally, they're here right now.

293
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,610
I swear it wasn't me.

294
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,460
It wasn't me either.

295
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,270
Now, now. Please calm down.

296
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:39,470
I know that Sasano Finance's practically
fraudulent practices put each of you in crisis.

297
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:44,190
Therefore, all three of you
have a motive for murder.

298
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,590
However, as was made clear
by the security cameras,

299
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,480
you never had the opportunity
to poison the glass.

300
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,660
The same goes for Tachikawa-san
and Oizumi-san.

301
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,990
But wouldn't that mean
the culprit isn't here?

302
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,000
Not so.

303
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,670
There's just one more person remaining.

304
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,290
Which means...

305
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,300
Could it be?

306
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,300
Surely you're not referring to me.

307
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,150
Enough of this!

308
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,110
An attempt was made on my life!

309
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,220
Why would I be the culprit?

310
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,080
Once you eliminate the impossible,

311
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,730
whatever remains, no matter how
improbable, must be the truth.

312
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,370
In other words, this murder is possible
if and only if you are the culprit.

313
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,920
But Kobayakawa-san chose
which glass to take himself.

314
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,220
That's right.

315
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,500
He deliberately chose the poisoned glass.

316
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,000
It was impossible for the
culprit to poison that glass.

317
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,630
Wasn't that the conclusion we reached?

318
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,350
But didn't he collapse because
the glass was poisoned?

319
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,200
Are you sure about that?

320
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,270
We're assuming there was poison in the glass
the victim drank from just before he collapsed.

321
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,150
But what if it was all an act?

322
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,780
An act?

323
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,780
Precisely.

324
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,850
The culprit's plan began
with the death threat.

325
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,790
If you assume that, then
you can figure it out.

326
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,410
Suppose that the secretary believed
the death threat was real

327
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,550
and that it was the president himself
who suggested that they swap places.

328
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,680
The similarities in their
appearance make it possible.

329
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,820
They conspired to disguise themselves
as each other and swapped places.

330
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,060
Someone who'd never met them
directly wouldn't notice.

331
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,020
Kobayakawa-san, while
disguised as the president,

332
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,310
would pretend to be poisoned in order
to unsettle three people who had motive.

333
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,790
Then Sasano-san, while
disguised as Kobayakawa-san,

334
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,400
would intervene and uncover
who sent the death threat.

335
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,080
What if the idea were proposed
to the victim in this manner?

336
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,530
But Kobayakawa-san's death wasn't an act.

337
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,080
That's right. He died, right before our eyes.

338
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,380
Indeed. It's true that a line had been
drawn between acting and reality.

339
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,970
Try to recall what happened after
Kobayakawa-san pretended to be poisoned.

340
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,590
Sir, hang in there.

341
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,890
Could it be?

342
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,560
It was the water?

343
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,770
The poison was in the water.

344
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,270
Immediately after I confirmed
the victim's death,

345
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,170
Sasano-san dropped the cup directly on
top of the glass dropped by the victim.

346
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:46,290
The poisoned water scattered and mixed
with the wine that had fallen earlier.

347
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,560
It was an attempt to make it appear as
though the poison had been in the wine

348
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,180
when forensics examined it later.

349
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,750
This case was actually a
plot to murder the secretary

350
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,050
disguised as a death threat
against the president.

351
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,370
Wait a minute!

352
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,100
What motive do I have?

353
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,850
The conversation between the
other three gave me some idea.

354
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,730
If the previous president
hadn't died in an accident,

355
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,400
you wouldn't have taken over the company.

356
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,110
And maintaining his car just
happened to be his hobby.

357
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,220
You probably worked with
Kobayakawa-san the secretary

358
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,440
to make the previous president's accident
look like it was caused by a maintenance error.

359
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,870
Which means your accomplice Kobayakawa-san
was a thorn in your side.

360
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,010
What evidence is there that I did it?

361
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,570
If you have any, show me!

362
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,540
I thought you might say that.

363
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,420
The greatest weakness of this plan is
that one of your guests is a doctor.

364
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,770
It would be fatal if he saw through
the act of pretending to be poisoned.

365
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,760
So you sent Enoshima-san
a fake urgent message

366
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,750
so he'd move away from the scene.

367
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,290
If you wrote the message beforehand,

368
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,140
If you wrote the message beforehand,
From: Enoshima Hospital
Subject: Emergency
Please contact us immediately.

369
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,530
From: Enoshima Hospital
Subject: Emergency
Please contact us immediately.
you could wait for the opportunity
to send it in an instant.

370
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,540
But you needed to erase the sent message
history that would be left on your phone.

371
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,700
Amidst the confusion, you didn't
appear to have the time to do that.

372
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,990
Which means I'd like to take
a look at your phone history.

373
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,550
I don't have my phone.

374
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,210
I don't bring my phone with me to parties.

375
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,070
I thought it would ruin the mood
if I suddenly received a call.

376
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,600
When I asked to see
Enoshima-san's phone earlier,

377
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,310
I memorized your number from his contacts.

378
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,730
Sounds like you do have your phone on you.

379
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,240
Let us see it.

380
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,830
It would seem that the police have arrived.

381
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,830
Mister, lunch is ready.

382
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,750
Tada! What do you think, kid?

383
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,240
Looks pretty good on me, doesn't it?

384
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,650
Uh, yeah...

385
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,920
If you don't hurry up,
your food will get cold.

386
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,100
Coming!

387
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,400
I'm gonna go, Mister.

388
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,780
Hey! Hey, kid!

389
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,030
Say something before you go. Hey!

390
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,760
Huh? What? My mustache. My mustache!

391
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,490
That might've actually
been a good look for him.
