1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.640
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.840
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.640
The case of the treasure thief is solved!

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.840
What is Ayumi's real motive?

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.567
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad

9
00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.367
were taken by Ayumi

10
00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:47.367
to go get a set of Girls' Festival dolls at the Kanno residence.

11
00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:48.367
While we were there...

12
00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.467
Mr. Mizutaka Tsumagari brings an antique appraiser, Mr. Yoshiharu Mie,

13
00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.767
with him saying that he wants to buy

14
00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:57.067
the hanging scroll at a very high price, but...

15
00:01:57.067 --> 00:02:00.367
Mrs. Kanno's grandma flatly refuses.

16
00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:03.867
But, while we were out for shopping,

17
00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:06.167
that hanging scroll disappears!

18
00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:13.667
Look, the time the fax was sent out all show 15:28!

19
00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.867
Which means that the fax kept coming in

20
00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:20.667
all the while we were out shopping until we came back, right?

21
00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.167
Do you think a burglar would break into a room

22
00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.267
where noise is constantly coming from?

23
00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.467
Besides, it's strange that

24
00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:31.767
the burglar didn't notice her wallet

25
00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.967
and if the burglar couldn't find what he was after,

26
00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:36.667
wouldn't all the other rooms be ransacked too?

27
00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:38.467
True.

28
00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:41.067
The strangest thing is,

29
00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:44.667
why only the hanging scroll was stolen.

30
00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.667
But, that hanging scroll is worth 20,000,000 yen.

31
00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.667
You idiot, only a professional would know

32
00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.467
if that scroll is really worth that price.

33
00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:54.467
Which means that

34
00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:58.867
the burglar knew that the scroll was here to begin with.

35
00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:00.567
Yeah.

36
00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.067
But if the burglar was after the scroll,

37
00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:05.467
the other room wouldn't have been ransacked.

38
00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:08.267
Maybe the burglar messed up the other room

39
00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:11.267
just to throw people off, so that he's not suspected.

40
00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:14.967
Which means the culprit has no definite alibi, and on top of that

41
00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:19.267
had to face the police reluctantly after the incident.

42
00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:24.367
Furthermore, that person knows the value of that hanging scroll!

43
00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:32.267
"Girls' Festival Dolls in the Sunset (Part 2)"

44
00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:36.567
Hey, Conan.

45
00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:38.167
But in the Japanese room...

46
00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.367
All there is the set of Girls' Festival dolls,

47
00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:41.667
and nothing else...

48
00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:43.767
Look, see!

49
00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.467
It's changed, isn't it?

50
00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:48.667
It's somehow different from how it was before we went shopping.

51
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:50.767
Somehow different?

52
00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.767
It looks the same to me.

53
00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:54.567
Oh, I see!

54
00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.867
The position of the Emperor and the Empress isn't correct.

55
00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:59.967
The right and left is opposite!

56
00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:01.367
Right.

57
00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:03.367
It's not only those two.

58
00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:05.467
Ayumi, will you get your digital camera out?

59
00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.067
Okay!

60
00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.567
-Here you go! -Thank you!

61
00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:11.667
See. Although it's very slight,

62
00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.067
when you compare the picture with the one that was taken previously,

63
00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:18.367
the position of the other 13 dolls are slightly moved, right?

64
00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:19.567
You're right.

65
00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:24.267
It's most likely that the person who took the hanging scroll

66
00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:26.567
bumped into the altar of the dolls accidentally

67
00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.767
and the dolls fell.

68
00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:30.067
I see.

69
00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.167
So the person who lined the dolls back again,

70
00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.267
placed them in the wrong position.

71
00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:37.067
And? Who's the culprit?

72
00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:39.567
-Huh? -Hurry up and tell us!

73
00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:41.067
Oh, well, as to that...

74
00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:44.667
I still haven't figured it out.

75
00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:45.667
Is that so?

76
00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:48.967
Stop talking like you got the answer then!

77
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:52.467
The dolls look sad.

78
00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:55.867
See. This doll here was smiling a bit more

79
00:04:55.867 --> 00:04:58.667
when it was first lined up.

80
00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:00.367
How dare they drop the dolls

81
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:01.667
after we went through the trouble of lining them up right.

82
00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.867
I see! I got it!

83
00:05:03.867 --> 00:05:05.167
Huh?

84
00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:07.767
The burglar is somebody who doesn't know very well

85
00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:10.067
how the dolls should be lined up.

86
00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:13.567
The burglar is you!

87
00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:15.967
Mr. Tsumagari!

88
00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:18.667
I remember you said you don't have a daughter

89
00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:21.367
so you're not interested in the dolls, right?

90
00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:25.367
I see, so that's why you lined the dolls up wrong!

91
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:27.367
Please confess!

92
00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:29.467
You're the burglar, aren't you?

93
00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:31.967
No.

94
00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:34.467
It's not Mr. Tsumagari!

95
00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:38.167
The burglar is one of the two!

96
00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:42.067
Only these two would be able to do something like this!

97
00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:43.667
But why?

98
00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.967
Why did the person line the dolls that dropped back again?

99
00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:49.367
It would've been more effective to leave the dolls as they were,

100
00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:52.867
to make it look like burglary.

101
00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:54.767
Mr. Tsumagari,

102
00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:57.767
will you please let me check your room out?

103
00:05:57.767 --> 00:05:58.767
Huh?

104
00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:01.167
Of course, I'm asking you to do it voluntarily.

105
00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:03.267
Oh, all right!

106
00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:05.167
Go on and check my room out if you want to!

107
00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:07.667
I assure you that you'll find nothing!

108
00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:12.867
Oh, and I'm going to have to do a body check on all three of you,

109
00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:14.067
since there is a possibility that

110
00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:17.867
you may be hiding the hanging scroll somewhere in your body.

111
00:06:17.867 --> 00:06:20.667
Okay, we'll get a woman officer and start right away.

112
00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:23.667
We better move fast or the sun will set.

113
00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.867
-Yes, sir. -What? Oh, no...

114
00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:29.167
It's this late already.

115
00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.867
Are you sure that Mr. Tsumagari is the culprit?

116
00:06:32.867 --> 00:06:34.367
Although you did seem really confident...

117
00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:37.167
You're the one that started this whole thing!

118
00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:44.767
Hey, Conan.

119
00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:47.367
Did you figure out who the culprit is?

120
00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:48.367
Huh?

121
00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:49.667
Oh, I'm sorry,

122
00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.067
I'm in the process of thinking now.

123
00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:56.567
We'd better hurry or the steps will...

124
00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:58.067
The steps...

125
00:06:58.067 --> 00:07:00.667
-Huh? -Thanks, Ayumi!

126
00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:02.467
I've figured it out!

127
00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:05.367
Really? Have you figured out who the culprit is, then?

128
00:07:05.367 --> 00:07:07.767
Yeah, thanks to you, Ayumi!

129
00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:10.967
I'll go get the officers then!

130
00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:12.167
Ayumi?

131
00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:19.167
What, you've figured out who stole the hanging scroll?

132
00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:21.367
Who could've done a thing like that?

133
00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:25.367
You'll find out after you come to Mrs. Kanno's room!

134
00:07:25.367 --> 00:07:26.967
Hurry, officer!

135
00:07:26.967 --> 00:07:29.167
Okay.

136
00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:40.767
Please...

137
00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:43.367
Please, sunset.

138
00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:46.067
Stay still a little while longer.

139
00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:47.767
Just a little while longer.

140
00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:48.967
I see.

141
00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:52.667
So this sunset was what you were waiting for.

142
00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:54.567
Haibara.

143
00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:57.667
Looks beautiful, doesn't it?

144
00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:00.667
You seem to have an eye for these things.

145
00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:02.067
Really?

146
00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:05.767
So let's hurry and solve the case, bring him along!

147
00:08:05.767 --> 00:08:06.867
Okay!

148
00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:18.167
The sunset.

149
00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:19.867
It smears the world in blood.

150
00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.967
The death throes of the sun.

151
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:28.567
I wonder how many more times I'll get to see.

152
00:08:31.267 --> 00:08:33.467
This sad color.

153
00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:42.567
And, who is it that solved the case?

154
00:08:42.567 --> 00:08:43.667
Don't tell me you did, Mrs. Kanno?

155
00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:46.267
-Oh, no. -Me!

156
00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:49.367
You, sonny?

157
00:08:49.367 --> 00:08:51.767
Yep! I've figured it all out!

158
00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:56.667
The one who took the hanging scroll and where it is too!

159
00:08:56.667 --> 00:09:00.067
The hint is the altar of the dolls!

160
00:09:00.067 --> 00:09:03.067
When the thief took the hanging scroll and fled,

161
00:09:03.067 --> 00:09:06.467
the thief accidentally bumped into the doll altar and the dolls fell.

162
00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:09.067
Then when putting the dolls back on the steps,

163
00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:12.067
the position of the Emperor and Empress were reversed, right?

164
00:09:12.067 --> 00:09:15.667
That's why we searched Mr. Tsumagari's room.

165
00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:16.667
Of all the four people

166
00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:18.967
that have a motive for stealing the hanging scroll,

167
00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:23.267
only he doesn't know how to line the dolls up!

168
00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:26.267
-No, it's just the opposite! -Opposite?

169
00:09:26.267 --> 00:09:29.067
Take a good look at the altar!

170
00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:31.067
When you compare it to the time when we lined the dolls up,

171
00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:32.867
before the burglar broke in,

172
00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:35.567
all of the dolls are a bit out of position,

173
00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.867
and except for the Emperor and Empress,

174
00:09:37.867 --> 00:09:40.267
all the dolls are in the correct position!

175
00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:41.867
Is he right?

176
00:09:41.867 --> 00:09:43.367
Yes, he's correct.

177
00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:45.067
I checked the position of the dolls

178
00:09:45.067 --> 00:09:47.867
after the children lined them in place.

179
00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:50.667
If the burglar bumped into the altar with enough impact

180
00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:53.167
to drop the Emperor and the Empress,

181
00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:56.867
the other dolls and accessories would have fell too, right?

182
00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:59.567
If the person didn't know how to line the dolls up,

183
00:09:59.567 --> 00:10:02.467
there is no way that the dolls would be lined up as perfectly as this!

184
00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:09.267
But, the burglar did actually line the Emperor and Empress up wrong.

185
00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:11.367
What if it's not a mistake?

186
00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:13.967
What if this is the traditional way that

187
00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:16.967
dolls used to be lined up in ancient times in Japan?

188
00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:18.867
The traditional way?

189
00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:20.367
Yep!

190
00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:23.567
Originally in Japan, the honourable seat was to the left

191
00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:24.967
and the lower seat to the right,

192
00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:28.767
so the person who is higher in rank used to stand on the left.

193
00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:32.967
As you can see, the elderly Minister of the Left is on the left,

194
00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:36.567
whereas, the young Minister of the Right is on the right.

195
00:10:36.567 --> 00:10:37.967
So, the Emperor and Empress in accordance

196
00:10:37.967 --> 00:10:40.367
to this tradition of men being higher in rank than women,

197
00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:44.267
the Emperor is on the left and the Empress is on the right.

198
00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:47.867
Hey, Conan, you're wrong!

199
00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.867
The man's on the right!

200
00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:52.567
Like I've been telling you, from the view point of the dolls,

201
00:10:52.567 --> 00:10:54.567
the Emperor is to the left of the Empress!

202
00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:57.267
Oh, I see.

203
00:10:57.267 --> 00:10:59.667
But, all the dolls decorated in show windows

204
00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:02.167
are opposite from the altar there.

205
00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:04.267
That's because this is Tokyo!

206
00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:06.267
During the Meiji Restoration, when the western custom

207
00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:09.267
of the "right side being the honourable position" entered Japan,

208
00:11:09.267 --> 00:11:13.767
the position of the Emperor during the coronation also changed,

209
00:11:13.767 --> 00:11:18.867
and so followed the doll industry of Tokyo!

210
00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:22.467
You sure know a lot, don't you, sonny?

211
00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:26.867
Yep, I love to check out things like this!

212
00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:32.667
Conan?

213
00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:35.567
I've been wanting to ask you from some time ago but...

214
00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:39.567
Why do you always talk childish only when you talk to adults?

215
00:11:39.567 --> 00:11:42.567
It's as you're fawning on them or something.

216
00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.267
Oh, yeah?

217
00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:47.967
Rather, you give me the creeps.

218
00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:52.467
Okay, I will act natural like always. Satisfied?

219
00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:54.367
I like the way you talk, it's cute.

220
00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:57.267
Although it's kind of girlish, it's sweet.

221
00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:02.767
So, who's the burglar, sonny?

222
00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:05.367
Oh, yes. So, the burglar is someone

223
00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:07.867
who knows how the dolls used to lined up in olden times.

224
00:12:07.867 --> 00:12:12.367
Either Grandma Kanno or Appraiser Mr. Mie!

225
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.730
When grandma was still a child,

226
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:29.130
the old way of lining up the dolls was widespread.

227
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.430
Besides, she's originally from Kyoto!

228
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.730
There are many homes in Kyoto that take traditional seriously

229
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.330
and stick to the traditional way of doing things.

230
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.330
She probably learned to line the dolls up the traditional way!

231
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:45.130
Mr. Mie should also know the traditional way of lining the dolls up,

232
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.230
and if he knows that those dolls are from Kyoto,

233
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:53.730
it's not inconceivable that he would line them up that way.

234
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.130
Does he know that those dolls are from Kyoto?

235
00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.530
Because Setsuko told him so,

236
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.230
and the dolls from Kyoto have accessories

237
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.930
that are different from the dolls in Tokyo,

238
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.130
so a professional would be able to tell right off the bat.

239
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.130
So, which one of them is the burglar

240
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.930
and where is the hanging scroll?

241
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.330
Don't tell me you don't know who it is again?

242
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.030
I know who it is!

243
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.230
Because Ayumi gave me the hint, "steps".

244
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.230
Steps, don't tell me that...

245
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.830
I get it!

246
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.930
The burglar climbed the altar as if they were steps

247
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.030
and hid the hanging scroll in the cabinet above the closet!

248
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.730
And, when the burglar did so,

249
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.630
some of the dolls were kicked by the burglar's foot,

250
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.530
so the dolls fell!

251
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.630
Hey, Genta, be careful!

252
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.730
So, the hanging scroll is probably still in here.

253
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.630
It's not here.

254
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.730
Not there. In the back, behind!

255
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.430
A steps like this altar was brought out

256
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.730
and the hanging scroll was hid in the back.

257
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:58.230
So the dolls fell when the altar was moved.

258
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.830
The burglar wasn't aware that if you go inside the closet like this,

259
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.730
it would've been easy to hide the scroll.

260
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:10.130
The box for the doll set is here, but there's nothing else.

261
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:15.530
Maybe the dolls fell when the burglar fled, after all.

262
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.430
No... no dolls were dropped.

263
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.130
The burglar took all the dolls away from the altar deliberately

264
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.530
in order to hide the hanging scroll.

265
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.830
Took the dolls away?

266
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.530
Don't tell me that the hanging scroll is...

267
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.530
Hey, help me move the dolls!

268
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.730
Yes, sir!

269
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:38.930
Yes, it's a convenient place to hide paper things

270
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.030
such as hanging scrolls.

271
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.530
And yet, it's a place that's hard to find even if you search for it.

272
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.630
The place is...

273
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.930
behind the red cloth of the altar!

274
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.930
I see.

275
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.930
A place that is not visible unless all the dolls are moved,

276
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.530
is hard to reach, in other words, hard to find.

277
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.830
And, Ayumi mentioned that the dolls looked sad.

278
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.330
That's because the this wooden plate that

279
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.430
is on the top of the hanging scroll was underneath.

280
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.430
If you put the wooden place above this laughing doll,

281
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.930
it tilts forward

282
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.230
and its facial expression changes, doesn't it?

283
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.730
I see, that's why its laughing face looked a bit different!

284
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.030
But, why is it placed reversed?

285
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:31.030
Because the thick plate that is attached under the hanging scroll

286
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.130
cannot be covered with just the red cloth.

287
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.230
That's why it was placed upside down and hidden behind

288
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.930
the folding screen on the very top of the altar.

289
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.530
Wait!

290
00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.730
If the burglar hid the hanging scroll in a place like this,

291
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:43.730
it means...

292
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.530
Yeah. After the police leave, the burglar

293
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.330
can pretend to put the dolls away

294
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.230
and also retrieve the hanging scroll.

295
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.230
Only grandma is capable of doing this, right?

296
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.330
-What? -Grandma?

297
00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.830
-Oh, no! -No joke?

298
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.930
Yeah. After we left to go shopping and she was at home all alone,

299
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.430
she probably came up with the idea

300
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.330
of hiding the hanging scroll

301
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.930
and messing up the room to make it look like a burglar broke in!

302
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.730
And then she goes up shopping herself

303
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.930
to make it look as if a burglar broke in while she was out.

304
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.830
But, I wonder if that granny would even come across

305
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.230
the idea of a burglar opening the veranda window

306
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.130
and breaking in through the roof?

307
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.230
Well, they broadcast a lot of those kinds of programs on TV recently

308
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:35.930
that I'm sure grandma had seen them too.

309
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.630
I guess so.

310
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.130
But, why would she do a thing like that?

311
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.130
Don't tell me...

312
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.930
You tried to get insurance money for it

313
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.330
after making it look as if it were stolen...

314
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.830
I would never do something so evil.

315
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.330
This hanging scroll is the protective god of the Kanno family.

316
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.830
Protective god?

317
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.030
Yes. That's why I decided to hide it for now,

318
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.830
and after my son returns from work,

319
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:10.430
I was going to show him the Thunder God and tell him about it.

320
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:15.030
That is, not to repeat the mistake that I made.

321
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.330
Repeat? Don't tell me that...

322
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.030
Right.

323
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:24.230
We originally had the hanging scroll of the Wind God here too.

324
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.430
It was found in the storeroom of my husband's parental home,

325
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.830
so we're not sure where it came from but...

326
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.430
My husband used to always say,

327
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.730
"We are the Kanno family, so this hanging scroll"

328
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.930
"is most likely our protective god!"

329
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.530
Come to think of it, the Wind God and Thunder God

330
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.930
are the guardian deity of the 12 handed Goddess of Mercy.

331
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:48.830
When my son got married,

332
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.630
we were having trouble getting money together to buy this condo.

333
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.530
Therefore, I decided to sell the Wind God scroll.

334
00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.630
I sold it secretly while my husband was on a company trip.

335
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.030
Then...

336
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.130
the passenger liner that my husband was on board sunk

337
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.930
when they encountered a typhoon

338
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.030
as if the Wind God had created.

339
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:17.930
Then are you saying that the cursed Wind God scroll

340
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.630
made its rounds and came to me.

341
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.830
It is not cursed.

342
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.330
Like they say the Girls' Festival dolls were originally placed

343
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.030
by the pillow of the child

344
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.930
as a protective charm to ward off evil.

345
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:37.530
Likewise, every time that hanging scroll is stained or soiled,

346
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.830
I feel that it may be warding off misfortune

347
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:45.030
that may befall our family for us.

348
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:53.730
So, please do not lay a hand on that Thunder God scroll.

349
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.330
Oh, well...

350
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.430
Now that we know it is not only very valuable,

351
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.130
but also has additional benefits,

352
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.330
the more we wouldn't mind risking our lives for it,

353
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.730
right, Mr. Tsumagari?

354
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.530
No, I'm totally satisfied with only the Wind God.

355
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.030
Forget all of this, okay?

356
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.830
My, how disappointing...

357
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.130
However, I will be back again later, Mrs. Kanno.

358
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.030
Huh?

359
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.930
To teach you an easy way to store it.

360
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:38.230
Let's get going too, officers.

361
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.530
I'll have to be punished for having committed this case.

362
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.530
A case?

363
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.530
Give me a break!

364
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.830
The owner of the house messes the room up,

365
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.530
and something disappears so there was a great fuss over it.

366
00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.330
If I file this as a case,

367
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:56.330
I'm really going to be struck by my boss' thunder!

368
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.830
Oh, god. How frightening.

369
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:07.230
However, it is a fact that I scared the children.

370
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.630
I'll help you pack the dolls as a token of my apology.

371
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.430
So that you can take it home right away.

372
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.730
Oh, on second thought I'm not going to take it!

373
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.630
Maybe my Hina doll was broken

374
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:24.130
because it warded off evil in my place.

375
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.330
So, I'll try asking daddy again

376
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.030
if he'll get it repaired for me!

377
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.730
I'm so sorry, after you went out of your way to help me.

378
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.130
Oh no, no problem.

379
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.530
Are you sure?

380
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.230
Yep!

381
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.630
Besides,

382
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.230
the Girls' Festival doll that I really wanted...

383
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.730
What I really, really want is...

384
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.730
What I really, really want is...

385
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.230
I don't care what but...

386
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.730
You'd better hurry

387
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.130
or you're going to lose the chance to push the shutter.

388
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.030
Because it looks just great now.

389
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.130
Hey, take a look of that!

390
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.430
What a beautiful sunset.

391
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.930
I see!

392
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.930
You wanted to take a picture of this sunset, right, Ayumi?

393
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.630
Conan, you sit right here!

394
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.130
Mitsuhiko, Haibara and Genta sit one step below!

395
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.430
Here's the camera!

396
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.930
Yes, yes.

397
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.530
But, why are we facing this way?

398
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.430
You may as well take a picture with the sunset in the background

399
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.130
because it'll be a nice picture that way.

400
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.330
Oh, never mind.

401
00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.830
Okay, everybody, smile!

402
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:08.130
The stairs are red from the sunset,

403
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.730
so with the cream-colored elevator door in the background,

404
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.030
you all look as if you're...

405
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.830
Hina dolls!

406
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.130
Huh?

407
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.930
Which means Conan is the Emperor

408
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.430
and I'm the Minister of the Right?

409
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.530
Rather, the three Court Ladies.

410
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.730
Hey, you gotta be joking!

411
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.430
No, I...

412
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.930
-Haibara, let's go up the steps! -Huh?

413
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.530
Move it, Conan!

414
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.030
No!

415
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.230
I mean, we're more like the five Musicians.

416
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.630
The tip of the rope is twisted.

417
00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.630
This is part of a spider web.

418
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.330
I wonder when it stuck on...

419
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.830
Why would it be in a place like this?

420
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.130
Next Conan,

421
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.530
"The View Point With A Broken Fence"

422
00:24:14.198 --> 00:24:15.198
Guess what's next?

423
00:24:15.198 --> 00:24:16.798
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:18.498
"The White-Eye's nest"

425
00:24:18.498 --> 00:24:20.198
Pops's will be making his appearance after a long time!

426
00:24:20.198 --> 00:24:22.998
Are you sure the needle of your tranquilizing gun isn't rusted?
