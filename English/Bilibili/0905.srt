The memory of a masked TV hero controls a girl's time.

He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8

His name is Detective Conan.

00:02:58.681 --> 00:02:59.981
I can't believe we're spending the weekend

12
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:02.881
in such a wonderful place.

13
00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.281
Sometimes, you have some chic ideas, Dad.

14
00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:07.681
What's that?

15
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:09.181
"Nishiokuho, Guest House Hatobue Lodge" -This is...

16
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:12.081
an article about the boarding house we're staying at today...

17
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:14.581
"The place has the best beer!" -Apparently, the boarding house...

18
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:17.981
has a wide variety of beers.

19
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.181
I see. So that's what Dad's after.

20
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:24.181
I'm going to drink.

21
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:28.581
Who's the Prince of Beer?

22
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:30.481
Otaro Minakitaya.

23
00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:32.381
He's an entertainer who recently became popular

24
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:34.481
for hosting variety shows.

25
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.381
His knowledge of beer that he displays on blogs and talk shows

26
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:39.681
is supposed to be amazing.

27
00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:41.781
So that makes him the Prince of Beer.

28
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.181
He used to be part of

29
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:48.681
the comedy duo Otaro Minakitaya and Kyujiro.

30
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.481
But his partner Kyujiro committed an act of violence.

31
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.181
Their duo was dissolved.

32
00:03:54.181 --> 00:03:56.481
That was three years ago, I believe.

Kogoro Mouri?

36
00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:08.681
Indeed. I am the great detective Kogoro Mouri.

37
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.381

Yeah. Are you?

41
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:22.281
Yes.

42
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:24.281
How could I not

43
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.081
after the Prince of Beer spoke so highly of it?

44
00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:33.681
Sorry I'm late.

45
00:04:33.681 --> 00:04:36.181
I'm Ohara of the Hatobue Lodge.

Yes.

49
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:47.581
In that case, I'll take you to the lodge.

50
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:49.281
Get in, please.

00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:28.981
Thank you for coming.

58
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:32.981
I'm Asako Yuri, owner of the Hatobue Lodge.

59
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:44.581
This is my daughter Miona.

60
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:46.581
Welcome.

61
00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:48.581
You must be exhausted.

62
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:50.281
Have a seat.

63
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:56.081
Were these taken around here?

64
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:59.481
Yes. The scenery around here is beautiful.

65
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.981
I recommend you go for a walk before dinner.

66
00:06:02.981 --> 00:06:05.181
What are these?

67
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.581
They're cow magnets.

68
00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:12.881
Cows sometimes swallow nails

69
00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:15.881
or bits of metal in addition to grass.

70
00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:19.181
It's dangerous to leave them inside their bodies,

71
00:06:19.181 --> 00:06:21.681
so we feed them powerful magnets

72
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:25.081
to grab the pieces of metal in their stomachs.

73
00:06:25.081 --> 00:06:27.381
And that's called a cow magnet.

74
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:28.881
I see.

75
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:30.981
The guests staying here last night

76
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.381
stuck bottle caps to them.

77
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:35.681
But there's an even more fun thing you can do with them.

78
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:43.781
You take turns sticking these onto the magnet.

79
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:45.481
And then...

80
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:49.881
Whoever makes the chain collapse loses.

81
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:53.181
Those weren't here last time I came.

82
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:56.181

86
00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:06.081
I... I'm a huge fan!

87
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.481
Could I get your autograph?

88
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.981
Sure.

89
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:12.881
Gladly.

90
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:13.881
Here.

91
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:15.681
Thank you!

92
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:20.181
I got his autograph.

00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:24.881

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:27.381
Otaro, have some tea.

96
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:29.781
Thank you, Asako.

97
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:34.381
Do you come here often?

98
00:07:34.381 --> 00:07:38.681
Yeah. This place has a huge selection of beers.

99
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:43.281
Enjoying your favorite beers in a quiet place with clean air

100
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:45.381
is the ultimate luxury.

101
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.481
I come once a month.

102
00:07:48.481 --> 00:07:50.881
What's that symbol?

103
00:07:50.881 --> 00:07:52.081
Oh, this?

104
00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:53.081
"Masked Comet Byun"

105
00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:55.681
It's the symbol of Masked Comet Byun.

106
00:07:57.881 --> 00:07:59.581
The TV hero?

107
00:07:59.581 --> 00:08:02.981
The show aired seven years ago.

108
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:06.281
It's about a hero who fights to protect the Earth

109
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:08.781
from the Hell Comet's Demon King Dyark

110
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:12.381
and his quest for world domination.

111
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:18.681
Byun himself was once a henchman of the Hell Comet,

112
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:22.081
but he's touched by the kindness of an Earthling girl,

113
00:08:22.081 --> 00:08:26.081
reforms his ways, and becomes the defender of the Earth.

114
00:08:27.781 --> 00:08:29.781
I remember now.

115
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:34.781
But wasn't the show canceled?

116
00:08:34.781 --> 00:08:38.381
Yeah, just when the story was reaching its climax.

117
00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:40.581
Of course, it was canceled.

118
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:42.081
Its ratings were terrible.

119
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:46.281
Ratings have nothing to do with the quality of the show.

120
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:49.581
It was pretty cool.

121
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.981
Miona!

122
00:09:02.981 --> 00:09:05.781
Calm down. Deep breaths.

123
00:09:05.781 --> 00:09:07.181
Is everything all right?

124
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:09.581
Sorry about that.

125
00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:19.981
Oh, right.

126
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.881
We should start getting dinner ready.

127
00:09:22.881 --> 00:09:25.781
Dinner starts at six.

128
00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:28.981
You're free to do what you want until then.

129
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:31.381
Maybe I'll go for a walk.

130
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:33.681
-Care to join me? -Sure.

131
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:35.581
Miona, why don't you come with us?

132
00:09:39.881 --> 00:09:41.081
Okay.

133
00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:43.981
In that case, I'll show you around.

134
00:09:43.981 --> 00:09:45.281
What about you, Dad?

135
00:09:45.281 --> 00:09:47.781
I'll be sleeping in our room until dinner.

136
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:49.481
I'll pass, too.

137
00:09:49.481 --> 00:09:52.681
I'm going to read my book.

138
00:09:54.281 --> 00:09:58.081
I need to call my manager,

139
00:09:58.081 --> 00:09:59.981
so I'll join you another time.

140
00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:01.681
Too bad.

141
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:03.281
Then the four of us will go.

142
00:10:03.281 --> 00:10:04.581
Okay.

143
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:11.881
Did you drop this, Shirogane?

144
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:17.681
Thanks, kid.

145
00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:19.581
You're welcome.

146
00:10:24.981 --> 00:10:28.881
Otaro bought a new car.

147
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:31.381
First, he bought a light truck, then a sedan.

148
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.481
I can't believe he has three cars.

149
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:35.781
Famous people really do live in a different world.

150
00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:49.481
Muramatsu.

151
00:10:49.481 --> 00:10:51.781
He seems to have drowned after all.

152
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:54.281
He had nothing identifying on his person.

153
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:59.181
This is from that incident.

154
00:11:08.648 --> 00:11:13.248
Please enjoy this pre-dinner fruit beer.

155
00:11:13.248 --> 00:11:14.948
Fruit?

156
00:11:14.948 --> 00:11:20.048
In Belgium, they've been making beer with fruit for ages.

157
00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:24.848
Like cherries and raspberries.

158
00:11:24.848 --> 00:11:27.048
What a pleasant aroma.

159
00:11:27.048 --> 00:11:29.148
Is this citron?

160
00:11:29.148 --> 00:11:31.548
That's right. This beer lets you enjoy

161
00:11:31.548 --> 00:11:35.548
the uniquely refreshing smell and taste of citron.

162
00:11:38.048 --> 00:11:42.448
Let's toast to our meeting today.

163
00:11:42.448 --> 00:11:44.348
Cheers...

164
00:11:44.348 --> 00:11:45.748
Cheers.

165
00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:54.748
The combination of sweet and sour flavors is interesting.

166
00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:57.948
Next is a pilsner.

167
00:11:59.148 --> 00:12:03.048
Pilsners are well known in Japan.

168
00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:07.248
They have a good balance of flavor, bitterness, and aroma.

169
00:12:08.448 --> 00:12:10.548
This is an IPA.

170
00:12:15.348 --> 00:12:17.848
You can't get enough of this intense bitterness.

171
00:12:22.248 --> 00:12:23.948
This meat is delicious.

172
00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:27.148
Next, we have a porter.

173
00:12:31.148 --> 00:12:34.148
The fragrant aroma of roasted malt.

174
00:12:34.148 --> 00:12:37.348
The strong, bitter flavor of dark roast coffee

175
00:12:37.348 --> 00:12:40.748
compliments the flavor of the meat.

176
00:12:44.748 --> 00:12:49.048
For dessert, enjoy this slightly unusual beer.

177
00:12:53.948 --> 00:12:56.048
Is this beer?

178
00:13:00.348 --> 00:13:02.148
It's definitely beer.

179
00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:06.348
It's not too bitter and has a crisp flavor.

180
00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:07.748
You're right.

181
00:13:07.748 --> 00:13:12.348
Based on its color, I thought it'd be sweet like a Blue Hawaii.

182
00:13:12.348 --> 00:13:15.848
This beer is dyed blue with gardenias.

183
00:13:15.848 --> 00:13:18.348
It tastes so different from how it looks.

184
00:13:18.348 --> 00:13:20.148
It's confusing.

185
00:13:20.148 --> 00:13:22.648
I was completely deceived by its appearance.

186
00:13:31.148 --> 00:13:32.948
You lose.

187
00:13:37.548 --> 00:13:40.248
He was here this afternoon.

188
00:13:41.748 --> 00:13:43.848
Excuse me.

189
00:13:46.848 --> 00:13:48.348
The police?

190
00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:50.548
So he's a cop.

191
00:13:50.548 --> 00:13:55.548
Aren't you the detective Kogoro Mouri?

192
00:13:55.548 --> 00:13:59.248
Indeed. I am the great detective.

193
00:13:59.248 --> 00:14:02.648
Muramatsu, like I told you this afternoon,

194
00:14:02.648 --> 00:14:04.548
if you're here about that case...

195
00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:07.648
I'm not here about that.

196
00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:09.748
That case?

197
00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:12.048
Around five this afternoon,

198
00:14:12.048 --> 00:14:16.648
the body of a man was found in a lake seven kilometers east of here.

199
00:14:16.648 --> 00:14:19.348
What?

200
00:14:19.348 --> 00:14:21.248
We believe he drowned.

201
00:14:21.248 --> 00:14:24.748
We're currently considering all possibilities,

202
00:14:24.748 --> 00:14:27.548
including accidental death, suicide and murder.

203
00:14:27.548 --> 00:14:31.048
The river behind the lodge is connected to the lake,

204
00:14:31.048 --> 00:14:34.948
so we've been canvassing along the river.

205
00:14:37.548 --> 00:14:40.648
Do you recognize this man?

206
00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:41.748
That man...

207
00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:43.348
You know him?

208
00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:46.848
Didn't he stay with us about two months ago?

209
00:14:51.148 --> 00:14:52.748
"Shujiro Kitamoto"

210
00:14:52.748 --> 00:14:55.948
This is him. Shujiro Kitamoto.

211
00:14:55.948 --> 00:14:57.448
What?

212
00:14:57.448 --> 00:14:58.748
What did you say?

213
00:15:01.248 --> 00:15:02.648
Is something wrong?

214
00:15:02.648 --> 00:15:06.348
Huh? Aren't you Otaro Minakitaya?

215
00:15:06.348 --> 00:15:08.248
This is Kyujiro.

216
00:15:08.248 --> 00:15:10.748
-What? -Your old partner?

217
00:15:10.748 --> 00:15:15.048
Yes. He's changed a lot,

218
00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:18.348
but Shujiro Kitamoto is his real name.

219
00:15:18.348 --> 00:15:21.548
When did you last see him?

220
00:15:21.548 --> 00:15:25.848
Three years ago, when we dissolved our duo.

221
00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:29.048
Rumor is he's an entertainment reporter now.

222
00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:31.148
An entertainment reporter?

223
00:15:31.148 --> 00:15:34.948
Come to think of it, he did ask a lot of questions about you.

224
00:15:35.848 --> 00:15:38.448
He doesn't have a very good reputation.

225
00:15:38.448 --> 00:15:39.648
They say he'll even

226
00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:41.848
engage in criminal activity to get information.

227
00:15:41.848 --> 00:15:44.148
He's also drowning in debt

228
00:15:44.148 --> 00:15:46.448
and has some aggressive debt collectors after him.

229
00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:50.748
Maybe he was looking to report a scandal on you.

230
00:15:52.148 --> 00:15:54.448
Kyujiro...

231
00:15:54.448 --> 00:15:59.048
The estimated time of death is between noon and 1 pm today.

232
00:15:59.048 --> 00:16:01.148
Where were you around that time?

233
00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:04.848
I was recording at a studio in the city until 12:30 pm.

234
00:16:04.848 --> 00:16:07.948
After that, I drove here.

235
00:16:07.948 --> 00:16:11.148
It took about two hours from the city.

236
00:16:12.348 --> 00:16:17.648
Noon to one is when we were on the train.

237
00:16:17.648 --> 00:16:19.048
What about you?

238
00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:23.048
We were getting ready for our guests here.

239
00:16:23.048 --> 00:16:24.248
Yes.

240
00:16:24.248 --> 00:16:26.248
What about the rest of you?

241
00:16:26.248 --> 00:16:28.548
We have nothing to do with this.

242
00:16:28.548 --> 00:16:30.548
We'd just like to know for reference.

243
00:16:32.548 --> 00:16:34.948
I was on the train.

244
00:16:34.948 --> 00:16:37.348
The same train as Mouri.

245
00:16:37.348 --> 00:16:39.648
I was on the bus.

246
00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:41.448
I took the 12 o'clock bus from Tatsukawa Station

247
00:16:41.448 --> 00:16:45.048
and arrived at Nishiokuho Station at 1:50 pm.

248
00:16:45.048 --> 00:16:47.848
I took the train an hour earlier

249
00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:50.448
and was walking around the station.

250
00:16:50.448 --> 00:16:54.448
Could you please identify yourselves?

251
00:16:55.748 --> 00:16:57.348
Toru Shirogane.

252
00:16:57.348 --> 00:16:59.248
I'm a writer for a local magazine.

253
00:16:59.248 --> 00:17:02.448
Masanari Ide. I'm a web designer.

254
00:17:02.448 --> 00:17:04.148
Hiroko Fujiyoshi.

255
00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:06.348
I'm an office worker for a stationery company.

256
00:17:06.348 --> 00:17:08.248
Do you recognize this?

257
00:17:09.548 --> 00:17:11.348
Masked Comet Byun!

258
00:17:16.248 --> 00:17:19.848
Was Kyujiro interested in this kind of thing?

259
00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:21.048
I'm not sure.

260
00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:23.648
Miona, are you okay?

261
00:17:23.648 --> 00:17:25.248
Miona!

262
00:17:25.248 --> 00:17:29.148
Miona didn't seem well

263
00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:31.148
the last time the Masked Comet was mentioned either.

264
00:17:31.148 --> 00:17:32.448
It's nothing.

265
00:17:33.548 --> 00:17:34.748
It's nothing.

266
00:17:35.848 --> 00:17:37.448
Come to think of it,

267
00:17:37.448 --> 00:17:41.348
there was a robbery and murder in Haido City a long time ago.

268
00:17:41.348 --> 00:17:43.248
A financial company employee was murdered,

269
00:17:43.248 --> 00:17:45.148
and a large amount of money was stolen.

270
00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.848
The culprits were wearing Masked Comet Byun

271
00:17:47.848 --> 00:17:51.448
and Demon King Dyark masks.

272
00:17:51.448 --> 00:17:53.448
I think that was seven years ago.

273
00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:55.148
"Robbery and Murder In Haido City"

274
00:17:55.148 --> 00:17:56.248
Come to think of it,

275
00:17:56.248 --> 00:17:59.948
there was a young girl who witnessed the crime.

276
00:17:59.948 --> 00:18:01.548
A witness?

277
00:18:03.848 --> 00:18:05.148
Miona!

278
00:18:07.948 --> 00:18:10.448
Miona, calm down.

279
00:18:10.448 --> 00:18:12.648
She can lie down in the guestroom in the back.

280
00:18:23.948 --> 00:18:26.648
Ide, why would you do that?

281
00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:28.948
Gosh.

282
00:18:56.748 --> 00:18:59.948
"Robbery and Murder In Haido City"

283
00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:13.848
Who could it be at this hour?

284
00:19:17.148 --> 00:19:19.448
Fujiyoshi?

285
00:19:19.448 --> 00:19:21.448
"Nishiokuho Police Station"

286
00:19:21.448 --> 00:19:23.648
It's an emergency, Muramatsu!

287
00:19:23.648 --> 00:19:24.948
What's wrong?

288
00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:28.348
The water found in the body's lungs wasn't lake water.

289
00:19:28.348 --> 00:19:30.048
It was ordinary tap water.

290
00:19:30.048 --> 00:19:32.648
What? Which means...

291
00:19:32.648 --> 00:19:33.948
Yes.

292
00:19:33.948 --> 00:19:36.948
If the victim was murdered elsewhere

293
00:19:36.948 --> 00:19:42.148
and brought to the lake by car to be dumped...

294
00:19:42.148 --> 00:19:45.748
Then Otaro Minakitaya could've done it.

295
00:19:47.648 --> 00:19:51.148
Who would do this?

296
00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:53.948
I was thirsty and came down to get something to drink

297
00:19:53.948 --> 00:19:55.248
when I found this.

298
00:19:55.248 --> 00:19:56.448
Dad.

299
00:19:56.448 --> 00:19:58.248
Otaro's not answering.

300
00:19:58.248 --> 00:19:59.948
His door's locked.

301
00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:00.948
What?

302
00:20:00.948 --> 00:20:02.348
What was that?

303
00:20:03.648 --> 00:20:06.648
Otaro, are you all right?

304
00:20:06.648 --> 00:20:08.348
Please respond!

305
00:20:08.348 --> 00:20:09.848
Otaro!

306
00:20:09.848 --> 00:20:12.248
Mouri, here's the spare key.

307
00:20:12.248 --> 00:20:13.548
Thank you.

308
00:20:18.148 --> 00:20:19.748
It's not opening.

309
00:20:19.748 --> 00:20:22.048
Maybe it's bolted shut.

310
00:20:22.048 --> 00:20:24.448
What if he's collapsed inside?

311
00:20:24.448 --> 00:20:26.448
Dad, let me.

312
00:20:38.748 --> 00:20:40.148
Otaro!

313
00:20:42.648 --> 00:20:45.148
It's no use. He's dead.

314
00:20:45.148 --> 00:20:46.548
What?

315
00:20:46.548 --> 00:20:47.948
He's still warm.

316
00:20:47.948 --> 00:20:51.448
It hasn't been long since he died.

317
00:20:51.448 --> 00:20:55.248
Looks like the door was locked and bolted.

318
00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:59.848
The window's locked, too.

319
00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:17.348
Pops!

320
00:21:17.348 --> 00:21:19.648
There's blood over here.

321
00:21:19.648 --> 00:21:21.348
What?

322
00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:24.948
That's a bloody fingerprint, isn't it?

323
00:21:24.948 --> 00:21:26.648
Is it Otaro's?

324
00:21:33.148 --> 00:21:35.348
There's something drawn over there.

325
00:21:38.148 --> 00:21:40.848
The symbol of the Masked Comet!

326
00:21:43.648 --> 00:21:46.048
Is it a dying message?

327
00:21:46.048 --> 00:21:48.748
So it's murder?

328
00:21:48.748 --> 00:21:51.448
And the Masked Comet did it?

329
00:21:51.448 --> 00:21:53.148
Calm down.

330
00:21:53.148 --> 00:21:57.148
It's possible he was drunk, fell, and hit his head.

331
00:21:57.848 --> 00:21:59.648
The Masked Comet's here...

332
00:21:59.648 --> 00:22:00.848
What?

333
00:22:00.848 --> 00:22:04.348
I promise I forgot everything.

334
00:22:04.348 --> 00:22:05.648
I forgot...

335
00:22:06.448 --> 00:22:07.548
Miona?

336
00:22:07.548 --> 00:22:10.448
No!

337
00:22:14.148 --> 00:22:17.548
Miona!

338
00:22:17.548 --> 00:22:19.248
Are you okay?

339
00:22:19.248 --> 00:22:22.348
-Hang in there, Miona! -Let's get her to her room!

340
00:22:22.348 --> 00:22:23.348
Okay.

"Next Episode" -The water found in Kyujiro's lungs

342
00:23:58.448 --> 00:24:00.748
was ordinary tap water.

00:24:00.748 --> 00:24:02.248
What?

344
00:24:03.448 --> 00:24:04.748
Could it be...

345
00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:08.048
It matched Otaro's fingerprints.

346
00:24:08.048 --> 00:24:11.448
If you're such a great detective, solve the case!

347
00:24:11.448 --> 00:24:17.448
The door was definitely locked and bolted.

348
00:24:17.448 --> 00:24:18.448
On top of that...

Beer and a locked room.

The culprit vanished like bubbles.

355
00:24:31.891 --> 00:24:33.791
How careless.
