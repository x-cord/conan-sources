1
00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.524
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:04.324
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04.324 --> 00:00:05.924
A surprising island secret.

4
00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.124
The battle of deduction ends in a twist.

5
00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:09.624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:11.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:13.324
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:01.911
A television program pitting the best detectives from the East and West

9
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.411
brings us along with Heiji Hattori here to Okinawa.

10
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:09.611
We accompany the filming crew to an uninhabited island

11
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:12.611
where an unidentified body and a mysterious message is found,

12
00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:16.511
Then a female member of the film crew, Yoshie Taira,

13
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.611
is murdered and a mysterious message is found near her body

14
00:02:18.611 --> 00:02:20.511
"I'm the 'guso' messenger." (I Death's messenger)

15
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:22.311
then the boat we came on

16
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:25.011
and the captain disappeared.

17
00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:29.611
Having no other choice, we wait for someone to come to rescue us

18
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:31.611
at the village head's villa that is on the island.

19
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:36.911
What was that?

20
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:38.811
Maybe it's...

21
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:43.211
Yes, I knew it! It's the rescue boat!

22
00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:44.911
We're saved!

23
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:48.111
Something's wrong with that boat.

24
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:50.311
Yeah, there're no lights on

25
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.411
and it's not docked right.

26
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.911
"I'm the 'guso's messenger'." (I Death's messenger)

27
00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:10.911
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 3)"

28
00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:14.311
Hey. It's already 5 in the morning.

29
00:03:14.311 --> 00:03:16.611
No wonder I'm starved.

30
00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:19.311
I haven't eaten a thing for half a day.

31
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:22.711
Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.

32
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:26.811
Shall we go get something for you from the kitchen?

33
00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:29.911
There may be non-perishable food or canned juice.

34
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:31.411
I guess so.

35
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:38.411
Are they going to be okay, just those two girls?

36
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:40.011
They'll be fine.

37
00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:43.411
I hear they're pretty strong.

38
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:46.711
There we go!

39
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:48.411
Rice crackers and fried dough cookies!

40
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:52.611
But won't eating things like that make you even more thirsty?

41
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:54.511
But, it's better than not having anything to eat, isn't it?

42
00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:58.111
What was that sound?

43
00:03:58.111 --> 00:03:59.411
I don't know.

44
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:01.511
It sounded like water dripping.

45
00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.511
Oh, no. It's coming this way.

46
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:12.511
You don't think it's...

47
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:16.511
The death's messenger?

48
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.011
What're you two doing?

49
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:26.411
What're you two holding knives with your mouth like that?

50
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.111
Heiji.

51
00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:33.411
We thought you were the death's messenger.

52
00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:35.811
You know, the one that Mr. Daito was telling us about.

53
00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:39.511
If you don't want it to suck your soul out hold a knife in your mouth.

54
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.311
But what's with you, Heiji?

55
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:43.011
How come you're all wet?

56
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:44.611
Oh, you mean this?

57
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:48.211
Heiji dove into the ocean after that.

58
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:52.311
Because he thought that if the killer threw our things away at the wharf,

59
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:55.111
his bag with his cell phone inside it

60
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:58.711
would be stuck on some coral around the area.

61
00:04:58.711 --> 00:05:00.911
And did you find your bag?

62
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.411
No. It seems to have drifted into the sea.

63
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:07.911
It's written "Kachan".

64
00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:11.711
While this one here is written "Chiyoni".

65
00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:19.211
Hey, maybe "Kachan" refers to the maid, Kako Matsumoto.

66
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.511
I see.

67
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:23.711
"KA" is taken from her first name.

68
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:24.911
If she's a maid, it's only natural

69
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:27.311
that she'd spend most of her time in the kitchen.

70
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:31.711
Then, what about this "chiyoni"?

71
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:33.811
Huh, there's a faded writing over here.

72
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:36.111
It seems "chiyoni" was written over

73
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:39.011
what was originally written here.

74
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.511
It's faded and hard to read.

75
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:42.211
But I think it's "weatherfish".

76
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:45.411
Which mean that the picture that was drawn

77
00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:49.211
on the door below "chiyoni" was weatherfish.

78
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:52.811
But, "chiyoni" and weatherfish have no connection whatsoever.

79
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.111
If the drawing under the word "kachan" is a crow means "karasu" in Japanese,

80
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:56.911
then they are more or less connected.

81
00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:59.411
Because when they crow, it sounds like they're saying "ka-ka".

82
00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:01.111
Karasu...

83
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.311
But, maybe that picture is just something that the girl drew by

84
00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:07.311
looking at the picture on the folding screen.

85
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.711
Then, that's a white heron?

86
00:06:10.711 --> 00:06:12.511
White heron?

87
00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:15.211
The director was saying a while ago

88
00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:18.711
that a white heron was drawn on the folding screen

89
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.911
that was stolen from the mayor 4 years ago.

90
00:06:20.911 --> 00:06:22.311
It seems to be of National Treasure class

91
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:23.811
and is said to be worth 2 billion.

92
00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:28.211
Bird, white hero, weatherfish.

93
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:31.411
With all these clues out in the open, nothing.

94
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:32.911
Tiger symbolizes Osaka.

95
00:06:32.911 --> 00:06:34.511
Eagle, Fukuoka.

96
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:36.311
And Carp Hiroshima.

97
00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:39.511
Sea bream and flatfish would be the Dragon King's Castle.

98
00:06:39.511 --> 00:06:41.511
The Dragon King's Castle?

99
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:42.811
That's it!

100
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.611
I think something's strange about Conan, after all.

101
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:52.611
Are you sure he's not lying about his age?

102
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:56.211
I don't think he is...

103
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.311
Kazuha, what did you just say?

104
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:01.411
I asked you what did you just say?

105
00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:05.311
Maybe he's lying?

106
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:08.811
-Heiji? -Conan?

107
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:15.511
The time now is 10 to 6 in the morning.

108
00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:19.411
More than 12 hours have passed since Ms. Taira's been found!

109
00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:22.611
If our deduction is correct, it should still be here.

110
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:25.111
Yeah, it should still be there.

111
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.411
It's nowhere.

112
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.611
Darn. I wonder if the killer got rid of it, after all!

113
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:38.611
No, we overlooked it.

114
00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:42.011
These little footprints of mine.

115
00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:46.711
Then, that's a trick, after all.

116
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:49.511
Yeah, we were completely deceived.

117
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.211
But, what're we going to do?

118
00:07:51.211 --> 00:07:53.911
We figured out the killer, but have no evidence.

119
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:56.811
If we got nothing, we just got to come up with something

120
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:00.311
by luring him out to this forest that the princess lies asleep in.

121
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:04.811
Yeah, although that princess may already be crying.

122
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:12.811
Heiji!

123
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:14.411
Conan!

124
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.411
Really, where are they anyway?

125
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:18.411
The nerve making us worry like this!

126
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:22.411
Oh, well. All is well since we found out.

127
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:24.311
Found out what?

128
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:25.311
Don't tell me...

129
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:29.311
Right, the trick that the killer used.

130
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:31.711
As well as the fact that the killer stayed near us all this time

131
00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:35.411
but was playing against us!

132
00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:40.111
What? You mean the killer is among us?

133
00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:43.411
Who is it? Tell us who? Quick!

134
00:08:43.411 --> 00:08:45.911
Not just yet.

135
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:51.811
We'll decide who it is after listening to what everybody has to say.

136
00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:54.111
First of all, Mr. Kume.

137
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:56.611
Let's start from you.

138
00:08:57.611 --> 00:09:01.611
It's going to be really short, so bear with me a while, okay?

139
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:08.111
Will the rest of you who are waiting decide the order in which

140
00:09:08.111 --> 00:09:09.611
you want to be asked.

141
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:20.111
Hey, what's taking them so long?

142
00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:22.811
They've already been in there for about 30 minutes.

143
00:09:22.811 --> 00:09:24.811
I'm sure they'll be coming out soon.

144
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:27.011
After all, he did say it was going to be really simple.

145
00:09:27.011 --> 00:09:29.611
Hey, hold it!

146
00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:32.011
Heiji?

147
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.311
Hey, what's up?

148
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:38.211
Nothing's up! He ran away!

149
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:42.111
Ran away? This means he's the killer, after all.

150
00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:45.311
It's because you made that sarcastic remark, Heiji.

151
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:47.011
You didn't have to say,

152
00:09:47.011 --> 00:09:49.911
"If I have to wait for you to talk, I'll turn into Taro Urashima".

153
00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:51.011
I didn't have a choice, did I?

154
00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:53.711
Since he refused to talk no matter what I asked him.

155
00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:57.211
Let's split up and find Mr. Kume.

156
00:09:57.211 --> 00:10:00.711
If he committed suicide going into the ocean, it wouldn't be right.

157
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:04.711
Hey, Kume!

158
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:06.211
Where are you?

159
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:08.811
Mr. Kume!

160
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:11.011
Hey!

161
00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:15.261
What the?

162
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:20.861
What're you surprised for? You're the one who told us

163
00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:23.961
that if we don't want our souls to be taken by the death,

164
00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:26.461
we should hold knives in our mouths.

165
00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:30.761
Isn't it, Mr. Daito?

166
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:36.461
Mr. Kume, the man you're after is still in the house.

167
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:40.261
He's fast asleep, though.

168
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:44.161
I borrowed his clothes to catch you.

169
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:46.261
To get you who killed Ms. Taira and the captain,

170
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:50.261
as well as wait for Mr. Kume, who you thought was coming!

171
00:11:50.261 --> 00:11:54.261
The three were the thieves who not only kidnapped Miyako,

172
00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:56.461
but also stole the folding screen,

173
00:11:56.461 --> 00:11:58.861
and on top of that killed the maid, right?

174
00:11:58.861 --> 00:12:01.861
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

175
00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:05.961
I was looking for Kume when I saw a suspicious silhouetted figure,

176
00:12:05.961 --> 00:12:09.461
so I tried to catch him, that's all.

177
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:14.461
Besides, I couldn't have killed Ms. Taira, right?

178
00:12:14.461 --> 00:12:17.861
The writing on the sand that was near that lady

179
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:21.761
was written right after the waves pulled away.

180
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:24.761
And you said it would've been impossible for me,

181
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:26.761
who was in the ship on the other side of the island to write it.

182
00:12:26.761 --> 00:12:28.861
That's true.

183
00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:31.361
Even if something is written on the sand before the tide pulls back,

184
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:32.761
it'll be washed away by the waves.

185
00:12:32.761 --> 00:12:35.361
Therefore, it'd be impossible to leave the writing on the sand.

186
00:12:35.361 --> 00:12:39.661
If it was really the waves that were pulling back then...

187
00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:43.161
Come off it.

188
00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:45.261
You saw it too, didn't you?

189
00:12:45.261 --> 00:12:50.661
The sand was wet up to about a meter above the lady's head.

190
00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:53.761
If the water was up there during high tide,

191
00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:56.061
no matter how you think of it, the tide was receding, wasn't it?

192
00:12:56.061 --> 00:13:00.861
That's we calculated wrong and were deceived.

193
00:13:00.861 --> 00:13:04.061
The waves actually don't come up that far,

194
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:05.761
but because the sand was wet,

195
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:06.861
we mistakenly thought that during high tide,

196
00:13:06.861 --> 00:13:09.461
the waves came all the way up there.

197
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:10.961
Right.

198
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:15.361
The time we found Ms. Taira was actually high tide.

199
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:18.461
If so, then it all fits just right, doesn't it?

200
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:20.561
If the tide is high, all you have to do

201
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:23.361
is write where the waves won't wash it away,

202
00:13:23.361 --> 00:13:26.861
then lie Ms. Taira right next to the writing.

203
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:30.861
Okay, then why don't we go look for the writing right now?

204
00:13:30.861 --> 00:13:33.161
Half a day has already passed since then.

205
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:35.661
If it was written where the waves wouldn't wash it away,

206
00:13:35.661 --> 00:13:38.161
the writing would still be there, wouldn't it?

207
00:13:38.161 --> 00:13:41.061
No, it was no longer there.

208
00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:45.561
You probably erased it the minute we left the site, anyway.

209
00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:46.961
Hey, hey.

210
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:49.261
But my footprints were still there.

211
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:54.361
When Heiji took the picture of my sandals and the writing.

212
00:13:54.361 --> 00:13:57.261
I was standing right next to him.

213
00:13:57.261 --> 00:14:00.661
But, my footprints were still there.

214
00:14:00.661 --> 00:14:05.561
Yeah, but kiddo, the sand was wet all over...

215
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:08.361
I couldn't have wet the sand that way even if I used a bucket.

216
00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:09.761
You didn't use a bucket.

217
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:12.061
You used the cruiser we came here on!

218
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.561
The waves that the cruiser created

219
00:14:15.561 --> 00:14:19.261
wet the shore more than during high tide.

220
00:14:19.261 --> 00:14:22.561
All you did was use it to your advantage.

221
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.061
You knew that the captain was going to go around the entire island

222
00:14:24.061 --> 00:14:26.461
looking for the stuff in question

223
00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:30.261
until it's time to leave.

224
00:14:30.261 --> 00:14:32.761
And just what is that stuff in question supposed to be?

225
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:34.661
What else?

226
00:14:34.661 --> 00:14:37.261
The anchor that I found.

227
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:38.661
He was looking for the "princess"

228
00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:41.461
that was supposed to be tied onto the anchor.

229
00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:42.861
"Princess"?

230
00:14:42.861 --> 00:14:45.561
It was on the writing on the pillar, wasn't it?

231
00:14:45.561 --> 00:14:49.061
The princess lies in A and not in B.

232
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:52.861
It's hard to understand what this means just as it is.

233
00:14:52.861 --> 00:14:54.661
But if you put together the folk tale of Taro Urashima

234
00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:57.261
and the fact that that this island is called Onikame Island,

235
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:00.261
then the puzzle fits...

236
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:02.661
The shell of the turtle.

237
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:06.061
Princess Oto lives in the Dragon King's Palace.

238
00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:07.261
In other words,

239
00:15:07.261 --> 00:15:10.061
the princess I's not in the sea, but on the shell of the turtle.

240
00:15:10.061 --> 00:15:14.361
That is, it is in the forest on this island,

241
00:15:14.361 --> 00:15:18.361
princess is a code name that the thieves called

242
00:15:19.261 --> 00:15:21.261
the thing that was sunk in the ocean,

243
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:24.061
but was washed up on this island during the typhoon that struck a year ago.

244
00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:27.361
This golden folding screen!

245
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.561
After they stole it, the thieves were at a loss

246
00:15:31.561 --> 00:15:33.561
where to hide the folding screen,

247
00:15:33.561 --> 00:15:37.361
so they put it in this air-tight case, tied it onto the boat,

248
00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:40.261
sunk it deep into this part of the ocean that nobody dives into

249
00:15:40.261 --> 00:15:43.061
with an anchor and decided to wait till things cooled off.

250
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:47.061
But, then a big typhoon hit a year ago.

251
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:50.061
And the boat was washed up to shore.

252
00:15:51.061 --> 00:15:53.861
Although it was okay that one of the members came to see how things were,

253
00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:55.061
but when the next typhoon hit,

254
00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:56.661
the boat that the thief came on was washed away,

255
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:58.861
leaving him behind on this island.

256
00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:01.761
That's why he left the writings

257
00:16:01.761 --> 00:16:02.961
to indicate the whereabouts of the folding screen

258
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.961
for his fellow thieves.

259
00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:09.661
And, since you figured out the meaning of the writing.

260
00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:14.361
You decided to take revenge on the thieves

261
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:16.161
after hearing about the TV program

262
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:20.361
"Renown Detectives of the East VS. Renown Detectives of the West".

263
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:23.461
Since the thieves didn't know where the folding screen was yet,

264
00:16:23.461 --> 00:16:25.261
you figured that there would be a high possibility

265
00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:28.061
that the members of the thieves would come mixed up as the filming crew.

266
00:16:28.061 --> 00:16:31.761
But, how would I be able to tell the thieves from the filming crew?

267
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:34.061
Taro Urashima.

268
00:16:34.061 --> 00:16:37.061
See, like you were saying!

269
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:40.261
You feel like you turned into Taro Urashima.

270
00:16:41.261 --> 00:16:44.661
You knew that the members of the band of thieves

271
00:16:44.661 --> 00:16:46.161
who sunk the folding screen into the ocean,

272
00:16:46.161 --> 00:16:48.161
would immediately figure out the meaning of the writings.

273
00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:50.561
That's why you killed Ms. Taira

274
00:16:50.561 --> 00:16:53.061
who came to look for it in the forest, right?

275
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:54.961
In the way that you tried to kill me a while ago.

276
00:16:55.961 --> 00:16:58.661
It sure is an interesting deduction,

277
00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:02.061
but, if that's the case, anybody could've committed the murder, right?

278
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:05.261
No, you're the one who committed the crime.

279
00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:07.061
Unlike the captain who was killed violently,

280
00:17:07.061 --> 00:17:10.361
Ms. Taira was treated as a corpse should be treated.

281
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:14.161
That's evidence that the killer knew that.

282
00:17:14.161 --> 00:17:18.461
The true identity of Ms. Taira was actually the daughter of the Mayor,

283
00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:21.861
Miyako who was kidnapped 5 years ago!

284
00:17:21.861 --> 00:17:24.661
In other words, that kidnapping incident was made up

285
00:17:24.661 --> 00:17:29.261
and Miyako herself was also a member of the band of thieves!

286
00:17:29.261 --> 00:17:32.261
I realized that I figured out the meaning of why the thieves

287
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:35.761
called the folding screen "Hime" is Princess.

288
00:17:35.761 --> 00:17:39.561
And the meaning of "Chiyoni" and "Kachan" that were written

289
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:43.561
by Miyako when she was little

290
00:17:43.561 --> 00:17:47.761
and living in that house.

291
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:50.061
Folding screen was called "Hime"

292
00:17:50.061 --> 00:17:53.061
because the name was taken from the Shirasagi Castle.

293
00:17:53.061 --> 00:17:58.161
"Kachan" is the Karasu Castle, formally known as Miyamoto Castle.

294
00:17:58.161 --> 00:18:02.461
In other words, it stands for Ms. Kako Miyamoto the maid.

295
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:05.561
"Chiyoni" came from the Chiyoda Castle,

296
00:18:05.561 --> 00:18:07.361
which is also known as the Edo Castle.

297
00:18:07.361 --> 00:18:11.461
The Edo Castle is a large castle that is located in the East.

298
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:15.561
Isn't that right? You who served as a butler at the Mayor's house,

299
00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:17.061
Mr. Daito?

300
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:22.861
Although it seems that Miyako used to call you Mr. Dojo

301
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:26.161
with the "e" omitted in the beginning though.

302
00:18:28.061 --> 00:18:29.961
I found out that you were the butler,

303
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:33.861
when you didn't sit but stood by the doorway.

304
00:18:33.861 --> 00:18:38.261
You have a room but your chair is only in the kitchen.

305
00:18:38.261 --> 00:18:40.261
The time when you suddenly opened the dish cabinet

306
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:42.261
when looking for the ashtray.

307
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:48.861
It was as if you knew there was no ashtray in this house, to begin with.

308
00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:53.061
You're the one who prepared that tea cup

309
00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:55.561
with the cigarette butts inside it beforehand too,

310
00:18:55.561 --> 00:18:58.561
to make it look like the doings of multiple criminals, right?

311
00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:03.061
You probably thought you'd get away for now somehow,

312
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:05.961
and was thinking of killing Mr. Kume who you goofed trying to kill later,

313
00:19:05.961 --> 00:19:07.661
too bad you can't.

314
00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:11.061
Because the rope you're holding now and the rope marks

315
00:19:11.061 --> 00:19:13.661
around Miyako's neck are going to match completely.

316
00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:18.361
But, there's still one thing I can't figure out.

317
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:21.361
I can understand that you found out about Mr. Kume after he got flustered

318
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:24.561
when he saw the picture of Miyako who he thought had died.

319
00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:27.761
But how'd you figure that the captain was also one of them?

320
00:19:27.761 --> 00:19:29.661
If you didn't predict that the captain

321
00:19:29.661 --> 00:19:30.961
would make his rounds around this island,

322
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.461
this trick wouldn't have worked out.

323
00:19:33.561 --> 00:19:35.761
How could I ever forget?

324
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:38.961
He was the only one that I witnessed four years back

325
00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:42.161
at the time of the incident.

326
00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:45.461
The very one who killed the one who was to be my wife my cherished loved one.

327
00:19:45.461 --> 00:19:47.561
He is the hateful killer who killed her.

328
00:19:47.561 --> 00:19:50.361
Which means that the maid, Ms. Matsumoto was...

329
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:53.161
Yes, I was engaged to her,

330
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:56.861
I asked the master for a leave to avenge her death.

331
00:19:56.861 --> 00:19:59.861
I changed my outer appearance as well as my way of speech

332
00:19:59.861 --> 00:20:01.761
speech in order to pursue the thieves.

333
00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:04.761
But, I was shocked when I found out that Miyako was one of them.

334
00:20:05.761 --> 00:20:07.361
Which means you didn't know?

335
00:20:07.361 --> 00:20:11.461
No, because she looked so different.

336
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:15.961
Until she mumbled those few words.

337
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:18.461
I'm sorry, Chiyoni.

338
00:20:20.861 --> 00:20:24.161
I felt like I understood for the first time just before her death,

339
00:20:24.161 --> 00:20:25.461
about how she really felt.

340
00:20:27.261 --> 00:20:30.361
That kidnapping incident was made up because after her mother died,

341
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:34.961
she wanted to test her step-father's love for her.

342
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:39.361
But, when Kaneshiro rejected to pay the ransom,

343
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:41.361
she decided to steal what Kaneshiro cherished,

344
00:20:41.361 --> 00:20:44.161
and it was the folding screen.

345
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:46.761
Miyako was actually Kaneshiro's wife's child

346
00:20:46.761 --> 00:20:48.061
from another marriage, after all.

347
00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:50.261
Yes, now that I think back.

348
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:52.461
It could be that Mr. Kaneshiro knew

349
00:20:52.461 --> 00:20:56.061
that Miyako was somehow involved in the incident.

350
00:20:56.061 --> 00:20:59.261
Because when he gave me time off, this is what he said...

351
00:21:00.261 --> 00:21:03.361
All this happened probably because of me.

352
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:08.361
So, hate me and forget about pursuing the incident, will you?

353
00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:13.161
I think that this incident was just as the master said,

354
00:21:13.161 --> 00:21:16.961
a box that shouldn't have been opened.

355
00:21:20.161 --> 00:21:23.461
As if to speak on his behalf,

356
00:21:23.461 --> 00:21:26.861
the golden folding screen was watching sadly over him.

357
00:21:28.461 --> 00:21:30.661
Because the folding screen was suddenly exposed to air

358
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:33.161
after being sealed for so long and oxidized,

359
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:36.661
the paint began to run and fade,

360
00:21:36.661 --> 00:21:38.061
resembling tears falling.

361
00:23:07.861 --> 00:23:09.161
What?

362
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:12.261
The case has been solved?

363
00:23:12.261 --> 00:23:13.961
Are you serious?

364
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:18.561
Yeah, while you were drinking and fell asleep feeling good.

365
00:23:18.561 --> 00:23:22.061
Then what about my TV appearance? My pay?

366
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:23.361
How should I know, darn dude?

367
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:25.861
Then you make something happen!

368
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:28.961
Eat and run or anything you like.

369
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:31.261
Go on, do it!

370
00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:32.761
Hey...

371
00:23:32.761 --> 00:23:36.261
Oh, that's for me!

372
00:23:41.561 --> 00:23:46.161
Detective Mouri is stretching over for his 12th bowl!

373
00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:53.861
Renown detectives big eater contest.

374
00:23:53.861 --> 00:23:56.961
Is this what you guys came to Okinawa to do?

375
00:23:56.961 --> 00:23:59.461
Well, sort of...

376
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:02.661
Give me a break.

377
00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:08.961
"Next Episode" -What shall I do? I've got to get somebody, quick.

378
00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:14.161
Cell phone, cell phone. Where's my cell phone?

379
00:24:20.161 --> 00:24:22.161
Ran disappeared?

380
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:25.061
Hey, answer me! Ran!

381
00:24:27.961 --> 00:24:29.261
The line's cut.

382
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:31.661
Next Conan,

383
00:24:31.661 --> 00:24:35.761
"Smash of Love and Resolve (Part 1)"

384
00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:38.929
Next Conan's Hint:

385
00:24:38.929 --> 00:24:40.829
"Mail"
