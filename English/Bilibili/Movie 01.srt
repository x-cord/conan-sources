1
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,260
(Kurokawa Household)

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,600
As Mr. Kurokawa was typing away, drinking wine as he did,

3
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,900
he was hit over the head from behind.

4
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,060
The murder weapon should be the statue next to him.

5
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,900
There's still one thing we are not clear of.

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,520
This seems to be the dying message left by the victim.

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,840
However, what does "JUN" refer to?

8
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,580
That must indicate the murderer's identity.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,560
What did you say?

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,200
Also, the murderer is one of the three of them in this very room!

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,860
Ooh, Mr. Mouri did a great job this time!

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,710
His wife, Mrs. Mina Kurokawa,

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,550
his eldest son, Mr. Daisuke Kurokawa

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,780
and the housemaid, Miss. Manami Nakazawa.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,190
Brilliant, Mouri.

16
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,170
So who's the murderer?

17
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,340
The one who killed Mr. Kurokawa is you,

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,860
M-Mrs. Kurokawa!

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,160
The three letters "JUN" which Kurokawa left behind

20
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,140
are the first three letters of the month "JUNE".

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,410
Because June is a dry month,

22
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,960
people call it "No-water month", or "Minazuki",

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,020
which refers to Mina!

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,580
Also, you...

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,120
So what if I was born in June, it doesn't mean anything!

26
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,170
What makes you say that this "Minazuki" means "Mina"?

27
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,150
Are you going to try to pin this on me with this absurd theory?

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,000
No, this is just the deduction I made based on logic.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,410
Why would a dying person do something like that?

30
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,680
If it was me, I'd type the murderer's name outright.

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,410
Inspector Megure, how could you team up against me too?

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,330
Mr. Mouri is at his limit now.

33
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,400
It's my turn.

34
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,240
Is framing an innocent person the job of a detective?

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,910
As usual I'll just use this stun-gun wrist-watch

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,350
- to put Mr. Mouri to sleep.
- If you keep spouting such nonsense, I'll sue you for libel!

37
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,410
Ouch, not this again!

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,230
Here it is, I was waiting for this moment!

39
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,430
That's right.

40
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:18,270
I was only joking when I named Mrs. Kurokawa the murderer.

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,780
Joking?

42
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,740
Inspector Megure,

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,470
please take a closer look at the body.

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,750
Only the little finger of Mr. Kurokawa's right hand

45
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,520
was stained with blood.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,370
Indeed.

47
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,400
And which keys have bloodstains on their surface?

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,200
KE MU and RO, as well as the Caps Lock key.

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,030
The keys KE MU and RO were stained with blood when Kurokawa

50
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,530
used the index finger of his right hand
to press the three letters "JUN".

51
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,520
But it's impossible for him to use the little finger
of his right hand to press on the key on the left.

52
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,630
So, why there are bloodstains on the key
on the left side of the keyboard?

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:06,470
I think it's because when Mr. Kurokawa
was hit over the head by the murderer

54
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,640
he touched the back of his head with his right hand.

55
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,220
That was when he got blood on his little finger.

56
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,390
And when he turned around, he was hit again.

57
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,880
As he fell, he hit the keyboard
with his little finger and it fell to the floor.

58
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,640
Which means,

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,190
Mr. Kurokawa didn't press on the Caps Lock key on purpose

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,620
but in fact only accidentally touched it

61
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,060
when he fell.

62
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,710
Mr. Kurokawa waited for the murderer to leave

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,850
and then while he still held onto consciousness,

64
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,510
he used the last of his strength
to spell out the killer's name on the keyboard.

65
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,050
But he wanted to use hiragana to do so!

66
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,410
So, the hiragana you get for typing "J-U-N" without the Caps Lock on is

67
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,560
Ma

68
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,360
Na

69
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,290
Mi

70
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,390
Yes.

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,020
The murderer is the housemaid, Manami Nakazawa.

72
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,620
It's you.

73
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,220
You must be joking again, Mr. Detective.

74
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,610
You don't have any proof.

75
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,290
Of course I have.

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,270
You must have taken off your slippers when you committed the crime.

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,310
Because if you wore slippers,

78
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,890
you wouldn't be able to approach Mr. Kurokawa quietly from behind.

79
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,360
But you didn't notice that

80
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,980
you had stepped on the blood on the floor.

81
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,610
The unnatural shape of the bloodstain at Exhibit A proves that.

82
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,340
The bottom of your white sock

83
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,860
must be stained with blood.

84
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,850
When you gave your statements to the police,

85
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,080
you said you never got close to the body, right?

86
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,770
Can we check your sock now?

87
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,180
Kurokawa killed my husband one year ago.

88
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:05,620
So you are the wife of the patient
whom my father performed heart surgery on...

89
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,490
That's right.

90
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,450
The patient who died after surgery performed
by Kurokawa while he was drunk was my husband.

91
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,180
No one in this family recognized me
after I changed my haircut and my name.

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,090
So it seems that that such incidents mean nothing to you guys.

93
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,830
In order to sue Kurokawa,

94
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,760
I asked his colleagues to testify,

95
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,420
but no one was willing to help.

96
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,020
Because they were all afraid of Kurokawa.

97
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,470
So you killed him in order to avenge your husband.

98
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,500
Today is the first anniversary of my husband's death.

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,380
I don't regret a thing, not one bit.

100
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,170
Because I have already avenged him.

101
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,270
Let's go.

102
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,060
It seems that I helped Mr. Mouri make a great contribution again.

103
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,550
Detective Conan The Time-Bombed Skyscraper

104
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,240
I am Shinichi Kudo, a high school detective.

105
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,560
When I was at the theme park with my childhood friend Ran Mouri,

106
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,380
I witnessed an exchange inside a secret criminal syndicate.

107
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,280
At that time, I, eyes fixed only on the deal in process,

108
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,470
didn't notice that one member of their gang had snuck up behind me.

109
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,700
I was forced to take a kind of poison by that man.

110
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,490
When I woke up,

111
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,580
I found my body had shrunk to that of a child.

112
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,930
If they found out that Shinichi Kudo is still alive,

113
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,370
they would try to kill me

114
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,190
or even hurt my families and friends.

115
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,510
So I listened to Professor Agasa's advice

116
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,390
and hid my true identity.

117
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,230
When Ran asked about my name,

118
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,470
the name Conan Edogawa suddenly came to me.

119
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,700
In order to get more information about that Black Organization,

120
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,610
I moved into Ran's house, since her father is a detective.

121
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,570
However, Mr. Mouri isn't really much of a detective.

122
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,330
I can't watch his bungling deductions anymore, so I pretend to be him

123
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,020
and solve a lot of tricky cases using my natural deduction genius.

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,010
With my help, Mr. Mouri has become more and more famous as a detective.

125
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,400
And I

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,870
have become a primary school student.

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,370
What's more, I was obliged to join the Junior Detective Squad,

128
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,160
made up of Ayumi, Genta and Mitsuhiko who are all my classmates.

129
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,320
Next, please let me introduce the tools which Agasa invented for me.

130
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,410
First, it's the stun-gun wrist-watch.

131
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,070
After I aim at the target, I press on the button to shoot a tranquilizer dart

132
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,130
which can put people to sleep instantly.

133
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,790
Next is this voice-changing bowtie.

134
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,210
By turning the dial on the back,

135
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,470
I am able to imitate all kinds of voices that I've heard.

136
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,800
Next is my killer stuff, power-enhancing kicking shoes.

137
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,230
These shoes use electricity and magnetic fields
to stimulate my feet muscles,

138
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,550
allowing me to kick objects with tremendous power.

139
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,770
If I want to chase after a criminal,
I'll need this turbo-engine skateboard.

140
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,850
However, it will not work without solar power,

141
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,020
which is its only weakness.

142
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,170
That's right, I almost forgot.

143
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,290
My Detective Boys Badge has a tiny walkie talkie inside

144
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,900
which can also emit a signal. It's simply perfect.

145
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,960
I have a lot more tools too,

146
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,870
but my most powerful weapon is this.

147
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,960
My body may have shrunk, but my mind is still as sharp as ever.

148
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,820
I am the famous detective who can solve any case.

149
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,850
Only one truth will prevail!!

150
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,430
(Professor Hiroshi's House April 26th Saturday)

151
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,100
For the attention of Mr. Kudo.

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
To Mr. Kudo.

153
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,320
They were all sent to my father.

154
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,550
Maybe the letters are all from fans of detective fiction.

155
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,530
I heard that the Night Baron series your father wrote a while ago

156
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,590
made the bestseller list in America.

157
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,330
That's right.

158
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,260
But he's in Switzerland now.

159
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,850
It's really difficult to forward these fan letters to him,

160
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,590
since he's always traveling around the world.

161
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,860
Doesn't he give you the freedom to do as you like?

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,560
It's only fair you at least do something for him.

163
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,040
I know.

164
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,120
By the way, professor,

165
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,490
what are you making now?

166
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,410
Is it a new tool for me?

167
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,320
Sorry, it's not that kind of thing.

168
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,940
Humans created airplanes after they studied
how birds could fly in the sky,

169
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,700
but no one has created anything
using the mechanics of how insects flap their wings.

170
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,350
If I could be the first to apply those mechanics to toy manufacturing,

171
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,420
then children all over the world would be captivated.

172
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,100
Then, I'll be sure to earn a lot of money, even become a billionaire!

173
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,690
When do you think you'll ever achieve that dream?

174
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,510
I've been listening to the same thing since I was a child.

175
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,980
Anyway,

176
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,800
none of the letters were addressed to me.

177
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,080
Perhaps the world already forgot about me.

178
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,250
One for me!

179
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,530
Teiji Moriya?

180
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,990
That Teiji Moriya?

181
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,210
Sorry to have written this letter to you all of a sudden.

182
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,180
I've learned about the cases you solved

183
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,180
from the newspaper and on the television.

184
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,370
I've been hoping to talk to you in person.

185
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,460
At half past three on the afternoon of Tuesday, April 29th,

186
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:39,240
I'll have a tea party in my garden.

187
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,050
I hope you could come by at that time.

188
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,160
What is it? An invitation to a party?

189
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,060
Professor,

190
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,910
you know who Teiji Moriya is, right?

191
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,790
Of course I do.

192
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,050
He's the professor in charge of
the architecture department at Kyoto University.

193
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,530
And also one of the best architects in Japan.

194
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,600
Why does such a famous architect want to talk to me?

195
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,740
Architects are also considered artists.

196
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,340
Maybe he's looking for new inspiration.

197
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,630
Not to mention that Professor Moriya and I are both geniuses.

198
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,860
Geniuses?

199
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,710
A garden party?

200
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,460
Yes.

201
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,720
I happen to be dealing with a case right now and can't go.

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,080
You want me to go to the party in your stead?

203
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,100
It says on the invitation that I could bring someone with me.

204
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,930
Ran, you can go with your father
and the boy who lives in your house...

205
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,950
What's his name again?

206
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,280
Conan.

207
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,220
That's right. The three of you should go together.

208
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,700
I've already put the invitation in your mailbox.

209
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,950
You finally called me and that was all you have to say?

210
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,460
Fine, I'll do it – but on one condition.

211
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,400
One condition?

212
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,290
You have to go to see a midnight movie with me next Saturday.

213
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,290
What's that got to do with anything?

214
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,870
We haven't seen each other for so long.

215
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,730
I'll meet you at 10 p.m. in front of the hall of Beika City Building.

216
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,760
Wait, wait a minute.

217
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,440
I can't be there next Saturday.

218
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Can we make it another day-

219
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,150
No.

220
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,500
It has to be May 3rd.

221
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,600
Shinichi, do you prefer red or blue?

222
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,980
Red or blue?

223
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,090
Why did you suddenly ask that?

224
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,170
It's nothing, just answer the question.

225
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,940
Then red.

226
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,970
Red?

227
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,110
Is that so? As I expected.

228
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,860
I knew you would pick red.

229
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,990
Because red is your favorite color!

230
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,870
Is dinner still not ready?

231
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,660
Fine, I'll go prepare it.

232
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,260
That's all, Shinichi.

233
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,480
At 10 p.m. on 3rd. Don't forget.

234
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,000
Jeez.

235
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,920
If I could just casually go to a movie with you,

236
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,860
I wouldn't ask you to attend a garden party for me.

237
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,200
Speaking of which,

238
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,780
why does it have to be May 3rd?

239
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,040
Is there anything special about May 3rd?

240
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,140
May 4th is the day when

241
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,890
Holmes and Professor Moriarty both fell down the Reichenbach Falls.

242
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,550
Next, on May 5th, it's National Boys' Day.

243
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,230
Conan.

244
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,940
Are you going back home now?

245
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,870
Inspector, you got another case again?

246
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:07,720
Yes, we do have some more cases.

247
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,500
Let me introduce you two,

248
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,250
this is Officer Shiratori, who just transferred to our department.

249
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,410
I am Shiratori.

250
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,010
Inspector Megure told me a lot about you.

251
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,840
I heard you always noticed those things that others had ignored.

252
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,130
That's just by coincidence.

253
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,140
I guessed so too.

254
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,120
Coincidences happen all the time.

255
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,980
You are very blunt.

256
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,910
We have so many cases lately.

257
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,130
I guess I won't be able to enjoy my golden week vacation this year.

258
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,850
See you.

259
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,850
Golden week?

260
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,630
That's right.

261
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,120
May 3rd is Constitution Memorial Day.

262
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,640
So what?

263
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,720
Birthday?

264
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,080
That's right.

265
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,610
May 4th is Shinichi's birthday,

266
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,610
so I asked him to see a movie with me on May 3rd.

267
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,780
At midnight, I'll give him the red shirt I bought for him.

268
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,100
It's a surprise for him.

269
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,330
That's right. My birthday is on May 4th.

270
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,290
I can't believe I forgot that.

271
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,670
Then which movie are you two going to see?

272
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,780
The Legend of the Red Line.

273
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,430
Red... red line?

274
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Don't you know that legend?

275
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,000
When a boy and the girl who are destined to be together are born,

276
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,680
there is a red line which ties their little fingers together?

277
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,530
It's a romantic movie about this legend.

278
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,220
It's a click flick.

279
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,080
Check this,

280
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,550
Shinichi and I have the same lucky color in May, which is red.

281
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,210
That's why I decided to see that movie.

282
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,790
Even if you decided, it's no use.

283
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,910
There's no way we can see that movie together.

284
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,930
Wait.

285
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,550
Did you just say you would watch a midnight screening?

286
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,540
Yes.

287
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,690
No, no.

288
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,960
I'll never allow it.

289
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:53,500
Young couples just make out for the whole night in the cinema.

290
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,070
It's not what you think!

291
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,980
Don't talk nonsense!

292
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,720
Shinichi always forgets about his birthday,

293
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,880
so I have to remind him every year.

294
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,490
Otherwise he would grow another year older without even knowing it.

295
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,870
Actually, I just became younger.

296
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,550
Even so,

297
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,890
you two are just high school students.

298
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,700
By the way,

299
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,770
dad, let's go to Teiji Moriya's garden party together.

300
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,880
Why-why are you suddenly bringing that up?

301
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,910
Shinishi was invited to the party, but he couldn't go.

302
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,250
Conan, let's go together.

303
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,440
Okay.

304
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,620
How could I go there with an invitation sent to Shinichi?

305
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,200
Isn't Teiji Moriy that famous architect?

306
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,120
This is a historic meeting between
the famous detective and famous architect.

307
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,130
The famous detective and the famous architect.

308
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,900
He's so easy to fool.

309
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,820
(Moriya's House April 29th Tuesday)

310
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,330
Conan, wait.

311
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,070
You need an invitation to get in.

312
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,670
Please come in.

313
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,610
Thanks.

314
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,880
It's so grand!

315
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,450
This is the 17th century architectural style popular
during the British Stuart period.

316
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,540
Dad, I never know you know so much about architecture.

317
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,170
People used to call your dad the walking library.

318
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,660
Now look to the left and right carefully.

319
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,050
If we stand in the middle,
we'll find the views on the left and right identical,

320
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,690
both the garden and the buildings.

321
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,800
This is the so-called symmetrical structure.

322
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,640
Professor Moriya spent his childhood in Britain up until high school.

323
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,080
Therefore, he is fond of buildings in the British style...

324
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,010
In particular...

325
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,180
He has an obsession with classical style constructions.

326
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,440
So he brought a cheat sheet.

327
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,050
His name was "Joji" before,

328
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,470
but he changed to Teiji because the latter's hiragana is symmetrical.

329
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,030
That's just going too far.

330
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,070
This is the first time I saw such a beautiful garden.

331
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,440
I'm honored to receive your compliment.

332
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,860
Nice to meet you, I'm Teiji Moriya.

333
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,660
I-I'm Ran Mouri.

334
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,100
This is my father and Conan Edogawa.

335
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,700
Today, Shinichi, no,

336
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,050
Kudo couldn't come,

337
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,610
so we are here in his stead.

338
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,560
Really?

339
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
So Kudo couldn't be here.

340
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,720
But uncle is also a famous detective.

341
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,940
What do you mean by "also"?

342
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,660
I am Kogoro Mouri.

343
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,120
You are the famous...

344
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,320
It's an honor to meet you.

345
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,460
This way please.

346
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,600
The tea party will be held in the back garden.

347
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,100
The back garden is beautiful too.

348
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,620
Huh, a tea party held by a famous architect really is something.

349
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,380
The guests are all musicians, models,

350
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,980
entrepreneurs, critics,

351
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,230
and famous actors

352
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,070
who are always on television.

353
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,270
Please make yourself at home

354
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,570
and enjoy your afternoon.

355
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,570
So pretty.

356
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,730
Are they all hand-made?

357
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,060
But of course.

358
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,940
This is a formal tea party,
so it's only natural to treat my guests with hand-made snacks.

359
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,910
Please, help yourself.

360
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,090
I'll take a bite then.

361
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,200
How does it taste?

362
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,270
This biscuit tastes incredible.

363
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,160
I'm glad you like it.

364
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,640
All that time I spent paid off in the end, then.

365
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,540
Sir, I didn't know you were good at baking too.

366
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,360
I have to be, since I live alone.

367
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,600
All the snacks here,

368
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,800
the scones, sandwiches and biscuits were all made by myself.

369
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,080
I'm the kind of person who only trusts myself with such things.

370
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,710
I see.

371
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,370
These beautiful buildings must have come into
the world because of this spirit.

372
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,280
I can't call something without a sense of beauty "architecture"..

373
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,950
A lot of young architects today

374
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,530
have no acknowledgement of beauty.

375
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,800
They have to be more responsible to their works.

376
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,070
By the way, Mr. Mouri,

377
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,930
do you mind if I give you a riddle?

378
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,960
A riddle?

379
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,720
Yes.

380
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,920
Try to guess the computer passcode
of a company operated by three people.

381
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,700
The famous detective, Kogoro Mouri,
should be able to solve it right away.

382
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,970
So he is the famous Kogoro Mouri.

383
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,680
Of course.

384
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,270
Please tell us.

385
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,080
Are you sure?

386
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,700
Here is some information regarding the three people.

387
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,700
The passcode is a word which is related to the three of them,

388
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,970
and is comprised of a total of five hiragana.

389
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,320
Miss Ran, you should try it too.

390
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,810
The time limit is 3 minutes.

391
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,700
Everyone, please think about it together.

392
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,670
Then,

393
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,910
your time starts now.

394
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,260
There's no shared characters in their names.

395
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,670
And their birthdates and blood types are different too.

396
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,340
They even have different hobbies.

397
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,840
This is much more difficult than I thought.

398
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,260
What is it?

399
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,940
Do they have anything in common?

400
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,660
I might have to give up.

401
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,940
Let's wait for the expert to give us the answer.

402
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,230
Me too.

403
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,680
Is dad going to work it out?

404
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,130
Wait.

405
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,720
Their birth years are one year from each other.

406
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,230
I see.

407
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,410
It's Momotaro!

408
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
Mo-Momotaro?

409
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,330
It's their zodiac signs, Mr. Mouri.

410
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,140
They were born in the years of the monkey, rooster, and dog

411
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,950
which matches with the monkey, pheasant, and dog

412
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,910
companions from the legend of Momotaro.

413
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,770
Correct, little boy.

414
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,070
You are a brilliant one.

415
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,960
Sometimes I have to let Mr. Mouri embarrass himself.

416
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,300
As a prize for giving the correct answer,

417
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,730
I'll give you a tour of my gallery.

418
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,060
Ran, you can come too.

419
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,790
Okay.

420
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,770
Now, feel free to peruse the exhibition.

421
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,260
Ran, we saw this building last time!

422
00:21:58,670 --> 00:21:59,770
That's right.

423
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,600
This is Mr. Kurokawa's house.

424
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,180
Speaking of which, I heard Mr. Kurokawa was murdered.

425
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,100
I designed that house not long
after I became an independent architect.

426
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,110
The few works after that one
were all designed when I was around thirty.

427
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,280
The structures I designed when I was young are not mature enough.

428
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,950
Please don't look at those too long.

429
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,860
He even designed bridges before.

430
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,920
By the way, Ran, do you know Kudo well?

431
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,600
That's right. We grew up together

432
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,040
and went to the same high school.

433
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,030
But we haven't seen each other for a long while.

434
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,970
But Shinichi's, that is, his birthday will be on this Sunday.

435
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,710
So we are going to watch the movie together.

436
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,560
You must be looking forward to it.

437
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,410
I guess you must have bought the gift already.

438
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,340
No, I want to buy it on Saturday.

439
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,040
Because he likes red, same as me,

440
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,250
and because our lucky color in May is red too,

441
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,090
I'm planning to buy him a red shirt.

442
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,350
That sounds like a great gift.

443
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,440
I think Kudo will be very happy.

444
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,360
Yes.

445
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,740
Crap.

446
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,270
I completely forgot the whole birthday thing.

447
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,980
Isn't that Beika City Building?

448
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,250
Yes.

449
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,050
We are going to Beika No.1 Cinema to watch the movie.

450
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,550
We'll meet at around 10 p.m. in the hall.

451
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,300
I see.

452
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
That building is one of my finest works.

453
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,140
It's the perfect place for

454
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,800
young couples to celebrate birthdays.

455
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,280
What should I do?

456
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,070
(May 3rd Saturday)

457
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,250
You can order takeout for dinner.

458
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,000
It's still 10 hours away from 10 p.m.

459
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,630
This is nerve-wracking.

460
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,400
I'm leaving.

461
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,040
Why did I hide?

462
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,540
Why didn't you turn her down earlier?

463
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,290
I can't.

464
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,630
Whenever I saw Ran's happy face as she counted the days,

465
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,610
I couldn't bring myself to reject her.

466
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,090
Professor,

467
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,450
can you make a Shinichi robot for me?

468
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,680
That I can't help you with.

469
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,030
Even a genius can't do that.

470
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,440
All right.

471
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,980
A large quantity of HMX explosives in Toyo Powder Magazine
were stolen the day before yesterday.

472
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,190
Hundreds of police officers were sent out for the search operation.

473
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,220
But the suspect has yet to be found.

474
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,390
This is something serious.

475
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,600
Yes.

476
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,260
- Last night, a fire broke out at Mr. Kurokawa's house in Haidochyou,
- If someone mixes HMX with plastics,

477
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,850
- Last night, a fire broke out at Mr. Kurokawa's house in Haidochyou,
- they'd be able to make plastic explosives.

478
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,520
Last night, a fire broke out at Mr. Kurokawa's house in Haidochyou,

479
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,740
affecting lot of the houses in that neighborhood.

480
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,670
This is Mr. Kurokawa's house, where we went last time.

481
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,550
That's right. The house where the murder took place.

482
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,650
Anyway, arson is so common lately.

483
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,740
Judging from the same M.O.

484
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:55,100
the police deducted that they might be dealing with a serial arsonist.

485
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,490
Hello,

486
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,130
is Kudo there?

487
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,290
Please wait a minute.

488
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,230
Shinichi, it's for you.

489
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,330
How did he know that I was here?

490
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,790
What are you talking about?

491
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,770
Didn't we transfer all the calls to your family

492
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,790
to this place?

493
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,340
That's right.

494
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,410
Sorry.

495
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,760
Recently I seldom got calls asking for me,

496
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,350
so I completely forgot that.

497
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,470
This person seems to be using a voice changing device too,

498
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,680
he sounds weird.

499
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,670
Hello.

500
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,160
Shinichi Kudo?

501
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,060
Yes.

502
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,180
Did you watch the news?

503
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,040
I'm the one who stole the explosives from Toyo Powder Magazine.

504
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,600
What?

505
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,570
Tell me your cellphone number.

506
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,040
I don't feel th need to give my number to someone like you.

507
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,550
So, you want to cut off the only way to contact me?

508
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,380
Fine, my number is...

509
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,760
Great.

510
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,590
Now, I want you to go to Teimu Tsugawa Greenland Park with your phone.

511
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,240
I'll show you something interesting.

512
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,590
The Greenland Park.

513
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,400
Hurry up, or those kids will die.

514
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,060
What?!

515
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,520
Shinichi-

516
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,940
I have to go there.

517
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,790
Could it be a prank?

518
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,410
He even used a voice-changing device,
there's definitely something afoot here.

519
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,040
Professor, please call Inspector Megure for me now.

520
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,680
Okay, be careful.

521
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,770
I will.

522
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,080
(Teimu Tsugawa Greenland Park)

523
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,570
Mitsuhiko, it's my turn now.

524
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,920
I'd like to play too.

525
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,700
Just wait a few more minutes.

526
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,280
This is very hard.

527
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,430
It's not easy to control a drone.

528
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,620
Mitsuhiko.

529
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,210
What's with that drone?

530
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,270
Conan.

531
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,690
A man with a bear gave it to me.

532
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,780
He also said that this was a bomber.

533
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,350
A bomber?

534
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,470
Is that a bomb,

535
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,310
tied to that drone?

536
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,450
Mitsuhiko, give it to me.

537
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,050
Come on, I'll be the next.

538
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,380
Someone planted a bomb on it.

539
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,850
Idiot.

540
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,020
Damn it.

541
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,810
The antenna was broken.

542
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,590
Conan, the drone.

543
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,850
I can't control it anymore. Everybody, run.

544
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,800
You fool, don't run that way.

545
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,750
Conan, think!

546
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,450
Shoot!

547
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,580
Crap!

548
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,060
Go!

549
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,490
What's wrong?

550
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,860
Did something explode?

551
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,720
Is it a firework?

552
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,320
That remote control airplane just blew up!

553
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,550
Orange sparks...

554
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,010
That's plastic explsives.

555
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,470
What the hell do you want?

556
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,820
Why didn't Kudo come here?

557
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,730
Crap!

558
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,170
Did he think that a kid like you was enough to defeat me?

559
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,960
A kid like me?

560
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,960
So he's looking at me from somewhere.

561
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,430
Listen to me carefully.

562
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,080
There will be another bomb set off at one o'clock.

563
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,660
One o'clock?

564
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,440
The location is the square in front of Beika station.

565
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,200
Since Kudo didn't come, you should go find it.

566
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:40,920
Wait.

567
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,720
How could a kid like me find that with so little information?

568
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,520
Give me more hints.

569
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,140
Hello?

570
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Under the tree.

571
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,380
But it was not buried under the tree.

572
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,170
If you don't hurry, it might be taken away by someone else.

573
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,850
Damn it!

574
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,460
Conan.

575
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,860
Conan, where are you going?

576
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,490
There's still 10 minutes!

577
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,090
No, there's nothing.

578
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,440
Welcome.

579
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,530
What's the meaning of "under the tree"?

580
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,670
"it will be taken away." I don't understand that too.

581
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,020
Anyone with a good heart, please take it away.

582
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,250
So you are abandoned by your owner.

583
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,540
What a poor thing.

584
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,370
Don't worry.

585
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,520
I'll take you home now.

586
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,250
Under the tree.

587
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,730
The root.

588
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,640
Root (Nekko).

589
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,480
Cat (Neko).

590
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,140
Welcome.

591
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,640
Old lady, please wait a minute!

592
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,210
You moron, didn't you see the red light?!

593
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,540
S-sorry!

594
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,170
Crap!

595
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,250
There are only 5 minutes left.

596
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,240
Shoot.

597
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,640
4 minutes.

598
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,500
Great, the car got stuck.

599
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,410
What is happening here?

600
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,020
The sun is still there.

601
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,940
Right, it must've broken when I crashed earlier.

602
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,490
Kid, I need your bike!

603
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,790
Kid?

604
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,610
Do I look younger than him?

605
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,120
Oh no, the car's starting to move!

606
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,550
I only have 3 minutes.

607
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,070
Wait,

608
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,120
I remember there's a big curve to the left on this road.

609
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,010
Are you all right, boy?

610
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,060
Excuse me, lady, I need to borrow this cage.

611
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,610
25 seconds left.

612
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,780
Boy, did you get hurt?

613
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,260
Shoot!

614
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,730
I can't let it explode at this place.

615
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,430
What to do?

616
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,040
It stopped.

617
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,010
Okay.

618
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,620
I remember there's an empty bank behind the highway.

619
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,870
You are gonna leave this behind?

620
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,370
The clock started again!

621
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,280
I want this one!

622
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,270
Such a bright one!

623
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:06,960
Because the color of this shirt...

624
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,580
The boy who got wounded in order to stop the explosion

625
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,280
was sent to the police hospital to receive treatment.

626
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,100
Conan woke up.

627
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,030
Conan, are you all right?

628
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,360
This is...

629
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,430
This is the hospital.

630
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,340
Conan, what happened?

631
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,060
Don't get too emotional.

632
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,800
I need an explanation.

633
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,560
Questions can wait.

634
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,530
Let's call the doctor over.

635
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,540
- Conan.
- Okay.

636
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,740
Calm down.

637
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:00,660
Yes.

638
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,700
Don't worry.

639
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,360
The test result shows that

640
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,730
there's nothing wrong with his brain waves.

641
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,920
He'll be able to leave the hospital tomorrow.

642
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,060
Thank you very much.

643
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,540
Take care.

644
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,900
So, take care.

645
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,750
There's something I need to ask you, Conan.

646
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,150
Please tell me what happened.

647
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,680
I see.

648
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,170
So you rode a bike to bring the bomb away

649
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,000
in order to protect others from being blown up.

650
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,050
Inspector,

651
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,890
the criminal can call Shinichi's phone at any time.

652
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,780
But it's not allowed to use cellphones, is it?

653
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,650
You don't need to worry about that.

654
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,910
This building is separated from the hospital building there.

655
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,910
There's no electronic equipment to treat diseases here.

656
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,240
So we can use our cellphones here.

657
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,400
I transferred you here after I had heard what Professor Agasa said.

658
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,290
Great.

659
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,020
Also, I broke the bicycle.

660
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,730
Mr. Mouri, could you pay for it?

661
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,140
We'll talk about it later.

662
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,000
How could you be so reckless?

663
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,790
You almost died.

664
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,640
Sorry.

665
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,560
Besides, where did Shinichi go?

666
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,760
Wasn't the call for Shinichi?

667
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,710
Because Shinichi happened to have something else to do.

668
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,980
So, he asked Conan for help.

669
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,740
How could he do that?

670
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,730
Next time I won't be able to forgive him.

671
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,510
It's not like I can tell you I am Shinichi.

672
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,090
By the way, Inspector Megure,

673
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,200
did you know what type of bomb it was?

674
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,300
The bombs on the drone and in the cage

675
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,010
were both plastic explosives.

676
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,840
I knew it.

677
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,570
The orange light mixed with blue sparks

678
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,510
is telltale sign that plastic explosives were involved.

679
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,950
I'm afraid these bombs are being made
with the stolen materials from Toyo Powder Magazine.

680
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,120
The drone was planted with a bomb with a detonator.

681
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,760
And the bomb in the cage

682
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,010
was connected to a timer.

683
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:21,080
Why did the timer stop moving 16 seconds from the explosion?

684
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,260
About that.

685
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,540
It was probably because the timer suddenly malfunctioned,

686
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:32,200
or the criminal stopped the timer remotely for some reason.

687
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,970
Those are the only two possibilities that I could think of.

688
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,930
The criminal called Kudo particularly,

689
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,050
so he either wants to challenge Shinichi Kudo,
the high school detective,

690
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,960
or has a personal grudge against him.

691
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,490
According to our investigation,

692
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:51,990
all the criminals in cases solved by Shinichi Kudo

693
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,890
are in prison right now.

694
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,770
So it might be those criminals' families or loved ones.

695
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:03,870
Anyway, we already started looking according to the sketch they made.

696
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,360
Conan, it's this one. The sketch is very lifelike.

697
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,560
You did a great job.

698
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,130
We drew this together.

699
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,500
You've drawn all these features.

700
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,850
But I don't remember this guy at all.

701
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,180
The criminal used a voice-changing device,

702
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,240
so maybe it's someone I know.

703
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,090
Inspector,

704
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,910
which case that Shinichi solved

705
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,680
got the most publicity?

706
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,030
I think it should be

707
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,410
the case of the mayor of Nishitamashi.

708
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,040
A 25-year-old secretary living in Nishitamashi

709
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,840
was driven over by the mayor's son.

710
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,270
At first, we thought her death was merely an accident,

711
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,720
but Kudo found the case very suspicious.

712
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,730
A cigarette butt was found
at the crime scene next to the victim's body.

713
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,260
Your saliva was found on the surface.

714
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,270
You're the one who threw it, right?

715
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,730
Yes.

716
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,560
After I hit her,

717
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,350
I ran out of my car in panic.

718
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,540
I think I might have thrown it unconsciously at that time.

719
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
I see.

720
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,610
Judging from its length,

721
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,080
I think the accident happened not long after you lit the cigarette.

722
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,000
That's right.

723
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,620
The accident happened right after I lit it.

724
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,490
You used a lighter?

725
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,170
Yes.

726
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,210
What kind of lighter did you use?

727
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,700
The cigarette lighter on the car.

728
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,460
Then please sit back on the driver's seat

729
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,410
and show it to me again, OK?

730
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,070
You only need to repeat your movements.

731
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,420
But please fasten your seatbelt.

732
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,150
Okay.

733
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,850
Here.

734
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,690
Please use this box of cigarettes to demonstrate.

735
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,700
It's the same brand as

736
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,980
the one you dropped at the crime scene.

737
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,630
Stop.

738
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,660
That's right.

739
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,240
If you want to get the cigarette light from the driver's seat,

740
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,540
you have to reach out your left hand.

741
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,090
But only the fingerprints of your right hand
were found on this lighter.

742
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,360
Can you explain why is that, Mr. Kohei?

743
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,850
I think I used my own lighter.

744
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,760
No.

745
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,650
You left it at home when you came out,

746
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,040
and your father doesn't smoke.

747
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,220
That night, you used the cigarette lighter on the passenger seat.

748
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,260
Which means, you were sitting next to your father, who was driving.

749
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,210
You two wiped off your father's fingerprints
from all the other places.

750
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,440
Even the position of the seat and the angle
of the rearview mirror were adjusted.

751
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,590
But you missed the cigarette lighter.

752
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,460
Mayor Okamoto.

753
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,710
Kohei, my son,

754
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,000
he considered my position as the mayor

755
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,250
and decided to take the fall for me.

756
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,620
Actually, I'm the one who drove the car that day.

757
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,400
I am so sorry.

758
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,370
Father!

759
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,220
Because of that case,

760
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,170
Mayor Okamoto was ousted.

761
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,780
The new City Construction Project of Nishitamashi
which he initiated was also put on hold.

762
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,180
Inspector,

763
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,090
is it possible that Mayor Okamoto's son
has been holding a grudge because of that?

764
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:33,720
I remember that he's a student
in the electronic engineering department.

765
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,860
I'll look into it.

766
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,310
Apart from these,

767
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,920
do you have any other impressions about the criminal?

768
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,620
Anything you can think of.

769
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,550
Well...

770
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,160
The smell.

771
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,080
I smelled something very strong

772
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,590
when he handed the drone to Mitsuhiko.

773
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,920
Really?

774
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,220
Why didn't I smell that?

775
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,430
Me neither.

776
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,630
Could it be a fragrance from the cosmetics he used?

777
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,230
I don't know.

778
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,060
But it wasn't like perfume,

779
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,350
that fragrant smell.

780
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,150
I see.

781
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,320
If you remember any other clues,

782
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,140
just tell me right away.

783
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,130
Okay.

784
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,750
Now we should probably go home now.

785
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,720
Yeah.

786
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,970
Conan has gotten a lot better now.

787
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,880
If there's anything you need me to do, I'll come here right away.

788
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:34,840
Thanks.

789
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,640
Conan is so lucky.

790
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,330
I want to be hospitalized too.

791
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,640
I never realized you were so popular.

792
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,620
You're good with the girls, little boy.

793
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,800
You have no idea how I feel.

794
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,680
Then, we'll be leaving now.

795
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:50,890
See you, Conan.

796
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,780
Thank you.

797
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,160
By the way,

798
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,660
where did Kudo go at such a critical moment?

799
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,260
Wait, Conan!

800
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,920
Listen, if it's the criminal, just hand the phone to me.

801
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,180
Hello.

802
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,470
I can't believe you found the bomb.

803
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,580
You deserve a reward.

804
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,430
But playtime with the kid is over.

805
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,450
Tell Kudo to come.

806
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,630
That's right.

807
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,620
From now on, the adults will do the talking.

808
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,950
Who are you? Where is Kudo?

809
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,840
Kudo is not here.

810
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,250
I'll deal with you.

811
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,470
I am the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri.

812
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,290
Fine.

813
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,300
I'll say this just once. Listen carefully.

814
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,540
I planted 5 bombs on the Kyoto Circle Line.

815
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:45,670
Five...

816
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,020
bombs?!

817
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,280
From 4 p.m. today,

818
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,340
the bombs will explode if the train's speed drops lower than 60km/h.

819
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:03,630
Also, if the bombs are not removed before sunset,
they will explode anyway.

820
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,750
I'll only give you one hint:

821
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:12,850
The five bombs have been placed
in "X the XX" on the Kyoto Circle Line.

822
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,400
Each X represents a single character.

823
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,860
Good luck, Detective Mouri.

824
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:27,150
He-he's just bluffing, right?

825
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:29,390
How could he put bombs on the circle line?

826
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:31,530
No, he was dead serious.

827
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,520
The detonated explosive devices will be activated at 4 p.m.

828
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:39,410
Then, if the train's speed drops lower than 60 km/h,

829
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,040
the bombs will go off.

830
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,530
Anyway,

831
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,850
I have to contact the headquarters right away.

832
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,690
This is Megure.

833
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,930
I agree with Inspector Megure.

834
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:57,980
But,

835
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,110
what is the criminal's purpose?

836
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,850
Why is he doing this?

837
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,490
We made it!

838
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,110
We got super lucky today!

839
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,800
(Kyoto Railway Dispatching Station)

840
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,310
There are bombs on the circle line?

841
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,590
Yes, we just received an emergency notice
from the Metropolitan Police Department.

842
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:31,260
I see.

843
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,590
I'll stop all the trains and get those carriages inspected.

844
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:34,080
No!

845
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,760
We can't stop the train.

846
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:41,420
After 4 p.m., if the train's speed is lower than 60km/h,

847
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,920
the bombs will explode.

848
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,450
What?!

849
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,370
There are only three minutes left.

850
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,800
Make sure that all the trains on the circle line
remain at a speed of 60km/h.

851
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,180
No, make it 70 km/h.

852
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,260
What about the trains which are parked at the station?

853
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,740
Get them to leave the station now.

854
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,520
And the trains which are about to pull in?

855
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,560
Don't let them stop.

856
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,830
In a word, none of the trains can be
allowed stop before the bombs are found.

857
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,760
Hurry up!

858
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,850
Yes, sir.

859
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,760
Emergency announcement

860
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,030
Emergency announcement

861
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,490
Attention, all the trains,

862
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,590
an unidentified man has planted bombs on the circle line.

863
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,280
The bombs will explode if the train's speed falls under 60 km/h.

864
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:24,300
Please keep the train's speed at 70 km/h.

865
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,160
Repeat.

866
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,550
An unidentified man has planted bombs on the circle line.

867
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,580
The bombs will explode if the train's speed falls under 60 km/h.

868
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,620
Please keep the train's speed at 70 km/h.

869
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:36,710
Isn't this kind weird?

870
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,520
What's so weird about it, Genta?

871
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:43,200
We're about to arrive at Beika station,
but the train just started speeding up.

872
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,690
Passengers, may I have your attention please.

873
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,430
Due to an unexpected accident,

874
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,380
this train will not stop at Beika Station.

875
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,230
What does that mean, an unexpected accident?

876
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,990
The Kyoto Circle Line train which is supposed to stop at No.1 platform

877
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:02,530
will not stop at this station.

878
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,640
Is that so? I see.

879
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,390
None of the trains have exploded yet.

880
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,510
I've got it, Inspector Megure.

881
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,630
What did you figure out?

882
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,330
The "X the XX" that the criminal mentioned on the phone

883
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,720
must be Under the Train Seat.

884
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,100
or On the Overhead Shelf.

885
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,630
That's where the criminal put the bombs!

886
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,440
By that logic, Under the Train Carriage also makes sense.

887
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,960
Oh, that's right...

888
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,710
By the way, if Ayumi and the boys were going back to Beika Chou,

889
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,530
they be would taking the circle line
from the green station right about now.

890
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,270
Repeat.

891
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,200
This train will not stop at any station for the time being.

892
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,000
Plus, if you find anything suspicious on the train,

893
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,000
please don't touch it and instead inform the conductor at once.

894
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,430
Anything suspicious, what does that mean?

895
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,090
It means something weird.

896
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:05,040
Of course I know that. I mean, what could they be thinking we'd find?

897
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,080
That's-

898
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,400
Ayumi, are you there?

899
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,410
Conan, I'm here.

900
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:12,010
Where are you right now?

901
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:13,490
On the circle line.

902
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:16,540
So you really are there.

903
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:19,960
Conan, what is going on here?

904
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,630
Did someone plant a bomb on the train too?

905
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,380
Don't worry.

906
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,720
It's nothing like that.

907
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,730
So,

908
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,720
those bombs might not be put on the trains on the circle line!

909
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,000
Bombs?

910
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,760
I knew it!

911
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,000
So are we going to die?

912
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,250
You won't die!

913
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,250
I'll find the location of the bombs.

914
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,050
Conan...

915
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,100
Damn it!

916
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,350
How could we leave everything to Conan?

917
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,060
We have to do something too!

918
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,580
It's time for the Junior Detective Squad to take action!

919
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,480
Junior...

920
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,760
Detective Squad?

921
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,000
That's-that's right.

922
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,440
The bombs seemed to have been planted on the trains.

923
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,600
All right, go, Junior Detective Squad!

924
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,220
Alright!

925
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,540
You guys-!

926
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,790
Jeez, how could they cut off the phone lines?

927
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,910
Are they going to be all right?

928
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,680
Okay, I see.

929
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,790
There's a joint operation center formed at headquarters.

930
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,660
I need to go to Kyoto Railway Dispatching Station.

931
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,890
Are you going with me?

932
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,700
Right, absolutely.

933
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,630
It's already half past four.

934
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,050
Now, everyone, please take a look at

935
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,090
the Kyoto Circle Line beneath me.

936
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,390
For more than 30 minutes,
none of the trains have stopped at any station.

937
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,920
The explanation which

938
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,820
the Kyoto Railway and the Metropolitan Police Department have given

939
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:54,220
is that there has been an emergency.

940
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,620
The police couldn't hide the truth for more than 30 minutes.

941
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,590
I borrowed it from a nurse.

942
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,880
Let's watch it in the patient ward.

943
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:21,650
It is impossible to design a bomb

944
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,760
which will explode when its moves at a speed below 60 km/h.

945
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:29,750
But... how could they make a bomb that would explode

946
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:31,910
automatically after sunset?

947
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,940
Why would it explode specifically after the sunset?

948
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:39,660
Does it have something to do with the light in the train?

949
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:49,980
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

950
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,770
Please enjoy.

951
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,560
That shirt looks nice.

952
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,170
Ran, you look good in red too.

953
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,330
Thanks.

954
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,000
Shinichi's lucky color for this month is red, just like mine.

955
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,320
Speaking of which, I haven't seen Shinichi for a long time either.

956
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,680
Can I go with you?

957
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,480
But the movie we are going to watch is kind of boring.

958
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,390
And he's a boring guy too.

959
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,220
I'm just joking!

960
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:24,000
Why would I want to be a third wheel?

961
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,500
Don't take it so seriously.

962
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:28,000
I just like to make fun of you.

963
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,850
Come on, Sonoko.

964
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,060
Anyway, I'm surprised that your dad agreed
to let you watch a midnight movie with Shinichi.

965
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:36,070
He did object,

966
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,270
but I wouldn't listen to him anyway.

967
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:44,450
Perhaps he is arguing with Conan about what to eat tonight right now.

968
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,460
So,

969
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,820
nothing suspicious was found on any of the trains?

970
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,550
Yes.

971
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,810
There are 21 trains on the line now.

972
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We already asked the conductors to check every coach.

973
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,450
There's no package which doesn't have an owner.

974
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,110
So, how's everything going with you guys?

975
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,300
We checked the footage from the security cameras along the circle line.

976
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,910
But we didn't find anything which looks like a bomb under the train.

977
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,160
I see.

978
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,780
So where could the bombs be planted?

979
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:14,940
Bad news, minister.

980
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,870
There's an uproar on the trains.

981
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,870
What?

982
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,280
When is this train going to stop?

983
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,710
Stop the train!

984
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,810
My kid has been saying that he has a stomachache!

985
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,950
Please let us get off the train!

986
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,650
What is that suspicious object?

987
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,390
Did someone plant the bombs here?

988
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,610
B-bombs?

989
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,340
Are you kidding me? I'm getting off the train!

990
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,260
Stop what you're doing! It's too dangerous! Please calm down!

991
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,380
You'll be badly injured if you jump out!

992
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,720
Chief, the situation is out of control.

993
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,320
Please hold on a little longer.

994
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:48,930
Mouri, you still haven't figured out a way to find the bombs?

995
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,850
The sun will go down in one and a half hours.

996
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,480
The bombs will explode after sunset.

997
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,380
That's exactly the opposite of the skateboard I invented.

998
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:08,150
The skateboard is solar-powered,

999
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,460
so it can't be used after the sun goes down.

1000
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,530
Solar, the sun...

1001
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:16,290
I got it!

1002
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,430
I got it, professor!

1003
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:27,560
This is Megure.

1004
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:29,270
Inspector, this is Kudo.

1005
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,850
Kudo, I've been waiting for you to call.

1006
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,430
I've heard the whole story from Professor Hiroshi.

1007
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,140
The bombs were not set

1008
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,920
under the seats of the circle line trains or on the shelves.

1009
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,700
They are definitely not under the trains either.

1010
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,180
They were planted between the rail tracks.

1011
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,010
Between the rail tracks?

1012
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:53,110
If those bombs aren't exposed to the sun
for a certain period of time, they will explode.

1013
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:56,090
When the circle line train passes above the bombs,

1014
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,770
the sunlight will be blocked for a few seconds.

1015
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,680
The length of each coach is 20 meters,

1016
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,330
so the total length of 10 coaches should be 200 meters.

1017
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,460
If the train is going at a speed of 60 km/h,

1018
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,630
which is 16.7m/s,

1019
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,550
it will take 12 seconds for the train to travel 200 meters.

1020
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,500
So, if the train passes over them at a speed of 60 km/h,

1021
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:18,430
the timers on the bombs will be reset again.

1022
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:24,030
So please tell the drivers to drive the trains to other lines.

1023
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,320
As long as the trains leave the circle line and stop,

1024
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,850
there wouldn't be any explosion.

1025
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:28,900
I see.

1026
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,030
Minister Sakaguchi,

1027
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,640
you heard that, right?

1028
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,590
Three minutes later,
Train 11 will be transferred to the freight line of Shibahama Station.

1029
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,760
Now get ready.

1030
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:47,280
Train 11.

1031
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,280
Train 11.

1032
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,100
Please change tracks in 3 minutes.

1033
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,840
The line of Shibahama station is confirmed. Change tracks now.

1034
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:55,060
The freight train will be transferred
to the emergency evacuation track.

1035
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,210
Train 11 passed Kawashina station.

1036
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,510
Train 10 passed Shibahama station.

1037
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,860
Switch the track.

1038
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,370
Now, begin to slow down.

1039
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,230
68 km/h.

1040
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:22,600
66 km/h.

1041
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,020
64

1042
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,530
63 km

1043
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:26,880
62

1044
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,400
61

1045
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,950
60 km

1046
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,940
59

1047
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,170
58 km.

1048
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,600
Is anything unusual happening there?

1049
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,230
Sir, nothing's happening.

1050
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,330
Great.

1051
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,600
Now keep reducing the speed and stop at the next station.

1052
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:41,800
Yes.

1053
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,230
We did it.

1054
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:45,780
No, it's too early to celebrate.

1055
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,930
There are still 20 trains on the circle line now.

1056
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,890
Nothing abnormal on Train 9.

1057
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,690
Nothing abnormal on Train 20.

1058
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,780
There's only one train left.

1059
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,090
This is Train 10.

1060
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,780
We are moving at a speed of 55 km/h.

1061
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,310
Nothing unusual is happening.

1062
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,800
Perfect.

1063
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:43,050
Great, we did it.

1064
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:45,510
Our chief is truly outstanding.

1065
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,440
Thanks for your hard work, everyone.

1066
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,000
Now it's our turn.

1067
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,450
Great, we could finally get off the train.

1068
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,400
I'll never tire myself out trying to catch a train again.

1069
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,620
Really? That's great.

1070
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,080
Conan, are you the one who found the bombs?

1071
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,350
No,

1072
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,630
it was Shinichi.

1073
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,840
Actually,

1074
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,390
we still haven't found the bombs yet.

1075
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:22,480
They were set on the tracks before 4 p.m.

1076
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,110
at a place where the sunlight wouldn't be blocked
by the buildings or walls.

1077
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:28,400
Pay attention to the sun's position
when you are searching for the bombs,

1078
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,900
don't let your shadows cover the bombs.

1079
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,730
I need you to be very careful.

1080
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:47,040
Found it.

1081
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,570
Found it.

1082
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,930
Found it.

1083
00:57:58,830 --> 00:57:59,820
Found it.

1084
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:02,910
Found it.

1085
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,410
I see.

1086
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,140
The 5 bombs were all removed safely.

1087
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:09,790
Great.

1088
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,560
Perfect.

1089
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,480
It's exactly like Kudo deduced.

1090
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,100
The sun will go down in 15 minutes.

1091
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,230
Talk about a close call.

1092
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,480
It's too soon to relax.

1093
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,630
The quantity of the explosive load inside those bombs

1094
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,660
is only a quarter of the explosive materials

1095
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,830
which were stolen.

1096
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,080
It means that

1097
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:36,140
the criminal still has three quarters of the explosives
ready to put into play.

1098
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,070
Sorry I'm late.

1099
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,900
How's the investigation going?

1100
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:42,440
Yes.

1101
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,750
Mayor Okamoto's son, Kohei Okamoto

1102
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:50,310
flew to Izu this morning.

1103
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,030
So this has nothing to do with him.

1104
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,630
Yes.

1105
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:56,830
Well, about the bomb incident this time...

1106
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:57,980
It's been solved.

1107
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:00,510
We have to thank Kudo for this.

1108
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,980
Our next problems are the rest of the bombs and the criminal.

1109
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,440
What we know at this point is that

1110
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:08,580
the criminal's residence can't be somewhere

1111
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,330
near the places where the five bombs were planted.

1112
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,150
I think we can all agree with that, right?

1113
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,360
You don't think so?

1114
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:21,280
If the bombs explode, the whole train would be blown off the tracks.

1115
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,460
How could he plant the bombs near his home?

1116
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:25,670
At that time,

1117
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,560
did he stop the timer in the cage

1118
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:31,770
for the same reason?

1119
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:36,320
There's a children's park and an apartment near that place.

1120
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:37,580
That's right.

1121
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,800
The criminal must live in that apartment.

1122
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,120
Okay.

1123
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,630
Let's head to that apartment now.

1124
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,540
You found nothing.

1125
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,690
Yes.

1126
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,390
We searched not only that apartment

1127
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,930
but also all the places nearby.

1128
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,780
We found no-one who's relevant to the case.

1129
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,890
Is that so?

1130
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,400
Inspector.

1131
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,500
What kind of place were the bombs planted at on the circle line?

1132
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,820
What kind of place?

1133
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,730
I think it was the places near the residential area.

1134
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,430
Wait,

1135
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,700
one was set on the bridge

1136
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,890
above the Sumita Canal.

1137
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,220
The bridge?

1138
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:18,500
You mean that bridge?

1139
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,160
(Bombs on Kyoto Circle Line)

1140
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,830
Wait,

1141
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,870
I remember seeing this photo in Professor Moriya's gallery.

1142
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:34,710
Isn't that bridge designed by Professor Moriya?

1143
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,080
I think so.

1144
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,490
That's right.

1145
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,000
It was indeed designed by Teiji Moriya.

1146
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,820
That's bridge was fully constructed on the 58th year of Showa period.

1147
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,500
It was constructed with stones
like British bridges instead of the usual iron,

1148
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,360
which attracted widespread attention.

1149
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,750
Teiji Moriya won the Japanese Construction
Association's Best New Architect award

1150
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:56,850
for designing that bridge.

1151
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:59,460
You sure know a lot of things.

1152
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,590
That's because I'm interested in architecture.

1153
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,630
(Next is the news about the serial arson)

1154
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,830
(The Metropolitan Police Department...)

1155
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,160
Turn that off. We'll get distracted.

1156
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,100
Fine.

1157
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,430
I just remembered.

1158
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:17,220
Mr. Kurokawa's house which was set on fire a few days ago

1159
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,120
was also designed by Professor Moriya.

1160
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:25,580
I wonder who designed the houses which were

1161
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,570
burnt down by that serial arsonist.

1162
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:32,420
We might find something interesting

1163
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,370
if we look into it.

1164
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,300
I'll leave you here then.

1165
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,020
Thanks for your company for today.

1166
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,300
Don't forget to give me the details later.

1167
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:52,760
You should at least kiss him.

1168
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:06,850
It's 9 o'clock.

1169
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,160
There's only one hour left.

1170
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,060
What did you say?

1171
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,880
They were all designed by Professor Moriya.

1172
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:16,420
Yes.

1173
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,170
The houses which were burnt down, including

1174
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:20,790
Mr. Kurokawa's house,

1175
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,730
Mr. Mizushima's house, Mr. Yasuda's house, and Mr. Akutsu's house

1176
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:26,650
were all designed by Professor Moriya when he was around 30.

1177
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:31,110
That doesn't look like a coincidence to me.

1178
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,940
Perhaps the reason
why the criminal planted the bomb on that bridge is that

1179
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,490
he wanted to blow up that specific bridge.

1180
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,730
That bridge?

1181
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:39,830
It's very possible.

1182
01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:42,590
Maybe the bomber and the serial arsonist are the same person,

1183
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:45,150
taking aim at Professor Moriya's works.

1184
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,530
That's right.

1185
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:48,290
I got it, inspector.

1186
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:54,310
Maybe the criminal is Professor Moriya's enemy
or someone jealous of his success.

1187
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:56,160
The challenge he gave to Shinichi

1188
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,870
was merely a camouflage.

1189
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,360
So that's what it is.

1190
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:00,770
Your deduction seems quite plausible.

1191
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,290
I feel the same way.

1192
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:07,000
The arsonist used a hand-made ignition device.

1193
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:10,780
On second thought, he and the bomber do have one thing in common.

1194
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,600
That the works which were burnt down
were all designed by Moriya when he was around 30?

1195
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:16,170
Fine.

1196
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,650
Let's go talk to Professor Moriya.

1197
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,800
Mouri, please lead the way.

1198
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,470
I don't think I remember the way.

1199
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:24,470
Uncle, I know how to get there.

1200
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,160
I'll be your guide.

1201
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,450
Cut the nonsense, you haven't...

1202
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,680
I've already recovered.

1203
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,690
Hurry, hurry.

1204
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:31,760
Wait.

1205
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:36,000
Please, Shinichi.

1206
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,690
Mr. Mouri,

1207
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,940
that's the place where the timer stopped clicking.

1208
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:52,120
The children's park?

1209
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,700
Come on.

1210
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,780
We've spent a lot of time searching for those bombs here.

1211
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:15,830
I see.

1212
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:18,520
What an unexpected coincidence.

1213
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,470
Do you have any idea of what kind of person

1214
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,090
might do that?

1215
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,780
Well.

1216
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,730
That's a photo of me when I was 10, Conan.

1217
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:34,170
The people in the picture are my parents.

1218
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:38,890
I heard your father was an outstanding man, Professor Moriya.

1219
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:42,700
He was a well-known architect around the world.

1220
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,290
He had been active in the British architecture scene.

1221
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:48,300
I love the structures he designed the most.

1222
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:51,100
I remember that he passed away at...

1223
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,700
In a catastrophic fire inside a villa

1224
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:56,490
with my mother...

1225
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,230
I inherited this house after the fire.

1226
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:03,750
I remember that it was ever since then that

1227
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,430
Professor Moriya's designs started to draw everyone's attention.

1228
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,100
That's right.

1229
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,400
The smell.

1230
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,430
Is it possible that...

1231
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,470
Professor Moriya,

1232
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,350
do you know anyone who might want to commit these crimes?

1233
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,790
Well.

1234
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:39,610
The works he designed at the age around 30 start from here.

1235
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:44,530
Kurokawa's House, Mizushima's House, Yasuda's House and Akutsu's House

1236
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:46,020
and this bridge.

1237
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,030
Wait, the bridge...!

1238
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:52,500
There's no doubt about it!

1239
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,860
The structures I designed when I was young are not mature enough.

1240
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,870
Please don't look at those too long.

1241
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:01,280
No way. How's that even possible?

1242
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:03,700
But the smell.

1243
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,410
Was it already here last time I came?

1244
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,110
The new town of my dreams, Nishitamashi.

1245
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,050
Come to think of it...

1246
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:17,560
Because of that case, Mayor Okamoto was ousted.

1247
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:25,290
The new City Construction Project of Nishitamashi
which he initiated was also put on hold.

1248
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:26,820
I see.

1249
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:29,910
The one who was in charge of that construction project
must be Professor Moriya.

1250
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:48,270
This new town is completely symmetrical.

1251
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,190
It's the same streetlamp as the one in the children's park!

1252
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,380
That explains why he did that...

1253
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,100
Then he is the criminal,

1254
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:02,910
but I don't have any proof.

1255
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,110
I have to take a chance now.

1256
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,650
This will come in handy.

1257
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:20,430
Next, I'll need a pair of scissors, a tape and a felt-tip pen.

1258
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:24,610
A lighter?

1259
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,800
So,

1260
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,690
you have no idea.

1261
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,310
Sorry I couldn't be of help.

1262
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:35,170
Anyway, if you remember anything, just call us.

1263
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,210
Where did Conan go?

1264
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,430
Sorry, I need to get that.

1265
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:43,040
Yes, this is Megure.

1266
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:44,850
Oh, Kudo!

1267
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,220
I see.

1268
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,580
You want us to go to the gallery, right?

1269
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,670
Professor Moriya,

1270
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,690
excuse me, can we visit your gallery?

1271
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,260
Okay, no problem.

1272
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,570
Can I go to my study before that?

1273
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,850
Of course.

1274
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,170
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

1275
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,220
Please follow me.

1276
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,410
The gallery is on the second floor.

1277
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,910
Please come in.

1278
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,600
This is Megure.

1279
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,260
That's right. We are at the gallery now.

1280
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,460
Inspector Megure,

1281
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:42,360
please put me on speaker, OK?

1282
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,600
I already know who set the fire and planted the bombs.

1283
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,760
Really?

1284
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,180
Who is that?

1285
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,700
Wait!

1286
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,270
I know it too!

1287
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:00,120
It's you, Officer Shiratori!

1288
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,220
What?!

1289
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,570
You respect Professor Moriya's father a lot

1290
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,200
and have doubts about the cause of his death.

1291
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:10,510
The thing which got you most suspicious is that

1292
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,460
Professor Moriya began to gain fame after his father died.

1293
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,710
You think that Professor Moriya set the fire
in the villa in order to kill his father.

1294
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,530
Since you are convinced of that thought,

1295
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:23,890
you started to set all of Professor Moriya's works
on fire one after another.

1296
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:28,350
Your respect for the father became your hatred for the son.

1297
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:34,360
What's more, every time the criminal called,
you happened to be absent.

1298
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,700
W-wait a minute!

1299
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:37,890
Shinichi!

1300
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,810
Is that what you are going to say?

1301
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:40,590
Not at all.

1302
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:41,640
What?

1303
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,760
The serial of crimes

1304
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:48,080
were not committed by Professor Moriya's enemy.

1305
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:51,780
The criminal is the one who

1306
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,930
designed the houses which were burnt down lately
and that bridge. Professor Moriya,

1307
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:55,880
it was you.

1308
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,840
What?!

1309
01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:03,710
Idiot!

1310
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:07,180
Which architect in the world would destroy their own works?

1311
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:12,950
As an architect's son, he's also gifted in architecture.

1312
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:17,280
As he reached 30, he already began
to make a name for himself as a young architect.

1313
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,130
Er, hello?

1314
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:21,960
After that, he won the Japanese Construction
Association's Best New Architect award

1315
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:25,760
for designing the stone bridge on the circle line.

1316
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,240
After that, Professor Moriya created lots of works

1317
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,710
in that new construction style.

1318
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:32,270
But one day it suddenly occurred to him,

1319
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,320
No, I should say, he had had that idea for a long time...

1320
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,600
He wanted to destroy the works he designed when he was young.

1321
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:44,300
He has revealed that thought somewhat at the tea party.

1322
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,090
A lot of young architects today

1323
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:48,910
have no acknowledgement of beauty.

1324
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,300
They have to be more responsible to their works.

1325
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:56,180
Which means, he wanted to put those words into practice.

1326
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,460
That makes sense.

1327
01:10:58,980 --> 01:10:59,700
Wait.

1328
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:01,920
You weren't there that day, how did you know...

1329
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,820
Next, everyone,

1330
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,600
please take a look at the pictures on the wall.

1331
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:11,130
Watch closely at Mr. Kurokawa's House,
Mizushima's House, Yasuda's House and Akutsu's House

1332
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,070
and the stone bridge.

1333
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,310
Though they are all structures in British classical style,

1334
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,260
but there is one thing I don't know if you may have noticed.

1335
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:24,340
I think they are all very beautiful.

1336
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,260
These structures are not completely symmetrical.

1337
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,190
That's right.

1338
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:31,240
The structures are not totally symmetrical.

1339
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,450
Perhaps Professor Moriya had to submit to

1340
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:38,600
the requests of the house owners or the Construction Standard Law.

1341
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,600
However, for a perfectionist like Professor Moriya,

1342
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,560
that was intolerable.

1343
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,480
Right at that time,

1344
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,870
for the first time, there was a setback appearing in his

1345
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,680
architectural career that had been so successful all this whole time.

1346
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:57,830
The new town construction project of Nishitamashi
which he spent a lot of time on

1347
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,090
was put on hold because the mayor had stepped down.

1348
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,580
I see. So this was Professor Moriya's design too.

1349
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,610
Professor Moriya challenged me,

1350
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,210
and tried to damage my good reputation as a high school detective.

1351
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:13,370
By doing this, he could not only get back at me,

1352
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,890
but also achieve his other goal,

1353
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:21,980
which is make it look like camouflage
for the arson and the bomb incident.

1354
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:24,470
Plus, at that time,

1355
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:26,900
he stopped the timer in the cage

1356
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,760
because the gas lamps in the children's park

1357
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,660
are the symbol he designed for the new town in Nishitamashi.

1358
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,010
So, he didn't want to destroy the lamps,

1359
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:43,940
which are in his favorite London style.

1360
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:45,750
Am I right?

1361
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,240
Kudo's deductions are really very interesting.

1362
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,130
But it's pity that you don't have any proof.

1363
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:56,250
Of course I have.

1364
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:57,720
It's behind that model.

1365
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,680
It's the tool which the bomber used to disguise himself.

1366
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,880
How could it be? I put them in the safe in the study.

1367
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,910
Really?

1368
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:11,640
So the bomber's disguise is in the safe in your study.

1369
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,840
What?

1370
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,850
These are my glasses.

1371
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,290
I blackened it with a felt-tip pen.

1372
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:24,070
As for how I made the beard and wig,

1373
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:28,070
I cut the hair from the armor in the study and taped it up.

1374
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:31,320
This was all Shinichi's idea.

1375
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,010
Professor Moriya,

1376
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:35,430
please come to the police station with me.

1377
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,020
Freeze.

1378
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,640
If you dare move, I'll detonate the bombs in the room.

1379
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:42,950
That's impossible.

1380
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:45,420
Because there's no battery

1381
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:47,190
in the detonation device.

1382
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,740
How could it be?

1383
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,800
When-when did you...

1384
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:54,560
How did you know this is a detonated device?

1385
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:57,480
Because you never used a lighter.

1386
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,450
When you lit your pipe, you only used matches.

1387
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:04,110
The fragrant smell which Ayumi talked about

1388
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:06,300
must have been the smell of your pipe.

1389
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,450
Arrest him.

1390
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:14,920
Perfect. This has finally been solved.

1391
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:16,740
Congratulations! Congratulations to us!

1392
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:19,300
What's so happy about, Mr. Mouri?

1393
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,760
How could say that

1394
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,490
I was the criminal?

1395
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,400
I'm sorry.

1396
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:27,070
But everyone makes mistakes.

1397
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,750
This is not a mistake,

1398
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,610
it's just rudeness!

1399
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:38,710
You are making a huge mistake if you think this is over.

1400
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:42,750
There's another structure I want to blow up.

1401
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,750
Is that Beika City Building?

1402
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:52,180
Is that building not completely symmetrical either?

1403
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,310
They said that they were underfunded because of the bubble economy.

1404
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:57,310
Due to that absurd reason,

1405
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:00,610
that building became the biggest failure in my life.

1406
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:03,590
You people don't grasp my understanding of beauty.

1407
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:07,280
There's only one minute left until 10 o'clock.

1408
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,590
Ran.

1409
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:14,850
(Beika City Building Beika No.1 Cinema)

1410
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,380
This is Mouri.

1411
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,420
Ran, leave the building now!

1412
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,270
Ran, are you all right?

1413
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,010
Ran!

1414
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:46,850
Give it to me.

1415
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,080
Ran!

1416
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:49,860
What's wrong? Answer me, Ran!

1417
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:51,540
Crap!

1418
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:55,420
You asshole, what did you want with Ran?

1419
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:00,020
Now the explosion only sealed all the entrances and exits.

1420
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:01,870
The really interesting part is yet to come.

1421
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:02,670
What?

1422
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,200
Kudo,

1423
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:06,290
you must be listening to me somewhere.

1424
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:10,870
If you don't go there quickly,
your girlfriend will be blown to pieces.

1425
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:12,870
I'll show you no mercy.

1426
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:13,800
Don't get violent.

1427
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,860
What do you want to do?

1428
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:21,930
This is?

1429
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,100
What? Is it the blueprint of the bomb?

1430
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:25,730
What?

1431
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:27,690
I'll bring it to Shinichi!

1432
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,020
Wait!

1433
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:31,910
I'll send in a bomb squad.

1434
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,830
There's no time for that!

1435
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:43,240
Wait,

1436
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:46,310
if you meet Kudo, tell him this.

1437
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:49,050
I reserved 3 minutes specially for you.

1438
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,910
Please enjoy it.

1439
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,430
Wait, Conan!

1440
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:56,790
Shiratori, I'll leave Professor Moriya to you.

1441
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,500
Sure.

1442
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:33,830
Ran!

1443
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,040
Where are you, Ran?

1444
01:17:36,570 --> 01:17:37,030
Ran!

1445
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:37,950
Ran!

1446
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:38,430
Shoot.

1447
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:39,420
Mouri.

1448
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,080
Ran.

1449
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,410
Inspector, what is the rescue team doing?

1450
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:46,550
Calm down, Mouri.

1451
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,660
Calm down.

1452
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:52,200
Ran, wait there,

1453
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,330
I'm coming for you!

1454
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:14,520
We're going to be all right.

1455
01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:16,140
Someone is going to rescue us soon.

1456
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:23,660
Hello.

1457
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:24,680
Ran?

1458
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:26,290
Shinichi.

1459
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,120
Great, the phone is still working.

1460
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,660
What the heck?

1461
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:33,230
Why are you always not with me at the most critical moment?

1462
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,510
It's always like this.

1463
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,320
Do you know what is happening to me now?

1464
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:41,150
I know.

1465
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:45,450
I'm outside the emergency exit which was blocked by the rubble.

1466
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:54,320
It was hard to slip into the cracks in the rubble.

1467
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:56,550
But, because of the blast,

1468
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,120
the whole shape of the door was changed.

1469
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:02,590
I can't open it.

1470
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,830
By the way,

1471
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:08,340
is there anything in the hall you found suspicious,
something like a briefcase or some luggage?

1472
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,470
Something suspicious?

1473
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:25,900
I don't know what this is.

1474
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:28,010
It's very heavy thing inside a big bag,

1475
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:30,600
with something like a digital watch on the top.

1476
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,070
Be careful, that's a bomb.

1477
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:34,710
A bomb?

1478
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,040
That evil professor,

1479
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:42,250
he put the biggest bomb here.

1480
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,990
Ran, how much time do we have?

1481
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,270
Wait.

1482
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:50,180
42 minutes and 7 seconds.

1483
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:51,730
There are still 42 minutes.

1484
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:54,690
So the bomb will explode at three minutes past midnight.

1485
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:56,160
Three?

1486
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,170
I reserved 3 minutes for you specially.

1487
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:00,430
Please do enjoy it.

1488
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,730
What does the 3 minutes mean?

1489
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:07,850
How's it going?

1490
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:08,660
This is bad.

1491
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,470
The stairs on every floor have been buried by rubble.

1492
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:15,460
It'll take some time for us to get to the hall
on the 5th floor where the people are trapped.

1493
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:18,000
Ran!

1494
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,470
Only 18 minutes left.

1495
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,890
There's not enough time.

1496
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:24,960
In that case-

1497
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:28,570
Ran, do you have a pair of scissors with you?

1498
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:31,120
There is a pair in my handbag.

1499
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:32,740
What do you need it for?

1500
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,030
I need you to use it to defuse the bomb.

1501
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,030
Listen, do as I say.

1502
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,450
Wait,

1503
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,740
I can't do something like that while listening to you on the phone!

1504
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,010
I'll go to you now.

1505
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,000
Wait.

1506
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,580
Okay.

1507
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,020
Looks like there's no vibration sensor on it.

1508
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:54,800
But you still need to walk as gently as you can.

1509
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,610
I know.

1510
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:08,630
Can you hear me, Shinichi?

1511
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,470
I can hear you clearly.

1512
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,010
Now I'm ripping the bag.

1513
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,880
Be careful.

1514
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:26,810
What's wrong, Ran?

1515
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:27,540
Are you all right?

1516
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:29,760
I'm fine.

1517
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:43,030
OK, I'm ready.

1518
01:21:43,330 --> 01:21:43,910
Great.

1519
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,260
Move away the cover first.

1520
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,390
You can pick it up directly.

1521
01:21:48,730 --> 01:21:49,710
Be gentle.

1522
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,540
I did it, Shinichi.

1523
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:57,450
Good job!

1524
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:00,180
Now, you are going to cut the lines inside.

1525
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:04,020
If you do it in the wrong order, we'll be dead.

1526
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:10,300
First, cut the yellow line at the bottom.

1527
01:22:17,190 --> 01:22:18,030
I'm going to cut it.

1528
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,450
Inspector.

1529
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,150
Will Ran...

1530
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,680
Calm down, Mouri.

1531
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:33,370
The place where Ran is didn't explode.

1532
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:34,660
Don't worry.

1533
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:38,170
Your daughter will be blown to pieces in 15 minutes.

1534
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:39,950
How dare you?!

1535
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:41,100
Tell us!

1536
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,750
How can we stop that bomb from exploding?

1537
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:46,030
That's a special bomb.

1538
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:49,710
Even if she can defuse it, she has to bet on the last line.

1539
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:51,860
The line of destiny.

1540
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:58,660
There was an explosion in Beika City Building just now...

1541
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,310
I cut it.

1542
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,300
Good.

1543
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:10,910
So it's not too late.

1544
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:14,290
Now you only need to cut the black line.

1545
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:15,760
The black one, right?

1546
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:22,280
Shi-Shinichi.

1547
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,270
I already cut the black line.

1548
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,080
But the timer didn't stop.

1549
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,050
Also, there are still two lines left.

1550
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,500
A red one and a blue one.

1551
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,090
What?

1552
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:39,960
We have opened the tunnel to the fourth floor.

1553
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,660
Make it as quick as you can.

1554
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:43,490
The explosion will take place in 4 minutes.

1555
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:44,330
Mr. Mouri.

1556
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:46,390
Ran, Ran, I'm coming for you!

1557
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:47,310
Mr. Mouri!

1558
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,560
Where are you going, Mr. Mouri?

1559
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,010
Let go of me.

1560
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,870
Ran, I have to save Ran!

1561
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:55,560
You can't go. The rescue team will get her out.

1562
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,750
Ran!

1563
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:01,830
Is this the tragedy of fatherly love?

1564
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:04,170
Architecture doesn't need love,

1565
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:05,870
and neither does one's life.

1566
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:10,070
So Professor Moriya didn't draw the two lines on the paper

1567
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,000
in order to leave me stumped here?

1568
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:14,660
What should I do?

1569
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,140
Should I cut both of the lines?

1570
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:17,180
Idiot!

1571
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,790
One of them is the detonating cord!

1572
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:20,490
If you cut it, we'll be blown to pieces!

1573
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:22,210
It-it can'be!

1574
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:30,730
Shoot!

1575
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,000
Which one is it?

1576
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:33,550
The red one or the blue one?

1577
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,140
Which line should we cut?

1578
01:24:50,730 --> 01:24:51,630
It's 12 o'clock.

1579
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,090
We only have 3 minutes left.

1580
01:24:54,010 --> 01:24:54,820
Damn it.

1581
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:55,610
Which one?

1582
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:56,800
Which one is it?

1583
01:24:57,090 --> 01:24:58,100
Shinichi.

1584
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,930
Happy Birthday.

1585
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:03,250
Shinichi.

1586
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:05,740
I said it because

1587
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:12,020
I might never have the chance to say it to you in person.

1588
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,430
Ran.

1589
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:31,190
Cut it.

1590
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,180
Cut the one you like.

1591
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,870
What if I get it wrong?

1592
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,540
It doesn't matter.

1593
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:42,130
It will explode when time is up anyway.

1594
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,940
Since then, just choose the color you like.

1595
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:46,640
B-but-

1596
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,290
Don't worry.

1597
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,460
I'll be here with you

1598
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:55,890
when you cut it.

1599
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:59,740
I'll die with you.

1600
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:04,450
Shinichi.

1601
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,750
Shinichi, which color do you prefer, red or blue?

1602
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,460
I think it's red.

1603
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:36,170
By the way, look at this,

1604
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:39,440
Shinichi's lucky color for May is the same as mine, which is red.

1605
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:42,520
That's why I decided to watch that movie.

1606
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,600
Ran, Ran, are you alright?

1607
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,900
Damn it, she can't hear me now.

1608
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:59,870
That's right, I can use my cell phone.

1609
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,020
It's gone.

1610
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,200
Crap, did I drop it?

1611
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,340
We found a boy here.

1612
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:08,800
It's fine, little boy.

1613
01:27:09,210 --> 01:27:10,000
Let's go now.

1614
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:11,760
W-Wait a moment.

1615
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,680
There's something stuck in here.

1616
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,410
Fine, wait here for a second.

1617
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,500
I can't bust it open. Get the drill ready.

1618
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,080
Yes.

1619
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,400
Today is my anniversary.

1620
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:27,960
It looks like I can't enjoy it.

1621
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,190
I reserved 3 minutes for you specially.

1622
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:33,400
Please do enjoy it.

1623
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,460
I see.

1624
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:39,690
So he wants me to enjoy the three minutes of my birthday.

1625
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:41,820
Wait.

1626
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:42,880
I remember at that time.

1627
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,330
You must be looking forward to it.

1628
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:49,330
I guess you have bought the gift already.

1629
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,340
No, I want to buy it on Saturday.

1630
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:55,080
Because he likes red like I do.

1631
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,360
Also, our lucky color for May is red.

1632
01:27:58,850 --> 01:27:59,980
The lucky color.

1633
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:01,890
Shoot.

1634
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,390
Let's go, boy.

1635
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:07,240
- Little boy.
- Ran!

1636
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,480
Don't cut the red line!

1637
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,360
Cut the blue one!

1638
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:10,580
You can't cut the red one!

1639
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,030
Ran!

1640
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,640
What's wrong?

1641
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,660
Answer my question.

1642
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:26,270
Ran!

1643
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:45,850
Goodbye.

1644
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,290
Shinichi!

1645
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,410
Ran!

1646
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,550
How-how's that possible?

1647
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:50,230
I'm so glad that Ran was safe, Mouri.

1648
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:50,760
Yes.

1649
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:52,190
Thank you very much.

1650
01:29:52,190 --> 01:29:53,970
Hello, may I speak to you?

1651
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,980
As the famous detective, what's your opinion about...

1652
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,320
To be honest, this time the criminal tried to

1653
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:02,470
damage my good reputation as a famous detective.

1654
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:05,610
So he set Ran, my daughter, in this dangerous situation.

1655
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:14,760
Conan!

1656
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:17,300
Did you come here because you were worried about me?

1657
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:18,310
Yeah.

1658
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,200
What's with this bandage?

1659
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,410
I tripped over myself just now.

1660
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:24,030
You have to be careful.

1661
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:27,150
Conan, did you see Shinichi?

1662
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:30,180
It's so weird. He was here just now.

1663
01:30:30,490 --> 01:30:33,140
I already bought a gift for him.

1664
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,750
By the way, Shinichi seemed very surprised

1665
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:40,490
because he thought you would cut the red line.

1666
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:43,040
He didn't understand why you cut the blue one.

1667
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:46,570
Because I don't want to cut it off,

1668
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,230
the red line.

1669
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:55,390
Maybe that's the red line which connects Shinichi and me together!

1670
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,500
The red line's not there!

1671
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:04,960
Right, I'm Conan now.

1672
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,570
There's no way it'd be there.
