1
00:00:03.443 --> 00:00:05.053
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:08.083
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a drug that shrunk him.

3
00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:10.963
Although smaller, my mind remains
that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:10.963 --> 00:00:12.963
Today's case takes place
in a department store at night!

5
00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:14.503
The empty floors after closing time...

6
00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.833
Even under the cover of night,
there is always only one truth!

7
00:01:52.874 --> 00:01:55.004
The Department Store Hijack.

8
00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:07.424
We have you now, Yaiba!

9
00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:10.124
Send him to hell, guys!

10
00:02:12.124 --> 00:02:14.814
I, Yaiba, shall defend world peace!

11
00:02:14.814 --> 00:02:16.334
Yaiba!

12
00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.254
Take care of those jerks!

13
00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:19.294
Use your kick!

14
00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.064
Yaiba Kick!

15
00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:27.534
I'm in high school. So what
am I doing watching this drivel?

16
00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:31.174
Don't you like Yaiba, Conan-kun?

17
00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:35.674
I love it! Go, Yaiba!

18
00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:42.174
Okay, say cheese!

19
00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:48.884
Talk about fun!

20
00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:53.324
Thank you for shopping with us today.

21
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:59.194
Thank you. We look forward
to seeing you again.

22
00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:01.004
Bye!
Bye!

23
00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:02.404
Bye now!

24
00:03:03.424 --> 00:03:08.354
Yaiba! Yaiba! He fights
for justice! Yaiba!

25
00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:11.334
It's gone!

26
00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:13.464
Yaiba's autograph is gone!

27
00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:15.754
You lost it?!

28
00:03:15.754 --> 00:03:19.354
I was going to treasure it
for my entire life, too...

29
00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:21.674
Hold on a minute.

30
00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:25.994
When we took the picture
with Yaiba, I seem to remember...

31
00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.534
Let me see the picture, Ayumi-chan.

32
00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:31.394
Okay...

33
00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:33.264
Here you go!

34
00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:38.084
I seem to recall Genta saying
that he was hungry when we took this...

35
00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:45.104
Yeah! I bought a hot dog and then--

36
00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:48.784
It's at that shop! I'm going to get it!

37
00:03:49.124 --> 00:03:54.084
But the place is closed by now.
I say leave it for tomorrow.

38
00:03:54.084 --> 00:03:58.084
Do whatever you want!
I'm going to go get it!

39
00:03:58.084 --> 00:03:59.424
Genta-kun!

40
00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:00.754
Wait!

41
00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:01.224
Hey!

42
00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:05.694
Whoops. My deductive skills
are to blame for this.

43
00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:19.964
Please hurry! The security system
is going to activate in 10 minutes!

44
00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:26.544
Genta-kun. That door's going to lock
when the security system activates!

45
00:04:26.544 --> 00:04:29.484
I can get it in less than 10 minutes!

46
00:04:30.004 --> 00:04:31.954
See you tomorrow!

47
00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:32.754
Now!

48
00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:34.924
Wait!

49
00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:36.674
Hey! Stop!

50
00:04:36.674 --> 00:04:37.194
Ugh!

51
00:04:41.424 --> 00:04:43.364
Yikes!

52
00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:52.744
Here it is!

53
00:04:53.214 --> 00:04:55.374
Yes! My treasure's safe!

54
00:04:55.374 --> 00:04:57.714
All thanks to Conan-kun's
great detective skills!

55
00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.614
No, this was nothing at all...

56
00:05:00.614 --> 00:05:02.984
We better hurry before
the security system activates!

57
00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:11.294
No!

58
00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.084
What now?!

59
00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:18.294
If we go to the security guards' office
inside the building

60
00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:21.084
and explain the situation,
I'm sure they'll let us out!

61
00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:22.474
Really?!

62
00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:25.504
Let's see here...

63
00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:28.144
Security Office! Floor B2!

64
00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:37.824
Masked Yaib--

65
00:05:37.824 --> 00:05:39.754
The jewelry store's
on the 6th floor, right?

66
00:05:39.754 --> 00:05:43.464
Yeah. And there are antiques in
the convention hall on the 7th floor.

67
00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:45.194
It's the elevator lady--

68
00:05:45.624 --> 00:05:49.294
Excellent. We have until morning
to take whatever we want.

69
00:05:49.294 --> 00:05:51.084
It's a gang of thieves!

70
00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:52.964
We're in big trouble if they find us!

71
00:05:52.964 --> 00:05:55.464
They'll kill us! Let's get outta here!

72
00:05:55.464 --> 00:05:58.104
But what about the elevator lady
and those other people?!

73
00:05:58.544 --> 00:06:02.334
For now, let's stay hidden
and contact the police! Okay?

74
00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:03.544
Yeah!

75
00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:11.754
Huh?! There's no dial tone!

76
00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:13.944
The cord's been cut!

77
00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:15.254
This one too!

78
00:06:15.254 --> 00:06:16.694
They've all been cut!

79
00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:19.884
Let's use this phone!

80
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.754
Nope. It doesn't work.

81
00:06:23.754 --> 00:06:27.974
The phones must be down
because of the security system!

82
00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:30.714
So nobody's going to come to rescue us?!

83
00:06:30.714 --> 00:06:33.914
I want to eat a ton of eel lunches
before I get killed!

84
00:06:34.674 --> 00:06:36.714
It's too early to give up just yet!

85
00:06:41.544 --> 00:06:43.624
Please notice!

86
00:06:48.544 --> 00:06:50.254
Hey!

87
00:06:50.254 --> 00:06:51.834
Help!

88
00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:53.564
Up here!

89
00:06:56.544 --> 00:06:58.034
It didn't work...

90
00:06:59.504 --> 00:07:00.754
Genta-kun!

91
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:01.874
Knock it off!

92
00:07:01.874 --> 00:07:03.974
The robbers will hear us!

93
00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:09.084
Darn, it won't break!

94
00:07:09.084 --> 00:07:13.924
Give it up! The windows here
are made of especially thick glass!

95
00:07:13.924 --> 00:07:16.384
Alright! In that case...

96
00:07:24.424 --> 00:07:25.464
Okay! Cut it!

97
00:07:26.024 --> 00:07:26.884
You got it!

98
00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:36.174
Come to papa!

99
00:07:41.214 --> 00:07:43.124
What's that?!

100
00:07:43.124 --> 00:07:46.054
Security office! There's a weird sound
coming from the 7th floor!

101
00:07:46.054 --> 00:07:47.124
Roger that.

102
00:07:47.124 --> 00:07:50.064
Hey. Use the security cameras
to check out the 7th floor!

103
00:07:52.124 --> 00:07:53.714
I'm pooped...

104
00:07:53.714 --> 00:07:55.394
I told you it was pointless!

105
00:07:57.754 --> 00:07:59.124
Everyone get down!

106
00:08:00.004 --> 00:08:01.664
Hey, Conan! What about the window?!

107
00:08:01.664 --> 00:08:02.964
Oh no!

108
00:08:05.374 --> 00:08:07.574
It's no good! You won't make it in time!

109
00:08:10.874 --> 00:08:13.244
Nothing strange that I can see.

110
00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:17.174
Nothing strange?! Those were
some pretty loud sounds we heard!

111
00:08:17.174 --> 00:08:19.214
Let's go! Let's take the loot and split!

112
00:08:19.214 --> 00:08:21.654
No. Let's check it out just to be safe.

113
00:08:21.654 --> 00:08:24.154
Darn it, aren't there
any exits around here?

114
00:08:24.154 --> 00:08:25.304
Quiet!

115
00:08:26.174 --> 00:08:27.124
Someone's coming!

116
00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:42.004
Genta-kun!

117
00:08:42.004 --> 00:08:43.464
Found you, you little brats!

118
00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:44.244
Oh no!

119
00:08:46.754 --> 00:08:49.424
Sorry I'm so late!

120
00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:52.254
Sonoko and I got caught up
in a discussion...

121
00:08:52.254 --> 00:08:54.424
I'll make dinner right away!

122
00:08:54.424 --> 00:08:54.714
Huh?

123
00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:00.294
They've seen our faces! Get 'em!

124
00:09:00.294 --> 00:09:02.834
Everyone get on!

125
00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:03.394
Here goes!

126
00:09:09.294 --> 00:09:11.504
Come back here!

127
00:09:11.504 --> 00:09:14.474
Security office! Do you read me?!
Turn on the lights!

128
00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:16.924
What'd you say? I didn't copy...

129
00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:19.044
There's a bunch of
little brats in the store!

130
00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:27.154
Where'd those lousy kids go?!

131
00:09:42.704 --> 00:09:45.334
Hey! What's going on?! Hey!

132
00:09:50.334 --> 00:09:52.834
What's going on?!

133
00:09:52.834 --> 00:09:55.504
The other guys in the security office
know we're here!

134
00:09:55.504 --> 00:09:59.004
They turned on the lights to catch us!

135
00:09:59.004 --> 00:10:01.384
Let's get away from here!

136
00:10:01.754 --> 00:10:04.754
Dad. Dad!

137
00:10:08.424 --> 00:10:10.584
What do you want?

138
00:10:10.584 --> 00:10:13.464
Conan-kun still hasn't come home!

139
00:10:13.464 --> 00:10:17.424
How should I know
where that lousy kid is?

140
00:10:17.424 --> 00:10:20.214
Why'd you wake me up?

141
00:10:21.214 --> 00:10:22.344
Dad!

142
00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:28.924
What good timing!

143
00:10:35.254 --> 00:10:37.674
Genta! Get out! Everyone out! Hurry!

144
00:10:37.674 --> 00:10:39.154
What's going on, Conan-kun?

145
00:10:42.294 --> 00:10:46.124
Oh! They almost had us trapped!

146
00:10:46.124 --> 00:10:47.364
That was close!

147
00:10:48.004 --> 00:10:50.424
Thanks, Conan-kun!

148
00:10:50.424 --> 00:10:53.574
Save that for after
we get out of this place!

149
00:10:55.794 --> 00:10:58.334
I thought Conan was
at the department store.

150
00:10:58.334 --> 00:11:02.944
Didn't he go with his friends
to see some kids' show?

151
00:11:03.624 --> 00:11:05.834
It's pitch dark outside.

152
00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:08.134
Did you try calling the store?

153
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:15.004
Where's my food, anyway?

154
00:11:15.004 --> 00:11:17.124
Are you trying to starve me to death?!

155
00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:23.704
This is Marutan Department Store.

156
00:11:23.704 --> 00:11:27.404
We are currently closed.

157
00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:32.574
Hurry! We need to get as far away
from them as possible!

158
00:11:32.574 --> 00:11:34.974
Got you!

159
00:11:35.504 --> 00:11:39.714
We will be open during our
regular hours tomorrow, from 10 am--

160
00:11:42.754 --> 00:11:47.504
See? So what do you say you
make me some dinner now?

161
00:11:47.504 --> 00:11:49.794
Now who are you calling?

162
00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:51.924
Is this the Kojima household?
This is Mori Ran.

163
00:11:51.924 --> 00:11:52.794
Has Genta-kun--

164
00:11:52.794 --> 00:11:54.694
Come back here!

165
00:11:59.214 --> 00:12:00.464
Those voices...

166
00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:01.874
They've been caught!

167
00:12:01.874 --> 00:12:04.294
You stay here and hide!

168
00:12:04.294 --> 00:12:05.074
Got it?!

169
00:12:05.074 --> 00:12:05.774
Yeah!

170
00:12:07.544 --> 00:12:09.084
Let go!

171
00:12:09.544 --> 00:12:12.334
Where are the other two?!

172
00:12:12.334 --> 00:12:15.224
Help! I don't wanna die!

173
00:12:15.624 --> 00:12:17.454
Stop right there! This is the police!

174
00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:20.004
We have this department store surrounded!

175
00:12:20.004 --> 00:12:21.554
There's no escape!

176
00:12:21.554 --> 00:12:24.364
Put your weapons down
and release the children!

177
00:12:29.804 --> 00:12:32.624
This way! Hurry!

178
00:12:32.624 --> 00:12:34.474
Damn kids!

179
00:12:34.474 --> 00:12:36.384
There's no police here!

180
00:12:36.384 --> 00:12:38.244
Just those kids!

181
00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:43.924
Damn it! They used a
bunch of stupid mannequins!

182
00:12:43.924 --> 00:12:45.584
Don't let 'em get away!

183
00:12:49.674 --> 00:12:53.664
Is this the Yoshida residence?
I'm Conan Edogawa's--

184
00:12:55.834 --> 00:12:58.534
Eh? Ayumi-chan hasn't
come home yet either?

185
00:13:00.424 --> 00:13:03.674
I just had a call from
Mitsuhiko-kun's family too...

186
00:13:03.674 --> 00:13:07.074
What is it? What's going on?

187
00:13:15.004 --> 00:13:18.834
Get up, Genta! Do you
want them to catch you?!

188
00:13:18.834 --> 00:13:20.824
Okay, okay...

189
00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:33.564
We're trapped!

190
00:13:34.424 --> 00:13:35.834
Over here!

191
00:13:40.234 --> 00:13:41.874
Damn it!

192
00:13:51.624 --> 00:13:53.624
What is it, Conan-kun?

193
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:54.814
Did you forget something?!

194
00:13:54.814 --> 00:13:58.044
No, that's not it...

195
00:13:58.044 --> 00:14:00.884
I just realized something strange,
but I don't know what.

196
00:14:01.754 --> 00:14:04.934
What could it be?!

197
00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:18.761
Conan and his friends were kidnapped?

198
00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.631
Yes, that's the only explanation...

199
00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:27.381
Hold on. Did any of their families
receive ransom demands?

200
00:14:27.381 --> 00:14:29.331
No, but...

201
00:14:29.331 --> 00:14:34.291
My guess is that they're taking
their sweet time coming home.

202
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:37.081
They'll be back soon enough.

203
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:38.871
I wonder...

204
00:14:38.871 --> 00:14:41.791
So how's about some dinner?

205
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:50.631
Come on! Cook me some food already--

206
00:14:50.631 --> 00:14:54.231
Is this the investigation department?
Inspector Megure, please.

207
00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:01.171
Works better than I expected!

208
00:15:03.251 --> 00:15:03.981
Jeez!

209
00:15:04.501 --> 00:15:06.801
Genta-kun!

210
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:08.401
You're a real liability!

211
00:15:08.401 --> 00:15:12.071
I couldn't help it, I'm hungry!

212
00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:14.741
Come back here!
Come back here!

213
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:20.541
Sorry to bother you at such a late hour.

214
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.211
Well?

215
00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:26.881
There aren't any incidents at the moment
that might involve the children,

216
00:15:26.881 --> 00:15:30.531
but it is strange that none of them
have returned home yet.

217
00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:32.961
Could something have happened to them?!

218
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:35.581
I've put out a bulletin.

219
00:15:35.581 --> 00:15:38.251
Don't worry, they'll turn up soon.

220
00:15:38.251 --> 00:15:40.001
Thanks!

221
00:15:40.001 --> 00:15:44.881
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in
the middle of an important case.

222
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:49.381
Well, we've done all we can do.

223
00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.921
All there is to do now is wait
for any reports about them.

224
00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:55.251
Let's go get something to eat!

225
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:56.451
Let's go...

226
00:16:05.791 --> 00:16:08.461
I've always wanted
to do this at least once!

227
00:16:08.461 --> 00:16:12.611
Forgive us. We'll pay for
this if we make it out alive.

228
00:16:13.921 --> 00:16:16.311
I wonder if we even will
make it out alive...

229
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:20.211
Don't look so down, Genta-kun!

230
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:24.041
You've had plenty to eat now,
so cheer up!

231
00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:27.901
We're going to take care of them
and get out of here!

232
00:16:27.901 --> 00:16:29.991
In the name of the
Junior Detective League!

233
00:16:30.421 --> 00:16:32.621
In the name of...

234
00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:34.231
...the Junior Detective League...

235
00:16:34.231 --> 00:16:42.251
Yeah, it must be a pretty important case
if they're still at it this late....

236
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:45.581
Are you trying to say that Conan-kun
and the others aren't important?!

237
00:16:45.581 --> 00:16:48.791
No, that's not what I meant...

238
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.711
Darn that Conan-kun...

239
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:58.621
I'm missing my dinner thanks to him...

240
00:17:00.251 --> 00:17:02.381
A gang of department store thieves?

241
00:17:02.381 --> 00:17:07.791
They sneak in after the stores close
and steal jewelry and electronics...

242
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:11.351
Could this be the important
case he was talking about?

243
00:17:13.171 --> 00:17:14.381
Department store?!

244
00:17:14.381 --> 00:17:15.951
It couldn't be...

245
00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:17.471
Calm down, Ran!

246
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:22.211
Okay! Commence counterattack!

247
00:17:36.391 --> 00:17:38.531
Now where are they hiding?!

248
00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:40.291
Over there!

249
00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:59.411
I don't handle alcohol well...

250
00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.061
Me neither...

251
00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:02.281
Mitsuhiko-kun!

252
00:18:14.631 --> 00:18:16.831
Damn kids!

253
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:18.831
You'll pay! We can't let you live!

254
00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:33.611
I'm not good with animals!

255
00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:37.251
That's it...

256
00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:39.091
Fetch!

257
00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:00.461
We did it!
We did it!

258
00:19:00.461 --> 00:19:03.411
Hurray for the Junior Detective League!
Hurray for the Junior Detective League!

259
00:19:04.541 --> 00:19:05.151
Wait a second!

260
00:19:06.381 --> 00:19:08.881
Aha! Now I get it!

261
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:15.331
Who's there?!

262
00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:19.071
It's me, elevator lady.

263
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:23.291
What are you doing here, little boy?

264
00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:26.751
Never mind that, we're in danger--
there are some bad people here.

265
00:19:26.751 --> 00:19:29.121
Let's escape together.

266
00:19:29.121 --> 00:19:31.921
You can drop the act.

267
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:35.461
I know what's going on, elevator lady.

268
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:38.711
Or should I say,
the 5th member of the thief gang!

269
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:41.591
W-What are you talking about?

270
00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:46.611
It was a 5th person who
activated the escalator earlier.

271
00:19:46.611 --> 00:19:49.501
This person had been waiting
to catch all four of us at once.

272
00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:52.431
Among the remaining people
in the security office,

273
00:19:52.431 --> 00:19:56.921
you were the only one who knew
how many of us there were.

274
00:19:56.921 --> 00:20:01.171
You planned in advance to get inside
by getting a job as an elevator girl

275
00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:02.991
so that you could scout out the place.

276
00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:04.861
Who in the world are you?!

277
00:20:05.291 --> 00:20:07.581
Conan Edogawa. A detective.

278
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.131
Excellent deductive work, boy.

279
00:20:10.131 --> 00:20:14.441
But it seems you didn't know that
I was actually the gang's boss.

280
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:17.251
A pistol?!

281
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.291
It's not fair that you have a gun!

282
00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:26.091
Okay! I'll lure her onto the roof!

283
00:20:43.131 --> 00:20:45.781
The game's over, little boy!
Come on out!

284
00:20:48.751 --> 00:20:49.781
There you are!

285
00:20:52.881 --> 00:20:54.661
Basketballs!

286
00:20:54.661 --> 00:20:56.251
Annoying little brat!

287
00:20:59.671 --> 00:21:01.001
Stop your pointless resistance!

288
00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:06.431
Go!

289
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:10.331
Damn it!

290
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:25.551
Let me down!

291
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:31.161
I did it!

292
00:21:51.081 --> 00:21:53.241
What in the world?

293
00:21:54.921 --> 00:21:57.601
These are the thieves!
Take them into custody!

294
00:21:59.461 --> 00:22:01.731
I don't feel so good...

295
00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:05.081
What a bunch of silly kids!

296
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:07.181
You can say that again.

297
00:23:47.081 --> 00:23:51.131
The following day, we were
given an award ceremony

298
00:23:51.131 --> 00:23:52.301
for capturing the thieves.

299
00:23:52.901 --> 00:23:55.041
We didn't have to pay

300
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:59.131
for any of the things we ate
or broke inside the store.

301
00:23:59.131 --> 00:24:00.201
Is that really alright?

302
00:24:00.691 --> 00:24:02.081
Don't ask questions!

303
00:24:02.761 --> 00:24:04.711
Chalk another one up...

304
00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:06.231
...for the Junior Detective League!

305
00:24:14.471 --> 00:24:15.971
What was that sound?!

306
00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:17.031
It came from her room!

307
00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:20.621
Matsumoto-sensei?!

308
00:24:23.931 --> 00:24:26.591
Come to think of it, we were taping it!

309
00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:27.531
What?!

310
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:31.671
The murder might be recorded on this!

311
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:34.841
So that was the one who
smeared her dress with blood!

312
00:24:36.761 --> 00:24:38.221
On the next Conan--

313
00:24:38.221 --> 00:24:40.821
The June Bride Murder Case.

314
00:24:57.878 --> 00:24:59.711
Next Conan's Hint:

315
00:24:59.711 --> 00:24:59.718
Next Conan's Hint:
Medicine capsule.

316
00:24:59.718 --> 00:25:02.062
Medicine capsule.
