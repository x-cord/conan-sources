1
00:00:01.224 --> 00:00:02.964
My name's Shinichi Kudo.

2
00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:06.054
I'm a famous high school detective
who's solved countless cases!

3
00:00:06.424 --> 00:00:09.184
I solved a roller coaster murder
case with no difficulty at all,

4
00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:11.894
but then a mysterious organization
forced me to take a strange poison.

5
00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:12.894
Things looked really bad!

6
00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:15.434
Ran! What's going to happen to me?!

7
00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:50.348
The Kidnapping of the Company
President's Daughter.

8
00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:55.008
Are you alright, little boy?!

9
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:55.012
Are you alright, little boy?!
Little boy?

10
00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:56.738
Little boy?

11
00:01:56.738 --> 00:01:58.488
What're these guys talking about?

12
00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:00.418
I'm a 2nd year high school student!

13
00:02:00.418 --> 00:02:02.998
How did you get that
cut on your head?!

14
00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:04.738
Cut?

15
00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:05.918
Oh yeah!

16
00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:07.858
A man dressed in black hit me and...

17
00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:10.468
What the...?

18
00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:13.278
We've found an injured boy.

19
00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:14.888
Yes, he's a grade school student.

20
00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.608
Who's a grade school student?!

21
00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:19.068
What're they talking about?!

22
00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:20.648
These officers are acting strange!

23
00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:25.278
There may have been an incident--
he's received injuries to his head.

24
00:02:26.488 --> 00:02:27.478
Where did he go?!

25
00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:27.948
Huh!?

26
00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.608
We may have a crime on
our hands! Try to find him!

27
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:30.738
Right!

28
00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:33.108
Mori Detective Agency

29
00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:34.908
I'm home!
Mori Detective Agency

30
00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:36.778
Oh, you're back, Ran!

31
00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:40.068
Come on, Dad, can't you stop
throwing trash all over?

32
00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:44.788
This is why you don't get any jobs!
And why Mom ran out on you!

33
00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:47.108
I choose what jobs I take.

34
00:02:47.108 --> 00:02:50.488
Anyway, where's that so-called
detective of yours?

35
00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:52.698
Wasn't he with you?

36
00:02:52.698 --> 00:02:55.648
He was before we left
the amusement park.

37
00:02:55.648 --> 00:02:57.178
But then...

38
00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:59.698
Sorry, Ran! You go on ahead!

39
00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:03.608
What could Shinichi be doing?

40
00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:25.738
I haven't run that far,
so why am I so out of breath?!

41
00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:33.148
I-I've shrunk!

42
00:03:34.738 --> 00:03:36.198
How?!

43
00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:38.598
Wait, it couldn't be...

44
00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:41.738
We'll use this.
Our organization's latest poison.

45
00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:45.648
Could it be because
I swallowed that pill?!

46
00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:53.198
Hello, this is Shinichi Kudo.

47
00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:54.968
I'm away at the moment.

48
00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:57.518
If you're interested in hiring me,
please leave your name and number...

49
00:03:57.518 --> 00:04:00.038
That's strange. He's still not home.

50
00:04:00.038 --> 00:04:04.738
He's probably out havin' dinner
with his novelist dad or somethin'...

51
00:04:04.738 --> 00:04:07.988
Shinichi's parents moved
to America three years ago,

52
00:04:07.988 --> 00:04:10.048
so he's living all by himself now!

53
00:04:10.048 --> 00:04:11.508
Oh yeah?

54
00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:15.718
Something must've
happened to him afterward!

55
00:04:15.718 --> 00:04:17.818
I'm going to stop by his house!

56
00:04:17.818 --> 00:04:20.118
W-What about my dinner?!

57
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.808
Darn it! Can't I even get
into my own house?!

58
00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.548
Professor Agasa!

59
00:04:38.548 --> 00:04:39.838
Who are you?

60
00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:41.868
It's me! Shinichi!

61
00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:44.418
A relative of Shinichi, are you?

62
00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.328
His house is the next one over.

63
00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:48.298
I'm Shinichi!

64
00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:49.958
Here, I'll prove it!

65
00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:51.998
Your name is Hiroshi Agasa
and you're 52!

66
00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:54.868
You're an eccentric inventor
and claim that you're a genius,

67
00:04:54.868 --> 00:04:56.658
but everything you make is junk!

68
00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:59.338
You also have a mole on your butt
that has a hair sticking out of it!

69
00:04:59.338 --> 00:05:02.288
Only Shinichi knows about that!

70
00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.678
He's been spreading my
secrets around, has he?

71
00:05:05.678 --> 00:05:08.328
No! It's because I'm Shinichi!

72
00:05:08.328 --> 00:05:10.728
I was forced to take some weird pill
which made my body shrink!

73
00:05:11.288 --> 00:05:12.868
A pill that shrunk you?

74
00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:13.688
Yeah!

75
00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:18.868
I highly doubt any such pills exist!

76
00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:21.408
You suspicious little punk!
I'm taking you to the police!

77
00:05:21.408 --> 00:05:23.008
Professor! You tripped while hurrying

78
00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:25.118
on your way back from the
Colombo restaurant, didn't you?!

79
00:05:25.998 --> 00:05:27.578
How do you know that?!

80
00:05:27.908 --> 00:05:29.368
Your clothes, Professor.

81
00:05:29.368 --> 00:05:32.828
The front of your clothes are still wet,
yet the back is completely dry!

82
00:05:32.828 --> 00:05:35.158
That's evidence that you
were running in the rain.

83
00:05:35.158 --> 00:05:37.048
What's more, you also
have mud on your pants.

84
00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:39.368
The only street in this area
where you could get mud on you

85
00:05:39.368 --> 00:05:41.508
is in front of Colombo,
which is under construction!

86
00:05:41.948 --> 00:05:45.498
Plus some of Colombo's special
meat sauce is still in your mustache.

87
00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:48.348
W-Who are you?

88
00:05:50.368 --> 00:05:52.438
Elementary, my dear Agasa!

89
00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:55.388
S-Shinichi?

90
00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:58.698
I see.

91
00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:04.868
So, the uncompleted poison mysteriously
caused your body to shrink.

92
00:06:05.158 --> 00:06:06.948
That's the gist of it.

93
00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:10.168
Talk about lame. My clothes from
when I was a kid fit perfectly.

94
00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.198
I'm begging you, Professor!
You are a genius, after all!

95
00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:16.448
Make me some medicine that'll
change me back to normal!

96
00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:19.628
Hold on there! I don't even know
the ingredients of the pill you took...

97
00:06:20.038 --> 00:06:22.198
Then all we need to do is
figure out where those guys are

98
00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:23.968
and get some of those pills!

99
00:06:23.968 --> 00:06:26.998
Well, that would certainly help...

100
00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:28.328
Listen, Shinichi!

101
00:06:28.328 --> 00:06:30.198
If they find out you're still alive,

102
00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:32.868
they'll come back to put
an end to you for good!

103
00:06:32.868 --> 00:06:35.538
So, this must stay a secret
between just the two of us!

104
00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:37.118
You mustn't tell anyone at all!

105
00:06:37.118 --> 00:06:38.948
That means not even Ran-kun!

106
00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:40.998
Shinichi! Are you there?!

107
00:06:40.998 --> 00:06:41.948
It's Ran!

108
00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:43.698
Oh no! Hide quickly!

109
00:06:43.698 --> 00:06:46.038
If you're home, then you can
at least answer the phone!

110
00:06:47.538 --> 00:06:50.578
Huh? Professor Agasa?
Where's Shinichi?

111
00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:51.278
Uh, well, he's...

112
00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:52.498
Dad's glasses...
Uh, well, he's...

113
00:06:52.498 --> 00:06:54.618
He isn't here?
Disguise time!

114
00:06:54.618 --> 00:06:55.588
Whoa, these are strong!

115
00:06:55.588 --> 00:06:57.868
Huh? Is there someone there?

116
00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:01.698
You must be really shy!

117
00:07:01.698 --> 00:07:03.868
Come on now, face this way!

118
00:07:05.288 --> 00:07:07.388
He's...

119
00:07:09.058 --> 00:07:10.598
...so cute!

120
00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.518
Her chest!

121
00:07:14.258 --> 00:07:15.518
Who is this boy?

122
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.908
He belongs to a distant
relative of mine!

123
00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:18.978
What's your name?

124
00:07:18.978 --> 00:07:22.368
M-My name's Shin-

125
00:07:22.368 --> 00:07:23.858
Err...

126
00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:28.648
Conan!

127
00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.788
My name's Conan Edogawa!

128
00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:34.238
Conan? That's an odd name.

129
00:07:34.238 --> 00:07:37.588
My dad was a big fan
of Conan Doyle, so...

130
00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:40.548
Reminds me of Shinichi somehow...

131
00:07:40.548 --> 00:07:42.278
Oh, Ran-kun, I almost forgot!

132
00:07:42.278 --> 00:07:45.858
Do you think you could let him
stay at your house for a little while?

133
00:07:45.858 --> 00:07:47.008
What the heck are you...?

134
00:07:47.858 --> 00:07:50.108
His parents are in the hospital
after getting into an accident.

135
00:07:50.108 --> 00:07:54.818
They asked me to look after him,
but I live a bachelor's life, so...

136
00:07:54.818 --> 00:07:57.568
Sure, but I'll have to ask my dad first.

137
00:07:57.568 --> 00:08:00.068
Right! So, you're willing to take him in?

138
00:08:00.068 --> 00:08:01.238
Isn't that great news, Conan?

139
00:08:01.698 --> 00:08:05.398
What happens if Ran finds out
who I really am while I'm there?!

140
00:08:05.398 --> 00:08:07.528
The first step to turning
you back to normal

141
00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:11.248
is finding the men in black
who used that drug on you!

142
00:08:11.738 --> 00:08:14.148
And Ran-kun's house
is a detective agency!

143
00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:16.528
Her dad might run across
information about them!

144
00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:17.628
Exactly!

145
00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:24.338
Say, Conan-kun...

146
00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:27.068
Yeah?

147
00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:28.798
I'll never get used to this name!

148
00:08:29.238 --> 00:08:31.148
Is there anyone you like?

149
00:08:31.148 --> 00:08:34.268
Like a girl at school or someone?

150
00:08:34.568 --> 00:08:36.728
No, none at all.

151
00:08:37.278 --> 00:08:40.188
There's someone I really like, though!

152
00:08:41.358 --> 00:08:45.448
Don't tell me it's that Shinichi boy
you were looking for earlier?

153
00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:48.408
That's right!

154
00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:51.988
He's always been kind of
a tease since he was a kid,

155
00:08:51.988 --> 00:08:54.058
and he's always been so full of himself
and a big mystery geek,

156
00:08:54.058 --> 00:08:59.628
but he's also courageous,
cool, and dependable!

157
00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:03.548
I really like Shinichi a lot!

158
00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:08.528
But keep this a secret from him!

159
00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:12.738
Here we are! This is my house!

160
00:09:12.738 --> 00:09:15.358
It's almost like I've gained
a cute little brother!

161
00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:17.478
It's like I can talk to you
about anything, Conan-kun!

162
00:09:18.148 --> 00:09:19.268
Ran...

163
00:09:19.898 --> 00:09:21.478
Let me introduce you to my dad!
Follow me!

164
00:09:23.988 --> 00:09:26.238
Um, Ran...

165
00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:29.818
I-I'm actually...

166
00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:32.868
I'm really...

167
00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:34.778
I got one! I got one!

168
00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:36.708
Dad!

169
00:09:37.358 --> 00:09:39.198
My first job in 6 months!

170
00:09:39.198 --> 00:09:41.028
Someone kidnapped
a rich guy's daughter!

171
00:09:41.028 --> 00:09:42.628
Some guy dressed in black!

172
00:09:42.628 --> 00:09:45.488
A man dressed in black?!

173
00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.058
Taxi!

174
00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:52.898
Conan-kun!

175
00:09:57.988 --> 00:09:59.738
This case is calling my name!

176
00:09:59.738 --> 00:10:03.448
Calling for the famous detective
known as Kogoro Mori!

177
00:10:05.358 --> 00:10:07.238
Why are you here?!

178
00:10:07.238 --> 00:10:09.278
Because he got in before
I could stop him!

179
00:10:09.278 --> 00:10:11.568
I'm riding in a car! Yay!

180
00:10:11.568 --> 00:10:12.898
So, who is he?!

181
00:10:12.898 --> 00:10:14.658
He belongs to a relative
of Professor Agasa!

182
00:10:14.658 --> 00:10:17.068
I don't need you bothering
me while I work! Get out!

183
00:10:17.068 --> 00:10:19.988
We can't get out!
We're on a freeway!

184
00:10:22.898 --> 00:10:25.498
The person kidnapped
was my only daughter.

185
00:10:25.498 --> 00:10:27.958
Akiko Tani. 10 years old.

186
00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.898
My butler Asao saw the
perpetrator with his own eyes.

187
00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:33.238
Darn, I can't see the picture.

188
00:10:33.238 --> 00:10:35.028
Being so small is such a pain!

189
00:10:37.498 --> 00:10:39.518
What was the surrounding situation
like when she was kidnapped?

190
00:10:40.448 --> 00:10:42.238
Who is this boy?

191
00:10:42.238 --> 00:10:43.898
Just an acquaintance...

192
00:10:44.238 --> 00:10:46.358
Ran! Watch him!

193
00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:49.438
Well then, Asao-san, please
explain in detail what happened.

194
00:10:50.068 --> 00:10:54.898
It occurred when she went to play
outside after returning from school.

195
00:10:56.148 --> 00:11:00.118
A man dressed in black suddenly
appeared from a corner of the garden!

196
00:11:00.778 --> 00:11:02.898
Give this message to her father.

197
00:11:02.898 --> 00:11:07.898
If he wants his daughter back,
he'll shut down his company for 1 month.

198
00:11:07.898 --> 00:11:11.548
Get the police involved
and she's as good as dead!

199
00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:13.028
Upon leaving those words,

200
00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:15.528
the kidnapper scaled a pine
tree and escaped outside!

201
00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:17.508
Did this man have any
special characteristics?

202
00:11:17.858 --> 00:11:20.198
My eyes aren't what
they used to be, so...

203
00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:21.738
That's too bad...

204
00:11:23.778 --> 00:11:27.568
You shouldn't get in the way
of my dad's work, Conan-kun...

205
00:11:27.898 --> 00:11:32.528
Did anyone else hear the kidnapper's
voice or any sounds out of the ordinary?

206
00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:38.988
No. Other than Asao-san's shouts
for help, it was completely quiet.

207
00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:42.408
Which means Asao-san was the
only one who saw the perpetrator.

208
00:11:42.408 --> 00:11:46.878
Judging from the demands, the kidnapper
is likely someone from a rival company.

209
00:11:46.878 --> 00:11:50.738
Damn it! To think they would
want money on top of that demand!

210
00:11:50.938 --> 00:11:51.948
Money?!

211
00:11:51.948 --> 00:11:53.588
There was a phone call just now!

212
00:11:54.058 --> 00:11:56.728
They demanded that I prepare
300 million, all in used bills!

213
00:11:56.728 --> 00:11:59.058
There must be some sort of mistake, sir!

214
00:11:59.058 --> 00:12:01.018
Silence! You will remain quiet!

215
00:12:01.018 --> 00:12:04.728
Which companies stand to gain something
if your company shuts down?

216
00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:08.808
There's something not right
about this incident.

217
00:12:08.808 --> 00:12:11.938
Why did the perpetrator
kidnap her inside her home?

218
00:12:11.938 --> 00:12:14.738
It would've been easier on
her way home from school.

219
00:12:14.738 --> 00:12:18.398
And being clearly seen is too careless.

220
00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:24.688
But demanding used bills
is oddly cautious...

221
00:12:24.688 --> 00:12:27.648
Oh, you're really good
at soccer, Conan-kun!

222
00:12:27.648 --> 00:12:28.958
I guess so.

223
00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:32.898
Shinichi would do that whenever
he was thinking about something.

224
00:12:32.898 --> 00:12:35.378
He said it would get his mind working.

225
00:12:35.768 --> 00:12:38.848
That Shinichi is me!

226
00:12:44.638 --> 00:12:46.228
Conan-kun!

227
00:12:53.068 --> 00:12:57.028
How rare it is for Jumbo to
be friendly with a stranger.

228
00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:04.978
The kidnapper climbed this pine tree
to break in and to get out.

229
00:13:04.978 --> 00:13:08.748
Which means this dog
must have barked at him!

230
00:13:08.748 --> 00:13:11.458
That's it! I've figured this case out!

231
00:13:11.768 --> 00:13:15.418
It sounds like this dog barks
at all strangers, doesn't it?

232
00:13:15.808 --> 00:13:19.388
Yes. Jumbo is one of the best
guard dogs around, after all.

233
00:13:19.388 --> 00:13:21.598
Wait, the servants said
that it was completely quiet

234
00:13:21.598 --> 00:13:24.768
except for when
the butler was yelling!

235
00:13:28.398 --> 00:13:30.358
And where are you going, Asao-san?

236
00:13:31.848 --> 00:13:33.608
He realized it!

237
00:13:33.848 --> 00:13:37.018
There's something strange
about your story!

238
00:13:37.018 --> 00:13:42.148
The kidnapper snuck in, took the girl,
and escaped using that tree!

239
00:13:42.148 --> 00:13:43.908
Yet the guard dog didn't bark!

240
00:13:44.518 --> 00:13:45.868
That's because...

241
00:13:45.868 --> 00:13:50.398
Plus your testimony
is too full of ambiguity!

242
00:13:50.398 --> 00:13:54.838
Was there really a man
dressed in black, Asao-san?

243
00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:58.758
Or shall I say, Kidnapper!

244
00:13:58.758 --> 00:14:01.218
Asao! How dare you!

245
00:14:01.438 --> 00:14:03.688
My deepest apologies, sir!

246
00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:05.558
What did you do this for?!

247
00:14:05.558 --> 00:14:07.178
Did someone put you up to it?!

248
00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:10.148
No, I did this entirely of my own accord!

249
00:14:10.678 --> 00:14:13.548
So, where is the girl now?

250
00:14:13.548 --> 00:14:15.108
A nearby hotel...

251
00:14:17.468 --> 00:14:19.488
Case closed!

252
00:14:19.488 --> 00:14:25.078
With Detective Kogoro Mori on the job,
no case goes unsolved!

253
00:14:25.508 --> 00:14:27.768
No! It's not over yet!

254
00:14:28.878 --> 00:14:31.698
There's still another side to this case!

255
00:14:42.004 --> 00:14:44.004
Sir! There's a phone call!

256
00:14:44.504 --> 00:14:47.174
I'm busy. Tell them to call back later!

257
00:14:47.174 --> 00:14:48.464
B-But...

258
00:14:50.174 --> 00:14:51.004
This is Tani.

259
00:14:51.004 --> 00:14:53.044
Is the 300 million ready?

260
00:14:54.174 --> 00:14:55.394
Who is this?!

261
00:14:57.674 --> 00:14:59.924
I called earlier.

262
00:14:59.924 --> 00:15:02.194
I'm the guy who kidnapped
your daughter.

263
00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:04.654
That's impossible!
The kidnapper has already...

264
00:15:04.964 --> 00:15:06.794
So, you did have help!

265
00:15:06.794 --> 00:15:09.614
No, I did it alone! Please believe me!

266
00:15:10.504 --> 00:15:13.294
This man is telling the truth.

267
00:15:13.294 --> 00:15:16.574
After being kidnapped
for the first time,

268
00:15:16.964 --> 00:15:21.504
she was most likely kidnapped
again by someone else.

269
00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:23.544
By someone much worse!

270
00:15:23.544 --> 00:15:25.004
Daddy! Help!

271
00:15:25.004 --> 00:15:26.004
Akiko!

272
00:15:28.254 --> 00:15:30.294
I'm an impatient man.

273
00:15:30.294 --> 00:15:32.634
Hurry and get the 300 million ready,

274
00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:34.434
or there's no telling what'll
happen to your daughter.

275
00:15:35.004 --> 00:15:37.464
Please! I'll get the money somehow!

276
00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:39.894
Just give Akiko back unharmed!

277
00:15:39.894 --> 00:15:44.004
Keep him talking and try
to find out his location!

278
00:15:44.004 --> 00:15:45.094
His location?

279
00:15:45.094 --> 00:15:46.354
Who's that?!

280
00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:48.334
Don't tell me it's the police.

281
00:15:48.334 --> 00:15:50.074
No! It isn't...

282
00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.034
Daddy! I'm in a storeroom of a school!

283
00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:54.584
I can see a big chimney
from the window-

284
00:15:54.584 --> 00:15:55.494
Akiko!

285
00:15:55.494 --> 00:15:57.544
I'll call again in one hour.

286
00:15:57.544 --> 00:15:59.084
Get the money ready by then!

287
00:16:01.174 --> 00:16:02.504
Big-mouthed brat.

288
00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:07.004
A big chimney visible
from a school storeroom

289
00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:09.504
isn't enough information to
pinpoint which school it is...

290
00:16:09.714 --> 00:16:13.544
At any rate, please buy us some
time by preparing the money.

291
00:16:13.544 --> 00:16:14.974
R-Right!

292
00:16:18.674 --> 00:16:21.174
The kidnapper's nervous now
that we know his location!

293
00:16:21.174 --> 00:16:23.354
If we don't rescue
the little girl soon...

294
00:16:23.354 --> 00:16:25.924
What're you doing, Conan-kun?

295
00:16:25.924 --> 00:16:28.714
It hasn't been very long
since she was kidnapped,

296
00:16:28.714 --> 00:16:31.324
so I figured they might
be somewhere nearby...

297
00:16:31.634 --> 00:16:32.754
That's right!

298
00:16:32.754 --> 00:16:36.334
There's no way he could have
gotten far with a little girl with him!

299
00:16:36.334 --> 00:16:39.784
If we limit it to the nearby area,
that leaves only so many schools to check!

300
00:16:39.784 --> 00:16:41.534
Conan-kun, where are you going?!

301
00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.204
Ran! After that dog!

302
00:16:43.204 --> 00:16:43.794
Right!

303
00:16:48.334 --> 00:16:50.834
The chimney she sees is probably
either a factory or a bathhouse!

304
00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:53.924
There are only 5 schools in the
area where you can see chimneys!

305
00:17:06.674 --> 00:17:07.814
No!

306
00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:09.774
No!

307
00:17:10.674 --> 00:17:12.384
Not here either!

308
00:17:12.384 --> 00:17:15.334
Darn it! It wasn't any of them!

309
00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:18.464
There aren't any other schools
that have views of chimneys!

310
00:17:18.464 --> 00:17:20.694
They must not be
in this area after all!

311
00:17:25.534 --> 00:17:27.464
Wait a second! Just maybe...

312
00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:47.814
This is it!

313
00:17:48.384 --> 00:17:51.274
She saw this building from the
side and mistook it for a chimney!

314
00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:54.754
Schools in this vicinity that
have a side view of this building...

315
00:17:57.284 --> 00:17:58.624
Futatsubashi Middle School!

316
00:18:00.624 --> 00:18:03.624
Place the money on the
bench in Hyakujii Park.

317
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.834
Once I have it in my hands,
I'll return the girl.

318
00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:08.534
Let me hear Akiko's voice
one more time!

319
00:18:08.534 --> 00:18:10.264
You'll have plenty of time
later to hear it.

320
00:18:12.204 --> 00:18:14.034
We've come to an agreement.

321
00:18:14.034 --> 00:18:16.964
Which means your role
is just about over with.

322
00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:22.144
Not so fast!

323
00:18:25.534 --> 00:18:27.164
Who's there?! Where are you?!

324
00:18:27.164 --> 00:18:28.134
Right here!

325
00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:37.494
It's alright now.

326
00:18:37.494 --> 00:18:39.084
Who are you?

327
00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.204
Shinichi Kudo...

328
00:18:40.204 --> 00:18:44.074
...I mean, Conan Edogawa. A detective!

329
00:18:44.584 --> 00:18:45.954
A detective?

330
00:18:50.204 --> 00:18:53.334
Don't be mockin' me,
you little brat!

331
00:18:57.284 --> 00:19:01.444
Darn it! I can't put any power
into it with my body so small!

332
00:19:03.204 --> 00:19:05.434
How about this?!

333
00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:08.774
No good! My soccer kicks
have weakened, too!

334
00:19:18.204 --> 00:19:20.534
Even if I do find the criminals,

335
00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:24.614
in my smaller body, I can't even
capture them or beat them up!

336
00:19:24.614 --> 00:19:27.584
Playtime's over! Say your prayers!

337
00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:28.664
Stop!

338
00:19:31.164 --> 00:19:32.294
It's all over!

339
00:19:34.784 --> 00:19:36.044
Ran!

340
00:19:48.394 --> 00:19:50.354
Talk about strong!

341
00:19:50.584 --> 00:19:52.204
Everything's okay now!

342
00:19:52.204 --> 00:19:53.874
How did you know to come here?

343
00:19:53.874 --> 00:19:57.314
I followed you and then I saw
Jumbo jump out from here!

344
00:20:00.334 --> 00:20:01.994
Jumbo!

345
00:20:01.994 --> 00:20:04.824
So, you're the one behind this!

346
00:20:05.284 --> 00:20:09.534
Kidnapping case? Detective
Kogoro Mori is your man!

347
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.554
Gimme a break.

348
00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:19.714
I was the one who came up
with the idea to kidnap me!

349
00:20:19.994 --> 00:20:22.014
What?!

350
00:20:22.014 --> 00:20:26.334
Daddy's always too busy
with work to care about me...

351
00:20:26.334 --> 00:20:30.534
So, I had Asao-san "kidnap" me.

352
00:20:30.534 --> 00:20:32.434
I thought I could get Daddy
to spend time with me

353
00:20:32.434 --> 00:20:35.124
if his company had to take a break!

354
00:20:37.244 --> 00:20:41.864
I see. So, the first
kidnapping was a fake.

355
00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:44.204
Even if my daughter
did ask for your help,

356
00:20:44.204 --> 00:20:46.704
I find it difficult to
forgive what you've done!

357
00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.034
I assume you realize this, Asao?!

358
00:20:48.034 --> 00:20:49.324
Yes.

359
00:20:49.664 --> 00:20:50.804
As punishment,

360
00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:53.084
you will make arrangements for a
1-week trip that starts tomorrow!

361
00:20:53.084 --> 00:20:56.044
A trip to Australia, where
Akiko has always wanted to go!

362
00:20:56.044 --> 00:20:57.924
S-Sir!

363
00:20:57.924 --> 00:21:01.494
She and I will be going
there together, of course!

364
00:21:01.494 --> 00:21:02.464
Daddy!

365
00:21:05.924 --> 00:21:08.954
Letting the dog go so he could find
my daughter was a stroke of genius.

366
00:21:08.954 --> 00:21:11.144
You truly are a great detective!

367
00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:14.814
No, it's because of all
the experience I've had!

368
00:21:14.814 --> 00:21:18.534
Who are you to talk?
I was the one who found him...

369
00:21:18.534 --> 00:21:21.164
I will express my gratitude
to you another day.

370
00:21:21.164 --> 00:21:22.984
Right! I'm looking forward to it!

371
00:21:25.694 --> 00:21:27.954
Thanks, Mr. Detective!

372
00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:31.494
Mr. Detective?

373
00:21:31.494 --> 00:21:36.244
No, she means him, not me!

374
00:21:41.084 --> 00:21:43.584
Say, Dad, about this boy...

375
00:21:44.354 --> 00:21:47.344
Professor Agasa asked if
we would take care of him...

376
00:21:50.264 --> 00:21:52.724
You're against it?

377
00:21:54.284 --> 00:21:55.404
Sure thing!

378
00:21:55.404 --> 00:21:59.234
I got a job the instant he showed up,
and then I solved it like an ace!

379
00:21:59.234 --> 00:22:01.114
He just might be a
god of good fortune!

380
00:22:01.114 --> 00:22:04.694
Stay with us and become my son!

381
00:23:48.324 --> 00:23:50.944
I just transferred here!
My name's Conan Edogawa!

382
00:23:50.944 --> 00:23:51.964
Nice to meet you!

383
00:23:53.864 --> 00:23:57.654
I have to go back to
grade school again?

384
00:24:00.631 --> 00:24:02.161
The one responsible...

385
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:03.741
...is you!

386
00:24:04.711 --> 00:24:08.461
If Shinichi were here,
he'd easily solve this case.

387
00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:14.001
Where could that
mystery nerd have gone?

388
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:14.881
Hot!

389
00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:17.591
Mori-kun! You were right!

390
00:24:17.591 --> 00:24:19.841
I've changed my mind about you,
"Great Detective"!

391
00:24:20.131 --> 00:24:24.311
I could never do that. I could never
be as strong as Yoko-san...

392
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:26.131
On the next Conan--

393
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:29.501
A Murder Behind the Locked Doors
of a Celebrity's Apartment.

394
00:24:45.921 --> 00:24:48.461
Next Conan's Hint:

395
00:24:48.461 --> 00:24:49.901
Ice.
