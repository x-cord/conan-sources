1
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:05,824
This way, this way!

2
00:00:05,824 --> 00:00:08,124
We've got a grave case!

3
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:11,024
We need your help, Detective Mouri!

4
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:12,224
I mean,

5
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:15,724
why do I have to keep kids company from so early in the morning.

6
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:18,124
You're the one who accepted the request, didn't you, Dad?

7
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:23,124
I didn't know that Yoko was going to be on this morning's Wide Show!

8
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,324
Everybody's so energetic from morning.

9
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:26,924
You can say that again.

10
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:29,724
Aim for a 100% solution.

11
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:31,924
Clear all mysteries and codes.

12
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:33,624
In flower gardens usually seen at district centers.

13
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:35,624
A twisted trick of a person who plunges to death.

14
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:37,324
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:39,224
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:39,224 --> 00:00:41,824
His name is Detective Conan.

17
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:32,462
"Flower Garden Vandalism Conspiracy"

18
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:38,262
Beikacho district center?

19
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:41,662
Yeah, it's a facility where the local people can enjoy sports

20
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,962
or spend their time freely doing what they want.

21
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:48,162
At any rate, I don't smell anything fishy here.

22
00:02:49,162 --> 00:02:50,862
Over here!

23
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,362
"Children's Flowerbed"

24
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:56,762
Isn't this terrible?

25
00:02:56,762 --> 00:03:00,662
It's all messed up like a whirlwind went by or something!

26
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:03,962
The children all take care of this flower garden

27
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:08,462
from giving water to growing the flowers and plants.

28
00:03:08,462 --> 00:03:12,262
And yet now days every morning it's always messed up like this.

29
00:03:12,262 --> 00:03:14,362
Talk about nasty!

30
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:16,662
So, Mr. Mouri, please catch the culprit.

31
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:20,062
Discuss it with your teacher or mother.

32
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:21,462
Dad!

33
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:24,862
So, I guess it's impossible to ask Detective Mouri

34
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:26,062
to handle this case after all.

35
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:30,162
And yet, when we called him a while ago, he said, "Leave it to me".

36
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:31,462
Right, Genta?

37
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,362
What's the matter?

38
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:35,962
Strange.

39
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:37,262
What's wrong?

40
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:40,062
The brick that I made is gone.

41
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:43,162
It was around here somewhere before.

42
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,162
Maybe the one who vandalized this garden,

43
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:46,862
carelessly stepped on it or something and cracked it?

44
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,262
Darn! What a rat!

45
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:52,362
Let's nab the one who's messing up the flower garden with our own hands!

46
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,162
Let's catch him!

47
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:55,262
Yes!

48
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:57,262
No, children can't possibly handle it alone.

49
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:59,562
The one who's messing up the flower garden is doing so at night,

50
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:01,262
so there has to be an adult around.

51
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:06,062
Come on, Dad! Promise made is to be kept!

52
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:09,662
So, here comes the great detective.

53
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:12,662
I'm in no mood to babysit.

54
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:15,562
You've all come?

55
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,762
Who's that beauty?

56
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,762
Good morning, Ms. Yamazaki and Saki!

57
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:26,862
"Toshiko Yamazaki (43), Town Centre Staff Member"

58
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:30,462
It sure is upsetting to see it messed up like this every morning.

59
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:33,562
Are you an employee at this center, Miss?

60
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:37,262
"Saki Okamura (24), Town Centre Staff Member" -Yes, and who are you?

61
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:40,962
Yes, I am the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

62
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:44,362
who has been asked to investigate the flower garden vandalism.

63
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,562
You're a detective?

64
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:48,562
Hey! Stop dilly-dallying

65
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:50,662
and hurry up and clean up!

66
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:51,862
Yes, ma'am!

67
00:04:51,862 --> 00:04:53,562
If you will excuse me.

68
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,262
Thank you for your patronage.

69
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:03,062
Oh. You're doing it all wrong.

70
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:05,262
"Ryunosuke Okuda (57)" -When amateurs do the flower garden,

71
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,062
"Flower Shop Owner" -they really spoil it.

72
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:08,762
We did ask you to deliver things,

73
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:11,362
but we never asked you to put in your two cents!

74
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,762
I wish you would leave fixing the garden to we professionals.

75
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:16,062
I'll keep the price down.

76
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:20,062
Young plants, fertilizers and the manual labor

77
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:21,962
it takes for fixing up, everything included.

78
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:24,262
I said, we don't need your two cents talk.

79
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:25,362
I tell you, people are all only interested

80
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:28,762
in ripping money off from each other.

81
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,762
People are all?

82
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:34,562
Then, with discount and all, how's this?

83
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:38,662
I'm sorry, as you can see, Ms. Yamazaki isn't interested.

84
00:05:38,662 --> 00:05:40,562
You stay out of it!

85
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:43,162
Hey, just what do you think you're doing?

86
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:46,962
Shut up! This property was originally mine,

87
00:05:46,962 --> 00:05:48,962
so it's up to me what I want to do with it!

88
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:51,462
Miss, are you all right?

89
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:54,162
Yes, I'm fine.

90
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:56,562
I, the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri,

91
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:58,762
won't let anyone who gets violent

92
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:00,562
with beautiful ladies get away with it.

93
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:03,162
A detective?

94
00:06:09,162 --> 00:06:11,862
So then, the one who's messing up the flower garden

95
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:14,262
does so between the time

96
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,562
after the employees leave at sundown and the following morning.

97
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:18,962
Since when has this started happening?

98
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,562
It's the 3rd day already.

99
00:06:20,562 --> 00:06:23,862
I'm sorry, I'm so busy in the morning.

100
00:06:23,862 --> 00:06:26,362
So, that's it for playing detective!

101
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:27,662
By the way,

102
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:31,662
do you know of anyone who may want to harass the district center?

103
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:33,662
Maybe just one.

104
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:36,962
Oh, you mean him?

105
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,762
Go! It's time for children to go to school!

106
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:44,762
"Workshop"

107
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:47,862
The brick of the flower garden. Did you make it here?

108
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:51,862
Yes. Each is of different size and shape

109
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:55,262
because the children all baked it themselves.

110
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:56,762
The one who's messing up the flower garden

111
00:06:56,762 --> 00:07:00,362
is stomping all over the hearts of the children.

112
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:01,362
I'm sure that the culprit will come

113
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,962
and mess up the flower garden tonight again.

114
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:05,862
What happens three times will happen for the fourth time!

115
00:07:05,862 --> 00:07:08,362
Let's go on night patrol with Mr. Mouri

116
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,162
and nab the culprit!

117
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:17,762
They're really all out to go for it.

118
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:19,762
I see, is that right?

119
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,962
Your parents run a cafe.

120
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:24,862
I pass by that area a lot too.

121
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,862
Please do stop by one day.

122
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,762
I can at least serve you beer.

123
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,162
Really?

124
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:33,062
Why should it be one day? I'll go tonight!

125
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,162
Tonight?

126
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,662
Geez, cut out the intimate act!

127
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:39,262
Uncle Kogoro.

128
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:41,462
We want to go on night patrol

129
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,362
to catch the one who's messing up the flower garden.

130
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:45,862
Is 20:00 okay?

131
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:48,562
Okay, okay.

132
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:51,562
You're really reliable, aren't you?

133
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:53,462
Yes, I am, as you can see.

134
00:07:53,462 --> 00:07:55,762
I guess it's embedded in the character of a detective

135
00:07:55,762 --> 00:07:58,062
to punish the strong and help the weak.

136
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:05,662
Come on, you people, I shall see you to school!

137
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:07,962
I'll be waiting for you tonight then.

138
00:08:08,962 --> 00:08:10,262
That's right.

139
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,362
Wait a minute, Ayumi.

140
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:14,162
Here, it's for you.

141
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,262
It's what I promised to give you last time.

142
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:20,062
It blooms at night. I took it from my garden.

143
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:22,962
Wow, super. Thank you very much.

144
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,162
I've got one more, so here's one for you too.

145
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:28,162
Thank you very much.

146
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,162
Here's another serving.

147
00:08:35,162 --> 00:08:38,162
Thank you, Saki.

148
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,362
Welcome.

149
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:41,762
My.

150
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:45,862
You're...

151
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,862
Since my mother's taking a trip now,

152
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,762
I'm part-timing here at night.

153
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,962
This is a nice shop.

154
00:08:51,962 --> 00:08:54,262
It's your parent's home.

155
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:58,162
Yes, they live on the 2nd floor up.

156
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,762
Would you like something to drink?

157
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:03,762
Thank you, but I'm sorry, we just came to get Dad.

158
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:07,462
You promised Ayumi and the others at 20:00, don't you, Dad?

159
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:11,062
How can I go home without drinking Saki's beer!

160
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,762
He's not going to budge an inch.

161
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,962
I'm sorry, I made him drink so much.

162
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:20,162
Geez.

163
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,862
We're late because of Pops.

164
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:29,962
It's already 22:00. Maybe the culprit's left already.

165
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:33,362
I wonder if the children's flower garden is okay?

166
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:37,262
The flowers.

167
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:41,762
What's the matter?

168
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,362
She is employee, Ms. Yamazaki.

169
00:09:50,362 --> 00:09:53,062
Ran, call the ambulance and the police!

170
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:54,562
Okay!

171
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:59,862
Conan, look at that.

172
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:05,362
This flower petal.

173
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:08,262
Pops! Somebody fled!

174
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:11,562
You're not getting away!

175
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:23,362
Caught him...

176
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:24,562
It's him!

177
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,762
He is from the flower shop!

178
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:41,812
The victim is an employee of the district center, Ms. Toshiko Yamazaki.

179
00:10:41,812 --> 00:10:45,712
The estimated time of death is around 20:00.

180
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,412
Although she had bruises all over her body, the direct cause of death

181
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:53,112
seems to be the impact of hitting her head on the brick.

182
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:56,912
The wound on her head matched the brick that was beside her.

183
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:59,012
The brick is said to be one that the children baked on their own

184
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,012
and can only be found here.

185
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:02,412
The person who found the body was...

186
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,712
Children shouldn't be walking around so late at night like this.

187
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,912
We were going after the one who was messing up the flower garden!

188
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:10,812
Mr. Mouri, chaperoned us!

189
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,212
Okay, okay.

190
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:15,512
And, who is he?

191
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:18,212
He's Mr. Okuda who owns a flower shop nearby.

192
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:22,212
When the body was found, he was hiding, then fled,

193
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,912
so we nabbed him.

194
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:29,012
That man hates our district center.

195
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:30,012
You are?

196
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:32,612
A colleague of Ms. Yamazaki who passed away.

197
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:37,312
That man used to be a florist here until a year ago,

198
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:40,312
but he evicted when the district center was built.

199
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,012
He still has a grudge against that even now

200
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:44,012
and comes to mess the flower garden up every night.

201
00:11:44,012 --> 00:11:46,912
Right. Since my shop was forced out of here,

202
00:11:46,912 --> 00:11:49,512
my business stopped going well.

203
00:11:49,512 --> 00:11:52,012
It's only natural that I get pissed, right?

204
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:55,012
I did mess the flower garden up.

205
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:59,112
But, when I came today, the flower garden was already a mess,

206
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:01,512
and that woman was lying on the ground.

207
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:04,712
Inspector!

208
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,312
From the circumstances, Ms. Yamazaki probably

209
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:11,112
fell from around there of the emergency stairs.

210
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:13,612
Yes. According to forensics,

211
00:12:13,612 --> 00:12:16,212
on the 3rd floor landing of the emergency stairs

212
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:19,212
there were traces of struggle seen from the shoe prints

213
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:22,412
of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda's gardening boots.

214
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:24,312
I got it, Inspector.

215
00:12:24,312 --> 00:12:26,612
In other words, at 20:00.

216
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,612
Mr. Okuda at that landing, got into an argument with Ms. Yamazaki

217
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:33,512
and after struggling with each other, pushed her off.

218
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:35,912
At that time, he was scared and fled,

219
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:39,112
but came back around 22:00 to check things out

220
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:42,712
and ran into us who came on night patrol.

221
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:43,812
No!

222
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:47,612
That's the only place in the center where smoking is allowed,

223
00:12:47,612 --> 00:12:50,012
so I took a puff there when I arrived in the morning.

224
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:52,612
Then, that woman came to chase me out,

225
00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,612
and we got into a small brawl.

226
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:58,512
And? How about 20:00?

227
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:02,012
Could you tell me where and what you were doing?

228
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:05,312
At that time, I went to deliver bouquets,

229
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:08,712
but maybe it was a prank. The address wasn't correct.

230
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:11,412
I was driving around the night road on my compact truck.

231
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,012
Was anybody with you

232
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:14,612
or can somebody verify that for you?

233
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:15,712
No.

234
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,912
I see, so you have no alibi.

235
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:21,512
At any rate, please come to the station.

236
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:22,512
Hey!

237
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,012
Yes, sir!

238
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:29,312
I didn't do anything. It's some kind of mistake!

239
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:30,912
But,

240
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:34,912
what on earth did Ms. Yamazaki come to do here at 8:00 at night?

241
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:39,212
I think Ms. Yamazaki came to look for this.

242
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:41,112
I'm in charge of accounting,

243
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,512
but the books didn't balance out lately.

244
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:46,112
It seems the operating fees are being embezzled.

245
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:47,212
Embezzled?

246
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:48,312
Yes.

247
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:51,112
Ms. Yamazaki is probably the one who embezzled he money.

248
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:52,712
I think she realized that I was checking into it

249
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:56,112
and came to the center at night to hide the evidence.

250
00:13:56,112 --> 00:13:59,112
But, I hid the accounting books, so...

251
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:02,312
I see! So, she ran into Mr. Okuda then,

252
00:14:02,312 --> 00:14:06,112
and was pushed off from the emergency stairs, eh?

253
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,012
The story fits right in.

254
00:14:08,012 --> 00:14:09,612
Just as expected of the famed detective.

255
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:11,212
What a wonderful deduction.

256
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:14,812
Well, I can do this hands down.

257
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:23,812
It seems you're not convinced about the suspect being arrested.

258
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,512
Look.

259
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:28,812
What's that line?

260
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:31,312
It looks like a string or something was dragged along.

261
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:33,912
Ms. Yamazaki's shoestring probably came off

262
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:36,412
when they got into a struggle.

263
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:38,312
But, isn't that strange?

264
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:42,512
Yeah. The shoestring of the corpse was tied nicely.

265
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:45,812
Which means...

266
00:14:49,112 --> 00:14:50,712
Officer Takagi.

267
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:54,212
What about the flower petal that was on the clothes of the corpse?

268
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:56,212
You mean this?

269
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:58,412
She fell onto the flower garden after all, you see.

270
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:02,012
It's not strange that a flower petal would be found on her clothes but...

271
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:04,012
Have the forensic check it anyway!

272
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:05,312
Yes, sir!

273
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:13,812
It seems that the flower petal is not from this flower garden, is it?

274
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:14,912
No.

275
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:19,112
And besides, the color was lighter than when it was first found.

276
00:15:19,112 --> 00:15:21,112
Maybe?

277
00:15:23,412 --> 00:15:25,612
Is this the bag you received today?

278
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:28,512
Right.

279
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,612
I see. So, that's the story!

280
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:34,012
But, I don't have the evidence necessary.

281
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:36,912
But, it's good that the culprit was arrested.

282
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:38,212
That's right.

283
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:40,912
Moreover, the flower garden won't be vandalized again.

284
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:43,012
It's not good at all!

285
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:47,212
It hasn't been solved where my brick disappeared to!

286
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:51,912
The evidence should most likely still be there.

287
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:05,012
Hiding evidence, eh?

288
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:08,412
So, you were the real culprit after all.

289
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:11,912
Well, I was almost deceived.

290
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:15,512
A corpse full of bruises.

291
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:17,912
The brick that was next to it.

292
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,912
No matter how you look at it,

293
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,912
Ms. Yamazaki looked to have fallen to her death

294
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,012
from the emergency stairs, you see.

295
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:25,812
On the landing of the stairs,

296
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:29,312
the shoeprints of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda were found.

297
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:32,812
The way it is, it could only look as if Mr. Okuda

298
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:34,412
who had a grudge against the district center

299
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,212
pushed Ms. Yamazaki to her death.

300
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:40,312
You tried to frame Mr. Okuda who had no alibi up as the culprit,

301
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:42,612
but made two small mistakes.

302
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:46,612
The first is the victim's shoelaces.

303
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:48,112
On the landing of the stairs,

304
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:50,512
other than the shoeprints of Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda,

305
00:16:50,512 --> 00:16:54,012
there were traces of a string being dragged.

306
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,812
Most likely, when the two got into a struggle,

307
00:16:56,812 --> 00:17:00,012
Ms. Yamazaki's shoestring untied.

308
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:01,212
But,

309
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:05,312
The shoestring of the corpse that was lying in the flower garden was tied.

310
00:17:05,312 --> 00:17:11,512
Which means that Ms. Yamazaki didn't fall then.

311
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:14,212
Ah, the flowers that are in bloom on the counter

312
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,312
and the yard are beautiful.

313
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:20,312
The flower that blooms so late at night, is it an evening primrose?

314
00:17:20,312 --> 00:17:23,512
Even primroses are white when they bloom at sundown,

315
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:28,012
but are said to gradually turn pink deeper into the night it gets.

316
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:32,012
The evening primrose was the other mistake you made.

317
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:34,712
Evening primroses bloom only at night,

318
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:37,412
so they are not grown in the children's flower garden.

319
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,712
Despite, this,

320
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:42,012
the petal of this flower was found stuck to the back of the corpse.

321
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:52,312
The fragrance of the evening primrose lead me to you, the real culprit.

322
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:54,512
Isn't that right, Ms. Okamura?

323
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:58,012
I have no idea what you are talking about.

324
00:17:58,012 --> 00:18:01,312
As for the shoestring maybe somebody tied it for her?

325
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:04,312
Evening primroses can be found anywhere too, can't they?

326
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:08,312
Even the police say that the culprit is that garden vandalist man.

327
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:13,312
Right, everyone knew that Mr. Okuda was the vandalist.

328
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:15,112
He was in need of money,

329
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:17,812
so messed up gardens in order to sell young plants or bulbs.

330
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:21,012
And was trying to get jobs to fix the gardens.

331
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:26,112
So you schemed to frame Mr. Okuda up.

332
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:29,712
You witnessed Ms. Yamazaki and Mr. Okuda fighting with each other

333
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:34,612
on the landing in the morning, and decided to create a crime scene there.

334
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:37,112
And in order to get rid of Mr. Okuda's alibi,

335
00:18:37,112 --> 00:18:39,412
you put in an order giving him false address

336
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:41,712
to make a delivery at 20:00.

337
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:43,412
What do you think you're saying?

338
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:46,712
Ms. Yamazaki died at 20:00, right?

339
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:50,112
At that time, I was part-timing at this shop,

340
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:53,312
and didn't go out anywhere between the hours of 19:00 to 21:30.

341
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:56,412
You should know because you were with me right through.

342
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:59,212
It's true that it's more than 5 kilometers from this shop

343
00:18:59,212 --> 00:19:00,712
to the district center.

344
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:04,312
And it would at least take 10 minutes even to go and come back by car.

345
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,812
That's an interesting deduction,

346
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:10,812
but the most important part seems to be missing.

347
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:12,712
When Ms. Yamazaki fell to her death,

348
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:15,912
I wasn't able to be there.

349
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:19,312
The key is the brick.

350
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:22,312
You took advantage of the vandalism case that started 3 days ago,

351
00:19:22,312 --> 00:19:27,512
and started removing bricks from the garden without anyone noticing.

352
00:19:27,512 --> 00:19:30,812
And you lined it out on the garden of this cafe.

353
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:38,812
Ms. Yamazaki was not killed at the district center,

354
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:41,312
but rather, in this yard.

355
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,912
So, your alibi is not valid anymore.

356
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:49,012
In other words, this was a trick to fake the site of the crime!

357
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:52,712
Before opening the shop, you called Ms. Yamazaki over here,

358
00:19:52,712 --> 00:19:55,812
put her to sleep after making her sniff a drug upstairs

359
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:59,812
and worked from 19:00 to 21:30 at the cafe on the 1st floor

360
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,012
and established your alibi.

361
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,312
Part way through your part time work,

362
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,712
you left the shop for just 5 minutes around 20:00,

363
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:07,512
saying you had to use the restroom.

364
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:10,512
You put on the shoes of Ms. Yamazaki who was sleeping,

365
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,812
and pushed her off the 3rd floor window

366
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,712
onto the bricks that are lined out in the yard, and killed her.

367
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:17,912
At that time,

368
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:21,612
the petal of the evening primrose attached to the corpse's clothes.

369
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:25,312
After that, you hid the body into the trunk of your car,

370
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,012
and after closing the shop,

371
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:31,112
you carried the body to the district center by car.

372
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:34,312
In the morning after hearing the conversation between Ayumi and I,

373
00:20:34,312 --> 00:20:37,412
you knew that we were going on night patrol.

374
00:20:37,412 --> 00:20:39,512
So, you decided to go there before us, to set it up

375
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,612
so that we would be the first to discover the corpse.

376
00:20:41,612 --> 00:20:45,312
You probably thought that you'd have an immovable alibi.

377
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,012
Listening to you talk for a while,

378
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,012
isn't everything you said till now a nothing more than your imagination?

379
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:52,712
Do you have proof that I'm the culprit?

380
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:55,112
The bricks that you took from the center

381
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:56,912
should still be in your yard.

382
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,512
Hey, Conan!

383
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,412
Yes!

384
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:06,612
Oh! Just as you said, Pops, there are a lot of bricks!

385
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:08,812
After transporting the corpse,

386
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:11,712
you were called right away for interrogation,

387
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:15,712
so you wouldn't have had anytime to clean up your yard.

388
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:18,012
If we check the bricks,

389
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:22,612
a trace that Ms. Yamazaki was killed here should be detected.

390
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,612
This is just my deduction.

391
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:31,112
You're the one who embezzled the management money, no?

392
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:33,512
Ms. Yamazaki who started looking into the embezzlement

393
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:36,212
became a burden to you.

394
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,612
That's right. I was in debt

395
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,912
and although I part-timed at my mother's cafe at night,

396
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:43,612
I still couldn't pay up

397
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:46,912
and stole money from the center.

398
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:48,812
Yamazaki who realized this

399
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:52,312
threatened to fire me.

400
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:57,712
That's why I... That woman...

401
00:23:23,712 --> 00:23:27,012
My brick! I'm glad it's okay!

402
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:29,612
The brick that Genta baked...

403
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:31,712
Where? Where? What kind is it?

404
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,412
This.

405
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:37,612
-What? -Don't tell me this is...

406
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:39,312
Oh, you got it?

407
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:42,312
Right! Eels over rice!

408
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:45,612
-Not again. -Again?

409
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:47,812
Your feeling for eels over rice

410
00:23:47,812 --> 00:23:50,212
is strong as any brick could be.

411
00:23:52,012 --> 00:23:55,812
"Next Episode" -My older sister would never commit suicide!

412
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:57,712
You saw it yourself

413
00:23:57,712 --> 00:24:00,412
and yet why do you think she didn't?

414
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:01,912
But, something's funny.

415
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:04,312
For two people like that to be in the same school.

416
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:08,512
That's why I just can't believe that it was suicide!

417
00:24:08,512 --> 00:24:10,212
Well, in other words,

418
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:14,112
it's to convince that girl and make her give up.

419
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:16,512
This is also the duty of a great detective.

420
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:18,012
Next Conan,

421
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:22,112
"Girl's Academy's Window"

422
00:24:37,912 --> 00:24:40,112
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,412
"Step ladder"

424
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,812
Hey, wait up! I'm going to the next case!

425
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:47,012
Pops, you're too attracted to the title of next week's episode.
