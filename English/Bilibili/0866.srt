1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,410
Sorry, Furuya.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,510
They found out that I'm a secret police agent.

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,510
My only escape is...

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,710
to the underworld.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,410
See you.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,210
Zero.

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,910
Traitors...

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,910
shall be punished.

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,110
Right?

10
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,210
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

11
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,410
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,810
The truth behind Akai and Scotch's relationship.

13
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,910
The drama surrounding the Organization continues.

14
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,810
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,210
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:07,768
"The Traitor's Stage (Part 1)"

18
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:14,768
Bourbon?

19
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:17,268
Hey, Bourbon!

20
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:18,268
What?

21
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,868
What you mean?

22
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:24,568
You were supposed to turn right at that intersection.

23
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:28,568
I'm sorry, I was lost in thought.

24
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:30,968
My, it's so unlike you.

25
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:34,368
Which means you weren't listening to me?

26
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:36,468
I was.

27
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:39,468
Before it goes public,

28
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:42,668
all I have to do is crush it, correct?

29
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,668
The guy's a big shot.

30
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,068
If you find it hard to get close,

31
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:48,868
I can disguise you as one of his people.

32
00:03:48,868 --> 00:03:50,968
No need to worry.

33
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,268
I've got an idea of how to get close to him.

34
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:04,368
Gosh.

35
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,268
Why of all things does a sweet high school girl

36
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:07,868
on her way back from school

37
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:11,568
have to help clean up the room of a deduction freak who's not home?

38
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:17,968
Come on, Sonoko. It's only a once in a while thing.

39
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,668
Sorry.

40
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:24,768
Thank you so much for helping out.

41
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:28,968
This place is too spacious to clean by myself.

42
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,068
It's okay, because I love to clean.

43
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:33,568
Sonoko.

44
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:36,868
By the way, was her name Masumi Sera?

45
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:39,768
She didn't come.

46
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,968
We invited her over.

47
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:45,868
But she seems to be busy because she has to change hotels again.

48
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,468
I see.

49
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:50,568
But how nice to be able to live in a hotel.

50
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:51,968
Really?

51
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:54,268
Well, for a Ms. Richie like you living in large mansion,

52
00:04:54,268 --> 00:04:57,368
every day is like living in a hotel.

53
00:04:57,368 --> 00:05:01,968
Didn't you see any strange people around Ms. Sera?

54
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,168
For example, someone who is constantly on his guard,

55
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,568
and if someone is deemed to be dangerous, he has the power

56
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:08,668
to bring that person under his control in a matter of seconds.

57
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,468
A person called Asaka...

58
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:13,468
I'm sure that person hasn't come up front, though.

59
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:17,668
The name's not Asaka, but there is one person!

60
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,968
Was there anybody like that?

61
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:23,768
That person is you, Ran!

62
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:24,768
What?

63
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:27,668
Remember, you're my exclusive SP

64
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:32,068
that will take down anyone dangerous that appears before in an instant.

65
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:33,468
Listen...

66
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:34,768
Gosh.

67
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:39,068
That's right. Talking of Asaca...

68
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:41,468
The title of the new song that rock music Rokumichi Hado

69
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:44,768
is going to release is "ASACA".

70
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,468
He finally seems to have made the lyrics for a song

71
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:48,868
that he composed 17 years ago.

72
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:51,468
And he's going to sing it at his next live.

73
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,468
17 years ago?

74
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:56,668
But the title is a bit weird, right?

75
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:58,468
What do you mean by weird?

76
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:02,168
It was publicized on the internet in alphabet.

77
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,068
The title "ASACA" is spelled with a "C"

78
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:06,868
instead of the usual "K".

79
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,168
"KA" is spelled...

80
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,768
"CA?"

81
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:26,268
Why? Why is it spelled "CA" instead of "KA"?

82
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,568
I wonder.

83
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,868
I'm sure there's a reason!

84
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,468
Can't you come up with something?

85
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:34,268
If you want to know that badly, why don't you ask him personally?

86
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,268
What?

87
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:38,768
We're going to watch Rokumichi Hado's rehearsal soon,

88
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:40,468
so I'll take you there.

89
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:41,668
Really?

90
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,968
If it's okay with you,

91
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:47,168
could I go and watch that rehearsal with you?

92
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:48,668
You want to go too, Subaru?

93
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:51,268
I'm a great fan of Rokumichi Hado!

94
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,368
Okay! My pleasure!

95
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:57,668
By the way, when was that title announced on the internet?

96
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:00,268
Just last week.

97
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:02,068
It's a new song in 5 years, you see.

98
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,368
So it ranked high on the internet news.

99
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:06,268
Right, right.

100
00:07:06,268 --> 00:07:08,168
If so...

101
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:09,768
They've...

102
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:13,468
already...

103
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,668
seen it, too.

104
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,168
What?

105
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,868
We can't watch the rehearsal?

106
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:23,068
No joke?

107
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,868
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:28,668
The fact is, the lyrics for the new song hasn't been completed yet.

109
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:32,768
He wants to write the lyrics on stage with no audience,

110
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,268
so he says he wants to be left alone for two hours.

111
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:38,068
Do things like this happen often?

112
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:39,668
Yes, sometimes.

113
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,968
Well, let's just let him have it his way.

114
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:46,368
It seems that this live is going to be the last one for him, too.

115
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,168
Big!

116
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,468
Last?

117
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,868
Was the rumor about Mr. Hado retiring true?

118
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,468
Yes. We tried to stop him many times,

119
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,968
but it seems he's going to announce it to his fans at tomorrow's live.

120
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:02,368
So, did things get settled then?

121
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:06,068
It's unthinkable that he's resigning while still under contract.

122
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,868
"Hirokazu Kajitani (51), Magazine journalist" -If he insists on resigning,

123
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:09,668
his company said they would take it to court

124
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:13,668
and make him pay an exorbitant sum for breach of contract.

125
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,168
What's with you? Where'd you come in from?

126
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:19,168
Of course, I came in from the front entrance.

127
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:21,768
I bribed one of the staff

128
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,268
and got hold of this staff jumper, too.

129
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:27,168
More importantly, Ms. beautiful,

130
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:30,268
did you settle your side of the problem?

131
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:31,868
What problem?

132
00:08:31,868 --> 00:08:34,868
There's rumor going around that the title of his new song "ASACA"

133
00:08:34,868 --> 00:08:39,868
is actually the name of Hado's new girlfriend.

134
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:43,368
And you, who were his girl for years, got enraged

135
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:46,768
and got into a big fight with Hado telling him not to release the song.

136
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:48,768
Who on earth's saying that?

137
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:51,268
I hear that your editor bawled you out

138
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:54,168
because another magazine company scooped the article

139
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:57,368
on Hado resigning from his music career before you did!

140
00:08:57,368 --> 00:08:58,568
He bawled you out saying,

141
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:01,568
"what do you think you were glued to Hado for 15 years for"?

142
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:05,968
That's why I disguised myself as staff and came over.

143
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:11,268
I want to make an explosive comeback before Hado resigns.

144
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,668
You two over there!

145
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:16,768
Yes, sir!

146
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:19,068
He's not authorized personnel, so kick him out of here!

147
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:20,468
What?

148
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,568
Hey, I went out of my way to bribe my way in here, you know!

149
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,068
Let me at least have a short interview or something!

150
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:26,368
-Be quiet. -Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

151
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:28,568
Let go of me! Hey!

152
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,568
Shall we get going too, then?

153
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:33,768
I guess so, since we've got school tomorrow, too.

154
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:35,368
Are we leaving?

155
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,468
I'm sorry. But maybe that's better.

156
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:41,268
Because we don't know when rehearsal will start.

157
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:42,268
Yes.

158
00:09:42,268 --> 00:09:44,068
But if this is going to be his last live,

159
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:46,268
I think it'll be better to watch the rehearsal, no?

160
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,368
I hate to say this to you, Subaru...

161
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:50,768
But we're not that much a fan of his as you are.

162
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:51,868
What?

163
00:09:51,868 --> 00:09:55,068
Then, who was the one that wanted to come here?

164
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,968
Me.

165
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,868
I was saying that I'm a great fan of Mr. Hado at Poirot

166
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:09,968
then she made arrangements for me to come and watch his rehearsal.

167
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,068
It seems that Sonoko's family,

168
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,268
the Suzuki Financial group happened to be an investor

169
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:17,068
for the record company that he belongs to.

170
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:19,268
You're here too, Azusa?

171
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:22,368
You didn't seem interested at Poirot, though.

172
00:10:22,368 --> 00:10:24,168
I hid it at the shop,

173
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:26,568
but I'm actually a great fan of his, too!

174
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:28,268
So...

175
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:29,868
after finishing our shift at the shop,

176
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:33,568
I followed Mr. Amuro here!

177
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,268
I was surprised

178
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,668
when she called to me just as I was about to come in here.

179
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:41,868
Well, I explained to the staff

180
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:44,668
and had them let us through somehow, though.

181
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:49,468
Talk of being surprised, you came here too,

182
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:51,668
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

183
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,468
Thank you for the other day.

184
00:10:53,468 --> 00:10:56,468
Do you remember me?

185
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:59,468
Yes. You're...

186
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:03,668
The courier?

187
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:04,768
What?

188
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:07,268
Yes, sort of.

189
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:10,068
Okay, then you three fans, take your time and enjoy.

190
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:13,168
Hey, Conan, you're coming home with me.

191
00:11:13,168 --> 00:11:15,568
Wait!

192
00:11:15,568 --> 00:11:17,868
Azusa.

193
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:22,168
You like Mr. Hado because he's a great guitar player, right?

194
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:25,368
You're really good at playing the guitar too, Azusa.

195
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,668
Yes, of course!

196
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:32,468
I thought you said that you never touched the guitar before?

197
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:36,068
Remember the other day when we asked you to become one of our band members?

198
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:39,868
Oh, right. Back then, I was too embarrassed

199
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,868
to become a member of a high school girls band, you see.

200
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,968
So she's...

201
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:49,368
Vermouth after all!

202
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:52,968
If so, I'd better make Subaru get out of here as soon as possible.

203
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:56,368
Mr. Hado's best song is "Bloody Comet", right?

204
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:59,568
No, no. I prefer "Fallen Angel of Snow".

205
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,968
They're enjoying chatting together.

206
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,868
Subaru.

207
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:08,268
No good, we've got to get out of here quick.

208
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:12,068
No pain no gain.

209
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:14,568
But better bend than break.

210
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:26,368
We've come for fire inspection.

211
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:28,868
We're confirming the fire equipment.

212
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:31,968
-You two. -Wait! Inside...

213
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:22,735
See! Because you're an angel, Ran.

214
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,135
Angel... A pun?

215
00:13:26,535 --> 00:13:31,435
At any rate, let's leave the investigation up to them.

216
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,235
And the one in the Organization

217
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:36,935
who possesses outstanding perceptiveness, Bourbon.

218
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:39,935
Along with the high school detective who turned into a child due to a drug,

219
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,535
Shinichi Kudo.

220
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:44,335
And another...

221
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,435
Who?

222
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:51,935
Is there more than one perp?

223
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:54,435
If this was the work of one person,

224
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:57,535
it had to be somebody with Herculean power.

225
00:13:57,535 --> 00:14:00,335
Don't you think so, Mr. Okiya?

226
00:14:00,335 --> 00:14:02,535
When I met you the other day,

227
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:06,735
you appeared to me as one with outstanding power of deduction.

228
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:08,035
No way.

229
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:12,335
I'm just any other mystery loving upper grad.

230
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:15,035
There's a hole in the rope that looks like something twisted into it.

231
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:23,535
On the sleeve of the stage,

232
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:26,635
there's a folding chair, rope and tool box.

233
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,935
Judging from the cut at the tip of the rope,

234
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,635
it's probably the extra rope after he was hung.

235
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:33,435
But why on earth would it be in a place like this?

236
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,635
Huh?

237
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:37,935
What's this string? Is it a kite string?

238
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:43,735
It's connected all the way to the top of the seats.

239
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,235
What's going on?

240
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,435
On the tip of the kite string...

241
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,335
A baseball?

242
00:14:55,535 --> 00:14:58,035
Tell me about the case.

243
00:14:58,035 --> 00:14:59,235
Yes, sir.

244
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:04,035
The deceased is Mr. Rokumichi Hado, age 39, a musician.

245
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:07,335
It seems he was scheduled to perform a live here tomorrow.

246
00:15:07,335 --> 00:15:10,835
I see. And the ETD?

247
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:13,335
Judging from the dilation of his pupils,

248
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,735
I guess it would be between one to two hours ago.

249
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,035
According to his manager,

250
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:23,035
it seems that Mr. Hado had confined himself to this hall

251
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:25,435
to write lyrics from about two hours ago.

252
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:28,435
Which means that someone entered this hall during that time

253
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:32,735
and hung the victim to death.

254
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:36,135
Well, I think a rope was passed through that steel pipe

255
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,835
that the spotlight is attached to

256
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:42,735
and he was hung using a device that can move heavy curtains.

257
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,235
I don't think so.

258
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:49,335
The room where the special equipment for moving the curtains was locked.

259
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,835
Moreover, the staff that had the key

260
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,735
seems to have been out to dinner.

261
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:58,235
Then, did the perp hang him without using the device?

262
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:01,535
I think several people did.

263
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,035
Unless there is a pulley or something on the bar of the stage,

264
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,035
I think doing it alone is virtually impossible.

265
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:10,735
The other thing that bothers me are the folded chair,

266
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:13,435
extra rope and tool box left at the sleeve of the stage.

267
00:16:13,435 --> 00:16:17,035
Also, the queer hole that is left by the knot of the rope

268
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:20,935
that is tied to the seat in the audience to hang the corpse.

269
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,835
Furthermore, a baseball with a kite string attached to it

270
00:16:24,835 --> 00:16:27,235
was also on the floor partway through the audience seat, too!

271
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:30,335
Conan, you're here too?

272
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:34,435
Let's ask the staff here tell us what they have to say.

273
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:35,835
But I mean it's amazing

274
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:39,235
how the detectives come one after another pursuing the cases.

275
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:40,435
True.

276
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:43,235
Conan has a perfect attendance record, too.

277
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:46,935
Let me summarize the things the staff told me.

278
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,235
Between the hours of 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.,

279
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:51,235
Mr. Hado's estimated time of death,

280
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:55,335
only the whereabouts of two people, Mr. Fuse and Ms. Enjo,

281
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:57,835
couldn't be confirmed.

282
00:16:57,835 --> 00:16:59,935
Come on!

283
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,335
I told you already, didn't I? I had the runs since this morning

284
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,735
and was sitting on the toilet seat.

285
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:10,335
I was also running around the hall instructing the staff.

286
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:13,135
Incidentally, the person who first discovered the corpse

287
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:16,535
was a firefighter who came here for fire inspection.

288
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,135
Officer!

289
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:20,735
He's also suspicious too, isn't he?

290
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,235
Hey, let me go!

291
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:24,235
Hado was killed, wasn't he?

292
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,735
Yeah.

293
00:17:27,735 --> 00:17:31,935
I did buy the jumper from the staff and come into this hall.

294
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:35,135
It was a little before 5:30 p.m., about 5:20.

295
00:17:35,135 --> 00:17:36,335
If you think I'm lying,

296
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:39,135
ask the staff that I bought the jumper from!

297
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:41,335
If so, it's odd.

298
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:46,135
Because Ms. Enjo was nowhere in sight between 4:30 p.m. to 4:50,

299
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:49,235
and Mr. Fuse from 5:00 p.m. to about 5:15.

300
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,535
Which means it's impossible for anyone of the three

301
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:53,735
to conspire and commit the murder.

302
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:55,035
Hey.

303
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:58,135
Is there someone among the three of you that used to play baseball?

304
00:17:58,135 --> 00:17:59,635
Hey, Conan.

305
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:02,035
What a thing to ask at a time like this?

306
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:05,235
I used to play rugby till I graduated from university.

307
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:08,035
I played a little tennis when I was in Jr. High School.

308
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:11,135
I was a ghost member for a mountain climbing club.

309
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:14,435
Hado used to play baseball.

310
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:17,235
I hear he was an outfielder with a powerful throw.

311
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,335
But, why are you asking?

312
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:23,635
Well, it's just that a baseball was found at the scene.

313
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,535
I'm pretty sure that ball

314
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:27,435
is what everyone at the baseball club gave Hado

315
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:30,535
when he graduated from high school.

316
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,535
Hado always had the ball on him.

317
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:35,235
Just as would be expected from an ex-girlfriend. You sure know a lot.

318
00:18:35,235 --> 00:18:37,635
You used to go with Hado since then,

319
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,535
to when he made his debut and became popular, right?

320
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:44,235
Then, you tried to take this beautiful manager here away from him,

321
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:46,735
but was brushed off just like that, right, Mr. President over there?

322
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:49,035
That was years ago.

323
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,935
No big deal.

324
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:53,635
A twisted affair and Hado's death.

325
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:58,035
I wonder what kind of distorted emotion lies deep within.

326
00:18:58,035 --> 00:19:02,235
By the way, do you happened to know where Mr. Hado's cell phone is?

327
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:05,635
We couldn't find it in his belongings in the waiting room.

328
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:09,135
Hado used to always carry his cell phone in his chest pocket.

329
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:15,135
Cellphone in his chest pocket...

330
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:18,035
Cell phone...

331
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:22,935
Cell phone...

332
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:25,035
Hey, Scotch!

333
00:19:25,035 --> 00:19:26,335
Gosh!

334
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,235
No use listening to his heartbeat.

335
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:32,935
He's dead.

336
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:37,335
I pierced right through his chest with my gun.

337
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:41,135
Rye, you jerk!

338
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:43,335
You haven't heard?

339
00:19:43,335 --> 00:19:47,335
He's a spy of the Japanese Secret Police.

340
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,435
It's too bad that

341
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:54,835
I fired at his chest pocket and busted up his cell phone and all.

342
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:58,635
So unfortunately, we don't know his true identity.

343
00:19:58,635 --> 00:20:00,635
It's like we killed a ghost.

344
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:02,335
You're to blame for this.

345
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:09,235
Mr. Amuro?

346
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,135
Mr. Tohru Amuro?

347
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,135
Yes?

348
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:15,435
Please write your name and the phrase "I'm sorry" here.

349
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,435
Why?

350
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:19,435
Weren't you listening?

351
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:22,835
This piece of paper was in Mr. Hado's pocket.

352
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,935
We want all of you in this hall to give us your handwriting

353
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:27,435
because we will sent it out to have it analyzed.

354
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,735
I see.

355
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:33,635
Hey, Conan. What was Azusa's last name?

356
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:35,735
Enomoto. Why?

357
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:41,235
Thank you.

358
00:20:41,235 --> 00:20:43,235
Please write something too, Azusa.

359
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:45,035
Okay.

360
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,835
Vermouth...

361
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:49,435
She knows that I've seen through her disguise

362
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,535
and yet she being really bold about it.

363
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,735
She knows that I'm not going to make a fuss about it

364
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,435
because I don't want to get Ran and the others involved.

365
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,235
Angel...

366
00:21:00,235 --> 00:21:02,735
Angel...

367
00:21:02,735 --> 00:21:05,835
Somebody called me this some place before.

368
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:07,535
Thank you very much.

369
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:09,835
Next, Ms. Enjo please.

370
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,135
It's surprising you knew Azusa's last name.

371
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:14,735
If you told me beforehand,

372
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:17,535
I could've been more prepared and give you more information.

373
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:20,835
Yet, why did you come disguised as Azusa?

374
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:25,635
I could've handled checking the lyrics that weren't released yet alone.

375
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:30,735
I got anxious when I heard that you were coming here with them.

376
00:21:30,735 --> 00:21:34,535
Whether you'd keep you promise with me.

377
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,035
That thing about no matter what happens

378
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:39,335
I don't hurt those two, correct?

379
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:43,235
More importantly, who is he?

380
00:21:44,535 --> 00:21:48,335
He's Subaru Okiya, an upper graduate of Tohto University.

381
00:21:48,335 --> 00:21:51,935
He lives in the house next to Dr. Agasa's.

382
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:00,635
Okay, thanks.

383
00:22:01,635 --> 00:22:03,635
You're left handed?

384
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,335
Yes, sort of.

385
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:06,835
Does it bother you?

386
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:08,235
No, no.

387
00:22:08,235 --> 00:22:09,835
When I met you last time,

388
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:12,535
you took your mask off with your right hand

389
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,835
so I thought you were right-handed.

390
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,935
Is that right?

391
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,735
Please just forget about it.

392
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:24,435
It's only that a man who I hate so much

393
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:26,735
enough to want to kill him...

394
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:31,735
happens to be a lefty.

395
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:57,535
"Next Episode" -You're finished. Scotch.

396
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:08,035
That's right.

397
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:10,535
I remember back then...

398
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:13,135
The one who made him do so was...

399
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:17,035
Shuichi Akai.

400
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:24,135
Next Conan, "The Traitor's Stage (Part 2)"

401
00:24:24,778 --> 00:24:27,078
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:29,578
"Folding pipe chair"

403
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,078
I haven't seen you since riding the Ferris Wheel.

404
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:32,878
I was really freaked out.

405
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:34,278
Me, too.
