1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,410
Sorry, Furuya.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,510
They found out that I'm a secret police agent.

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:17,510
My only escape is...

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,710
to the underworld.

5
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,410
See you.

6
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,210
Zero.

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,910
Traitors...

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,910
shall be punished.

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,110
Right?

10
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,210
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

11
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,410
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,810
The truth behind Akai and Scotch's relationship.

13
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,910
The drama surrounding the Organization continues.

14
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,810
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,210
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,770
"The Traitor's Stage (Part 1)"

18
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,770
Bourbon?

19
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,270
Hey, Bourbon!

20
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,270
What?

21
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,870
What you mean?

22
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,570
You were supposed to turn right at that intersection.

23
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,570
I'm sorry, I was lost in thought.

24
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,970
My, it's so unlike you.

25
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,370
Which means you weren't listening to me?

26
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,470
I was.

27
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,470
Before it goes public,

28
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,670
all I have to do is crush it, correct?

29
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,670
The guy's a big shot.

30
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,070
If you find it hard to get close,

31
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,870
I can disguise you as one of his people.

32
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,970
No need to worry.

33
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,270
I've got an idea of how to get close to him.

34
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,370
Gosh.

35
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,270
Why of all things does a sweet high school girl

36
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,870
on her way back from school

37
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,570
have to help clean up the room of a deduction freak who's not home?

38
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,970
Come on, Sonoko. It's only a once in a while thing.

39
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,670
Sorry.

40
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,770
Thank you so much for helping out.

41
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,970
This place is too spacious to clean by myself.

42
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,070
It's okay, because I love to clean.

43
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,570
Sonoko.

44
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,870
By the way, was her name Masumi Sera?

45
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,770
She didn't come.

46
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,970
We invited her over.

47
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,870
But she seems to be busy because she has to change hotels again.

48
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,470
I see.

49
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,570
But how nice to be able to live in a hotel.

50
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,970
Really?

51
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,270
Well, for a Ms. Richie like you living in large mansion,

52
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,370
every day is like living in a hotel.

53
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,970
Didn't you see any strange people around Ms. Sera?

54
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,170
For example, someone who is constantly on his guard,

55
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,570
and if someone is deemed to be dangerous, he has the power

56
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,670
to bring that person under his control in a matter of seconds.

57
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,470
A person called Asaka...

58
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,470
I'm sure that person hasn't come up front, though.

59
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,670
The name's not Asaka, but there is one person!

60
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,970
Was there anybody like that?

61
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,770
That person is you, Ran!

62
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,770
What?

63
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,670
Remember, you're my exclusive SP

64
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,070
that will take down anyone dangerous that appears before in an instant.

65
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,470
Listen...

66
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,770
Gosh.

67
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,070
That's right. Talking of Asaca...

68
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,470
The title of the new song that rock music Rokumichi Hado

69
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,770
is going to release is "ASACA".

70
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,470
He finally seems to have made the lyrics for a song

71
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,870
that he composed 17 years ago.

72
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,470
And he's going to sing it at his next live.

73
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,470
17 years ago?

74
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,670
But the title is a bit weird, right?

75
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,470
What do you mean by weird?

76
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,170
It was publicized on the internet in alphabet.

77
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:05,070
The title "ASACA" is spelled with a "C"

78
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,870
instead of the usual "K".

79
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,170
"KA" is spelled...

80
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,770
"CA?"

81
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,270
Why? Why is it spelled "CA" instead of "KA"?

82
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,570
I wonder.

83
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,870
I'm sure there's a reason!

84
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,470
Can't you come up with something?

85
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,270
If you want to know that badly, why don't you ask him personally?

86
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,270
What?

87
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,770
We're going to watch Rokumichi Hado's rehearsal soon,

88
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,470
so I'll take you there.

89
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,670
Really?

90
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,970
If it's okay with you,

91
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,170
could I go and watch that rehearsal with you?

92
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,670
You want to go too, Subaru?

93
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,270
I'm a great fan of Rokumichi Hado!

94
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,370
Okay! My pleasure!

95
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,670
By the way, when was that title announced on the internet?

96
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,270
Just last week.

97
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,070
It's a new song in 5 years, you see.

98
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,370
So it ranked high on the internet news.

99
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,270
Right, right.

100
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,170
If so...

101
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,770
They've...

102
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,470
already...

103
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,670
seen it, too.

104
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,170
What?

105
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,870
We can't watch the rehearsal?

106
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,070
No joke?

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,870
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,670
The fact is, the lyrics for the new song hasn't been completed yet.

109
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,770
He wants to write the lyrics on stage with no audience,

110
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,270
so he says he wants to be left alone for two hours.

111
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,070
Do things like this happen often?

112
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,670
Yes, sometimes.

113
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,970
Well, let's just let him have it his way.

114
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,370
It seems that this live is going to be the last one for him, too.

115
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,170
Big!

116
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,470
Last?

117
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,870
Was the rumor about Mr. Hado retiring true?

118
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,470
Yes. We tried to stop him many times,

119
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,970
but it seems he's going to announce it to his fans at tomorrow's live.

120
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,370
So, did things get settled then?

121
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,070
It's unthinkable that he's resigning while still under contract.

122
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,870
"Hirokazu Kajitani (51), Magazine journalist" -If he insists on resigning,

123
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,670
his company said they would take it to court

124
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,670
and make him pay an exorbitant sum for breach of contract.

125
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,170
What's with you? Where'd you come in from?

126
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,170
Of course, I came in from the front entrance.

127
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,770
I bribed one of the staff

128
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,270
and got hold of this staff jumper, too.

129
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,170
More importantly, Ms. beautiful,

130
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,270
did you settle your side of the problem?

131
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,870
What problem?

132
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,870
There's rumor going around that the title of his new song "ASACA"

133
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,870
is actually the name of Hado's new girlfriend.

134
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,370
And you, who were his girl for years, got enraged

135
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,770
and got into a big fight with Hado telling him not to release the song.

136
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,770
Who on earth's saying that?

137
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,270
I hear that your editor bawled you out

138
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,170
because another magazine company scooped the article

139
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,370
on Hado resigning from his music career before you did!

140
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,570
He bawled you out saying,

141
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,570
"what do you think you were glued to Hado for 15 years for"?

142
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,970
That's why I disguised myself as staff and came over.

143
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,270
I want to make an explosive comeback before Hado resigns.

144
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,670
You two over there!

145
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,770
Yes, sir!

146
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,070
He's not authorized personnel, so kick him out of here!

147
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,470
What?

148
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,570
Hey, I went out of my way to bribe my way in here, you know!

149
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,070
Let me at least have a short interview or something!

150
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,370
-Be quiet. -Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

151
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,570
Let go of me! Hey!

152
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,570
Shall we get going too, then?

153
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,770
I guess so, since we've got school tomorrow, too.

154
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,370
Are we leaving?

155
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,470
I'm sorry. But maybe that's better.

156
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,270
Because we don't know when rehearsal will start.

157
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,270
Yes.

158
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,070
But if this is going to be his last live,

159
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,270
I think it'll be better to watch the rehearsal, no?

160
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,370
I hate to say this to you, Subaru...

161
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,770
But we're not that much a fan of his as you are.

162
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,870
What?

163
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,070
Then, who was the one that wanted to come here?

164
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,970
Me.

165
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,870
I was saying that I'm a great fan of Mr. Hado at Poirot

166
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,970
then she made arrangements for me to come and watch his rehearsal.

167
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,070
It seems that Sonoko's family,

168
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,270
the Suzuki Financial group happened to be an investor

169
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,070
for the record company that he belongs to.

170
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,270
You're here too, Azusa?

171
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,370
You didn't seem interested at Poirot, though.

172
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,170
I hid it at the shop,

173
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,570
but I'm actually a great fan of his, too!

174
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,270
So...

175
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,870
after finishing our shift at the shop,

176
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:33,570
I followed Mr. Amuro here!

177
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,270
I was surprised

178
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,670
when she called to me just as I was about to come in here.

179
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,870
Well, I explained to the staff

180
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,670
and had them let us through somehow, though.

181
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,470
Talk of being surprised, you came here too,

182
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,670
Mr. Subaru Okiya.

183
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,470
Thank you for the other day.

184
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,470
Do you remember me?

185
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,470
Yes. You're...

186
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,670
The courier?

187
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,770
What?

188
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,270
Yes, sort of.

189
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,070
Okay, then you three fans, take your time and enjoy.

190
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,170
Hey, Conan, you're coming home with me.

191
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,570
Wait!

192
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,870
Azusa.

193
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,170
You like Mr. Hado because he's a great guitar player, right?

194
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,370
You're really good at playing the guitar too, Azusa.

195
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,670
Yes, of course!

196
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,470
I thought you said that you never touched the guitar before?

197
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,070
Remember the other day when we asked you to become one of our band members?

198
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,870
Oh, right. Back then, I was too embarrassed

199
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,870
to become a member of a high school girls band, you see.

200
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,970
So she's...

201
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,370
Vermouth after all!

202
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,970
If so, I'd better make Subaru get out of here as soon as possible.

203
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,370
Mr. Hado's best song is "Bloody Comet", right?

204
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,570
No, no. I prefer "Fallen Angel of Snow".

205
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,970
They're enjoying chatting together.

206
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,870
Subaru.

207
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,270
No good, we've got to get out of here quick.

208
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,070
No pain no gain.

209
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,570
But better bend than break.

210
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,370
We've come for fire inspection.

211
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,870
We're confirming the fire equipment.

212
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,970
-You two. -Wait! Inside...

213
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,340
See! Because you're an angel, Ran.

214
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,760
Angel... A pun?

215
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,060
At any rate, let's leave the investigation up to them.

216
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,850
And the one in the Organization

217
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,560
who possesses outstanding perceptiveness, Bourbon.

218
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,560
Along with the high school detective who turned into a child due to a drug,

219
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,140
Shinichi Kudo.

220
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,930
And another...

221
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,020
Who?

222
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,520
Is there more than one perp?

223
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,030
If this was the work of one person,

224
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,150
it had to be somebody with Herculean power.

225
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,950
Don't you think so, Mr. Okiya?

226
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,160
When I met you the other day,

227
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,330
you appeared to me as one with outstanding power of deduction.

228
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,620
No way.

229
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,960
I'm just any other mystery loving upper grad.

230
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,630
There's a hole in the rope that looks like something twisted into it.

231
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,140
On the sleeve of the stage,

232
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,220
there's a folding chair, rope and tool box.

233
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,560
Judging from the cut at the tip of the rope,

234
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,230
it's probably the extra rope after he was hung.

235
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,020
But why on earth would it be in a place like this?

236
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,230
Huh?

237
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,530
What's this string? Is it a kite string?

238
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,330
It's connected all the way to the top of the seats.

239
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,830
What's going on?

240
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,040
On the tip of the kite string...

241
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
A baseball?

242
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,630
Tell me about the case.

243
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,840
Yes, sir.

244
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,640
The deceased is Mr. Rokumichi Hado, age 39, a musician.

245
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,930
It seems he was scheduled to perform a live here tomorrow.

246
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,440
I see. And the ETD?

247
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,940
Judging from the dilation of his pupils,

248
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,360
I guess it would be between one to two hours ago.

249
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,650
According to his manager,

250
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,660
it seems that Mr. Hado had confined himself to this hall

251
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,030
to write lyrics from about two hours ago.

252
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,040
Which means that someone entered this hall during that time

253
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,330
and hung the victim to death.

254
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,750
Well, I think a rope was passed through that steel pipe

255
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,420
that the spotlight is attached to

256
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,340
and he was hung using a device that can move heavy curtains.

257
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,850
I don't think so.

258
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,930
The room where the special equipment for moving the curtains was locked.

259
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,440
Moreover, the staff that had the key

260
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,350
seems to have been out to dinner.

261
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,860
Then, did the perp hang him without using the device?

262
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,150
I think several people did.

263
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,660
Unless there is a pulley or something on the bar of the stage,

264
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,660
I think doing it alone is virtually impossible.

265
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,330
The other thing that bothers me are the folded chair,

266
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,040
extra rope and tool box left at the sleeve of the stage.

267
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,630
Also, the queer hole that is left by the knot of the rope

268
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,550
that is tied to the seat in the audience to hang the corpse.

269
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,430
Furthermore, a baseball with a kite string attached to it

270
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,850
was also on the floor partway through the audience seat, too!

271
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,930
Conan, you're here too?

272
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,060
Let's ask the staff here tell us what they have to say.

273
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,440
But I mean it's amazing

274
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,860
how the detectives come one after another pursuing the cases.

275
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,030
True.

276
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,860
Conan has a perfect attendance record, too.

277
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,530
Let me summarize the things the staff told me.

278
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:23,820
Between the hours of 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.,

279
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,830
Mr. Hado's estimated time of death,

280
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,960
only the whereabouts of two people, Mr. Fuse and Ms. Enjo,

281
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,460
couldn't be confirmed.

282
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,540
Come on!

283
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,920
I told you already, didn't I? I had the runs since this morning

284
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,340
and was sitting on the toilet seat.

285
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,930
I was also running around the hall instructing the staff.

286
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,720
Incidentally, the person who first discovered the corpse

287
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,140
was a firefighter who came here for fire inspection.

288
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,730
Officer!

289
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,360
He's also suspicious too, isn't he?

290
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,860
Hey, let me go!

291
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Hado was killed, wasn't he?

292
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,320
Yeah.

293
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,540
I did buy the jumper from the staff and come into this hall.

294
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,750
It was a little before 5:30 p.m., about 5:20.

295
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,960
If you think I'm lying,

296
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,750
ask the staff that I bought the jumper from!

297
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,960
If so, it's odd.

298
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,760
Because Ms. Enjo was nowhere in sight between 4:30 p.m. to 4:50,

299
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,840
and Mr. Fuse from 5:00 p.m. to about 5:15.

300
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,140
Which means it's impossible for anyone of the three

301
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,350
to conspire and commit the murder.

302
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,640
Hey.

303
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,730
Is there someone among the three of you that used to play baseball?

304
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,230
Hey, Conan.

305
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,650
What a thing to ask at a time like this?

306
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,860
I used to play rugby till I graduated from university.

307
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,650
I played a little tennis when I was in Jr. High School.

308
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,740
I was a ghost member for a mountain climbing club.

309
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,040
Hado used to play baseball.

310
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,830
I hear he was an outfielder with a powerful throw.

311
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,960
But, why are you asking?

312
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,250
Well, it's just that a baseball was found at the scene.

313
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,130
I'm pretty sure that ball

314
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,050
is what everyone at the baseball club gave Hado

315
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,140
when he graduated from high school.

316
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Hado always had the ball on him.

317
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,850
Just as would be expected from an ex-girlfriend. You sure know a lot.

318
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,230
You used to go with Hado since then,

319
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,140
to when he made his debut and became popular, right?

320
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,860
Then, you tried to take this beautiful manager here away from him,

321
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,360
but was brushed off just like that, right, Mr. President over there?

322
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,650
That was years ago.

323
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,530
No big deal.

324
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,240
A twisted affair and Hado's death.

325
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,620
I wonder what kind of distorted emotion lies deep within.

326
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,830
By the way, do you happened to know where Mr. Hado's cell phone is?

327
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,250
We couldn't find it in his belongings in the waiting room.

328
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,760
Hado used to always carry his cell phone in his chest pocket.

329
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,720
Cellphone in his chest pocket...

330
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,640
Cell phone...

331
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,520
Cell phone...

332
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,650
Hey, Scotch!

333
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,940
Gosh!

334
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,860
No use listening to his heartbeat.

335
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,530
He's dead.

336
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,950
I pierced right through his chest with my gun.

337
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,750
Rye, you jerk!

338
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,960
You haven't heard?

339
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,920
He's a spy of the Japanese Secret Police.

340
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,050
It's too bad that

341
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:30,430
I fired at his chest pocket and busted up his cell phone and all.

342
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:34,220
So unfortunately, we don't know his true identity.

343
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,230
It's like we killed a ghost.

344
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,940
You're to blame for this.

345
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,860
Mr. Amuro?

346
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,740
Mr. Tohru Amuro?

347
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,740
Yes?

348
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,030
Please write your name and the phrase "I'm sorry" here.

349
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,030
Why?

350
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,040
Weren't you listening?

351
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,460
This piece of paper was in Mr. Hado's pocket.

352
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,540
We want all of you in this hall to give us your handwriting

353
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,040
because we will sent it out to have it analyzed.

354
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,340
I see.

355
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,260
Hey, Conan. What was Azusa's last name?

356
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,340
Enomoto. Why?

357
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,850
Thank you.

358
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,850
Please write something too, Azusa.

359
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,640
Okay.

360
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
Vermouth...

361
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,020
She knows that I've seen through her disguise

362
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,150
and yet she being really bold about it.

363
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,320
She knows that I'm not going to make a fuss about it

364
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,030
because I don't want to get Ran and the others involved.

365
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,830
Angel...

366
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,330
Angel...

367
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:41,460
Somebody called me this some place before.

368
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,130
Thank you very much.

369
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,460
Next, Ms. Enjo please.

370
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,760
It's surprising you knew Azusa's last name.

371
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,340
If you told me beforehand,

372
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,140
I could've been more prepared and give you more information.

373
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,430
Yet, why did you come disguised as Azusa?

374
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:01,230
I could've handled checking the lyrics that weren't released yet alone.

375
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:06,360
I got anxious when I heard that you were coming here with them.

376
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,150
Whether you'd keep you promise with me.

377
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,650
That thing about no matter what happens

378
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,950
I don't hurt those two, correct?

379
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,830
More importantly, who is he?

380
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,960
He's Subaru Okiya, an upper graduate of Tohto University.

381
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,540
He lives in the house next to Dr. Agasa's.

382
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,220
Okay, thanks.

383
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
You're left handed?

384
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,930
Yes, sort of.

385
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,430
Does it bother you?

386
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,850
No, no.

387
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,440
When I met you last time,

388
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,150
you took your mask off with your right hand

389
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,440
so I thought you were right-handed.

390
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,530
Is that right?

391
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,320
Please just forget about it.

392
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,040
It's only that a man who I hate so much

393
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,330
enough to want to kill him...

394
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,330
happens to be a lefty.

395
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,130
"Next Episode" -You're finished. Scotch.

396
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,640
That's right.

397
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,140
I remember back then...

398
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,730
The one who made him do so was...

399
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,650
Shuichi Akai.

400
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,740
Next Conan, "The Traitor's Stage (Part 2)"

401
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,700
Next Conan's Hint:

402
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,200
"Folding pipe chair"

403
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,700
I haven't seen you since riding the Ferris Wheel.

404
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,500
I was really freaked out.

405
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,870
Me, too.
