00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.370
Happy New Year, everyone!

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.660
Thank you for all of your support last year.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.540
We'll do our best to mouse-merize
you again this year.

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.780
Thank you!

Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba

11
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.940
Production Announced!!

12
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.810
Isn't it amazing?

13
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.970
It's Gomera VS Yaiba!

14
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.550
It's a dream team-up!

15
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.270
I wanna see it now!

16
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.080
But since they're announcing production,
they're probably starting filming now.

17
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.860
It won't be released for a while.

18
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.110
What? But I wanna see it now.

19
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.950
Anyway, I can't believe
they're making a kaiju movie

20
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.870
to commemorate the construction
of their new building.

21
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.160
Where there's a will, there's a way.

22
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.410
Well, yeah.

23
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.190
But because of that, because of our
strange connection to Gomera and Yaiba,

24
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.960
all of us were invited.

25
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.390
So good!

26
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.490
So, were you invited through your dad?

27
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.410
Nah, her.

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.770
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba
Kaiju or superhero? Who will you support?!

29
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.280
Gomera is so cool!

Uh, yeah...

Kaiju or superhero? Who will you support?!

31
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.590
Kazuha-chan, I didn't know you like kaiju.

32
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.280
Gomera is special.

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.060
When I was a kid, I watched his
movies at the theater with Heiji.

34
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.780
I was so moved!

35
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.280
Really?

36
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.450
But starting in "Forever," after "Final
Battle," the actor inside the costume changed.

37
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.810
His movies have been kind of off for
a while, but now we're getting this.

38
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.330
I'm so excited!

39
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.330
You sure know a lot about him.

40
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.870
I thought I knew everything about Kazuha,
but there's still so much I don't know.
You sure know a lot about him.

41
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.660
It'll be an instant classic.

42
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.120

but there's still so much I don't know.

43
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.420
Let's watch it together.

44
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.400
Heiji!

45
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.300
What?

46
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.630
Let's take a picture with Gomera!

47
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.900
Sheesh.

48
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.810
Give me a break.

49
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350
He's still going, though.

50
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.710
I'm taking the picture.

51
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.200
Say cheese.

52
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.320
Gomera!
Say cheese.

53
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.790
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

54
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.280
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

55
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.660
Taking a photo with Gomera!

56
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.960
A murder occurs at the grand
opening of a new building!

I look forward to working with
you at tomorrow's film shoot.

90
00:05:50.342 --> 00:05:52.152
What? Film shoot?

91
00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:56.422
Dad, it was written on the invitation!

92
00:05:56.672 --> 00:05:58.272
W-Was it?

93
00:05:58.272 --> 00:05:59.882
Yeah, mister.

94
00:05:59.882 --> 00:06:03.712
They're filming a crowd scene
at Osaka Castle Park tomorrow.

95
00:06:03.932 --> 00:06:05.252
Crowd scene?

96
00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:10.212
They're filming a scene in which people flee
from the kaiju that appears at Osaka Castle!

97
00:06:10.212 --> 00:06:12.262
Et... cetera?

98
00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:13.472
Extras.

99
00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:16.642
We're playing those extras, right?

100
00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.732
We get to be in the movie, too, right?

101
00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:20.672
Yes, of course.

102
00:06:20.672 --> 00:06:21.902
Yes!

103
00:06:21.902 --> 00:06:25.602
But since it's a crowd scene, there
will be a lot of people there.

104
00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:28.672
Then let's dress so we really stand out.

105
00:06:28.672 --> 00:06:29.832
Like Kaito Kid?

Yonekura-san?

108
00:06:46.832 --> 00:06:50.302
What's wrong? You were scowling.

109
00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:53.792
Nothing. Just thinking.

110
00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:57.112

Where are you, Kosugi?

114
00:07:15.722 --> 00:07:17.832
Jeez. You scared me.

115
00:07:38.862 --> 00:07:42.102
Damn it. Why'd Onda have to do that?

116
00:08:04.632 --> 00:08:07.262
They're giving us a rather long time to chat.

117
00:08:07.262 --> 00:08:08.462
Yeah.

118
00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.132
What's going on?

119
00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:14.392
They seem flustered.

120
00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:15.682
Yeah.

121
00:08:22.962 --> 00:08:24.222
Hey, kid!

122
00:08:24.522 --> 00:08:26.652
What's going on?

123
00:08:27.532 --> 00:08:28.182
Wait...

124
00:08:28.702 --> 00:08:29.992
What is that?

125
00:08:29.992 --> 00:08:30.642
Excuse us!

126
00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:31.252
Let us through!

127
00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:32.532
Hey, you kids!

128
00:08:32.532 --> 00:08:34.002
You can't go in there!

129
00:08:36.822 --> 00:08:38.582
What's going on here?

130
00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:40.362
W-Well...

131
00:08:41.972 --> 00:08:43.922
Wh-What's this?!

132
00:08:44.312 --> 00:08:45.762
Have you called the police?

133
00:08:45.762 --> 00:08:47.932
Yes, just now.

134
00:08:47.932 --> 00:08:49.922

Yeah.

140
00:09:04.692 --> 00:09:05.542
Go ahead.

141
00:09:05.542 --> 00:09:06.232
Thanks.

142
00:09:06.852 --> 00:09:08.872
The victim is Yonekura Isato.

143
00:09:08.872 --> 00:09:10.822
He worked here as a producer.

144
00:09:11.272 --> 00:09:15.592
I see. Anyway, it sure is dark in here.

145
00:09:15.592 --> 00:09:17.792
Can't we make it any brighter?

146
00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:18.932
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:22.712
The electrical system's having problems,
so it doesn't get any brighter.

148
00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:25.062
Jeez. In that case...

149
00:09:25.062 --> 00:09:26.692
Hey, you there!

150
00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:27.342
Yes?

151
00:09:27.772 --> 00:09:31.382
Open the door. That'll
make it a little brighter.

152
00:09:31.382 --> 00:09:32.722
Well, actually...

153
00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:37.052
This door closes unless it's propped open.

154
00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:38.972
Are you stupid?

155
00:09:39.362 --> 00:09:42.392
Then keep it open with
a doorstop or something.

156
00:09:42.392 --> 00:09:43.692
Now, now.

157
00:09:43.692 --> 00:09:47.222
Either way, it doesn't look
like this was foul play.

158
00:09:47.222 --> 00:09:48.552
It shouldn't be a problem.

159
00:09:48.552 --> 00:09:50.012
I guess...

160
00:09:50.012 --> 00:09:52.402
You guys okay with that?

161
00:09:52.682 --> 00:09:55.062
Are we okay? No matter how you look at it...

162
00:09:55.062 --> 00:09:57.282
Look at the victim's right hand.

163
00:09:58.362 --> 00:09:59.662
What about his right hand?

164
00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:01.902
What's going on here?

165
00:10:01.902 --> 00:10:04.792
The blood's been wiped off
of just his pointer finger.

166
00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:05.782
Yeah.

167
00:10:05.782 --> 00:10:09.082
And look at the phone next to him.

168
00:10:09.082 --> 00:10:09.922
The phone?

169
00:10:10.412 --> 00:10:11.402
What's this?

170
00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.802
I see. The fingerprint ID button...

171
00:10:15.082 --> 00:10:20.552
The victim was probably conscious for a
while after he was stabbed in the stomach.

172
00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:23.812
He took out his phone and unlocked it.

173
00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:29.472
And wiped the blood from his pointer finger
so it would recognize his fingerprint.

174
00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:34.762
Got it. I'll have the data on
the phone analyzed immediately.

175
00:10:34.762 --> 00:10:35.792
Yeah.

176
00:10:35.792 --> 00:10:36.902
Inspector Otaki!

177
00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:37.702
What?

178
00:10:37.982 --> 00:10:40.202
Take a look at this rope.

179
00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:47.652
I see. It's frayed, but this
didn't break naturally.

180
00:10:47.652 --> 00:10:48.462
Yeah.

181
00:10:48.862 --> 00:10:53.902
It looks like a pretty tough rope, so
they must've had some trouble cutting it.

182
00:10:53.902 --> 00:10:58.182
Hey, there's some kind of scratch right here.

183
00:10:58.182 --> 00:11:02.522
Yeah. That cut must have been made
by the end of a knife or something.

184
00:11:02.522 --> 00:11:04.992
A knife cut on the top of the shelf?

185
00:11:05.952 --> 00:11:11.632
In other words, the culprit dropped the knife
while cutting the rope, and cut the shelf there.

186
00:11:11.632 --> 00:11:12.442
Yes.

187
00:11:12.702 --> 00:11:17.532
But the cut is too small. I'm not sure
we'll be able to identify the weapon.

188
00:11:18.742 --> 00:11:21.372
Yeah, but now it's clear.

189
00:11:22.192 --> 00:11:23.992
This wasn't an accident.

190
00:11:25.432 --> 00:11:27.372
It's a murder.

191

Meeting Room 601

192
00:11:28.832 --> 00:11:31.382
I can't believe what
happened to Yonekura-san.
In Use
Meeting Room 601

193
00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:33.602
I don't know what's going on anymore.

194
00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:38.762
So, how's the security of the
warehouse that is the crime scene?

195
00:11:38.992 --> 00:11:44.182
It's unlocked using these key cards.

196
00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:47.352
Who had a key card?

197
00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:51.272
Including Yonekura-san, I
believe it was about fifteen people.

198
00:11:51.772 --> 00:11:55.892
The new kaiju in there were
being kept confidential

199
00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:57.582
until they were announced at today's event,

200
00:11:57.582 --> 00:12:01.782
so only a few people were
allowed to enter the room.

201
00:12:02.112 --> 00:12:03.222
I see.

202
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.652
That narrows down the suspects quite a bit.

203
00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:07.012
Yeah.

204
00:12:07.012 --> 00:12:07.872
Excuse me.

205
00:12:08.472 --> 00:12:11.542
Yonekura-san wasn't killed in an accident?

206
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:14.052
We're investigating it right now.

207
00:12:14.052 --> 00:12:18.552
Anyway, I heard you got into
a fight with the victim.

208
00:12:18.802 --> 00:12:21.422
What? I-I...

209
00:12:21.422 --> 00:12:24.432
The staff saw you arguing.

210
00:12:25.212 --> 00:12:29.812
Apparently this movie was
originally your idea,

211
00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:32.502
but the victim stole it.

212
00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:33.442
You're wrong!

213
00:12:33.762 --> 00:12:37.442
I discussed and planned
everything with Yonekura-san!

214
00:12:37.842 --> 00:12:40.952
But he took all the credit.

215
00:12:41.232 --> 00:12:42.492
No!

216
00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:44.032
Hey, mister.

217
00:12:44.592 --> 00:12:48.392
Why did you go to the warehouse when you did?

218
00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:49.122
What?

219
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:54.282
I received a note from Yonekura-san
saying to come to the warehouse at 2:30.

220
00:12:54.282 --> 00:12:58.412
Yonekura-san was to leave for Bangkok
immediately after the event,

221
00:12:58.412 --> 00:13:01.232
so I thought he wanted to
discuss something before then.

222
00:13:01.232 --> 00:13:04.422
So, where's that note now?

223
00:13:04.422 --> 00:13:05.832
I threw it away.

224
00:13:05.832 --> 00:13:07.762
That's what it said to do.

225
00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:11.522
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:16.152 --> 00:13:19.722
Aw, darn. The Yaiba show's canceled.

227
00:13:19.722 --> 00:13:23.282
I hope tomorrow's film
shoot happens as scheduled.

228
00:13:23.672 --> 00:13:26.262
I'm so tired of waiting that I'm hungry.

229
00:13:26.262 --> 00:13:28.662
Genta-kun, you're always hungry.

230
00:13:28.662 --> 00:13:31.202
The Yaiba show is more important.

231
00:13:31.202 --> 00:13:33.412
But they're not doing the show.

232
00:13:40.052 --> 00:13:41.082
Ai-chan?

233
00:13:41.842 --> 00:13:42.802
Is something wrong?

234
00:13:44.862 --> 00:13:45.972
It's nothing.

235
00:13:46.172 --> 00:13:47.062
I see.

236
00:13:47.062 --> 00:13:50.222
Jeez. Not a peep from Heiji either.

237
00:13:50.222 --> 00:13:51.992
What should we do, Ran-chan?

238
00:13:51.992 --> 00:13:53.852
Let's wait a little longer.

239
00:13:54.112 --> 00:13:56.562
Huh? Come to think of it, where's Conan-kun?

240
00:13:56.562 --> 00:13:59.452
Now that you mention it, I
haven't seen him in a while.

241
00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:02.232
Maybe he's with Heiji-oniisan.

242
00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:05.112
Did he run off again?

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.349

was glaring quite intensely at his phone.

was glaring quite intensely at his phone.

246
00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:25.719
Do you know what time that was?

247
00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:32.779
It was right after the first afternoon
meeting, so it might have been around 2:20.

248
00:14:34.289 --> 00:14:35.479
Hei-chan!

249
00:14:35.799 --> 00:14:37.599
We're ready for you.

250
00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:39.369
I'll be right there.

251
00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:40.589
Thanks.

252
00:14:41.739 --> 00:14:45.319
Of the staff that had key
cards to the warehouse,

253
00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:50.499
only two others besides Kosugi were
in the back at the time of the crime.

254
00:14:50.849 --> 00:14:54.119
That's great. So, who are they?

255
00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:57.259
I had them wait in the meeting room.

256
00:14:58.139 --> 00:15:00.479
Sorry to make you wait so long.

257
00:15:00.479 --> 00:15:02.639
How long were you going to make us wait?

264
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:15.179
You're awfully aggressive.

265
00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:18.529
Is there something you don't
want to be asked about?

266

I'm high school detective Hattori Heiji.

269
00:15:27.569 --> 00:15:30.209
I've heard of you.

270
00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:36.519
You're that brat claiming to be Kudo
Shinichi's rival high school detective of the west.

271
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:42.999
You sure you're not using your dad's
connections to fabricate your achievements?

272
00:15:45.849 --> 00:15:48.099
Hey, guys.

273
00:15:49.119 --> 00:15:50.679
It's fine.

274
00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:54.729
I've got some questions for you
concerning Yonekura-san's death.

275
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:57.299
Wasn't Yonekura's death an accident?

276
00:15:57.299 --> 00:16:00.189
Why's a detective getting involved?

277
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:01.839
Or what?

278
00:16:01.839 --> 00:16:04.489
Are you saying someone killed him?

279
00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:07.989
You were Yonekura-san's
subordinates, weren't you?

280
00:16:07.989 --> 00:16:09.759
Yeah, that's right.

281
00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:12.909
He called us Team Yonekura.

282
00:16:12.909 --> 00:16:17.629
But we came up with most of his recent plans.

283
00:16:18.049 --> 00:16:21.079
They called him the hit maker,

284
00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:24.129
but he was just a pretty face.

285
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:28.819
And with Yonekura-san out of the way,
you guys could take the top spot.

286
00:16:28.819 --> 00:16:31.059
That sounds like a motive to me.

287
00:16:31.059 --> 00:16:32.519
Don't be ridiculous.

288
00:16:32.519 --> 00:16:35.029
Hold on, what about Kosugi?

289
00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:37.019
He was part of Team Yonekura, too.

290
00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:39.329
Why isn't he here?

291
00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:43.779
Shouldn't you be worrying
about yourselves right now?

292
00:16:44.229 --> 00:16:48.279
Where were you and what were
you doing around 2:30 PM today?

293
00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:50.909
You're checking our alibis?

294
00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:57.379
At that time, I was in the third floor
meeting room planning the filming.

295
00:16:57.379 --> 00:16:58.419
Why?

296
00:16:58.419 --> 00:16:59.109
I was alone the whole time,
so it's not an alibi.

297
00:16:59.109 --> 00:17:01.929
Why are these two so strangely confident?
I was alone the whole time,
so it's not an alibi.

298
00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:03.919
No, wait.

299
00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:06.129
Around 2:30,

300
00:17:06.129 --> 00:17:13.639
I had a girl get me some painkillers
from my car in the basement parking lot.

301
00:17:13.639 --> 00:17:15.439
Painkillers?

302
00:17:15.719 --> 00:17:17.439
Look at this.

303
00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:20.939
I tripped three days ago and twisted it.

304
00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:26.819
I had her come get my car keys around 2:20,

305
00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.949
and she brought me the medicine at 2:30.

306
00:17:31.299 --> 00:17:35.619
It took her a long time
just to get some medicine.

307
00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:36.329
Yeah.

308
00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:42.069
The elevator never arrived
because of today's event.

309
00:17:42.069 --> 00:17:46.339
Not only that, but she said the stairs from
the first floor to the basement were packed,

310
00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:48.839
so it took her a while.

311
00:17:49.089 --> 00:17:51.619
That's about a ten minute gap in his alibi.

312
00:17:52.139 --> 00:17:56.479
If he couldn't use the elevator,
he must've used the stairs.

313
00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:59.109
His foot is injured.

314
00:17:59.109 --> 00:18:02.979
It would've been tough for him to travel back
and forth between the third and sixth floors

315
00:18:02.979 --> 00:18:04.479
and commit a murder in ten minutes.

316
00:18:05.249 --> 00:18:07.489
So, Kouchi-san, what about you?

317
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:13.489
I was checking bathrooms and other deserted
areas for suspicious objects alone.

318
00:18:14.169 --> 00:18:17.499
I didn't meet any acquaintances,
so I have no alibi.

319
00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:21.379
But I couldn't have killed Yonekura.

320
00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:23.249
Why not?

321
00:18:23.939 --> 00:18:26.259
I'm afraid of heights.

322
00:18:26.259 --> 00:18:27.359
What?

323
00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:29.819
I've got a severe case of acrophobia.

324
00:18:29.819 --> 00:18:34.369
High places are naturally out of the
question, and I can't climb ladders.

325
00:18:34.369 --> 00:18:39.269
I heard Yonekura was crushed beneath a kaiju.

326
00:18:39.809 --> 00:18:45.779
Which means the culprit climbed the scaffolding
and cut the rope holding the kaiju, right?

327
00:18:46.109 --> 00:18:49.029
I couldn't climb a scaffold.

328
00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:50.699
You sure that's true?

329
00:18:50.699 --> 00:18:52.779
A person can claim anything if it's just talk.

330
00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:54.949
Are you stupid? You know it's true.

331
00:18:54.949 --> 00:18:56.309
Is that right?

332
00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:10.299
We should use something to prop this open.

333
00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:11.259
Yeah.

334
00:19:11.259 --> 00:19:14.339
Inspector Otaki might come get us.

335
00:19:16.569 --> 00:19:19.359
Those two are suspicious.

336
00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:24.089
Yeah, but only Kosugi had
the motive and opportunity.

337
00:19:26.109 --> 00:19:28.149
Hei-chan, where are you?

338
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:30.319
Otaki-han, over here.

339
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:33.679
We finished analyzing Yonekura-san's phone.

340
00:19:33.679 --> 00:19:34.829
Really?

341
00:19:34.829 --> 00:19:39.419
Yeah. It seems Yonekura-san
took a picture of the culprit.

342
00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:42.829
That's amazing. That solves the case.

343
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:47.339
Actually... Well, you'll see.

344
00:19:48.919 --> 00:19:53.379
It's impossible to identify
them from this blurry photo.

345
00:19:53.379 --> 00:19:56.129
Otaki-han, where are Mihara and Kouchi?

346
00:19:56.129 --> 00:19:58.599
What? They headed down to the first floor.

347
00:19:58.789 --> 00:20:00.389
Don't let them out of the building!

348
00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:01.579
What?

349
00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:07.439
Don't let them out? What do you mean?

350
00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.379
Look closely at that photo.

351
00:20:10.369 --> 00:20:15.499
That warehouse was dark because of
electrical issues, but there's a little bit of light.

352
00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:16.909
Y-Yeah.

353
00:20:17.129 --> 00:20:19.759
Where do you think that light came from?

354
00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:20.909
Where?

355
00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:25.289
The door. The door was open, and
the hallway light entered the room.

356
00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:28.249
Yeah, but that door closes on its own.

357
00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:33.259
That's right. Someone was
holding the door open.

358
00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:36.039
In other words, there were two culprits.

359
00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:38.889
Kouchi-san and Mihara-san
were working together.

360
00:20:39.219 --> 00:20:43.389
Kouchi-san helped Mihara-san and
his injured foot on the stairs,

361
00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:48.879
and Kouchi-san helped Mihara-san
climb the scaffolding from below.

362
00:20:51.689 --> 00:20:53.239
This is Otaki!

363
00:20:53.239 --> 00:20:57.119
If you see Kouchi and Mihara, secure them!

364
00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:02.749
Hey, you two!

365
00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:04.859
Don't move!

366
00:21:04.859 --> 00:21:06.119
Kouchi and Mihara spotted
in the basement parking lot!
Don't move!

367
00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:06.319
Kouchi and Mihara spotted
in the basement parking lot!

368
00:21:06.319 --> 00:21:06.959
Hurry up.
Kouchi and Mihara spotted
in the basement parking lot!

369
00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:07.319
The spare key should be around here.

371

372

374
00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:12.169
Got it.

375
00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:13.469
Stop!

376
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:14.379
Let go!

377
00:21:16.459 --> 00:21:17.549
Open the door!

378
00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:21.979
Mihara has been secured!

379
00:21:21.979 --> 00:21:23.889
Kouchi is fleeing in Yonekura's car!

380
00:21:23.889 --> 00:21:25.729
It's a large black SUV!

381
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.909
Damn!

382
00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:35.949
Kazuha!

Are you okay, Kazuha?!
Ran-neechan!
