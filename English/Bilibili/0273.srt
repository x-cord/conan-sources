1
00:00:00,924 --> 00:00:02,724
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:04,624
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:06,424
Ayumi and granny.

4
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:08,424
Solving both the code and the case!

5
00:00:08,424 --> 00:00:09,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:11,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:13,624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,270
Ayumi?

9
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,570
Well... That figures.

10
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,970
Yes. I'm sure of it.

11
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,670
She's not hanging around with us anymore.

12
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,970
Looks like she's meeting somebody named

13
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:13,170
Bruce or Jackie in that park every day.

14
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,770
Seems she has a foreigner boyfriend.

15
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,970
And you want to go to see them?

16
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,970
That would be too nosy isn't it?

17
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,070
It's not being nosy!

18
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,970
We must investigate

19
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,370
whether the person deserves seeing Ayumi!

20
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,170
Conan, you have to come with us.

21
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,570
No, thanks.

22
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,570
Conan! This is serious matter

23
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,370
that can affect her entire life!

24
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,470
Hey, hey isn't that a bit too far-fetched?

25
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,070
"Riddle Granny Disappearance Case"

26
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,470
Who's that old woman?

27
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,370
The character "Ta" for rice paddy?

28
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,270
Yes, with four matchsticks.

29
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,170
The character "Ta"...

30
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,370
Can I bend one?

31
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,770
No, Ayumi...

32
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,270
I give up! How do you do it?

33
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,970
Here, let me do it.

34
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,570
See?

35
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,170
It is!

36
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,170
It's the character "Ta"!

37
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,170
You see.

38
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,170
This quiz was in this book, too.

39
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,470
Sounds interesting!

40
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,370
I'll lend it to you some time.

41
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,870
Now...

42
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,670
What in the world are they doing?

43
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,370
Here you are!

44
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,470
Looks like your leg is so much better, Jackie.

45
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,270
Jackie?

46
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,070
"Shizuka Omori (65)" -Here you are, Steve.

47
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,370
A little more time for your skin to cure.

48
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,270
Ayumi, will you put the ointment on Steve?

49
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,370
Steve?

50
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,970
Steve, don't move! Stay still!

51
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,970
Jackie and Steve were cats!

52
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,870
Gosh. So much worry for nothing.

53
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,370
I knew it was something like that!

54
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,870
Bruce! What's the matter?

55
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,070
Hey, Granny!

56
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,070
"Joji Yabuki (25)" -I need to have that cat now!

57
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,870
I hear you! You don't have to shout.

58
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,870
It was inside the hood of my car again!

59
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,270
Plus pee all over it!

60
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,870
It's all your fault! You taking care of these good-for-nothings!

61
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,770
Leave them alone!

62
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,570
You shouldn't talk like that!

63
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,870
On top of that, your car is parked in a no-parking zone.

64
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,870
On top of that, your car is parked in no-parking zone.

65
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,470
Don't make a big fuss over cat pee!

66
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,070
Shut up! Do you want to take the cat's place

67
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,770
and be taught a lesson?

68
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,970
What kind of lesson?

69
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,870
Show it to me!

70
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:13,270
-You... -Stop!

71
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,270
What are you kids?

72
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,570
We're the Youth Detective Squad!

73
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,970
Leave old ladies alone!

74
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,270
Granny,

75
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,370
if you let the cat under the hood one more time,

76
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,270
you'll pay for it!

77
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,570
Bruce!

78
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,970
How many times do I have to tell you not to get inside the hood?

79
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,870
You naughty boy!

80
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,270
So cute.

81
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,570
Thank you so much, boys!

82
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,270
Really! You guys were so brave!

83
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,970
I was impressed!

84
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,370
Standing up for the homeless cats!

85
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,370
It's not something everyone can do!

86
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,070
Yeah, Granny is like a god for these cats

87
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,670
A god? No way, kids.

88
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,370
I don't deserve that.

89
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,170
I am a miserable being not worthy of them.

90
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,770
Are they all abandoned cats?

91
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,770
Yes, abandoned because of human whim.

92
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,370
Mrs. Omori is taking care of them

93
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,870
while looking for people who are willing to take them.

94
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,870
I'm just helping her out.

95
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,370
Ayumi, why didn't you tell us?

96
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,870
We are the members of the Youth Detective Squad!

97
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,570
The Youth Detective Squad?

98
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,170
Yeah, we've solved mystery cases together.

99
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,470
Is that right? Mysteries.

100
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,070
Something troubling you, Grans?

101
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,470
Well, nothing.

102
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,470
Oh, yes, Ayumi. Will you...

103
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,570
please keep this for me?

104
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,870
What? But, why?

105
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,870
Oh, I may not come tomorrow.

106
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,570
You know, my arthritis hurts.

107
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,070
Arthritis?

108
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,870
I know a hot springs place that is good for arthritis.

109
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,570
Hot springs?

110
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,870
I used to go to the hot springs in Izu before.

111
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,470
Oh, why not?

112
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,170
There is an inn I know well.

113
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:27,470
I'm pretty sure they're safe with Ayumi.

114
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,470
Okay, see you tomorrow!

115
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,470
Bye! Granny!

116
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,070
Be careful on your way home.

117
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,570
I don't see Bruce.

118
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,870
He's probably dozing off in the warm sunshine.

119
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,770
Granny is late.

120
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,870
She should be here by now.

121
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,170
Maybe she went to the hot springs.

122
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,870
Remember, she was complaining about arthritis yesterday.

123
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,570
I wonder...

124
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,570
She is not the type to leave the cats she love neglected.

125
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,370
Is she in trouble?

126
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,270
Like suddenly becoming ill.

127
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,570
Let's go check her place!

128
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,370
What do you think, Conan?

129
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,570
Let's go.

130
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,970
There is something that had been nagging me yesterday.

131
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,870
Granny! It's me, Ayumi!

132
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,370
Are you there?

133
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,470
Granny, it's Ayumi!

134
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,370
Granny...

135
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,370
Where has she gone?

136
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,770
Did something happen after we left?

137
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,270
You're been overly concerned.

138
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,370
But that man said he's going to make her pay.

139
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,670
That's all bluff!

140
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,470
Funny.

141
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,070
The evening paper is still in the box.

142
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,870
That means, she hasn't been back here!

143
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,970
What! She hasn't been back!

144
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,370
Still, it's pretty difficult to imagine that

145
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,770
she left immediately for hot springs.

146
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,170
Something must have happened!

147
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,670
Anyway, call the fire department, Ayumi.

148
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,970
Mitsuhiko, call the police

149
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,770
and ask whether they have a person named Shizuka Ohmori

150
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,970
who either got involved in an accident

151
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,070
or was carried by an ambulance to a hospital.

152
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,670
Genta, check out who the man we saw yesterday is.

153
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,570
But how?

154
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,970
Looks like he's always illegally parked.

155
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,270
Someone in this area may have seen him.

156
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,070
I'll check around the neighborhood

157
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,470
to find somebody who knows the old lady!

158
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,470
Okay! The Youth Detective Squad to battle stations!

159
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,070
Go!

160
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,070
I don't deserve that.

161
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,870
I am a miserable being not worthy of them.

162
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,470
I hope what I'm thinking turns out wrong.

163
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,470
I've known Shizuka for a very long time,

164
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,370
and I don't think she have friends or relations

165
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,570
she can stay with.

166
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,370
That is why she can't resist taking care of those cats.

167
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,370
She's had her fill of trouble

168
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,370
and probably went to the hot springs

169
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,270
for some relaxation.

170
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,670
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

171
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,770
"Setsuko Nishiyoma (62)" -There's a house close to the park,

172
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,070
which belonged to an old man named Ezaki.

173
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,270
Shizuka was taking care of him.

174
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,970
But, about a month ago...

175
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,270
Poor Mr. Ezaki.

176
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,570
He fell over in the bathtub

177
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,770
and hit his head very hard and passed away.

178
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,970
It looked like he was set up

179
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,370
to fall on the faucet

180
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,070
even though it was an accident.

181
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,870
So, that's why Shizuka became lonely.

182
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,870
When Mr. Ezaki was still alive,

183
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,970
she called him Master Ezaki

184
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,570
She always take him to hot springs

185
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,470
and take good care of him.

186
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,970
Hot springs in Izu.

187
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,370
Do you know where they stayed in Izu?

188
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,270
Oh she hasn't told me.

189
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,970
Maybe you can find that out at Mr. Ezaki's house.

190
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,170
Hasn't he died?

191
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,870
His nephew lives there now.

192
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,370
His name is Mr. Mochizuki.

193
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:27,270
I heard that he owns a company in Haitocho.

194
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,570
This is it! We got it, Conan!

195
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,070
The hot springs town in Izu

196
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,770
that she frequented with Mr. Ezaki...

197
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,670
she probably became nostalgic and went there.

198
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,470
Because we couldn't find her name

199
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,170
among those involved in traffic accidents

200
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,570
or criminal cases.

201
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,570
The hot spring resort

202
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,970
"Toshio Mochizuki (50)" -that Uncle and Shizuka frequented?

203
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,370
Yes, do you know where they used to stay in Izu?

204
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,870
Mr. Mochizuki,

205
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,770
do you want the locker moved out at two o'clock?

206
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,170
Yes, please do that.

207
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,770
The door is locked tight,

208
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,170
and it contains things.

209
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,770
But it's all junk inside.

210
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,870
Please throw it away.

211
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,170
All right. I'll be back.

212
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,370
Hot springs in Izu.

213
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,570
I haven't heard of any favorite inn.

214
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,670
Don't worry, she'll be back soon.

215
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,170
Is that right?

216
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,470
There are so many monkey figurines here.

217
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,870
Oh, yes.

218
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,070
They are all part of Uncle's collection.

219
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,070
Oh, that's "The Three Monkeys."

220
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,570
Hey, you're pretty smart.

221
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,970
"See no evil, speaking no evil, hear no evil"

222
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,070
That means don't get involved in matters

223
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,070
that are of no concern to you.

224
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,870
I've been asking people all over,

225
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,370
but I couldn't find who he was.

226
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,070
I'll call hotels and inns in Izu!

227
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,470
All over Izu?

228
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,270
There are thousands and thousands!

229
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,770
But I can't just sit here.

230
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,770
I want to know whether she's safe or not.

231
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,770
Hey, it's Bruce.

232
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,770
What!

233
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,970
Bruce?

234
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,870
It is! It is Bruce!

235
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,770
Bruce!

236
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,770
Bruce! We're in trouble!

237
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,870
Granny's gone!

238
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,270
The scarf...

239
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,470
What is it, Ayumi?

240
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,870
Bruce has Granny's scarf around his neck.

241
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,370
See?

242
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,470
It is!

243
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,770
That means, he's with Mrs. Ohmori!

244
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,870
Wait! There is something written on the scarf!

245
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,170
I see eight characters on it.

246
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,570
Hey... What is that stain there?

247
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,370
This is...

248
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,570
Blood stain!

249
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,270
What?

250
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,120
What?

251
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,620
Granny's been abducted and held?

252
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,720
She hasn't gone to the hot springs in Izu?

253
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,820
No.

254
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,520
She tied the scarf with bloodstain around Bruce.

255
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,820
That means she's being held somewhere.

256
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
But, it means that she's hurt and can't move, right?

257
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,920
Then, she'd be writing where she is being held.

258
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
The reason why she sent an encrypted message is...

259
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,420
Encrypted message?

260
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,520
I get it!

261
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,320
She did it so that the culprit won't be able to understand,

262
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,520
if it ever should be found.

263
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,620
That means that we must decipher the message, right?

264
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,420
I've seen this somewhere.

265
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
What?

266
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,520
What? You've seen it?

267
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,220
Granny used to give me quizzes

268
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,820
before calling the cats.

269
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,120
One of them was

270
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,420
a quiz about creating new Kanji characters

271
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,320
from this character by adding one more stroke.

272
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,720
A quiz!

273
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,620
Mitsuhiko, can you guess?

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,420
Well..

275
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,320
Add one in the center, and you get "Me" for eyes.

276
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,120
One vertical line and you get "Ta" for the rice field.

277
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,320
Add a short one at the top and you get "Shiro" for white.

278
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,120
Come on, Mitsuhiko.

279
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,620
Anything else, Conan?

280
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,020
"Kyu". "Yoshi".

281
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
"Kou". "Tan". "Shin".

282
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
"Kyu". "Yoshi".

283
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,520
"Kou". "Tan". "Shin".

284
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,020
Oh, sorry.

285
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,620
I forget I'll write them down.

286
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,820
The characters from left

287
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,220
are "Me", "Shiro",

288
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,720
"Ta", "Kyu"

289
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,320
"Yoshi", "Kou",

290
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,020
"Tan", "Shin".

291
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,520
Where did you get to learn them?

292
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,820
These tell us where she is being held?

293
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,620
The first three...

294
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,920
Do they mean some paddy in Mejiro?

295
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,420
Are there rice paddies in Mejiro?

296
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,920
Well...

297
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,420
I get it!

298
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,320
The paddy became all white with snow!

299
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,920
And then?

300
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,520
Then...

301
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,820
It's so bright it hurts your eyes!

302
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,620
That's no clue to finding a place!

303
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,420
How about you? Can't you think of anything?

304
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,920
Me?

305
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,420
"Meshirotakyuyoshikoutanshin"!

306
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,320
You're just reading them in order!

307
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,520
Anyway, we need to find out

308
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,320
the meaning of the last five characters.

309
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,220
Or else, we're getting nowhere.

310
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,620
The first character, "Kyu" is used to mean old.

311
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,720
The next "Yoshi" is a character used for the word motive.

312
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,420
That suggests the cause or reason.

313
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,720
"Kou" suggests the turtle shell.

314
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,820
"Tan" symbolizes the sun rising in the horizon,

315
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,220
so it suggests sunrise or morning.

316
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,320
I've seen that one.

317
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
I saw it in New Year greeting cards!

318
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,620
Right, as in the word New Year.

319
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,020
It actually refers to the daybreak of New Year's Day.

320
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,220
New Year greetings?

321
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,320
Then that means the last character "Shin" suggests

322
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,620
the "monkey"?

323
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,920
Monkey?

324
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
Yeah.

325
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,220
The character is used to symbolize the Monkey,

326
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,120
as in the Year of the Monkey.

327
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,920
Then, that suggests someone born

328
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,420
in the Year of the Monkey?

329
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,720
Well... Conan.

330
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,620
That character "Tan"

331
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,120
Doesn't that read "Dan", too?

332
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,120
What? As in "Dan" meaning master?

333
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I see!

334
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,820
Yes. You told us

335
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Granny used to call Mr. Ezaki, Master Ezaki.

336
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,020
Right.

337
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,520
That means these two point

338
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,820
to the "old" or "former", "master"

339
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
that is, Mr. Ezaki!

340
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,820
But I thought granny wanted to tell us where she's locked?

341
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,420
No. It doesn't seem like it.

342
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,220
Do you remember her saying she doesn't deserve this,

343
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,420
that she's a miserable being?

344
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,120
I am a miserable being not worthy of them.

345
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,420
So, that means that she wasn't just being humble about herself?

346
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,320
Right most probably she learned a secret about Mr. Ezaki

347
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,220
and was abducted because of that.

348
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,820
And she sent the information

349
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,120
in this encrypted message.

350
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,820
Conan.

351
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,520
Doesn't the character "Ta"

352
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,720
is a combination of the character "kuchi" (mouth) with a cross in it?

353
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,920
Yeah.

354
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,820
Then, this character

355
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,720
must be a mouth with a cross meaning,

356
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,420
"Don't tell anyone".

357
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,520
No, that's not it.

358
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,620
This means "make her silent".

359
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,520
That means "murder"!

360
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,820
What!

361
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,020
I'll show you.

362
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,320
If you put them in this order...

363
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,720
The reason why the former master was murdered...

364
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,420
That means Mr. Ezaki didn't die because of an accident!

365
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,220
He was killed!

366
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,020
And the remaining four characters

367
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,020
suggest the cause or the weapon!

368
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,420
The four are

369
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,520
"Me", "Shiro",

370
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,120
"Kou" and "Shin"...

371
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,320
"Me", "Shiro", "Kou" and "Shin".

372
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,920
"Koushin"!

373
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,520
Yes!

374
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,820
"Koushin" is just phonetic!

375
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,420
What? You mean "Koushin" points to "Koushinto"?

376
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,120
Come to think of it, there is a shopping street

377
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,920
on the other side of the tracks named Koushin.

378
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,820
Yeah. Then, maybe someone there!

379
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,620
No. It's not like that.

380
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,920
Koushinto that Mitsuhiko suggested

381
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,220
frequently has a certain drawing on it.

382
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
What drawing?

383
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,920
The Three Monkeys.

384
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,620
You mean the Three Monkeys

385
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,120
who "see no evil, speak no evil and hear no evil"?

386
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,420
That means!

387
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
You're right.

388
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,420
The Three Monkeys figurine we saw at Mr. Ezaki's house.

389
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,420
That was the murder weapon.

390
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,220
Wait.

391
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,620
Then, what do "Me" and "Shiro" suggest?

392
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,220
Remember how the figurine look like?

393
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,320
I got it! The Three Monkeys with white eyes!

394
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Right.

395
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,020
Then, the culprit is that guy Mochizuki?

396
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,420
Most probably.

397
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,520
Anyway, we don't have time.

398
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,220
Granny will be moved out of the house at 2 pm.

399
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,620
What? You know where she is?

400
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,020
Certain as I can be.

401
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,320
We alerted the police with our report,

402
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,520
We were able to rescue granny from the locker

403
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,720
that was about to be moved out of the house.

404
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,320
With her testimony,

405
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,020
Mr. Ezaki's blood was found on the figurine.

406
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,120
And Mr. Mochizuki was arrested for murder,

407
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,520
abduction and illegal detention.

408
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,520
Granny Shizuka seems completely recovered and happy.

409
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,520
She's back taking care of the cats.

410
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,820
Great!

411
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,020
Hey, that man...

412
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,820
Isn't that the guy who threatened Granny the other day?

413
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,920
Yes.

414
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,620
Why is he apologizing to her?

415
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,820
What's going on, Ayumi?

416
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,820
Why is he apologizing?

417
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,820
That man almost had his car stolen.

418
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,320
What?

419
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,820
When the burglar was trying to steal the car,

420
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,620
Bruce meowed inside the car, surprising him.

421
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,720
He tried to check what was wrong inside.

422
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
While he was doing that,

423
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,520
the guy came back and prevented the burglary.

424
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,620
Really, I owe it to the cat named Bruce.

425
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,420
I was saved.

426
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,820
Thank you so much.

427
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:03,320
You were just defending your own bed, right, Bruce?

428
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,620
"Next Episode"

429
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,020
Get out...

430
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,820
Quickly.

431
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,920
Leave this place.

432
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,620
Gosh. All this hassle about ghosts!

433
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,920
What a waste of time!

434
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,920
Next Conan,
