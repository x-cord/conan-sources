1
00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:38.824
"If you can kill me, go ahead and try. I'll be waiting inside the room."

2
00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:40.824
"I'll be end up killing you, though. -From Daisaku Katsumoto"

3
00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:43.524
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

4
00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:45.624
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

5
00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:47.524
The text mail that was transmitted simultaneously before the deadly fall

6
00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.524
was it a trick to hide the traces of a crime?

7
00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:51.124
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:51.124 --> 00:00:53.024
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

9
00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:55.724
His name is Detective Conan!

10
00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:46.504
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 1)"

11
00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:47.604
"Mouri Detective Agency"

12
00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:49.104
I'm sorry, Conan.

13
00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:51.604
It seems dad can't use the car.

14
00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.704
It seems he was drinking till 5 this morning

15
00:02:53.704 --> 00:02:56.004
and he's still sleeping.

16
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.304
I'm sorry, but, can you and Ai go there by train?

17
00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.304
Yes, okay.

18
00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:02.604
Be careful, okay?

19
00:03:02.604 --> 00:03:04.304
Yes.

20
00:03:04.304 --> 00:03:06.104
Come to think of it,

21
00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:08.704
when I got up, pops wasn't in bed.

22
00:03:08.704 --> 00:03:13.604
It seems like you couldn't get Kogoro to drive us over.

23
00:03:13.604 --> 00:03:16.104
Darn. It's already 07:00 am.

24
00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:17.504
Even if we walk back to the bus stop from now,

25
00:03:17.504 --> 00:03:20.304
the ski bus, Dr. Agasa and the others are on would've left already.

26
00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:22.104
I told you so.

27
00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:24.304
I'm the one who forgot something,

28
00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:26.804
so I, alone should've come back.

29
00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:28.004
You idiot.

30
00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:29.804
I came back with you

31
00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:31.504
because there's danger of kidnap

32
00:03:31.504 --> 00:03:33.204
for a child to be walking around alone, you know!

33
00:03:33.204 --> 00:03:35.104
I'm no kid.

34
00:03:35.104 --> 00:03:37.704
Outwardly, you look like nothing but a kid!

35
00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:39.504
But, just what do you plan to do?

36
00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:42.404
We could go there by train

37
00:03:42.404 --> 00:03:44.704
but we'd have to spend a lot of time transferring trains

38
00:03:44.704 --> 00:03:46.804
and by the time we get there it'll be sundown.

39
00:03:46.804 --> 00:03:50.504
It can't be helped we've got no other choice.

40
00:03:50.504 --> 00:03:51.604
We do.

41
00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:55.904
We could have Subaru drive us over.

42
00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.804
But, you don't mind?

43
00:03:58.804 --> 00:04:00.104
No, why would I?

44
00:04:00.104 --> 00:04:02.504
He always looks like he has a lot of time on his hands.

45
00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.604
Oh, no, I mean you.

46
00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:07.104
You kept saying you don't like him.

47
00:04:07.104 --> 00:04:10.104
I can't keep lingering on my likes and dislikes forever.

48
00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:11.804
I'm no kid.

49
00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:14.604
I'm telling you, that outwardly you're nothing but a kid...

50
00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:18.004
But in this case, how you look on the outside has nothing to do with it.

51
00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:19.804
Besides, he...

52
00:04:19.804 --> 00:04:21.404
maybe...

53
00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:27.804
Yes, yes...

54
00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:30.404
"Daisaku Katsumoto" -How boisterous from early morning.

55
00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:33.504
It's you.

56
00:04:33.504 --> 00:04:36.004
You really came.

57
00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:38.904
So, come in, will you I'll hear you out.

58
00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.204
It's probably some boring talking anyway, so...

59
00:04:45.904 --> 00:04:47.704
You're all going skiing together?

60
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:49.104
How lucky.

61
00:04:49.104 --> 00:04:52.804
If I'm going either way, I guess I'll take a slide too.

62
00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:55.504
I haven't moved my body for some time besides.

63
00:04:55.504 --> 00:05:00.204
Oh, my, is there any reason why you need to keep your body in shape?

64
00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:01.704
Well, of course.

65
00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:04.904
Because I'd like to make a good impression on women.

66
00:05:09.904 --> 00:05:11.304
Officer Takagi!

67
00:05:13.304 --> 00:05:15.304
-Conan. -Staking out?

68
00:05:15.304 --> 00:05:18.804
Sort of I just changed shifts with Chiba.

69
00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:22.504
But, I'm glad you got back to work faster than expected.

70
00:05:22.504 --> 00:05:23.904
Yes.

71
00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:26.904
But I still dream about it even now.

72
00:05:28.904 --> 00:05:31.404
Well, the minute I fall off the board,

73
00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:33.204
I get up though.

74
00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:35.804
I always make it a point to tell myself.

75
00:05:35.804 --> 00:05:38.504
Don't worry. You haven't fallen. You haven't fallen.

76
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.204
He fell!

77
00:05:40.204 --> 00:05:41.504
Somebody fell!

78
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:44.804
On the other side of the road?

79
00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:46.404
Officer Takagi, go for it!

80
00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:48.704
Let's go to the site.

81
00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:50.204
Come on, hurry.

82
00:05:50.204 --> 00:05:51.804
Yes.

83
00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:56.804
I saw.

84
00:05:56.804 --> 00:05:58.104
Wow!

85
00:05:58.104 --> 00:05:59.304
Excuse me!

86
00:06:00.904 --> 00:06:02.604
Police.

87
00:06:02.604 --> 00:06:04.204
What happened here?

88
00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:11.304
This is...

89
00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:13.904
I passed by while I was jogging

90
00:06:13.904 --> 00:06:16.504
and suddenly he came falling from above.

91
00:06:16.504 --> 00:06:18.604
I saw it too.

92
00:06:18.604 --> 00:06:21.404
This happens to be my dog's walking course.

93
00:06:21.404 --> 00:06:24.104
I wonder if he fell from this condo.

94
00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:27.204
Does anyone know who he is?

95
00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:33.304
He's got a cell phone in his chest pocket.

96
00:06:34.304 --> 00:06:35.304
True.

97
00:06:39.104 --> 00:06:42.204
He sent out a strange text mail just before he fell.

98
00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:47.004
Moreover, he seems to have simultaneously sent mail to several people.

99
00:06:47.004 --> 00:06:49.804
Then why don't you try sending it again?

100
00:06:50.804 --> 00:06:51.804
Oh, hey!

101
00:06:57.404 --> 00:07:01.304
It seems he sent it to those three.

102
00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:05.404
Which means they know this person who fell, right?

103
00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:08.304
Why didn't they say anything, then?

104
00:07:08.304 --> 00:07:09.704
"Keisuke Ogino (34)" -Oh, well...

105
00:07:09.704 --> 00:07:13.004
I heard a loud sound and dashed out of my room.

106
00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:15.404
I didn't have time to confirm his face or anything.

107
00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:17.504
"Kaori Tsukihara (28)" -Same here.

108
00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:22.204
His voice was so loud that I spilled the coffee I was drinking.

109
00:07:22.204 --> 00:07:25.104
"Kazutomo Sodezaki (31)" -I heard his voice and came too.

110
00:07:25.104 --> 00:07:28.604
If the person who fell was the one who sent me mail,

111
00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:30.804
he could be President Katsumoto?

112
00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:33.004
-No. -No joke?

113
00:07:33.004 --> 00:07:36.404
Is he the president?

114
00:07:36.404 --> 00:07:39.704
Yes, he's the president as well as the editor

115
00:07:39.704 --> 00:07:42.304
for Katsumoto publishing company, Daisaku Katsumoto.

116
00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:43.904
You know, the magazine "Weekly Great"

117
00:07:43.904 --> 00:07:46.004
that's been selling quite well recently.

118
00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:50.004
Yes, the one who writes gossips of talents and such.

119
00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:54.304
Both the president and the employees are living in the same condo?

120
00:07:54.304 --> 00:07:55.404
It's a coincidence.

121
00:07:55.404 --> 00:07:57.304
It's near the company too.

122
00:07:57.304 --> 00:08:00.504
I was just thinking of moving out soon, though.

123
00:08:00.504 --> 00:08:03.104
I'm a free-lancer and not an employee.

124
00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:05.504
Well, but we live on the 3rd floor

125
00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:07.704
and the president lives on the 26th.

126
00:08:07.704 --> 00:08:09.104
I see.

127
00:08:09.104 --> 00:08:13.104
Then, may I ask you to please come to the station with me?

128
00:08:13.104 --> 00:08:16.404
I've got a lot of things that I'd like to ask you.

129
00:08:16.404 --> 00:08:18.204
Hey, hold it.

130
00:08:18.204 --> 00:08:20.304
Are you suspecting us?

131
00:08:20.304 --> 00:08:21.504
I told you, didn't I?

132
00:08:21.504 --> 00:08:24.004
That I was in my room till just a while ago.

133
00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:26.804
Is there anyone who can verify that for you?

134
00:08:28.204 --> 00:08:29.704
I don't think there is.

135
00:08:29.704 --> 00:08:31.904
Because all three of us, live alone.

136
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:37.104
Then, why don't we go to the rooms of the three now?

137
00:08:37.104 --> 00:08:39.304
It's only been less than 4 minutes

138
00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:41.404
since we heard the voice say, "He fell!" you see!

139
00:08:44.004 --> 00:08:46.504
We might find something, right?

140
00:08:51.404 --> 00:08:54.604
I wonder if anything can be found by checking the rooms?

141
00:08:54.604 --> 00:08:57.004
Judging from the corpse,

142
00:08:57.004 --> 00:08:59.604
he seems to have fallen from quite a high place.

143
00:08:59.604 --> 00:09:01.604
If this is murder,

144
00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:05.604
the culprit probably pushed this man out from his room

145
00:09:05.604 --> 00:09:08.704
and rushed over down here.

146
00:09:08.704 --> 00:09:11.804
If traces of you having been in your room till a while ago, are found,

147
00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:14.104
you'll be taken off the suspect's list.

148
00:09:14.104 --> 00:09:16.704
You're being asked to show your rooms right now,

149
00:09:16.704 --> 00:09:20.304
because Officer Takagi happened to be at the scene.

150
00:09:20.304 --> 00:09:23.804
The culprit couldn't have known this,

151
00:09:23.804 --> 00:09:25.704
so he wouldn't have had to go through the trouble

152
00:09:25.704 --> 00:09:26.804
of going back into his room

153
00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:31.304
to make it look as though he had been there all the while.

154
00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:34.804
You sure know a lot when it comes to murder, don't you?

155
00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:38.004
Yes, I'm a Sherlockian.

156
00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:40.604
But, I'm not interested in the killing,

157
00:09:40.604 --> 00:09:42.704
I'm only interested in, solving the mystery part.

158
00:09:42.704 --> 00:09:44.204
Is that so...

159
00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:51.204
Okay, will Ms. Kaori and Mr. Sodesaki stand

160
00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:53.504
and wait here with the door open?

161
00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:54.504
-Yes. -Yes.

162
00:10:03.404 --> 00:10:05.504
What is it? That package?

163
00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:07.604
It's a package with return gifts from a funeral

164
00:10:07.604 --> 00:10:09.604
that I attended the other day.

165
00:10:10.704 --> 00:10:14.704
And? What's the proof that you were here till just a while ago?

166
00:10:16.604 --> 00:10:19.104
See, the TV is on.

167
00:10:20.104 --> 00:10:22.704
Well, I don't think that it will be enough to...

168
00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:25.804
How about this?

169
00:10:25.804 --> 00:10:29.004
There's still this much beer foam left here.

170
00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.604
It's because I was drinking beer

171
00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:32.404
and watching TV till just a while ago.

172
00:10:32.404 --> 00:10:34.104
I see.

173
00:10:34.104 --> 00:10:37.404
Proof that I was in this room till a while ago.

174
00:10:37.404 --> 00:10:38.804
I wonder if I can find something.

175
00:10:41.304 --> 00:10:44.904
You went to the same funeral as Mr. Ogino too, didn't you?

176
00:10:44.904 --> 00:10:48.904
Yes. All three of us went.

177
00:10:48.904 --> 00:10:51.204
The president didn't come though.

178
00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:53.704
This coffee?

179
00:10:55.004 --> 00:10:58.304
That's the coffee I was drinking before I left the room.

180
00:10:58.304 --> 00:11:01.404
I can't start my day without my morning coffee.

181
00:11:01.404 --> 00:11:04.504
Then, this will for the time being, serve as proof.

182
00:11:04.504 --> 00:11:07.204
There still some steam rising from it too.

183
00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:10.804
Officer, hurry, hurry!

184
00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:12.404
Hurry and look officer!

185
00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:14.204
Please calm down.

186
00:11:14.204 --> 00:11:17.504
After I heard about the steam of Ms. Tsukihara's coffee a while ago,

187
00:11:17.504 --> 00:11:19.104
I happened to remember.

188
00:11:21.604 --> 00:11:24.304
No good. They're all snuffed out.

189
00:11:24.304 --> 00:11:27.804
I left the cigarette standing in the ashtray when I left the room,

190
00:11:27.804 --> 00:11:31.404
so I thought it'd still be lit, but...

191
00:11:31.404 --> 00:11:32.904
Please look, see.

192
00:11:32.904 --> 00:11:35.204
The smoke's still rising, isn't it?

193
00:11:35.204 --> 00:11:37.804
This is proof that I was here till just a while ago.

194
00:11:37.804 --> 00:11:39.604
True.

195
00:11:40.904 --> 00:11:44.504
Which means that none of you three went to the president's room?

196
00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:45.504
No.

197
00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:46.904
Of course not.

198
00:11:46.904 --> 00:11:49.404
We've been saying so all this time, haven't we?

199
00:11:49.404 --> 00:11:52.604
The things that will serve as proof of the alibis are...

200
00:11:52.604 --> 00:11:56.904
foam, steam, and smoke.

201
00:12:08.255 --> 00:12:11.255
Foam, steam, and smoke?

202
00:12:11.255 --> 00:12:13.055
Are you telling me that such intangible things

203
00:12:13.055 --> 00:12:14.855
are going to serve as alibis?

204
00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:16.055
Oh, yes.

205
00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:18.355
Please let me explain it to you in chronological order.

206
00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:21.755
At about 07:30 am, when I changed shifts staking out

207
00:12:21.755 --> 00:12:23.655
and was on my way back to the station,

208
00:12:23.655 --> 00:12:26.355
I heard somebody shout, "A man fell!",

209
00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:28.855
and came running up to this condo.

210
00:12:28.855 --> 00:12:31.855
Then, I see a man dressed in PJs and a gown on the ground.

211
00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:33.555
From the testimony of the eye-witness,

212
00:12:33.555 --> 00:12:37.955
I found that the man had fallen from the top floor of the condo.

213
00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:40.655
A cell phone was in the pocket of the man so,

214
00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:41.955
I checked it

215
00:12:41.955 --> 00:12:44.555
and found that at 07:25 am, just before he fell,

216
00:12:44.555 --> 00:12:47.955
he simultaneously sent several people text mail.

217
00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:50.755
Then, when I tried re-sending the mail...

218
00:12:53.855 --> 00:12:55.155
I see.

219
00:12:55.155 --> 00:12:59.655
So, these three received a provoking mail

220
00:12:59.655 --> 00:13:02.155
as if to encourage committing the murder.

221
00:13:02.155 --> 00:13:03.355
Yes.

222
00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:04.555
We found that the man who fell,

223
00:13:04.555 --> 00:13:07.555
was company president Mr. Daisaku Katsumoto,

224
00:13:07.555 --> 00:13:10.255
who worked with the three.

225
00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:12.455
Since the contents of the mail were as such,

226
00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:14.955
I was going to ask the three to come voluntarily

227
00:13:14.955 --> 00:13:18.155
to the station for interrogation,

228
00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:19.755
but, after the suggestion that going to their room right away

229
00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:21.555
may show evidence of them having been in the room

230
00:13:21.555 --> 00:13:23.855
till just before the incident.

231
00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:26.055
You went to the rooms of the three

232
00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:27.555
and were shown the foam of the beer,

233
00:13:27.555 --> 00:13:29.755
the steam in the coffee cup

234
00:13:29.755 --> 00:13:31.255
and the smoke from the cigarette,

235
00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:33.055
is that the story?

236
00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:34.555
Yes, sir.

237
00:13:34.555 --> 00:13:36.855
If one of the three were the culprit that pushed...

238
00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:39.855
President Katsumoto from the condo,

239
00:13:39.855 --> 00:13:42.455
and that person was mixed among the spectators

240
00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:44.555
that person would've come here right away

241
00:13:44.555 --> 00:13:46.655
without going anywhere else.

242
00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:50.355
After all, the sooner that person's witnessed here, the better,

243
00:13:50.355 --> 00:13:52.555
because when questioned later,

244
00:13:52.555 --> 00:13:54.955
the person can insist that he heard the commotion

245
00:13:54.955 --> 00:13:56.255
and rushed down here right away.

246
00:13:56.255 --> 00:13:59.055
But as for the foam, steam, and smoke,

247
00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:00.655
you're the only one who saw them, right?

248
00:14:00.655 --> 00:14:02.655
I took a picture of them too.

249
00:14:03.655 --> 00:14:06.455
I took it with my cell phone camera, though.

250
00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:08.255
Conan?

251
00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:10.355
I coincidentally happened to run into Conan

252
00:14:10.355 --> 00:14:12.555
and the others on the street in their car,

253
00:14:12.555 --> 00:14:16.655
when I heard the voice shouting that somebody fell.

254
00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:20.355
And, you mean you took Conan

255
00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:23.055
to the room of someone who could possibly be a murderer?

256
00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:27.055
Yes, because Conan's the one who said

257
00:14:27.055 --> 00:14:28.355
that we should immediately go to the rooms.

258
00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:29.955
But...

259
00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:32.055
See, look.

260
00:14:32.055 --> 00:14:35.055
This is Mr. Ogino's beer foam.

261
00:14:35.055 --> 00:14:37.855
This is the steam from Ms. Tsukihara's coffee cup.

262
00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:40.955
Since it's hard to see in a photo, I took a video of this one only.

263
00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:44.955
And, this is the smoke from Mr. Sodesaki's cigarette.

264
00:14:44.955 --> 00:14:47.555
To make it easy to tell who's room it was,

265
00:14:47.555 --> 00:14:48.855
I had each resident of the room hold the thing up

266
00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:50.355
before taking the picture.

267
00:14:50.355 --> 00:14:51.755
Where were the two remaining people

268
00:14:51.755 --> 00:14:53.155
when the picture was being taken?

269
00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:56.155
I had them wait right outside the entrance with the door open.

270
00:14:56.155 --> 00:15:00.755
Therefore, they didn't have time to go back to their rooms

271
00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:03.155
and change anything.

272
00:15:04.155 --> 00:15:07.555
And? Are you sure that President Katsumoto fell off

273
00:15:07.555 --> 00:15:12.655
from the veranda of his room that's on the 26th floor of this condo?

274
00:15:12.655 --> 00:15:13.755
Yes, sir.

275
00:15:13.755 --> 00:15:17.855
The front door as well as the veranda window were left opened.

276
00:15:17.855 --> 00:15:20.055
Right after the president sent the mail in question out,

277
00:15:20.055 --> 00:15:24.055
he seems to have called the renovators too.

278
00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:26.455
-Renovators? -Yes, sir

279
00:15:26.455 --> 00:15:27.655
It seems that the carpet

280
00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:29.855
that the president ordered and was installed last night,

281
00:15:29.855 --> 00:15:32.655
was not what he ordered.

282
00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:37.055
It seems that he actually measured the fluffiness of the carpet

283
00:15:37.055 --> 00:15:39.655
while on the phone and complained.

284
00:15:39.655 --> 00:15:42.155
While he was on the phone,

285
00:15:42.155 --> 00:15:43.655
the door bell seems to have rung,

286
00:15:43.655 --> 00:15:45.555
and he hung up saying that he would call back later.

287
00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:51.155
President Katsumoto was in his room until right before he fell

288
00:15:51.155 --> 00:15:53.855
and it seems safe to say that the person who came to visit him

289
00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:55.555
is the culprit.

290
00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:58.255
By the way, how long does it take

291
00:15:58.255 --> 00:16:00.955
to get from their room to the president's?

292
00:16:00.955 --> 00:16:03.555
Since all three of them live on the 3rd floor,

293
00:16:03.555 --> 00:16:07.055
to get to the president's room that is 23 floors above,

294
00:16:07.055 --> 00:16:10.155
it would take about 7 minutes to go and come back.

295
00:16:10.155 --> 00:16:13.455
I actually used the stairs and tried it out myself,

296
00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:14.955
so there's no mistake about it.

297
00:16:14.955 --> 00:16:16.555
You used the stairs?

298
00:16:16.555 --> 00:16:18.855
You didn't use the elevator?

299
00:16:18.855 --> 00:16:21.855
There's a surveillance camera in the elevator,

300
00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:24.655
and when I had them show me the image on the camera in the control room,

301
00:16:24.655 --> 00:16:28.255
at the time President Katsumoto fell, around 07:30 am,

302
00:16:28.255 --> 00:16:31.155
the images of the three weren't found.

303
00:16:31.155 --> 00:16:34.455
Therefore, if one of them is the culprit,

304
00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:37.655
I thought they took the stairs that had no camera.

305
00:16:37.655 --> 00:16:38.955
I see.

306
00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:41.555
The culprit rang the door bell of the president's room,

307
00:16:41.555 --> 00:16:45.155
and after being invited in, pushed him off.

308
00:16:45.155 --> 00:16:47.955
If you calculate the time it would take to get out of the room

309
00:16:47.955 --> 00:16:48.955
and run to the first floor,

310
00:16:48.955 --> 00:16:51.055
and you add the time it took you to enter

311
00:16:51.055 --> 00:16:52.555
the rooms of the three after the incident...

312
00:16:52.555 --> 00:16:55.355
If anyone among the three is the culprit,

313
00:16:55.355 --> 00:16:57.755
it would mean that the person would've had to leave his room empty

314
00:16:57.755 --> 00:16:58.855
for more than 10 minutes.

315
00:16:58.855 --> 00:17:00.055
Yes, sir.

316
00:17:00.055 --> 00:17:01.355
If left behind for that long,

317
00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:05.155
I figured that the foam, steam, and smoke would've been long gone.

318
00:17:05.155 --> 00:17:06.955
I see.

319
00:17:06.955 --> 00:17:10.855
But why did the president send you all a mail like that?

320
00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:12.255
Because of the lawsuit.

321
00:17:12.255 --> 00:17:15.955
All three of us were planning to sue that president.

322
00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:18.155
At the beginning of next month.

323
00:17:18.155 --> 00:17:19.355
Sue?

324
00:17:19.355 --> 00:17:20.955
You know about it, don't you?

325
00:17:20.955 --> 00:17:24.255
The incident about the popular actress who jumped to her death last week.

326
00:17:24.255 --> 00:17:28.055
Yes. If I remember correctly, she committed suicide

327
00:17:28.055 --> 00:17:29.955
because her kiss scene with her "dangerous" lover

328
00:17:29.955 --> 00:17:32.655
made the headlines, right?

329
00:17:32.655 --> 00:17:35.155
I'm the one who took the picture.

330
00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:37.455
I'm the one who wrote the article.

331
00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:41.055
And, I'm supposedly the one who edited it

332
00:17:41.055 --> 00:17:43.455
and put it in the Weekly Magazine Great.

333
00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:44.655
Supposedly?

334
00:17:44.655 --> 00:17:48.555
Yes. Because the picture as well as the article are lies.

335
00:17:50.555 --> 00:17:54.655
That picture was taken right before they hugged each other.

336
00:17:54.655 --> 00:17:56.755
They weren't kissing or anything.

337
00:17:56.755 --> 00:17:58.755
The background of her boyfriend in the photo,

338
00:17:58.755 --> 00:18:00.755
that's written in the article, is full of baloney.

339
00:18:00.755 --> 00:18:02.655
He happens to be a stunt man,

340
00:18:02.655 --> 00:18:04.555
and the wound on his face is one that he got

341
00:18:04.555 --> 00:18:05.755
from shooting a film that day.

342
00:18:05.755 --> 00:18:10.255
But, she was engaged with a young Diet member, wasn't she?

343
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.355
In spite of that, if she was in somebody else's arms,

344
00:18:12.355 --> 00:18:14.755
it's not all baloney, is it?

345
00:18:14.755 --> 00:18:16.755
That's wrong too.

346
00:18:16.755 --> 00:18:19.255
He was her half younger brother, from her father's side,

347
00:18:19.255 --> 00:18:22.955
and was only hugging him telling him that she was getting married.

348
00:18:22.955 --> 00:18:25.155
But, why, then?

349
00:18:25.155 --> 00:18:27.555
We found all this out before we put it on the magazine

350
00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:29.555
and was going to trash it.

351
00:18:29.555 --> 00:18:32.255
But, that President Katsumoto re-wrote it without permission,

352
00:18:32.255 --> 00:18:33.655
and put it in the magazine.

353
00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:34.855
He wrote up a headline,

354
00:18:34.855 --> 00:18:36.755
"Popular Actress, Plays Dangerous Love Till Late

355
00:18:36.755 --> 00:18:38.855
on the Night Before her Wedding"!

356
00:18:38.855 --> 00:18:41.455
Since the day that magazine was to go out on the market,

357
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:45.555
was the day before her coming wedding with the groom-to-be Diet member,

358
00:18:45.555 --> 00:18:47.555
the magazine sold fast, but...

359
00:18:47.555 --> 00:18:52.355
Her younger brother was attacked by a fanatic fan of hers

360
00:18:52.355 --> 00:18:55.455
and is in the hospital even now, unconscious and in critical condition.

361
00:18:55.455 --> 00:18:57.555
Her marriage, most naturally shattered to pieces,

362
00:18:57.555 --> 00:19:01.555
and losing all hope, she chose suicide as a way out.

363
00:19:03.255 --> 00:19:05.955
But, if she told him the truth right away,

364
00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:08.055
it would've become obvious that everything was a lie, no?

365
00:19:08.055 --> 00:19:09.955
She couldn't come out and tell him

366
00:19:09.955 --> 00:19:14.255
because her younger brother was the child of her father's mistress.

367
00:19:14.255 --> 00:19:17.155
But, I'm sure that the president wrote the article

368
00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.755
because he saw through everything.

369
00:19:18.755 --> 00:19:20.555
But, it's totally unforgivable for him

370
00:19:20.555 --> 00:19:24.855
to use our names without permission and make up an article.

371
00:19:24.855 --> 00:19:30.355
That's why all three of us sent that guy our signed mail last night.

372
00:19:30.355 --> 00:19:32.255
We wrote that we had proof that he made that article up,

373
00:19:32.255 --> 00:19:35.155
so to be ready to take the consequences.

374
00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:39.155
That we would keep on filing action against him until he's no more.

375
00:19:39.155 --> 00:19:40.655
I see.

376
00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:43.155
So the president saw that mail this morning

377
00:19:43.155 --> 00:19:46.155
and sent you all the mail that he did.

378
00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:50.955
Then, the funeral package that was found in the rooms of you three was...

379
00:19:50.955 --> 00:19:52.055
Yes.

380
00:19:52.055 --> 00:19:54.755
It's the return gift that we received

381
00:19:54.755 --> 00:19:56.055
after attending that actress's funeral.

382
00:19:56.055 --> 00:19:59.055
Well, but we all kept our names hidden

383
00:19:59.055 --> 00:20:00.655
and attended her funeral under the pretense

384
00:20:00.655 --> 00:20:03.955
of being people who were involved with her production company

385
00:20:03.955 --> 00:20:05.955
If that article is the motive,

386
00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:08.055
shouldn't we include the bereaved family of the deceased actress

387
00:20:08.055 --> 00:20:10.155
in the list of suspects too?

388
00:20:11.355 --> 00:20:15.855
But, the murder occurred right after the mail was sent.

389
00:20:15.855 --> 00:20:17.355
It doesn't seem right

390
00:20:17.355 --> 00:20:19.655
to take these three completely off the list of suspects.

391
00:20:19.655 --> 00:20:21.255
That's true.

392
00:20:21.255 --> 00:20:24.355
The timing is too good for it to be a coincidence.

393
00:20:24.355 --> 00:20:26.555
But the foam, steam, and smoke are proof

394
00:20:26.555 --> 00:20:29.755
that they didn't do it.

395
00:20:29.755 --> 00:20:32.855
I thought that we would find something

396
00:20:32.855 --> 00:20:36.455
if we entered the room before any trick could be set up but...

397
00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:38.355
Or is there a way?

398
00:20:38.355 --> 00:20:40.855
A method, to set something up on the spot.

399
00:20:44.155 --> 00:20:45.555
Yes, hello.

400
00:20:45.555 --> 00:20:47.155
Conan?

401
00:20:47.155 --> 00:20:49.755
About when do you think you'll be arriving here?

402
00:20:49.755 --> 00:20:52.555
We've started skiing already.

403
00:20:52.555 --> 00:20:54.855
Call us when you get here, okay?

404
00:20:54.855 --> 00:20:56.555
We'll be waiting for you, okay!

405
00:20:56.555 --> 00:20:57.555
Sorry.

406
00:20:57.555 --> 00:20:59.555
I got caught up in a case here,

407
00:20:59.555 --> 00:21:01.055
so I don't think I'll be able to go there.

408
00:21:01.055 --> 00:21:03.255
What? No joke!

409
00:21:03.255 --> 00:21:06.155
Conan says he can't come because of a criminal case.

410
00:21:06.155 --> 00:21:08.355
You mean Ai can't either?

411
00:21:08.355 --> 00:21:09.655
I guess not.

412
00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:11.855
Why don't you just let somebody else handle the case?

413
00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:15.555
All our breaths are super white here, and it feels really good.

414
00:21:15.555 --> 00:21:17.955
Breath is white?

415
00:21:17.955 --> 00:21:20.555
Sorry. I'll call you again later.

416
00:21:20.555 --> 00:21:22.255
Conan?

417
00:21:22.255 --> 00:21:23.455
He hung up.

418
00:21:23.455 --> 00:21:25.755
Inspector Megure.

419
00:21:25.755 --> 00:21:29.355
Why don't we experiment while we're at it?

420
00:21:29.355 --> 00:21:30.755
Experiment?

421
00:21:30.755 --> 00:21:34.555
Yes, an experiment with foam, steam, and smoke.

422
00:22:59.655 --> 00:23:02.155
So...

423
00:23:02.155 --> 00:23:04.955
I wonder what he's planning to do now?

424
00:23:04.955 --> 00:23:06.055
What about?

425
00:23:06.055 --> 00:23:07.755
Skiing.

426
00:23:07.755 --> 00:23:10.055
Aren't Dr. Agasa and the others waiting?

427
00:23:11.255 --> 00:23:12.855
He's probably going to cancel going.

428
00:23:12.855 --> 00:23:15.155
The phone call that he got a while ago

429
00:23:15.155 --> 00:23:16.655
was probably from the children.

430
00:23:16.655 --> 00:23:19.155
He probably said something like,

431
00:23:19.155 --> 00:23:20.955
"I can't go because of a criminal case",

432
00:23:20.955 --> 00:23:22.655
or something to that effect, and cancelled.

433
00:23:22.655 --> 00:23:24.355
Like always.

434
00:23:24.355 --> 00:23:25.855
I see.

435
00:23:25.855 --> 00:23:27.655
That's too bad.

436
00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:30.455
So, you can go on home if you want to already.

437
00:23:30.455 --> 00:23:32.855
You don't have to drive us anywhere anymore.

438
00:23:32.855 --> 00:23:36.655
No, I'm concerned how the case is coming along too.

439
00:23:36.655 --> 00:23:40.055
Besides, I couldn't possibly leave a fragile little lady all by herself

440
00:23:40.055 --> 00:23:41.255
and leave.

441
00:23:41.255 --> 00:23:45.555
Because a murderer may be hanging around somewhere too.

442
00:23:45.555 --> 00:23:47.855
You sure are an unreliable knight.

443
00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:51.055
You're a tough one, aren't you?

444
00:23:53.055 --> 00:23:56.655
I'll protect you over my dead body, princess.

445
00:24:07.555 --> 00:24:09.055
I wonder if this the first time...

446
00:24:09.055 --> 00:24:12.155
that I've been with you, just the two of us.

447
00:24:12.155 --> 00:24:14.755
What shall we do about those three, inspector?

448
00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:18.955
They all have enough motive,

449
00:24:18.955 --> 00:24:22.255
I guess we'll have them interrogated a bit longer.

450
00:24:22.255 --> 00:24:24.455
Because we'll find out if we stay here...

451
00:24:24.455 --> 00:24:26.755
who the culprit is.

452
00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:33.055
Next Conan,

453
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:37.055
"Foam, Steam, and Smoke (Part 2)".

454
00:24:52.955 --> 00:24:54.855
Next Conan's Hint:

455
00:24:54.855 --> 00:24:57.255
"Business Tool".

456
00:24:57.255 --> 00:24:59.055
Should we call Mr. Mouri over to do the experiment?

457
00:24:59.055 --> 00:25:01.155
Remove him from being in charge of beer.

458
00:25:01.155 --> 00:25:02.155
Yes.
