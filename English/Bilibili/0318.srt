1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,540
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,440
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,240
Queer actions after committing the crime.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,640
An accident or a case of homicide. What is the hidden truth?

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:48,567
Oh no... not again.

9
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,567
Why is it that all the cars you rent

10
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,867
always break down, dad?

11
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,967
We can't even use the cell phone in the mountains like this.

12
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:59,467
We've got no choice but to wait for the fog to clear.

13
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:03,867
Hey, don't smoke in a small place like this!

14
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:07,667
Shut up! I'll open the window, okay?

15
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:12,567
Gosh, now what...

16
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,967
It's nothing.

17
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:18,667
Ran, I'll bet you're scared.

18
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,467
That there's a mountain monster

19
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:22,367
looking at us from somewhere.

20
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:26,867
I can't hear you, I can't hear a thing!

21
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:29,167
Just as I though...

22
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,767
Gosh, hopeless...

23
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,467
Oh, it's a car.

24
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,167
Saved...

25
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,667
It turned the corner.

26
00:02:40,967 --> 00:02:42,767
Wait a second.

27
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,667
Was there are side road there?

28
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:50,467
Pops, which means the car we just saw...

29
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,667
Yeah.

30
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:54,067
It could've been an apparition.

31
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:05,167
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 1)"

32
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,267
Hey, hey, let's not...

33
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:10,267
Don't worry.

34
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:11,867
You saw the sign, didn't you?

35
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:15,667
It's a study facility for a legitimate company.

36
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,667
The people of the company

37
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:18,667
would never be in a place like this at this time!

38
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,567
I'm sure the car we just saw is a robber's car or something.

39
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,867
What the...

40
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,967
I'll go first and check things out!

41
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,667
Be careful!

42
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,167
Oh, it's a car.

43
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,367
It still warm.

44
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,667
It's a cute car.

45
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,867
What a relief!

46
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,367
Bad people don't ride cars like this, do they?

47
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,767
There seems to be a lot of other cars. See.

48
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,367
This one is warmer!

49
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,867
The car that came in here just a while ago is probably this car!

50
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,767
This car is still warm too.

51
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:02,167
Which means...

52
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:05,467
There are people here for sure!

53
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:06,867
-Let's go! -Okay!

54
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,267
Kuron Health Equipment Corporation.

55
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,167
I've never heard of them.

56
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,167
You two, mind your manners.

57
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,367
Yes, sir!

58
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:26,867
Hello!

59
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,367
Is anyone in?

60
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,967
They couldn't be sleeping at this hour yet, could they...

61
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,167
What it is?

62
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:42,967
I'm sorry to be intruding on you at this hour,

63
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:46,067
but our car broke down nearby.

64
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:51,567
So, you see, we're stalled in this fog,

65
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:54,367
so we would like to ask you for some help.

66
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,067
Please go find someone else to help you,

67
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:58,167
because I'm going to get busy from now.

68
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,767
Wait!

69
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,767
Please at least lend us your phone! Please!

70
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:08,067
Please wait!

71
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,267
Wait.

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,367
Hey!

73
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:13,567
What a guy.

74
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,367
I promise that if I die, I'll come and haunt you!

75
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:18,467
Darn.

76
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:20,767
I guess we'll just have to go back to the car.

77
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,567
It's cold.

78
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,967
You seem to be in trouble.

79
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,367
Please do come in.

80
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,267
Wow, is it okay?

81
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,567
Thank you so very much!

82
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,867
What a fix, eh.

83
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,367
This is a study facility for the company

84
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,667
that there's usually no one here.

85
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:44,167
The phone's over there.

86
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,767
Thank you.

87
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,267
Are you sure it's okay?

88
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,567
What if they're spies?

89
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,267
Talk about push over,

90
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:54,467
or rather is it that you have a lot of elbow room

91
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,167
because you're in the 1st development section?

92
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,067
I heard you all!

93
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,067
Oh, president.

94
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,167
Just what are you guys doing?

95
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:04,967
We're sorry to be intruding on you,

96
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:07,967
but we're not suspicious people.

97
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:13,367
I am a private detective and my name is Kogoro Mouri.

98
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:17,867
Mouri, you mean that famous "Sleeping Mouri"?

99
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,767
Yes, well...

100
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:22,067
this is my daughter Ran,

101
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:25,467
and the little one there is Conan.

102
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,167
Oh my,

103
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,867
I am very honored to be able meet you.

104
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:34,167
I am the president of Kuron Health Equipment Corporation, Umetani.

105
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,167
Please make yourselves at home here.

106
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,667
Oh, that's right!

107
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,467
Mr. Mouri, please become a monitor for us!

108
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,267
How about it?

109
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:46,567
We having an in-company competition on a relax sheet,

110
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,367
and we would appreciate it if you could give us

111
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,267
your unbiased opinion how you feel about it.

112
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,167
Oh...

113
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,567
There, right there.

114
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,967
This is just great.

115
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,367
It feels so good!

116
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:13,267
Dad, you're so embarrassing.

117
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,967
I've never experienced a great massage chair like this!

118
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:21,867
It fits right into the vital spot.

119
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,467
Yes, the combination of the softness of tanned hide

120
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,967
and the combination of artificial leather for durability

121
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,867
makes for a sensation of perfect fit.

122
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:31,267
Just as expected of the 1st development section!

123
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,167
Well done, Nakano!

124
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,867
But, president.

125
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:38,267
That artificial leather you take pride in is made in Italy!

126
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,467
Moreover, for the massager part,

127
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,667
high grade silicone rubber is lavishly used!

128
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,867
Therefore, the production cost is too high.

129
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,567
What? What is the meaning of this, Nakano?

130
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,267
The original parts of the basic components such as the rollers,

131
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:53,267
are of the same product line as what we've used so far,

132
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:54,867
so as far as that's concerned, the cost is...

133
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,767
You idiot!

134
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,367
Never mind durability!

135
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:02,167
But, even if we don't make much profit,

136
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,767
so long as we produce good items to our customers,

137
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:05,967
eventually...

138
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:08,167
Eventually is not what we're after!

139
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,567
Make profit for me right this minute!

140
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,467
Rather, what I mean is,

141
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:15,167
if we don't keep dishing out new products,

142
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:18,067
the customers will give up on us.

143
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:20,967
Next!

144
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:24,267
That president is kind of scary, isn't he?

145
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:25,367
Yeah.

146
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:29,167
Next for the 2nd development section's Ecstasy One.

147
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:33,367
This product is made for the younger generation.

148
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,967
Please take a look.

149
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:36,567
This seat is a cover-type seat.

150
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,967
There are 7 color variations and the color of the customer's choice

151
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,767
can be chosen to meet any type of interior.

152
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:45,567
The back part of the seat can be reclined to any angle,

153
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,967
and it can also be used in the living room as a sofa.

154
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,267
I see,

155
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:54,067
it sure seems to be great for a young person's room!

156
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,467
You move this device using the remote controller

157
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,567
that is in the side pocket.

158
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:01,367
First, let's start with full body massage...

159
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,167
Are you sleepy, Conan?

160
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,867
Stop it already.

161
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,067
What on earth is this?

162
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,367
It's made for young people

163
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:19,167
so maybe it's too strong for you, Mr. Mouri?

164
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,867
I'll switch it to weak sleep mode.

165
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,367
No thanks!

166
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,767
Relieve my tiredness, my foot!

167
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:27,167
My whole body feels as if it's going to fall apart!

168
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,767
But...

169
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,867
Kasahara! That's enough.

170
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:34,267
-Oh, well... -Next! Hiramatsu!

171
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:36,067
Yes.

172
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,467
Hey, hey, what's this?

173
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:43,167
Are you going to beat up some monster?

174
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,167
Come to think of it,

175
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:47,367
my child has a toy that looks something like this.

176
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:50,567
Really, it looks like some robot animation.

177
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,367
Well, take a look at it, please.

178
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:58,567
Oh, yes, right there!

179
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:00,867
Right, just great, right there!

180
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,467
Dad?

181
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:05,567
How does this thing know just where I want to be massaged?

182
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,767
Right! That's exactly what the main feature

183
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,767
of this business type AIMS is all about!

184
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,467
A micro sensor detects the part of your body that is stiff

185
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:16,767
and massages with the exact strength needed.

186
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,967
Sounds like a great function,

187
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,567
but I'll bet the cost is really high.

188
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,967
No, the only thing new is the program,

189
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:28,367
and the rest involves diverting what was being used till now,

190
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:33,367
so I think the cost is less than half of what your cost is!

191
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,567
Besides, with a function as good as that,

192
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:38,767
it'll probably sell even if the price is a bit high.

193
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:40,367
Yes.

194
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:45,367
So! I'll think over which machine I'll sell

195
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,767
while taking a smoke.

196
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,267
Mr. Mouri, do make yourself at home too!

197
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:53,667
Thank you. I don't want to come out just yet.

198
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:59,367
Well, it feels so good, I feel like falling asleep.

199
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,967
Dad, you're interfering everybody with their work!

200
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:06,767
It's okay, because it seems he's already decided so...

201
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,467
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,567
Things are moving really fast today, don't you think?

203
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,467
It seems like the rumor about behind the scenes negotiations

204
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,567
was true after all.

205
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,367
It's probably because Mr. Mouri played monitor for us.

206
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,467
President didn't even have to think about it,

207
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,767
but I guess he just wanted to emphasize his importance.

208
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,467
I get it!

209
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,467
Maybe the rumor about the development section

210
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,267
going to be downsized is true!

211
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,267
Maybe he's thinking over which development section

212
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,467
to shut down now.

213
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,867
By the way, Mr. Kasahara, your seat

214
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:41,467
pushes at the vital points even if it isn't moving.

215
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,667
It's so lumpy!

216
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,867
What? How dare you...

217
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,667
Please calm down, Mr. Kasahara!

218
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,267
Thank you everyone!

219
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:52,867
May you all work together in peace.

220
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:56,767
I hope all of your inventions end up being marketed.

221
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,067
It's all your fault!

222
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,367
You're to blame for this.

223
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:04,367
Right, you do monitor for him,

224
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:06,067
representing the young generation, Ran!

225
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:08,167
No, I'd rather not...

226
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,967
Where's Conan?

227
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,467
Conan! What are you doing?

228
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,567
Don't touch things here!

229
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:19,067
Isn't this a knife? It's dangerous!

230
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:20,767
But, I wonder if it's for real.

231
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,567
It's real!

232
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:26,267
The president is a famous knife collector.

233
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,767
There's a lot of talk about his collection with our clients,

234
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,167
so he has a lot decorated at the company too.

235
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,467
Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

236
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:37,967
I've made up my mind!

237
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:43,167
We're going to put AIMS of the 3rd development section on the market!

238
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,567
And, we're going to consolidate the first

239
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,067
and second development sections into one section.

240
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,367
Will everyone except Hiramatsu leave the room?

241
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,967
-President! -I'll talk to you later!

242
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:57,567
Thank you so much also, Mr. Mouri.

243
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,567
Please relax in the reception corner.

244
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:05,367
After we finish work, I'd like to talk with you over drinks.

245
00:13:06,767 --> 00:13:08,567
Wow, that'd be just great!

246
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:12,767
Okay, I'll be waiting then.

247
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,967
They can't dispatch a repair car until the fog clears up after all.

248
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:20,267
I'll bet you're really relieved

249
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,967
because you can drink all you like now!

250
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:25,367
Well, I guess I'll go make some coffee then.

251
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:28,367
Oh, let me help you!

252
00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:30,467
I have to go to the restroom.

253
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,767
The restroom's beyond the room we were in just a while ago.

254
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,067
It's the second door to your left.

255
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,167
Okay!

256
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,067
Please nullify my contract with you!

257
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:42,967
I'm fed up having to work under you!

258
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:47,167
Do I look like a softy who would say, "Yes, of course",

259
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:50,367
and nullify our contract?

260
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,767
No...

261
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,967
so I have already made appropriate arrangements.

262
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,267
So, that you would by no means refuse to do so.

263
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:01,567
I'm definite that you won't refuse.

264
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:09,589
They're sure taking their time.

265
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:11,689
He's probably being threatened

266
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:14,589
and signing a ruthless contract or something.

267
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,589
Serves him right.

268
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,589
A ruthless contract?

269
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:19,689
Yes.

270
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:22,289
What does it mean to nullify a contract?

271
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:23,389
Gosh!

272
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,689
Keep out of this, kid!

273
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:29,989
Sonny, did you hear Hiramatsu say so to the president?

274
00:14:29,989 --> 00:14:34,889
Don't tell me Hiramatsu's planning to quit the company?

275
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,489
Which means that you're all contract employees?

276
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:42,789
Yes, when the president finds a talented developer,

277
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,289
he forces the developer to sign a long-term contract with him,

278
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:47,889
and makes it difficult for the person to quit easily.

279
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,989
By force? No.

280
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,289
It's true.

281
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:54,689
The president's physique is as you saw him.

282
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,689
Besides, he carries a "dan" in karate.

283
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,789
Even if he doesn't really hit you and stops just before hitting,

284
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:02,289
a weak hearted person would panic

285
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,289
and sign the contract immediately.

286
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:05,889
Oh, no.

287
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,089
Well, Kasahara and I have been here

288
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,089
since the previous president was our boss,

289
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,289
so we've been spared that karate scare

290
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:14,889
but all the young staff are being tempered here

291
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,489
at this study dormitory.

292
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:20,089
Moreover, he takes advantage of tax exemptions

293
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,789
and uses company funds to cover everything

294
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:28,089
from his hobby of collecting knives to giving gifts to women.

295
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,489
Even on our way here... take a look at this!

296
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:36,089
What's that?

297
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:38,289
Strange, that's the sound of a car...

298
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:44,289
It's Mr. Hiramatsu's car.

299
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:45,689
I wonder what's going on.

300
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,789
The window on the other side!

301
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:51,089
It's open.

302
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,489
No way?

303
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:54,989
Conan?

304
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:06,089
-This is? -President.

305
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:09,189
President? President!

306
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:10,989
Please get a hold of yourself!

307
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:12,889
Please stay back!

308
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,089
Mr. Umetani, are you okay?

309
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:21,089
He's still breathing!

310
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,189
President!

311
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,389
Ran! Get the ambulance and the police!

312
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,489
Yes!

313
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:30,189
Let's leave the rest to Ran and go after Mr. Hiramatsu!

314
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:33,589
The car in the foreground!

315
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:35,289
I've got the keys.

316
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:38,589
It's the president's but I drive it so...

317
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:41,089
Wait! There's a flat!

318
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:43,389
This side is super flat too!

319
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,189
The tires of my car are flat too!

320
00:16:46,189 --> 00:16:47,589
Darn!

321
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,589
In the mountains like this,

322
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,389
it's faster to take him to the hospital by car

323
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,389
than to wait for an ambulance but...

324
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:07,989
-Oh, president. -President!

325
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:09,189
Mr. Umetani.

326
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:11,589
President, please get a hold of yourself!

327
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,489
The knife fell off!

328
00:17:17,489 --> 00:17:19,489
What's going on?

329
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,489
This is?

330
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:28,789
The knife poked into the cigar case!

331
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:32,989
Which means that the cigar case saved his life?

332
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,889
-President! -Thank god!

333
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:43,789
Mr. Umetani, what in the world happened?

334
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,589
Hiramatsu suddenly stabbed me with a knife.

335
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:27,389
It seems that there was a thick fog at the time of the accident

336
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:30,189
and besides this slope is steep and the curve is very sharp...

337
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:32,789
It's most likely that he couldn't steer fast enough

338
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,089
while he was on the run.

339
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,889
Yeah, most likely...

340
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:41,089
All the tires of the other cars were flat,

341
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:46,689
so there was no reason for him to rush as much as he did, though.

342
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:49,689
If he could think on that line,

343
00:18:49,689 --> 00:18:52,789
he wouldn't have gotten enraged and stab somebody.

344
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:54,689
Exactly!

345
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:57,689
Just as expected of you Mr. Mouri, very sharp deduction!

346
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:59,889
Well...

347
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:08,589
Well, the victim is only slightly hurt,

348
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,389
so we'll be able to get at the motive of the stabber right away.

349
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:12,489
Right.

350
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,489
Sonny! What are you doing?

351
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:21,789
You shouldn't be in here.

352
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:24,589
What's this mirror?

353
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:26,389
Oh, that?

354
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:27,989
It's called a corner mirror.

355
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,189
From here on down, it's the land of that company

356
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:31,589
and it's a private road.

357
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:33,989
It seems that nobody is here now, though.

358
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:36,289
See, there's the sign of the company.

359
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,889
It says public welfare facility.

360
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,889
Well, it's like a company villa.

361
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,889
This large rock is really a pain

362
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,689
and it blocks vision when going in and out

363
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,189
making it really dangerous.

364
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:48,789
On this side, there's this sharp curve too.

365
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:52,189
There's a curve mirror there for the public road too.

366
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:54,989
Because I'm in charge around here,

367
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:59,389
I wanted a corner mirror for the private road!

368
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:01,389
I see.

369
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:05,389
The position of the mirror is not right.

370
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:07,789
It's good that they made a large one,

371
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,889
but I wonder if the wind blows it out of place.

372
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:11,889
It was okay in the day time!

373
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:14,589
Oh, I think it's better not to fix it.

374
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:18,689
It could've been the reason the accident occurred, right?

375
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:21,289
Oh, no!

376
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:27,089
And, Mr. Mouri wants you to check the brakes of the car right away!

377
00:20:27,089 --> 00:20:29,189
Mr. Mouri want me to?

378
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,289
I see!

379
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,789
The brakes may have not been working.

380
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:35,889
I'll ask using the wireless so wait a while, okay?

381
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,189
Conan!

382
00:20:37,189 --> 00:20:39,889
Just what are you doing in a place like this!

383
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:43,089
Dad's angry because he wants you to come back up.

384
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,789
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,389
Hurry, quick.

386
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:48,089
Oh, wait.

387
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:50,589
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

388
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:53,089
I tell you! Stop scampering around!

389
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,689
I'm going to leave you here!

390
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:56,289
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,489
Calm down, Mr. Mouri.

392
00:20:58,489 --> 00:20:59,889
Mr. Mouri!

393
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:03,189
Inspector Yokomizo!

394
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:06,089
About your question a while ago...

395
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:11,389
It seems that the brake oil of the car was completely gone.

396
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:13,789
-Huh? -What did you just say?

397
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,489
I can't tell for sure whether it happened

398
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,089
because of the shock of the accident

399
00:21:18,089 --> 00:21:19,689
or whether it happened before the accident,

400
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,789
but the tube seems to have come off.

401
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,189
Which means, Mr. Mouri...

402
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:28,689
the oil leaked out and the brakes may not have been working.

403
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,489
It's only natural for him to have gotten into an accident

404
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,589
on this mountainous road.

405
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:37,889
Strange.

406
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:40,589
There are too many strange things involved.

407
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:43,689
A person who gets enraged, stabs someone and flees,

408
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:44,989
flattens the tires of everyone's car

409
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:47,289
because he doesn't want anyone to come after him.

410
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:51,689
This same person panics and steers his car out of control,

411
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,889
and falls over the cliff to his death.

412
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:57,989
The curve mirror that was facing the wrong way.

413
00:21:58,889 --> 00:22:01,689
Brake oil that was completely gone.

414
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:05,489
Something smells fishy.

415
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,389
Very fishy!

416
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,689
A rope, a stun gun and a death note.

417
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:52,289
A death note? What's going on?

418
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:55,789
What's this?

419
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:56,889
What's wrong?

420
00:23:56,889 --> 00:23:59,089
Ran, please call Inspector Yokomizo and the others

421
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:01,789
and tell them to come back!

422
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:07,489
This is a cleverly schemed case of homicide!

423
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:09,289
Next Conan,

424
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,489
"The Lucky Cigar Case (Part 2)"

425
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:16,457
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:18,657
"Cigar"

427
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,457
Dad, which of the massage chairs was good?

428
00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:22,157
I can't tell unless I get to drink some beer.

429
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:23,503
Talk about hopeless.
