1
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:05.153
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:05.153 --> 00:00:07.143
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07.143 --> 00:00:08.863
Today is the
lemon pie conclusion!

4
00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:10.433
Fragrant memories
and tender first love!

5
00:00:10.903 --> 00:00:12.653
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:14.313
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.773
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:57.796
We were invited to the
birthday party of Uchida Asami,

9
00:01:57.796 --> 00:02:00.846
rumored to have
been Shinichi's first love.

10
00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:06.306
She fell asleep, so the rest of us
went to the Karaoke Room in town.

11
00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:10.146
That's when one of her friends
noticed the lodge was on fire!

12
00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:14.676
Uchida Asami
was asleep in the lodge!

13
00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:21.566
Luckily, Ran broke down the
door and managed to save her!

14
00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:27.546
"The Memories of First Love Case (Part 2)."

15
00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:32.586
Eh?! She said that in her sleep?!

16
00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:37.296
Not so loud! You'll wake her up!

17
00:02:41.216 --> 00:02:47.226
As I was saying, she was sleep-mumbling
when they brought her here.

18
00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:52.686
"I'm sorry! I'm sorry,
Kudo-kun! I'm so sorry!"

19
00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.146
But why would she say that?

20
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:58.706
How should I know?
That's just what I heard.

21
00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:06.006
Anyways, are you thirsty?

22
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.706
I can get you something from
the vending machine downstairs!

23
00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:10.526
I'll come with you, then.

24
00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:14.286
Say, is Conan-kun all right?

25
00:03:14.596 --> 00:03:17.756
Yeah! He's perfectly okay!
Not a scratch on him!

26
00:03:17.756 --> 00:03:21.126
I bet he's with your dad,
loitering around the scene of the fire.

27
00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:40.736
Was it really an accident? Did they
just forget to put out the candles?

28
00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:44.736
If so, then why was she asleep
on the sofa when we left

29
00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:48.116
but on the floor during the fire?

30
00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:50.156
And this room...

31
00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:55.346
Something seems off about
the furniture before and after the fire!

32
00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:57.166
Almost as if someone moved it!

33
00:03:57.506 --> 00:04:01.296
Could it be?! Did someone
come back here to set the fire?!

34
00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:05.676
If so, then Morimoto-san would be
most suspicious, as he had the key!

35
00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.006
No, wait!

36
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:13.296
Anyone could've easily entered
via a window unlocked in advance!

37
00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:15.686
Think! Think!

38
00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:19.566
According to the witnesses,
the fire started around 2:50.

39
00:04:20.136 --> 00:04:24.126
We were all in the karaoke booth at 3:00.

40
00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:31.006
By car, it'd take five minutes to get here.
Running, it'd take fifteen.

41
00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:33.636
No one was gone for thirty minutes,

42
00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:36.716
so only Noguchi-san could've
gone there, set the fire, and returned,

43
00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:38.846
since he had the car key...

44
00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.796
The car was parked in
front of the karaoke place,

45
00:04:42.796 --> 00:04:45.966
and everyone left thirty minutes
before to use the station bathrooms

46
00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:49.006
and buy cigarettes and such
from the convenience store next door.

47
00:04:49.006 --> 00:04:51.846
So someone would've
noticed if the car was missing.

48
00:04:53.296 --> 00:04:56.886
If not the car... Chika-san's motorcycle?!

49
00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:02.346
No, it was parked in front of
the lodge when we rushed here.

50
00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:03.796
It's impossible!

51
00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:07.986
None of the people in the
karaoke booth could've done it!

52
00:05:09.096 --> 00:05:13.046
It'd be a different story if there
was a timer device of some sort,

53
00:05:13.046 --> 00:05:16.956
but if there had been one,
the firemen would've found it long ago.

54
00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:22.416
Which leaves what the old guy
said... It was Asami-san who...

55
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:23.756
Hold it, little boy!

56
00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.466
You know you shouldn't be in here.

57
00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:28.756
I'm sorry!

58
00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:33.346
Oh, yeah. I hear today's the
birthday of that girl who was asleep.

59
00:05:33.346 --> 00:05:37.676
The presents and the cake all
burned up, but this survived the fire!

60
00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:38.226
Here you are!

61
00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:41.106
It's a birthday message for her, right?

62
00:05:41.106 --> 00:05:43.006
Go give it to her at the hospital.

63
00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:44.816
Huh? They don't fit!

64
00:05:46.006 --> 00:05:48.346
Wait a minute! Come to think of it...

65
00:05:49.346 --> 00:05:53.276
Come to think of it, that person
did say something strange then!

66
00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:57.746
Sheesh! Of course there was a fire!

67
00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:01.796
The cake with the lit candles
was sitting on a chair!

68
00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:06.626
Say, Mister. Was the
cake really on a chair?

69
00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:10.296
Yeah. The chair was burnt up,
and the cake turned to goop.

70
00:06:10.296 --> 00:06:12.296
Where was this chair?

71
00:06:12.296 --> 00:06:14.056
It's right over there.

72
00:06:14.346 --> 00:06:18.476
In front of that small,
charred cabinet in the corner.

73
00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:29.636
But doesn't it
seem strange to you, Ran?

74
00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:30.446
What do you mean?

75
00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:34.636
I heard she was in the tennis club
until her 2nd year of middle school.

76
00:06:34.636 --> 00:06:36.906
And she was the national champion that year!

77
00:06:37.296 --> 00:06:39.596
Wow, that's amazing.

78
00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:43.046
Huh? But wasn't she the soccer
club manager in her 3rd year?

79
00:06:43.046 --> 00:06:46.916
Yeah! Apparently she completely
changed after that summer break!

80
00:06:47.346 --> 00:06:48.876
I wonder why...

81
00:06:48.876 --> 00:06:52.006
She probably wanted to
focus on her studying.

82
00:06:52.006 --> 00:06:54.076
But that'd be even weirder.

83
00:06:54.076 --> 00:06:54.806
How come?

84
00:06:54.806 --> 00:06:59.846
The 2nd semester of the 3rd
year is when people quit their clubs!

85
00:06:59.846 --> 00:07:01.466
That is strange, now that you mention it.

86
00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:04.816
I bet she switched 'cause there
were no hot guys in the tennis club.

87
00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:06.966
Yeah, right. She isn't you.

88
00:07:06.966 --> 00:07:08.026
Say what?

89
00:07:08.026 --> 00:07:11.886
Well, anyways,
she must've had her reasons.

90
00:07:11.886 --> 00:07:14.426
It's probably
none of our business to pry.

91
00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:16.926
But I wanna know!

92
00:07:16.926 --> 00:07:20.676
Not so loud! You'll wake her up!

93
00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:21.236
Huh?

94
00:07:21.236 --> 00:07:22.666
What? What is it?

95
00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:27.836
S-Senpai?

96
00:07:29.176 --> 00:07:31.296
Eh? Customers who
came in at around 3:00?

97
00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:34.176
Yeah! Do you remember who came?

98
00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:40.046
Let me think. Just some youngsters
doing karaoke next door, I guess.

99
00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:42.846
They bought cigarettes,
tomato juice, and other stuff.

100
00:07:42.846 --> 00:07:44.016
What were they like?!

101
00:07:44.346 --> 00:07:48.886
A brown-haired guy with
glasses, a girl in a black dress,

102
00:07:48.886 --> 00:07:50.856
and a guy with a buzz-cut.

103
00:07:51.176 --> 00:07:54.066
Sawai-san, Hayasaka-san,
and Noguchi-san!

104
00:07:54.426 --> 00:07:58.676
Yeesh! That buzz-cut guy
puked in front of the store!

105
00:07:58.676 --> 00:08:00.926
Cleaning it up was such a pain!

106
00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:03.036
Say, Mister. Could you tell me if...

107
00:08:07.006 --> 00:08:08.706
Sonoko! Any luck?!

108
00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:12.636
No, she wasn't in the bathroom.
How about you, Ran?

109
00:08:12.636 --> 00:08:14.396
No luck here, either.

110
00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:17.926
Where could Asami-senpai have gone?

111
00:08:18.216 --> 00:08:22.886
Just contact your dad
for now! I'll go get a nurse!

112
00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:24.726
Right! Got it!

113
00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:30.816
Yeah, that's right, little boy!
How did you know that?

114
00:08:30.816 --> 00:08:32.346
Just as I thought.

115
00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:37.176
I told him he had it backwards,
but he didn't listen.

116
00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:41.786
It had sticky stuff on it, too.
What a ridiculous customer.

117
00:08:42.096 --> 00:08:45.546
No question about it!
That person set the fire!

118
00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:51.796
And if my theory is right, the
evidence is still in their possession!

119
00:08:52.716 --> 00:08:55.676
What?! Asami-san disappeared?!

120
00:08:55.926 --> 00:08:57.346
Are you serious, Ran?!

121
00:08:57.346 --> 00:08:59.636
Yeah! She was in
bed just a minute ago!

122
00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:03.506
She must've left while we were
getting something to drink!

123
00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:04.926
What do we do, Dad?!

124
00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:09.646
Just look around outside the
hospital! She might still be nearby!

125
00:09:09.646 --> 00:09:11.106
Okay.

126
00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:15.386
Where could Asami have gone?!

127
00:09:15.386 --> 00:09:18.216
She may be planning to commit suicide.

128
00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:19.076
Suicide?!

129
00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:25.506
Yes. If it really was
Asami-san who set the fire.

130
00:09:30.506 --> 00:09:32.086
Or so one might think.

131
00:09:32.086 --> 00:09:33.886
M-Mori-san?

132
00:09:33.886 --> 00:09:36.546
But the truth is different.

133
00:09:36.546 --> 00:09:40.296
Asami-san was not
the perpetrator but the victim!

134
00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:41.296
Victim?!

135
00:09:41.296 --> 00:09:45.756
Yes. Asami-san was nearly burned to death.

136
00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:49.506
By one of you here!

137
00:10:01.257 --> 00:10:02.967
Y-You can't be serious!

138
00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:07.467
But the fire started when
we were in the karaoke booth!

139
00:10:07.467 --> 00:10:10.787
It'd take fifteen minutes
to run from there to here.

140
00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:13.677
Or only five minutes
by car or motorcycle.

141
00:10:13.677 --> 00:10:17.467
The car didn't seem to have been used,

142
00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:19.497
and the motorcycle
was parked by this lodge.

143
00:10:19.757 --> 00:10:25.507
None of us could have
come here to set the fire then.

144
00:10:25.507 --> 00:10:29.257
Though it'd be different if there
was some sort of timer device,

145
00:10:29.257 --> 00:10:31.757
but the firefighters would've found it.

146
00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:33.137
A timer device...

147
00:10:33.587 --> 00:10:37.607
What if it was something
not out of the ordinary?

148
00:10:38.377 --> 00:10:41.837
What if it was something
that belonged there

149
00:10:41.837 --> 00:10:46.607
and could be controlled
from a remote location?

150
00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:53.007
Yes. The perpetrator set
the fire from kilometers away!

151
00:10:53.007 --> 00:10:57.707
By using a certain thing at a
certain location near the karaoke place!

152
00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:03.427
Little boy! Everything's ready here!

153
00:11:03.427 --> 00:11:05.627
Okay! We'll be right there!

154
00:11:05.627 --> 00:11:07.797
Hey. What's ready?

155
00:11:07.797 --> 00:11:11.587
This man asked me to have
the firefighters set up the same trick

156
00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:14.087
that the bad guy used!

157
00:11:14.087 --> 00:11:15.637
Eh?!

158
00:11:17.007 --> 00:11:18.097
What's so funny?

159
00:11:18.507 --> 00:11:21.837
It's just such a surprisingly simple trick!

160
00:11:21.837 --> 00:11:23.567
I bet it'll make you laugh, too!

161
00:11:28.507 --> 00:11:32.677
Oh, I see. It's set up like
the living room before the fire.

162
00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:34.317
It even has a fax machine.

163
00:11:34.317 --> 00:11:35.467
So it does.

164
00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:37.587
But how will this help?

165
00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:39.497
Pardon me!

166
00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:42.117
Cake?

167
00:11:42.117 --> 00:11:43.627
That's right.

168
00:11:43.627 --> 00:11:47.587
I asked Conan to buy some just now.

169
00:11:47.587 --> 00:11:53.007
If we place it on the chair in front
of the fax machine, everything's set.

170
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:58.227
Now we just wait until it starts a fire.

171
00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:09.047
Uhh, Mori-san?

172
00:12:09.047 --> 00:12:13.327
You're not suggesting we wait
until a candle falls to the floor?

173
00:12:13.757 --> 00:12:15.757
Besides, if that was what happened,

174
00:12:15.757 --> 00:12:18.337
that'd make it an accident
caused by carelessness.

175
00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:19.537
I would hardly call--

176
00:12:24.427 --> 00:12:25.837
A-A phone call?

177
00:12:28.927 --> 00:12:30.757
No, it's a fax!

178
00:12:33.967 --> 00:12:35.177
H-Hey!

179
00:12:37.177 --> 00:12:38.177
You don't mean...

180
00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:54.987
That fax was sent by the convenience
store owner at my request.

181
00:12:54.987 --> 00:12:57.447
Just as the perpetrator sent one.

182
00:12:58.467 --> 00:12:59.827
You can't be serious...

183
00:12:59.827 --> 00:13:02.417
That's too simple!

184
00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:04.967
That was the perpetrator's intent.

185
00:13:05.877 --> 00:13:10.257
The more complicated the trick,
the more likely evidence will be left.

186
00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:12.087
So the idea was to simplify the trick,

187
00:13:12.087 --> 00:13:15.427
leave as little out of
the ordinary as possible,

188
00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:19.307
and make it look
like an accidental fire.

189
00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:21.267
Isn't that right?

190
00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:27.527
You went to the convenience
store to buy cigarettes at that time...

191
00:13:29.127 --> 00:13:31.237
...Sawai Manabu-san!

192
00:13:32.427 --> 00:13:34.447
Y-You did it, Sawai-kun?!

193
00:13:34.447 --> 00:13:37.407
It's not true, right, President?!

194
00:13:37.407 --> 00:13:42.967
B-But he leapt into
the flames to rescue Asami!

195
00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:45.837
Would he really rescue
someone he was trying to kill?!

196
00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:49.467
Plus, he was the first to notice the fire!

197
00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:52.337
What if he hadn't intended to kill her?

198
00:13:53.337 --> 00:14:00.267
What if this fire was set so
he could rescue Asami-san?

199
00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:04.187
Sawai-san most likely did the following...

200
00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:08.777
He dropped sedatives into
her drink to make her sleep,

201
00:14:09.087 --> 00:14:14.087
set up the trick just now while
everyone was getting ready to leave,

202
00:14:14.087 --> 00:14:16.237
and then left the lodge.

203
00:14:16.927 --> 00:14:20.087
To keep Asami-san from burning
to death, he placed her on the floor,

204
00:14:20.087 --> 00:14:22.707
far away from any furniture.

205
00:14:22.707 --> 00:14:27.667
Then, just as he planned,
while everyone was busy doing karaoke,

206
00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:32.087
he sent a fax to
the lodge and started the fire.

207
00:14:32.257 --> 00:14:39.757
The store owner saw him sending
the fax just before the fire started.

208
00:14:39.757 --> 00:14:44.097
The burned remnants
of that fax were also found.

209
00:14:44.097 --> 00:14:45.297
Burned remnants?

210
00:14:45.297 --> 00:14:48.567
These! A firefighter gave them to me earlier!

211
00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:53.127
See? The shapes don't fit,
so there must've been two pages.

212
00:14:53.127 --> 00:14:58.297
Only one page was sent before
the fire, so it seemed strange.

213
00:14:58.297 --> 00:14:59.527
Right, Mister?

214
00:14:59.527 --> 00:15:04.827
H-Hold on, now! Yes, I did send
a fax at the convenience store.

215
00:15:05.127 --> 00:15:08.297
But it was a fax I sent to a friend!

216
00:15:08.297 --> 00:15:12.627
He asked me to come
up with a good title for his novel!

217
00:15:12.627 --> 00:15:15.797
Oh? A friend, huh?

218
00:15:15.797 --> 00:15:18.597
Then how do you explain the transmit slip?

219
00:15:19.717 --> 00:15:25.557
You gave the transmit slip to the
store owner after you sent it, right?

220
00:15:26.177 --> 00:15:33.027
The date, time, phone number,
and your fingerprints are on it.

221
00:15:33.297 --> 00:15:37.627
Oh, that's strange.
I'm sure I sent it to him.

222
00:15:37.627 --> 00:15:39.377
Just a minute.

223
00:15:41.047 --> 00:15:43.697
Yes! I must've dialed the wrong number!

224
00:15:44.257 --> 00:15:49.467
See? My friend's number and this
lodge's number are next to each other.

225
00:15:50.177 --> 00:15:54.587
Besides, I'm president of Toto
University's mystery study club!

226
00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:58.047
I'd never use such
an unreliable trick as that!

227
00:15:58.047 --> 00:16:01.097
That's why you tested it with a copy.

228
00:16:02.627 --> 00:16:06.257
When you set up the living room trick,

229
00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.507
you used the fax machine's copy feature

230
00:16:08.507 --> 00:16:11.557
to determine where it would catch fire.

231
00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:17.427
As you know, to use the copy
feature, you need to use an original.

232
00:16:17.427 --> 00:16:23.757
So you copied the birthday
message Professor Takamura just sent,

233
00:16:23.757 --> 00:16:25.327
which was lying nearby.

234
00:16:25.587 --> 00:16:31.287
What's more, you faxed that copy
from the convenience store later.

235
00:16:31.677 --> 00:16:37.297
The copy that had the
message and cake cream on it.

236
00:16:37.837 --> 00:16:43.467
The owner complained that you
stuck sticky paper in the machine.

237
00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:47.427
He also said he told you it was backwards.

238
00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:52.857
But you can't blame him.
You sent the blank side of the copy.

239
00:16:53.507 --> 00:16:58.217
Because if two faxes with the same
message were found at the scene,

240
00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.567
it would raise suspicion.

241
00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:05.277
That's enough! I'm sick of these
groundless, made-up accusations!

242
00:17:05.277 --> 00:17:07.757
If you're going to make
such claims, show some proof!

243
00:17:07.757 --> 00:17:09.747
Are you still playing innocent?

244
00:17:10.467 --> 00:17:15.207
You still have the fax in question.

245
00:17:15.927 --> 00:17:18.467
People certainly are strange.

246
00:17:18.467 --> 00:17:23.217
They can't easily throw away
anything that could put them in danger.

247
00:17:23.627 --> 00:17:27.717
They worry that
someone else might pick it up.

248
00:17:28.927 --> 00:17:30.877
You're a prime example.

249
00:17:30.877 --> 00:17:33.587
You even brought it back
from the convenience store.

250
00:17:33.587 --> 00:17:34.607
Are you saying he--?!

251
00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:39.527
Yes. He should still
have it on him somewhere...

252
00:17:40.127 --> 00:17:46.177
A fax with Professor Takamura's
message and cake cream on it!

253
00:17:46.877 --> 00:17:48.007
If you'll excuse us...

254
00:17:48.007 --> 00:17:49.037
Don't touch me!

255
00:17:51.967 --> 00:17:56.457
How ridiculous! I should've
just thrown this thing away!

256
00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:01.927
T-Then it really was you?!

257
00:18:01.927 --> 00:18:07.717
Yeah. I set the fire. Using the exact
method the detective explained.

258
00:18:07.717 --> 00:18:13.087
But how did you know it was me?
Anyone could've used that trick.

259
00:18:13.087 --> 00:18:17.057
Think back to when we all rushed here.

260
00:18:18.257 --> 00:18:21.187
Should we call her on the phone?!
She was asleep in the living room!

261
00:18:21.187 --> 00:18:23.957
It's no use! It's already burned up!

262
00:18:25.967 --> 00:18:31.257
I see. Only someone who knew
where the fire was could've said that.

263
00:18:31.257 --> 00:18:34.297
But why would you do that to Asami?!

264
00:18:34.297 --> 00:18:36.757
I wanted her to love me.

265
00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:42.127
As a brave man who risked his
life to rescue her from the flames.

266
00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:47.087
She turned me down
when I asked her out last month.

267
00:18:47.087 --> 00:18:50.877
That had never happened
to me before, so I couldn't stand it.

268
00:18:50.877 --> 00:18:55.557
I'd planned for it to be a small fire,
but it spread faster than I thought.

269
00:18:55.557 --> 00:18:56.477
You fool!

270
00:18:57.427 --> 00:19:00.937
Just a small fire?!
It spread faster than you thought?!

271
00:19:01.257 --> 00:19:05.147
Do you think those
serve as excuses?! You idiot!

272
00:19:05.547 --> 00:19:10.087
Why couldn't you imagine
Asami-san possibly burning to death?!

273
00:19:10.087 --> 00:19:14.427
The car could've gotten into an accident!
It could've gotten a flat tire!

274
00:19:14.427 --> 00:19:15.957
There could've been a traffic jam!

275
00:19:16.427 --> 00:19:20.877
Asami-san would've lost
her life in any of those cases!

276
00:19:21.177 --> 00:19:23.337
If you wanted her to love you,

277
00:19:23.337 --> 00:19:26.967
why didn't you consider becoming
someone who could be loved?!

278
00:19:26.967 --> 00:19:32.757
Why didn't you consider
improving yourself instead?!

279
00:19:32.757 --> 00:19:36.427
Yes. That was very stupid, President.

280
00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:38.557
Asami...

281
00:19:39.087 --> 00:19:40.297
I did something horrible.

282
00:19:40.297 --> 00:19:43.297
I can't believe you did this for me...

283
00:19:43.297 --> 00:19:46.587
Alright. You can explain
everything to the police.

284
00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:47.627
Yeah.

285
00:19:54.757 --> 00:19:55.707
President.

286
00:19:58.337 --> 00:20:03.127
You can't open people's hearts with force.

287
00:20:03.967 --> 00:20:05.627
Yeah.

288
00:20:05.627 --> 00:20:10.087
I bet you could capture any
man with a single breath, though.

289
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.017
That's not true.

290
00:20:16.547 --> 00:20:19.127
You just don't know about me.

291
00:20:19.127 --> 00:20:20.977
Long ago, even I...

292
00:20:22.127 --> 00:20:23.227
...even I was...

293
00:21:51.707 --> 00:21:54.267
Eh?! You confessed to Shinichi-kun?!

294
00:21:54.267 --> 00:21:57.287
Yep. I was the one who confessed my love.

295
00:21:57.287 --> 00:21:59.457
He completely rejected me, though.

296
00:21:59.457 --> 00:22:01.287
B-But the rumor said...

297
00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:04.737
Oh. I started that rumor.

298
00:22:05.077 --> 00:22:09.327
I really wanted him to
like me. He was my first love.

299
00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:13.207
But he didn't seem to care about it.

300
00:22:14.627 --> 00:22:17.957
Umm, there's one thing I'd like to know...

301
00:22:17.957 --> 00:22:21.177
What exactly about him did you like?

302
00:22:21.457 --> 00:22:26.167
Hmm. I didn't really
take notice of him at first.

303
00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:29.957
In his first year, he was a regular
midfielder on the soccer team.

304
00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:33.397
I thought he was an impressive
newcomer. That's about it.

305
00:22:33.397 --> 00:22:38.747
But one day, I shared some
lemon pie I made with the soccer club.

306
00:22:38.747 --> 00:22:42.857
Everyone told me it
was delicious, except for him...

307
00:22:44.287 --> 00:22:47.327
Huh? This is kind of bad.

308
00:22:47.327 --> 00:22:50.037
Shinichi has a weird sense of taste!

309
00:22:50.037 --> 00:22:53.917
No. I guess it really wasn't very good at all.

310
00:22:53.917 --> 00:22:57.377
Later on, everyone
said they had pretended to like it.

311
00:22:57.377 --> 00:23:02.917
That hurt my feelings, so I baked
a new one every day for three months

312
00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:04.997
until he said it was good.

313
00:23:04.997 --> 00:23:08.577
Before I knew it, I was
manager of the soccer club

314
00:23:08.577 --> 00:23:10.787
and fascinated with him.

315
00:23:10.787 --> 00:23:13.977
Someone else made it
great on her first try, though.

316
00:23:14.537 --> 00:23:19.987
Did you know? I was mean and
taught you a weird way of making it!

317
00:23:19.987 --> 00:23:21.937
Eh?! How come?!

318
00:23:21.937 --> 00:23:28.407
Sheesh. Shall I tell you what he
said after I confessed to him, then?

319
00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:30.627
U-Umm, say--!

320
00:23:30.627 --> 00:23:34.367
Pipe down!
This is getting good! Be quiet!

321
00:23:34.627 --> 00:23:37.697
He said this while
acting embarrassed...

322
00:23:40.787 --> 00:23:42.537
I'm sorry, Senpai.

323
00:23:42.537 --> 00:23:46.457
There's someone I've been
fond of since I was little.

324
00:23:46.457 --> 00:23:50.457
She's strong-minded and obstinate,
yet easily moved to tears.

325
00:23:50.457 --> 00:23:52.477
It's that strangeness of hers...

326
00:23:53.627 --> 00:23:54.807
And there you have it.

327
00:23:55.627 --> 00:23:59.267
H-Hold on, Ran! Could that be--?!

328
00:23:59.267 --> 00:24:01.457
Do you remember a girl like that?

329
00:24:01.457 --> 00:24:02.447
Huh?

330
00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:05.807
Oh well.

331
00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:14.667
Don't play dumb, Okita!

332
00:24:14.667 --> 00:24:18.877
We saw Nagakura Isami-san
collapse on the veranda from your room!

333
00:24:19.627 --> 00:24:23.257
It definitely looks
like Okita-san killed her.

334
00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:31.467
Wait a minute!
Could this incident be--?!

335
00:24:32.247 --> 00:24:33.707
On the next Conan--

336
00:24:33.707 --> 00:24:37.167
"The Historical Drama
Actor Murder Case (Part 1)."
