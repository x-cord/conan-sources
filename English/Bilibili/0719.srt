1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,240
One moment please.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,640
But, Haruka. It's amazing you got a hold of the ticket

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,440
for the Black Roses Live.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,240
It was a present from him.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,940
What? You mean that nameless guitarist?

6
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,240
Yep. The day is his birthday, you see!

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,640
And he says he wants me to celebrate it with him.

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,240
I see. It's surprising how he came up with the cash.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,740
Thank you for waiting.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,640
I clicked at exactly 10:00 sharp, but couldn't get through.

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,440
I'm sorry, Sonoko.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,240
See, I told you, didn't I?

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,740
That's it's going to be horrendous trying to get tickets

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,940
being that it's going to be their one and only Japan tour.

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,540
At times like this, the only way is

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,340
to go directly to the store and get in line.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,840
Sonoko, don't tell me that that's...

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,040
2 arena seat tickets to the Black Roses Tokyo Live.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,840
I had a tough time trying to get them, you know.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,940
It's gone!

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm sure I put it in here.

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,940
Who is it? That stole my ticket?

23
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,540
Wrong! I got this ticket.

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,540
Thief!

25
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,040
The black of shadow and the density of darkness

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
are slashed by the light of deduction.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,540
An incident occurs at a coffee shop.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,240
Beware of rare tickets!

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,940
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,640
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:14,454 --> 00:03:20,254
"The Platinum Ticket Commotion"

33
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:21,954
"The next day"

34
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:24,554
I was taken to the police box on the corner after that

35
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:27,854
and until my innocence was proven, it took 3 hours! 3 hours!

36
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:34,754
But she have a note of her seat number on the ticket?

37
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:38,354
But she said it was one that her boyfriend got hold of from a friend,

38
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,254
so she had no record of it at all.

39
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,954
I tell you, really, it's so infuriating!

40
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:45,554
I got in line and stood overnight from Saturday.

41
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:47,554
Excuse me.

42
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:50,354
I would like an XL size cafe latte,

43
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:53,154
with an addition of vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup to go with it,

44
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:56,154
and chocolate chip topping with just a little ice.

45
00:03:56,154 --> 00:03:59,654
An X large size cafe latte with vanilla ice cream,

46
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:02,454
caramel syrup and chocolate chip topping to go with it.

47
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,254
And you just want a little ice.

48
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:07,754
Hey, Sonoko. Hold it down a bit, girl.

49
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:13,454
It's okay. It's on the house today,

50
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:14,554
so order to your heart's content.

51
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:18,354
Welcome.

52
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:22,754
Conan, it's her.

53
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:26,754
The one who called us thief yesterday, Haruka Kona.

54
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:31,354
Excuse me. We're sorry about yesterday.

55
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,754
Please take a look at this!

56
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:39,054
Last night after this shop had closed,

57
00:04:39,054 --> 00:04:41,154
this ticket for the live was put on auction

58
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:43,754
from an internet auction site!

59
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:46,054
No joke! 50,000 yen per ticket?

60
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:49,154
The price sky-rocketed to 5 times the original in one night!

61
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:50,754
Not only the price,

62
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:52,954
but also the handle name of the exhibitor.

63
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:54,854
Coffee Rumba?

64
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:57,454
It sure sounds like a name

65
00:04:57,454 --> 00:04:59,754
that a coffee shop employee would use, don't you think?

66
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:03,154
Don't tell me that one of our employees is the culprit?

67
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:05,354
Aren't you just kind of picking a fight?

68
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:07,454
At any rate, I'd like to talk to the people

69
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:10,954
who were at this shop last night.

70
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:13,154
The people who were at the shop last night

71
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:17,754
were me and Kosuda who was passing out cake freebies,

72
00:05:17,754 --> 00:05:21,454
and the cashier, Masako Moka.

73
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,154
Please call her over here, too!

74
00:05:27,554 --> 00:05:30,554
The fact is, she's hasn't shown up yet today.

75
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:38,954
No good.

76
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:41,554
She's not answering no matter how many times I call.

77
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:44,354
It seems that she hasn't attended her university classes either.

78
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:45,954
Maybe something came up?

79
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:48,754
Is she your friend?

80
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:51,554
Yes, we're classmates at the university.

81
00:05:51,554 --> 00:05:55,754
She was supposed to work the shift after me today.

82
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:59,554
True. She should've been here some time ago, already.

83
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:02,554
Shall I go check on her on my way home?

84
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:04,854
-Will you do that? -Yes, sir.

85
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:07,154
Wait. If so, I'll go with you too.

86
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,354
We'll tag along with you too, then.

87
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,754
-Right? -Yeah.

88
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,654
Masako.

89
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:25,454
Masako. Aren't you home?

90
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,254
It's open.

91
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:34,354
Masako?

92
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,454
Conan!

93
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:55,054
No good. She's already dead.

94
00:06:55,054 --> 00:06:58,054
Ran, call the police, please.

95
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,754
Okay!

96
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:15,954
This is...

97
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:17,454
an auction site.

98
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,654
Which means that it was her after all.

99
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:26,054
Manager!

100
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:28,154
What's the meaning of this?

101
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:30,254
You are?

102
00:07:30,254 --> 00:07:32,054
I'm the store manager of the coffee shop

103
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:36,254
that Ms. Moka works for, Jiro Kirima.

104
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:37,554
I see.

105
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:41,454
Please tell me what Ms. Moka was doing last night.

106
00:07:41,454 --> 00:07:44,554
Yes, sir. Ms. Moka was working the late shift

107
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:47,754
and they worked together until 21:00.

108
00:07:47,754 --> 00:07:50,854
After quickly cleaning the shop,

109
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:53,154
we changed and left the shop.

110
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,754
I think at around 21:15.

111
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:59,954
It takes about 30 minutes from the shop to here,

112
00:07:59,954 --> 00:08:03,954
so she probably got home at around 21:45.

113
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:05,554
And 30 minutes later,

114
00:08:05,554 --> 00:08:09,354
the ticket was placed on the auction site.

115
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:12,554
Inspector. According to Mr. Uruma who lives next door,

116
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:14,954
it seems that she was washing clothes

117
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:16,554
between 22:20 to 23:00 last night.

118
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:19,354
What?

119
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:22,254
Does she always wash clothes at that time of day?

120
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:25,554
Yeah. She vacuums her room late at night

121
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,554
as well as bring her boyfriend around, too.

122
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:29,754
She delays paying the rent a lot, too.

123
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:32,154
She was a sloppy woman.

124
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:33,754
I see.

125
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:35,254
If she had 40 minutes,

126
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:37,654
she would've finished washing clothes, no?

127
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:39,954
May I take a look?

128
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,554
No, Conan.

129
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,054
You shouldn't look in on women's clothes.

130
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:45,554
Okay.

131
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:51,354
Inspector, the wash is still in here after being wrung.

132
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:56,254
Moreover, from the fact that the bag was near the corpse on the floor,

133
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:58,954
it seems that the victim was planning to go out somewhere

134
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,954
while the washing machine was still running.

135
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,854
That's when she ran into the thief

136
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:06,254
that broke into her place was killed.

137
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,254
-But, isn't that strange? -Huh?

138
00:09:09,254 --> 00:09:11,354
Because if the washing machine is running,

139
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:14,854
wouldn't it be natural to think that somebody's home?

140
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,754
I see. That's true.

141
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:21,054
I'm sure that after running the washing machine,

142
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:24,654
she was planning to go to a convenience store nearby and left.

143
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:26,754
But she realized right away that she had forgotten something

144
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:28,254
and came home.

145
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:30,754
That's where she ran into the culprit.

146
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:36,654
But, what did she forget?

147
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,554
Most probably the deposit slip

148
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:41,154
to pay for her gas bill that was on the table.

149
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:45,754
The payment deadline is last night.

150
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:48,754
It could be just as Conan had said.

151
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,754
Yes.

152
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:52,554
The culprit, after murdering the victim

153
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:54,754
pulled the bills out of the wallet,

154
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:57,854
took the ticket and fled.

155
00:09:57,854 --> 00:10:02,654
So, the culprit knew that the ticket was premium?

156
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:06,354
Which means that you may have been in danger too, Sonoko.

157
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:08,254
But if I were the thief,

158
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:11,354
I would go for the laptop first of all.

159
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:16,254
And more so, Pops was saying

160
00:10:16,254 --> 00:10:19,654
that professional thieves, in order to work effectively,

161
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:23,354
would open drawers in order from the bottom up.

162
00:10:23,354 --> 00:10:26,354
But these drawers aren't opened that way.

163
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:27,754
Then, it's also likely that

164
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:30,754
the culprit tried to make it look like the work of a thief?

165
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:34,254
First of all, let's start by

166
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,054
checking on the acquaintances of the victim, shall we?

167
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:38,554
What? Ms. Moka's boyfriend?

168
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,954
Yes. Do you remember what kind of man he was?

169
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:46,854
The thing is, I've never met him personally.

170
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:51,054
Store manager.

171
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:55,054
I think it's better for you to tell the police the truth.

172
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,354
What the? What should I tell them, sonny?

173
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:02,154
You were the one going with the lady who died, right?

174
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:06,754
Because on your cell phone, you had her name registered

175
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:10,354
not by her full name, but as "Masa-chan."

176
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,954
Besides even on the shift chart back at the shop,

177
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:18,054
both of you had days off on the same days, right?

178
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,454
I saw it.

179
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:24,154
Is what he just said true?

180
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:29,454
To be honest, I've been going with her since two months ago.

181
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:32,854
You have a spare key, don't you?

182
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:35,154
Yes.

183
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:39,154
I see. If you have the spare key,

184
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:41,854
it would've been easy for you to enter the room

185
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:44,254
after confirming that she had gone out, wouldn't it?

186
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:45,954
No.

187
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:49,954
Then, please tell me what you were doing last night.

188
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:53,254
Yesterday, after closing the shop,

189
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,554
I was placing orders for stationeries and odds and ends

190
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:57,854
to be used at the shop, then left,

191
00:11:57,854 --> 00:12:00,754
so it must've been around a little before 22:00.

192
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,854
It's true that if they were going with each other,

193
00:12:02,854 --> 00:12:06,154
they could've easily gotten into a fight over emotional differences.

194
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:10,754
Besides, Masako was trying to resell a customer's ticket.

195
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,054
It's highly probable that she got into a fight

196
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:16,454
with Mr. Kirima who is the store manager.

197
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:20,054
But what is it? Something just doesn't feel right.

198
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:26,554
And where and what were you doing between 22:20 and 23:00?

199
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:28,754
I see.

200
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:33,654
Sir. How come you remember so accurately

201
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:36,854
the time that the washing machine was running?

202
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,854
It was rattling and making a lot of noise.

203
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:42,654
After about 5 minutes it stopped once,

204
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:45,454
so I thought the owner heard the noise and...

205
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:48,054
-It stopped once? -Yeah.

206
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:49,454
But after a while,

207
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,754
it started spinning making that loud noise again,

208
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,454
that's why I remember.

209
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:02,154
I see. That was the cause of the noise.

210
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:05,154
But, why was only that?

211
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,454
This is...

212
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,854
I get it! So, that's the story!

213
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,704
I get it! So, that's the story!

214
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:33,004
Gosh. The minute we take our eyes off of you, it's this.

215
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:34,404
Sonoko.

216
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:37,204
You're too young to be looking in on women's clothes yet!

217
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:41,204
I've got to tell Ran to educate you correctly!

218
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:49,604
Sonoko.

219
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:50,904
Sonoko?

220
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:53,504
How annoying. We know who the culprit is,

221
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:56,204
so why don't we get right to it and solve the case?

222
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,004
-What? -What?

223
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,204
The victim started washing clothes last night,

224
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:05,204
but didn't get around to taking out the laundry from the washing machine.

225
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:06,904
So, we can assume that the incident happened

226
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:08,804
during the time that the washing machine was running

227
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:13,204
which was between 22:20 to 23:00.

228
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:16,004
But after scrutinizing this washing machine,

229
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,304
there's something queer about it.

230
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:20,104
Something queer?

231
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,504
Officer Sato, please turn the faucet on.

232
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:29,004
The faucet is shut off.

233
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:32,604
Exactly. The laundry hasn't been taken out

234
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:35,304
and yet the faucet is shut off.

235
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:38,104
In other words, couldn't it be that someone stopped the water

236
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:39,504
and drained the washing machine

237
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,604
in order to take something out of it?

238
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:44,604
What's that something?

239
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:48,404
Of course, the ticket for the Black Roses live.

240
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,604
But, why would it be in the washing machine?

241
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:53,304
Because the culprit was sure that

242
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:55,504
it would be in the pocket of the apron

243
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:58,404
that Masako took home from the shop.

244
00:14:58,404 --> 00:14:59,804
The culprit last night,

245
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:02,704
put the ticket that she stole from Haruka

246
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:05,904
into her own apron pocket.

247
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,604
But, after closing time,

248
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:12,604
Masako mistakenly took that apron home thinking it was hers.

249
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:17,904
That's why the culprit came to this room

250
00:15:17,904 --> 00:15:21,304
to retrieve that ticket she had stolen.

251
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:22,504
Wait a minute!

252
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,504
It's just as if you're saying that I'm the culprit!

253
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:28,804
But, aren't you? Ms. Kaori Kosuda?

254
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:34,504
You, who approached the apartment last night,

255
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:37,904
saw Masako throw the apron from the shop

256
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,904
into the washing machine and run it.

257
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:43,104
You were at a loss what to do.

258
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:45,604
She eventually went shopping

259
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:48,004
while the washing machine was running.

260
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,204
You then stopped the water

261
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:53,204
and was about to take out your own apron,

262
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:56,404
but Masako who had forgotten something

263
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:59,404
came back right away.

264
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:01,604
After murdering Masako,

265
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:03,704
in order to make it look as if a thief had broken in,

266
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,204
you messed the room up.

267
00:16:05,204 --> 00:16:08,604
Then, in order to feign that the entire washing process had ended,

268
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:11,904
you set the washing machine to spin dry and left.

269
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,504
Enough is enough!

270
00:16:13,504 --> 00:16:16,704
Who's going to believe something so ridiculous?

271
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:21,104
But you seem to have forgotten to open the faucet that you shut off.

272
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:23,704
Everything you're saying

273
00:16:23,704 --> 00:16:25,504
is all a product of your imagination.

274
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:27,704
Where on earth is the evidence?

275
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,604
I've got proof.

276
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:32,004
It's the apron that you have with you!

277
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,404
Apron?

278
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,704
I get it. If it's just as Sonoko said

279
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,804
and Masako brought home Kaori's apron,

280
00:16:39,804 --> 00:16:42,204
the apron that Kaori has right now

281
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:46,104
is indeed actually Masako's apron, right?

282
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,004
I see.

283
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:53,204
You would recognize my apron, wouldn't you, Manager?

284
00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:58,504
-Please confirm. -Yes.

285
00:16:59,804 --> 00:17:01,604
Can you tell?

286
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,604
This is Ms. Kosuda's apron.

287
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:07,804
She just started working for us from last month,

288
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,304
so her apron is still new.

289
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:12,104
So, now you know.

290
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:14,304
I'm not the culprit!

291
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:16,904
Your deduction is wrong.

292
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,904
Mr. Uruma.

293
00:17:20,904 --> 00:17:22,804
It seems that the washing machine last night

294
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:25,304
was especially noisy, wasn't it?

295
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:30,604
Yeah. Something hard must've been inside.

296
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:35,104
Officer Sato, please take a look inside the washing machine.

297
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,104
Okay.

298
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:39,204
So this is the apron in question.

299
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:44,704
What's up?

300
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,604
There's a red marker inside.

301
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:47,704
What?

302
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:50,104
Right, a red marker.

303
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:52,004
It's a miscellaneous item of the shop

304
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,404
that's used to write in special orders.

305
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:58,604
The shirt and towel that have been washed are pink

306
00:17:58,604 --> 00:18:00,204
because although they were originally white,

307
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,004
they were dyed by the ink of the red marker.

308
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:07,004
By the way, there's a dark smear on the pocket of the pants,

309
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:12,304
so it must've inadvertently been thrown into the washing machine.

310
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:14,904
True.

311
00:18:14,904 --> 00:18:16,204
Inspector Megure.

312
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:20,204
Will you please take a look at Kaori's apron once again?

313
00:18:20,204 --> 00:18:21,504
Okay.

314
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:23,604
If my deduction is correct,

315
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:27,704
I'm sure that apron is also dyed pink.

316
00:18:27,704 --> 00:18:31,904
Too bad. The apron of Marine Coffee is black.

317
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:33,804
It couldn't be dyed with a red marker.

318
00:18:33,804 --> 00:18:35,604
-It's dyed. -Huh?

319
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:38,704
The washing instructions tab is dyed pink!

320
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:42,804
Kaori.

321
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,404
After committing the murder,

322
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:46,204
in order to leave no trace behind,

323
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:49,104
you took your own apron out of the washing machine,

324
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:51,904
and put Masako's apron inside it in place of yours.

325
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:55,304
Then you spun dried it with the other laundry.

326
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,704
That's why the washing instructions tab of the apron

327
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,004
that is inside the washing machine is white as it was originally.

328
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:05,004
And your apron's washing instructions tab is dyed pink.

329
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:09,204
No.

330
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:15,304
Ms. Kosuda. Why did you...

331
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:20,104
That's because the ticket was originally what Kaori had bought.

332
00:19:21,804 --> 00:19:23,004
Just what're you talking about?

333
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,904
It's what my boyfriend...

334
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:27,204
According to the shift chart that we saw a while ago at the shop,

335
00:19:27,204 --> 00:19:30,804
last Sunday when most of the employees were working,

336
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:34,304
only Kaori had taken a day off.

337
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:36,204
You took a day off

338
00:19:36,204 --> 00:19:40,104
to get in line overnight at the ticket shop, didn't you?

339
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:42,704
You did?

340
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:47,104
I just wanted to make my boyfriend happy.

341
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:51,504
To see him smiling on his birthday, the day of the live...

342
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,304
Your boyfriend?

343
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:55,004
Don't tell me...

344
00:19:55,004 --> 00:19:56,904
He's a guitarist,

345
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,104
although he's nameless.

346
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:04,404
But he told me that he couldn't go because of work that day.

347
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:08,004
So, that he was going to give the ticket

348
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:10,504
to an acquaintance at a record company.

349
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:14,904
A person at a record company? Me?

350
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:17,604
I realized it, just yesterday.

351
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:20,104
When you came to the shop.

352
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:22,704
What? You mean that nameless guitarist?

353
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:26,304
Yep. The day is his birthday, you see!

354
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:28,604
And he says he wants me to celebrate it with him.

355
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,704
I didn't think that he would...

356
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:32,204
After thinking about it,

357
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:35,404
I just couldn't not do anything about it.

358
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:37,104
On second thought,

359
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,804
Masako was watching all that.

360
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:44,504
Yes. It's all just as you've deduced.

361
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:50,704
After Masako left, I came here to retrieve the apron.

362
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:53,804
But Masako saw me.

363
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,704
You really surprised me, though.

364
00:20:57,704 --> 00:20:58,804
To think that somebody as well-behaved as you

365
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,904
would steal something from a customer.

366
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,004
It's about time you wake up, don't you think?

367
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:06,804
You're just being used as a handy money-giving girlfriend!

368
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:07,904
No!

369
00:21:07,904 --> 00:21:11,704
That guy doesn't give a hoot about you!

370
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:15,604
Wrong! He told me that he loved me!

371
00:21:15,604 --> 00:21:17,104
That he loved me.

372
00:21:17,104 --> 00:21:19,004
He loved me...

373
00:21:20,304 --> 00:21:22,404
Masako.

374
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:30,004
When I snapped back to myself, I suddenly got scared.

375
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:31,204
That's why...

376
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:35,204
You tried to make it look to be the doing of a thief?

377
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:37,804
But at the point, you tried to hide your crime

378
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:40,004
and fabricated the site,

379
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:44,204
you turned into an even more ill-natured,

380
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:47,004
cowardly liar than the guy who deceived you.

381
00:23:19,204 --> 00:23:20,804
But the worst of them all

382
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:23,504
is the guitarist that deceived the two, right?

383
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:25,504
You can say that again.

384
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:28,204
I don't remember a thing, though.

385
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:31,404
If I were her, I would blast him with a punch.

386
00:23:36,304 --> 00:23:40,004
Two-timing men are the pits!

387
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:51,104
Well, I guess he asked for it.

388
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:54,004
"Next Episode"

389
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:55,804
We the members of the Youth Detective Squad,

390
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:58,204
accompanied by Ran and Pops

391
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:01,004
came to Kumamoto on a sightseeing tour.

392
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,404
I'm Justin.

393
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:05,004
Justin Takamori.

394
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:07,304
The man just left Kumamon behind

395
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:09,104
and took the bag with him.

396
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:12,004
Report back to me as soon as the crowd of people subside!

397
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:17,404
The culprit kidnapped the child and all!

398
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:22,804
Next Conan, "Fire and Water Mystery Tour (Aso Edition)"

399
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:40,604

400
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,904
"Stuffed Doll"

401
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:44,004
The next episode will take place in Kumamoto.

402
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:45,604
Raw horse meat and spicy lotus root.

403
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:47,904
They say it's going to be a mystery tour.
