1
00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:06.309
Rikumichi Kusuda a member of the Black Organization

2
00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.809
that snuck into the hospital where Rena Mizunashi is hospitalized...

3
00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.809
commits suicide after being pursued by agent Akai and I.

4
00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.009
Agent Akai declares that since if Kusuda was able to make contact,

5
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.209
the Organization would single out this hospital.

6
00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:24.909
The FBI works out remedial measures.

7
00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:27.509
But, there are many patients

8
00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.509
who cannot move from here, you know?

9
00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.409
We can't just do nothing and wait

10
00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:34.609
when we know that the guys of the Organization

11
00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.509
will be raiding this place.

12
00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:38.209
We're not just going to wait,

13
00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:39.409
we're pulling out.

14
00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.209
Pulling out?

15
00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:43.309
You mean we're leaving her behind and pulling out?

16
00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.709
No.

17
00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:46.309
We're pulling out the strings and waiting.

18
00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.409
Let's meet our enemy,

19
00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.909
the black wolves who've come

20
00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:55.709
to retrieve their straying colleague?

21
00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:57.409
We find out that agent Akai had in the past

22
00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.909
snuck into the Black Organization

23
00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.909
and became the boyfriend of Haibara's older sister, Akemi Miyano.

24
00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.609
Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job,

25
00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.609
will you go out with me as my real boyfriend?

26
00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.309
"Dai, if I get to quit the Organization after this job"

27
00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:24.009
"will you go out with me as my real boyfriend? Akemi"

28
00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.509
Hey.

29
00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.109
May I talk to you for a while?

30
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.209
If you're thinking of the strategy to counter-attack them,

31
00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.509
I'm still thinking about it.

32
00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.609
But, I was looking at you,

33
00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.209
and thought that maybe you're thinking exactly

34
00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.009
what I'm thinking.

35
00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.209
In the meantime,

36
00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.509
Eisuke Hondo who is searching for the whereabouts of his older sister,

37
00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.809
tracks down Rena Mizunashi's room.

38
00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.209
Hey, get up, Rena Mizunashi.

39
00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:06.609
If you don't wake up,

40
00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.809
I can't ask you how my older sister Hidemi is doing!

41
00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.009
Hey, get up! Please get up!

42
00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.409
You're going to be taken somewhere again, aren't you?

43
00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.809
Before that happens!

44
00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.009
Please open your eyes!

45
00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.509
Hey!

46
00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.709
I'm telling you, open your eyes!

47
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.809
No, Ei-chan.

48
00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.809
Oh, wait.

49
00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.609
Are you one of the agents that have been summoned here?

50
00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.309
Oh, yes.

51
00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:43.109
I'm Andre Camel.

52
00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.509
I just happened to get a call from my wife.

53
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.609
Then, please hang up quickly.

54
00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.009
We're having a strategy meeting.

55
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.009
Yes, just as planned.

56
00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.409
You never fail to surprise me, sonny.

57
00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:19.409
I'm glad you're on our side, Mr. Akai.

58
00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.309
Thank god we've got you too, sonny.

59
00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.609
And what now, Mr. Akai?

60
00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:41.909
You think...

61
00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.109
we should take on the risk?

62
00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.409
Are you willing to try it?

63
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:12.909
Sizzling hot suspense.

64
00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.509
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

65
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.509
Abnormal incidents occur everywhere.

66
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.509
Every incident leads to the hospital.

67
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.009
He sees through the one and only truth.

68
00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.709
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

69
00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:24.609
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

70
00:05:57.432 --> 00:06:03.132
"Red and Black Crash: Confusion"

71
00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:06.132
We got ready three stretchers for moving patients

72
00:06:06.132 --> 00:06:09.632
as well as three vehicles we could load the stretchers onto.

73
00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:10.632
If worse comes to worse,

74
00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:11.732
we were going to use these

75
00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:13.532
to confuse the guys of the Organization,

76
00:06:13.532 --> 00:06:15.232
while we attempt to take Rena Mizunashi

77
00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:17.432
out of this hospital and flee.

78
00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:21.832
It's a strategy that we would most like to avoid using though.

79
00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:23.332
Any questions?

80
00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:25.532
May I?

81
00:06:25.532 --> 00:06:27.132
And about communication methods,

82
00:06:27.132 --> 00:06:29.632
we can't use the cell phone or the wireless, is that right?

83
00:06:29.632 --> 00:06:32.232
No, this is a hospital,

84
00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:33.532
so please try to avoid using electronic devices,

85
00:06:33.532 --> 00:06:35.732
they may interfere with medical equipment.

86
00:06:35.732 --> 00:06:38.232
Cell phones are easy to tap, besides.

87
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:41.032
If anything comes up,

88
00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:42.532
notify the leader of your block verbally.

89
00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:44.032
Leaders, go outside to the parking lot

90
00:06:44.032 --> 00:06:46.232
and notify James who is waiting there,

91
00:06:46.232 --> 00:06:49.832
by wireless and get orders from him.

92
00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:53.532
Talk about tedious.

93
00:06:53.532 --> 00:06:56.632
Playing a telephone game like that,

94
00:06:56.632 --> 00:07:00.532
is like giving them a chance to get what they want.

95
00:07:00.532 --> 00:07:03.432
If all preparation for escape is ready,

96
00:07:03.432 --> 00:07:07.432
I think it would be way better to move her out now.

97
00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:11.132
No, that would be the last resort.

98
00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:14.932
It's too dangerous to make a move from our side

99
00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:17.232
when those guys still don't know where is Rena Mizunashi's room.

100
00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:19.632
The guys of the Organization are probably keeping their eyes wide open

101
00:07:19.632 --> 00:07:23.132
for cars that come out of the hospital.

102
00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:26.232
Judging from the fact that the car of the guy Kusuda

103
00:07:26.232 --> 00:07:29.332
secretly had a heat detecting thermography equipped to it,

104
00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:31.232
it's likely that they'll discover which is our car

105
00:07:31.232 --> 00:07:33.732
from the number of people in the car,

106
00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:36.732
thus making the FBI targets for their snipers.

107
00:07:36.732 --> 00:07:42.332
Then, we'd have to flee through the shower of their bullets.

108
00:07:42.332 --> 00:07:44.232
But, I wonder about not being able to make contact

109
00:07:44.232 --> 00:07:46.332
during an emergency.

110
00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.832
Of course in such case,

111
00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:51.132
call me directly on the wireless.

112
00:07:51.132 --> 00:07:52.932
I'll leave it to your discretion.

113
00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:54.032
Yes, sir...

114
00:07:54.032 --> 00:07:57.532
Well, I don't think they'll make a grand entrance,

115
00:07:57.532 --> 00:08:00.132
arming themselves with guns and machine guns,

116
00:08:00.132 --> 00:08:02.932
because they don't want the world to know that they exist.

117
00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:04.532
Right, I agree.

118
00:08:07.332 --> 00:08:09.132
They approach like a shadow

119
00:08:09.132 --> 00:08:11.932
and vanish like a fog.

120
00:08:11.932 --> 00:08:15.632
That's how they usually do their job.

121
00:08:15.632 --> 00:08:16.832
Hey...

122
00:08:16.832 --> 00:08:18.432
where were you?

123
00:08:18.432 --> 00:08:20.232
The strategy meeting is over.

124
00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:21.532
No problem.

125
00:08:21.532 --> 00:08:23.932
With the three stretchers

126
00:08:23.932 --> 00:08:26.932
and the three vans that are parked at the parking lot,

127
00:08:26.932 --> 00:08:29.732
I already know the strategy.

128
00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:31.932
I wouldn't call it a great strategy,

129
00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:33.532
but I knew it was coming.

130
00:08:33.532 --> 00:08:35.732
Right, sonny?

131
00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:37.032
Yep!

132
00:08:38.932 --> 00:08:42.532
What... what's with you two?

133
00:08:42.532 --> 00:08:44.932
Besides, Conan...

134
00:08:44.932 --> 00:08:47.632
isn't it time you head on home?

135
00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:49.032
I'll be just fine.

136
00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:52.032
I told everybody that I'll be sleeping over at Doc's tonight.

137
00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:54.332
And I also took a cat nap.

138
00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:55.732
Really...

139
00:08:55.732 --> 00:08:57.332
Okay then.

140
00:08:57.332 --> 00:08:59.832
I'll go stand in position for now.

141
00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:04.532
But, please let me know

142
00:09:04.532 --> 00:09:05.832
if you plan to split from here.

143
00:09:07.632 --> 00:09:11.532
I'm pretty confident about my driving technique.

144
00:09:11.532 --> 00:09:13.832
Hey, Shu.

145
00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:16.132
Doesn't that guy look familiar?

146
00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:17.432
Huh?

147
00:09:17.432 --> 00:09:18.932
He's among the additional agents

148
00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:20.732
that were dispatched.

149
00:09:20.732 --> 00:09:22.332
Well...

150
00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:24.532
I'm not sure of the faces of people on our side.

151
00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:29.632
I never forget the faces of my enemies though.

152
00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:33.032
I guess it's only natural that he looks familiar.

153
00:09:33.032 --> 00:09:35.632
After all he's an FBI agent just like us.

154
00:09:35.632 --> 00:09:36.932
Yes.

155
00:09:36.932 --> 00:09:38.832
But, when I look at him,

156
00:09:38.832 --> 00:09:41.432
it makes me feel uneasy.

157
00:09:49.932 --> 00:09:52.232
Hey... are you okay?

158
00:09:52.232 --> 00:09:54.432
Yeah.

159
00:09:54.432 --> 00:09:56.332
I see that you haven't been sleeping much.

160
00:09:56.332 --> 00:09:58.232
You've got black circles around your eyes.

161
00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.232
No, he always had them.

162
00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.332
Well, I'll go get a breath of fresh air

163
00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:04.132
while I patrol the area.

164
00:10:04.132 --> 00:10:05.332
Yeah.

165
00:10:07.532 --> 00:10:10.632
Maybe Shu is getting too personally involved in this

166
00:10:10.632 --> 00:10:12.632
because of his girlfriend who was killed.

167
00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:14.532
No, in his case,

168
00:10:14.532 --> 00:10:17.132
the more involved he is the better.

169
00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:18.732
Akai who had been in that Organization before

170
00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:22.232
and is aware of their way of doing things,

171
00:10:22.232 --> 00:10:24.232
is an arch enemy

172
00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:26.732
that they had tried to get rid of time and again.

173
00:10:26.732 --> 00:10:31.232
For we, the FBI, he's an absolute ace is the hole.

174
00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:36.032
"Family Restaurant Haido"

175
00:10:44.732 --> 00:10:45.832
Sir?

176
00:10:47.732 --> 00:10:48.932
Has something happened?

177
00:10:48.932 --> 00:10:51.632
My stomach suddenly...

178
00:10:53.332 --> 00:10:56.632
I'm sorry, same here...

179
00:10:56.632 --> 00:10:58.332
The Tohto Kanjo outward track train

180
00:10:58.332 --> 00:11:00.132
will be arriving at platform number four.

181
00:11:00.132 --> 00:11:03.132
Please stand behind the white line to prevent accidents.

182
00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:07.032
My throat...

183
00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:09.532
-My eyes... -Don't you smell something strange?

184
00:11:09.532 --> 00:11:11.432
Station master, please call an ambulance!

185
00:11:11.432 --> 00:11:12.432
Okay!

186
00:11:12.432 --> 00:11:15.532
"Yoko Okino starring in Kiss Note"

187
00:11:15.532 --> 00:11:17.932
I've got to get that notebook back as soon as possible

188
00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:20.732
or else everybody's heart will be broken.

189
00:11:20.732 --> 00:11:22.432
A fire has broken out.

190
00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:24.232
Please obey instructions from the person in charge.

191
00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:25.532
-No joke... -Give me a break?

192
00:11:35.332 --> 00:11:37.332
Fire!

193
00:11:37.332 --> 00:11:39.832
Huh? Mr. James Black?

194
00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:42.632
There's no such patient by the name here.

195
00:11:42.632 --> 00:11:44.232
No, I heard that he's not a patient here,

196
00:11:44.232 --> 00:11:46.632
but a helper accompanying a patient...

197
00:11:46.632 --> 00:11:49.032
I know him.

198
00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:52.032
Oh, yes! Here's a delivery for him!

199
00:11:52.032 --> 00:11:54.532
Who is it from? And what is it?

200
00:11:54.532 --> 00:11:56.132
That...

201
00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:58.632
The sender is...

202
00:11:58.632 --> 00:12:01.132
It's from a Mr. Rikumichi Kusuda.

203
00:12:03.732 --> 00:12:06.232
Rikumichi Kususda?

204
00:12:06.232 --> 00:12:08.732
Yes, it's from a Mr. Kusuda,

205
00:12:08.732 --> 00:12:11.332
and this is the delivery.

206
00:12:11.332 --> 00:12:14.932
Flower?

207
00:12:14.932 --> 00:12:16.432
A Columbine.

208
00:12:16.432 --> 00:12:19.932
It's called Odamaki in Japanese.

209
00:12:19.932 --> 00:12:22.132
The Organization sent this to me?

210
00:12:22.132 --> 00:12:24.832
Yes. They used the name of one of their members

211
00:12:24.832 --> 00:12:28.232
who committed suicide last night as the sender,

212
00:12:28.232 --> 00:12:29.632
so there's no doubt about it.

213
00:12:29.632 --> 00:12:31.832
Our agents are disguised as security officers

214
00:12:31.832 --> 00:12:34.532
and checking the bags of everyone entering the hospital,

215
00:12:34.532 --> 00:12:37.132
we even checked delivery packages.

216
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.932
Why would they send me a flower like this?

217
00:12:39.932 --> 00:12:42.632
This Columbine is the state flower of Colorado.

218
00:12:42.632 --> 00:12:44.932
It means getting hold of something for sure.

219
00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.132
In the language of flowers that what it means.

220
00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:50.732
It has another meaning which is determined to win too.

221
00:12:50.732 --> 00:12:53.432
Declaration of war.

222
00:12:53.432 --> 00:12:54.932
Right?

223
00:12:54.932 --> 00:12:57.232
Yeah, I guess so.

224
00:12:58.732 --> 00:13:00.032
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

225
00:13:00.032 --> 00:13:01.332
We're at the hospital now!

226
00:13:04.232 --> 00:13:07.132
I wonder if they're victims of the fire that we just saw a while ago.

227
00:13:07.132 --> 00:13:10.732
This is Maiya calling from the front entrance!

228
00:13:10.732 --> 00:13:12.832
James Black here! Is something wrong?

229
00:13:12.832 --> 00:13:17.632
So many ill patients and others are flooding the hospital!

230
00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:19.332
I can't check them all!

231
00:13:21.632 --> 00:13:23.032
What?

232
00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:45.085
According to the wounded,

233
00:13:45.085 --> 00:13:46.785
it seems that three different incidents

234
00:13:46.785 --> 00:13:48.785
occurred in this vicinity at almost the same time.

235
00:13:48.785 --> 00:13:50.685
Three incidents happened simultaneously?

236
00:13:50.685 --> 00:13:52.985
Yes, group food poisoning,

237
00:13:52.985 --> 00:13:55.485
bad odor chaos, and a break out of fire!

238
00:13:55.485 --> 00:13:57.085
The Organization's done it?

239
00:13:57.085 --> 00:13:59.085
The bad odor chaos and fire

240
00:13:59.085 --> 00:14:01.185
can deliberately be caused at the same time,

241
00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:02.885
but the incubation period for food poisoning

242
00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:04.285
differs from person to person.

243
00:14:04.285 --> 00:14:06.985
They probably used some kind of poisoning

244
00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:08.885
that would result in a similar symptom.

245
00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:10.585
Just like the other two cases,

246
00:14:10.585 --> 00:14:13.485
their purpose is to come up with a lot of victims

247
00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:14.885
without having to kill any of them,

248
00:14:14.885 --> 00:14:17.285
but have them crowding over to this hospital.

249
00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:20.885
Moreover, after excluding those with surface injuries

250
00:14:20.885 --> 00:14:23.285
such as burns or cuts,

251
00:14:23.285 --> 00:14:26.585
it's still difficult to determine

252
00:14:26.585 --> 00:14:29.585
who is faking pain in their stomach, throat and eyes.

253
00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:33.185
In other words, it's easy to make a large number of their members

254
00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:36.985
sneak into the hospital.

255
00:14:36.985 --> 00:14:38.985
Their purpose is to find

256
00:14:38.985 --> 00:14:41.785
which room Rena Mizunashi is in.

257
00:14:41.785 --> 00:14:45.985
If they use sheer force of numbers to look around for her,

258
00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:47.385
they'll probably do it in no time at all.

259
00:14:47.385 --> 00:14:49.385
No.

260
00:14:49.385 --> 00:14:50.685
Not possible.

261
00:14:50.685 --> 00:14:54.185
-Huh? -If they send in that many members

262
00:14:54.185 --> 00:14:56.685
and start suspicious movement like that,

263
00:14:56.685 --> 00:14:59.385
the number of members who would get caught

264
00:14:59.385 --> 00:15:02.185
by the FBI may skyrocket.

265
00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:05.085
They're not people who would risk doing something like that.

266
00:15:05.085 --> 00:15:06.685
Then, what's all this racket for?

267
00:15:06.685 --> 00:15:10.685
Yeah, they're probably after something else.

268
00:15:22.785 --> 00:15:25.085
Hey, did you hear something just then?

269
00:15:26.285 --> 00:15:27.285
That planter.

270
00:15:27.285 --> 00:15:28.885
Huh...

271
00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:30.685
Besides, the sound seems to be...

272
00:15:30.685 --> 00:15:32.985
getting louder and louder.

273
00:15:32.985 --> 00:15:36.785
Now that he mentioned it, very true.

274
00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:39.085
Put in on the floor slowly and pull away from it.

275
00:16:17.185 --> 00:16:18.885
Bomb?

276
00:16:18.885 --> 00:16:21.185
Didn't you check inside the planter?

277
00:16:21.185 --> 00:16:22.685
I... I'm sorry.

278
00:16:22.685 --> 00:16:25.585
I was distracted by the flower. Besides...

279
00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:27.785
Setting a bomb to this planter

280
00:16:27.785 --> 00:16:31.485
would only succeed in killing a few agents.

281
00:16:31.485 --> 00:16:33.985
If the Japanese police come here because of a bomb explodes,

282
00:16:33.985 --> 00:16:36.985
searching for Rena Mizunashi would be difficult.

283
00:16:36.985 --> 00:16:39.785
They could gain nothing from it.

284
00:16:39.785 --> 00:16:41.085
That's what you thought, right?

285
00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:42.085
Yes.

286
00:16:42.085 --> 00:16:45.785
At any rate, we've got to do something about that bomb.

287
00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:47.585
It looks to be full of traps

288
00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:50.085
and it may take some time disassembling it.

289
00:16:50.085 --> 00:16:51.785
So, I think it would be safer to take it to a place

290
00:16:51.785 --> 00:16:54.685
where there're no people and dispose of it.

291
00:16:54.685 --> 00:16:57.585
If this time is correct,

292
00:16:57.585 --> 00:17:01.685
there is 31 minutes and 14 seconds to go.

293
00:17:01.685 --> 00:17:04.185
Okay, Akai, we're counting on you.

294
00:17:04.185 --> 00:17:07.385
-Okay. -No, you stay here, Shu.

295
00:17:07.385 --> 00:17:08.685
I'll go.

296
00:17:08.685 --> 00:17:11.885
There's a trash dump seven kilometers from here,

297
00:17:11.885 --> 00:17:12.885
so I'll drive over there.

298
00:17:12.885 --> 00:17:16.085
Use my car, then.

299
00:17:17.085 --> 00:17:21.285
I wonder if you can get there in time?

300
00:17:21.285 --> 00:17:23.685
Because three incidents happened at once,

301
00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:26.185
all the major roads are jammed.

302
00:17:26.185 --> 00:17:28.685
Getting there in 30 minutes isn't going to be easy.

303
00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:30.685
Well, if you were to take a navigator

304
00:17:30.685 --> 00:17:32.985
who knows the roads in this vicinity,

305
00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:35.085
it would be a different story, though.

306
00:17:35.085 --> 00:17:36.185
Hey you!

307
00:17:36.185 --> 00:17:38.485
What do you think you're doing leaving your post?

308
00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:40.485
I heard about the terrible traffic jam

309
00:17:40.485 --> 00:17:42.385
from the people who came to this hospital,

310
00:17:42.385 --> 00:17:44.285
so I came to report it to you.

311
00:17:44.285 --> 00:17:46.785
I happen to be posted close by,

312
00:17:46.785 --> 00:17:49.985
so I thought it was faster to directly report it myself.

313
00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:52.085
We have no time to waste talking!

314
00:17:52.085 --> 00:17:53.985
You two both go and take care of the bomb!

315
00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:56.185
Roger...

316
00:17:56.185 --> 00:17:57.685
Something bothers me.

317
00:17:57.685 --> 00:18:00.185
Huh? You mean Camel?

318
00:18:00.185 --> 00:18:03.385
It's true he doesn't have the most amiable looks.

319
00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:05.985
No, I mean the bomb.

320
00:18:05.985 --> 00:18:08.585
It was set deliberately, so that the time indicator would show,

321
00:18:08.585 --> 00:18:10.885
and moreover rigged so that it would gradually get louder.

322
00:18:10.885 --> 00:18:13.985
It's as if they wanted us to find the bomb.

323
00:18:13.985 --> 00:18:18.285
Also, isn't it strange that they gave us more than 30 minutes?

324
00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.685
It's as if they set the time ahead,

325
00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:26.085
so that the FBI agents would take the bomb elsewhere to explode.

326
00:18:26.085 --> 00:18:28.685
Then, what the heck is that bomb for?

327
00:18:28.685 --> 00:18:31.285
I wonder what they're after?

328
00:18:40.685 --> 00:18:43.085
Hey! Are you really sure

329
00:18:43.085 --> 00:18:45.285
that this is the short cut to the trash dump?

330
00:18:45.285 --> 00:18:47.185
How strange.

331
00:18:47.185 --> 00:18:50.685
This was completely empty two years ago.

332
00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:52.485
Two years ago?

333
00:18:52.485 --> 00:18:54.585
By the way, is there a clock

334
00:18:54.585 --> 00:18:56.985
or something in the trunk behind?

335
00:18:56.985 --> 00:18:59.585
The noisy ticking has been bugging me for some time now.

336
00:18:59.585 --> 00:19:01.185
What? Oh God!

337
00:19:01.185 --> 00:19:02.785
Why didn't you hurry up and say so?

338
00:19:07.385 --> 00:19:10.985
Hey! There's no clock in here!

339
00:19:10.985 --> 00:19:13.885
Hey! Did you really hear something like that?

340
00:19:14.885 --> 00:19:17.085
-He's gone? -You'd better hurry inside

341
00:19:17.085 --> 00:19:18.285
or I'm going to leave you behind.

342
00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:25.185
Why are you sitting in the driver's seat?

343
00:19:25.185 --> 00:19:28.585
It's too much trouble trying to verbally explain the back roads.

344
00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.185
And I've got better driving skills.

345
00:19:31.185 --> 00:19:35.185
Besides, we don't seem to have much time left either.

346
00:19:35.185 --> 00:19:38.685
So, you lied to me about the clock in the trunk?

347
00:19:38.685 --> 00:19:40.985
Yes, circumstances may justify a lie.

348
00:19:42.585 --> 00:19:44.785
Hey... just what do you think you're doing?

349
00:19:44.785 --> 00:19:46.185
Hang on tight!

350
00:19:46.185 --> 00:19:47.185
Hey?

351
00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:49.985
Hey...

352
00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:06.185
Hey! The trash dump is in the direction opposite from here!

353
00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:07.285
I've given up going there

354
00:20:07.285 --> 00:20:08.285
because there's no time left.

355
00:20:08.285 --> 00:20:09.485
Huh?

356
00:20:09.485 --> 00:20:12.385
All we need is an unoccupied place, right?

357
00:20:19.685 --> 00:20:21.385
Quick, will you examine her?

358
00:20:21.385 --> 00:20:23.285
You idiot! We were here first!

359
00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:25.785
There are a lot of deliverymen around.

360
00:20:25.785 --> 00:20:27.885
Yeah, there sure are a lot of them.

361
00:20:27.885 --> 00:20:29.485
What shall I do...

362
00:20:31.185 --> 00:20:32.685
Sorry.

363
00:20:32.685 --> 00:20:34.785
Excuse me.

364
00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:38.685
Kusuda...

365
00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:40.885
Rikumichi Kusuda.

366
00:20:43.385 --> 00:20:46.385
Jodie, is everything okay on your side?

367
00:20:46.385 --> 00:20:48.185
It's about time the bomb explodes.

368
00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:49.985
Well...

369
00:20:49.985 --> 00:20:52.585
Agent Camel forced me off the wheels and he's driving now...

370
00:20:58.485 --> 00:21:00.485
What're you doing by opening the roof?

371
00:21:00.485 --> 00:21:02.185
-The wheels... -What?

372
00:21:02.185 --> 00:21:04.085
Steer please!

373
00:21:04.085 --> 00:21:06.185
What?

374
00:21:06.185 --> 00:21:07.185
Hey!

375
00:21:19.885 --> 00:21:21.885
What was that sound just now?

376
00:21:21.885 --> 00:21:23.885
Jodie?

377
00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:26.685
Yes, sir. The bomb was gotten rid of just now.

378
00:21:27.685 --> 00:21:29.285
Good work, Jodie.

379
00:21:29.285 --> 00:21:30.685
Oh, no.

380
00:21:30.685 --> 00:21:32.885
Agent Camel is the one who should be given credit for it.

381
00:21:32.885 --> 00:21:34.885
I hate to think what would have happened

382
00:21:34.885 --> 00:21:36.085
without his driving technique.

383
00:21:37.685 --> 00:21:39.985
By the way, how are things over there?

384
00:21:39.985 --> 00:21:44.485
Akai and Conan found a clue

385
00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:45.585
as to what the Organization is up to doing.

386
00:21:46.885 --> 00:21:48.285
Yes?

387
00:21:48.285 --> 00:21:50.585
Excuse me, I'm a security officer.

388
00:21:50.585 --> 00:21:53.785
I'm sure the nurse brought you a delivery just now.

389
00:21:53.785 --> 00:21:55.885
Oh, yes, this is it.

390
00:21:55.885 --> 00:21:57.985
Isn't it from a person named Kusuda?

391
00:21:57.985 --> 00:22:02.385
Yes, but I don't know anyone by that name.

392
00:22:02.385 --> 00:22:03.885
Excuse me.

393
00:22:12.285 --> 00:22:14.285
It's a bomb after all.

394
00:22:14.285 --> 00:22:16.285
What is that?

395
00:22:16.285 --> 00:22:18.885
It's a wiretap.

396
00:22:18.885 --> 00:22:23.685
A new type of fraud is widespread nowadays using this device.

397
00:22:23.685 --> 00:22:25.385
A Bomb?

398
00:22:25.385 --> 00:22:27.285
The contents of the get well gift

399
00:22:27.285 --> 00:22:28.685
was a bomb after all?

400
00:22:28.685 --> 00:22:29.785
Yes.

401
00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:31.285
This plastic bomb alone

402
00:22:31.285 --> 00:22:35.085
is only capable of blowing up one room.

403
00:22:35.085 --> 00:22:37.885
But if several of these go off together...

404
00:22:39.485 --> 00:22:42.985
This hospital will unmistakably collapse.

405
00:24:12.185 --> 00:24:13.885
"Next Episode" -There is only four hours to go

406
00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:18.685
before the bombs that are delivered to the hospital explode.

407
00:24:18.685 --> 00:24:22.785
While the FBI agents go all out retrieving the bombs,

408
00:24:22.785 --> 00:24:25.085
the image of Rena Mizunashi returning to work on TV

409
00:24:25.085 --> 00:24:27.085
is suddenly aired!

410
00:24:27.085 --> 00:24:29.385
Realizing what they were after,

411
00:24:29.385 --> 00:24:33.385
I worked on a strategy to outdo their trap but...

412
00:24:35.285 --> 00:24:37.985
Next on Detective Conan,

413
00:24:37.985 --> 00:24:42.285
"Black and Red Crash: Camouflage"

414
00:24:57.985 --> 00:24:59.785
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:59.785 --> 00:25:02.485
Driving Technique.

416
00:25:02.485 --> 00:25:03.785
March 3rd is Ear Day.

417
00:25:03.785 --> 00:25:05.785
-It's Girl's Day. -Goldfish Day.

418
00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:07.185
Oh, really?
