"Saturday, December 5th.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,520
Today Conan-kun caught a jewel thief.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,710
When I asked him how he did it, he said
it was thanks to my illustrated diary.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,700
But I don't remember figuring anything out.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,320
I wonder why he said that."

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,930
Find the question that solves the mystery!

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,260
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,510
Hints from Ayumi's illustrated
diary save the day!

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,380
Catch that jewel thief!

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,050
Always determining the one truth

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,710
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,190
his name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:44,088
Is something wrong?

21
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:47,518
Is it your illustrated diary?

22
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:50,208
Yeah.

23
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,228
I'm never sure what to write each day.

24
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:55,028
What do you guys do?

25
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:59,158
Just write about whatever
you want to eat that day.

26
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,948
Like grilled eel in a bowl, or grilled
eel in a box, or quartered grilled eel.

27
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:04,708
That can't be right.

28
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:08,568
When I can't decide, I go for a walk.

29
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:11,498
Don't you end up writing
the same thing every day?

30
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:13,088
I suppose.

31
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:13,308
Today I went for a walk
I suppose.

32
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:14,588
As long as I can write something.
Today I went for a walk

33
00:03:15,168 --> 00:03:16,468
Seriously?

34
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,418
What about you, Ai-chan?

35
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,808
It's easy.

36
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:23,978
A quick search online yields plenty of
ideas, like the weather or whatever else.

37
00:03:24,498 --> 00:03:28,268
You simply have to choose whatever
you like from among the options.

38
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,768
That doesn't sound right either.

39
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:34,278
Aw, jeez. What should I do?

40
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,178
Carefully observe all kinds of things,

41
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:40,778
and you'll discover the truth.

42
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:41,358
Huh?

43
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:47,048
You should observe your
surroundings in your own way.

44
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:50,588
I'm sure you'll find
something to write about.

45
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:55,468
Got it. Thanks, Conan-kun.

46
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,068
Hey.

47
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:00,848
There's a bunch of people over there.

48
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:01,848
Huh?

49
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:04,348
What are they doing?

50
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:13,858
What does Kaneko-san plan to do
by stocking something this nice?

51
00:04:13,858 --> 00:04:17,008
He said he hoped it would
revitalize the town.

52
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,358
What if someone steals it?

53
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:20,908
I'm not certain, but it's probably insured.

00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:23,488

I'm not certain, but it's probably insured.

00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:26,498

Then it'd be no skin off Kaneko-san's
nose if it were stolen.

59
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:31,668
Then it'd be no skin off Kaneko-san's
nose if it were stolen.

60
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:36,008
I don't know about that.

61
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:41,218
But I wonder how much that
watch would sell for.

62
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:47,588
Even if you sold it so it couldn't be
traced, it'd probably go for at least 70 million.

63
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:49,298
70 million?

64
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:50,228
No way.

65
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,728
I heard you can get several times the market
price if you sell it to a collector.

66
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,738
If I got that much money,
I'd take my family to Hawaii.

67
00:04:58,988 --> 00:04:59,418
So this is what drew the small crowd.

68
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,058
Speaking of which, did you win that trip
to Hawaii you mentioned the other day?

70
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:03,278
It's a big watch.

I don't know yet.
It's a big watch.

73
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:05,908
It's so shiny.
I don't know yet.

I hope you win.

I'd like to win a trip to Hawaii.

77
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:10,748
I wonder how many eel bowls this is worth.
I'd like to win a trip to Hawaii.

78
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:14,228
Come on, kids.

79
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,798
Isn't it almost time for school? Get moving.

80
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:19,468
Okay.

81
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,008
According to Conan-kun,

82
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:29,778
the jewel thief was trying to steal the
big shiny watch from Jewelry Kaneko.

83
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:36,268
Blue Diamond Limited Tourbillon Cage No. 3.

84
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:43,618
Made by renowned watchmaker Soumillon,
there's only five of them in the world.

85
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,908
No wonder the grocer was so excited.

86
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:54,388
It's quite the luxury watch
for a small town jeweler.

87
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:57,918
Enough to create a commotion
among ordinary people.

88
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:02,608
I hope it doesn't become the target
of any ill-intentioned people.

89
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,218
Did you beat that game?

90
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:12,588
Yeah, I did.

91
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:13,438
Huh?

92
00:06:13,438 --> 00:06:14,788
It's Detective Takagi.

93
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:15,938
Hey, you're right.

94
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:19,278
Make sure you lock your doors.

95
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,188
Will do.

96
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:21,438
Detective Takagi.

97
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:24,738
Conan-kun, you kids.

98
00:06:24,898 --> 00:06:27,448
What are you doing here?

99
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:30,368
Is it about the luxury watch
at the store next door?

100
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:33,618
Not exactly.

101
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:35,498
Then what it is?

102
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:41,378
There have been a lot of
burglaries in this area lately.

103
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:45,458
I'm handing out these fliers
to alert the locals.

104
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,998
Rash of Burglaries!!
Please be careful!

105
00:06:47,998 --> 00:06:50,558
Anyway, that's why we're
handing out these fliers.

109

Thank you, I appreciate it.

110
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:02,438
Hey, Mister. We heard the watch in
your store window is really expensive.

111
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,738
Would you like to take a look?

112
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:05,948
Can we?

113
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:10,728
Yeah. After all, you seem to be
friends with this police officer.

114
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:23,258
Soumillon's masterpiece from
the height of his career.

115
00:07:23,538 --> 00:07:28,518
Blue Diamond Limited Tourbillon Cage No. 3.

116
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:30,848
Well? Beautiful, isn't it?

117
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,518
Wow!

118
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,978
It looks different up close.

119
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:36,848
It's so sparkly.

120
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:41,228
Kaneko-san, how's your security?

121
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,238
Don't worry.

122
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,988
My security is absolutely secure.

123
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:50,238
I have security cameras covering
every inch of the store.

124
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:54,248
The footage is stored on the cloud,

125
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:57,798
so you don't need to worry
about intruders erasing it.

126
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:03,248
Outside of business hours,
I keep the sturdy shutters closed.

127
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:06,868
I also have infrared and
pressure sensors installed.

128
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:12,278
The store window where the watch is
displayed is made of tempered glass,

129
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:16,118
and a code is required to open this door.

130
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:23,868
All of these systems are
monitored by computer.

131
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:28,778
If anything happens, the security
company will come running.

132
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:36,728
I see. With security this tight, it's not
possible for your average burglar to break in.

133
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:37,658
Indeed.

134
00:08:37,988 --> 00:08:40,978
But nothing's for certain.

135
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,168
Please be careful.

136
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,538
Understood.

137
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:47,358
Excuse me.

138
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:49,428
Now then.

139
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:50,568
Hey, kids—

140
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:51,738
Detective Takagi.

141
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:54,998
Don't you think that watch is at risk?

142
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:00,018
But security is tight,

143
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:04,818
and it's hard to imagine jewelry theft
going well in this day and age.

144
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:09,038
Hey, kids.

145
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:13,768
If you're not busy, could you
help me hand out these fliers?

146
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,688
Bye!

147
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:18,328
Hey, w-wait!

148
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:23,078
Nothing of note happened for
several days after that.

149
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:25,198
But one day...

150
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:29,668
Cafe
Haronbo

151
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:32,188
Hup.

152
00:09:34,438 --> 00:09:36,058
Good morning, kids.

153
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,558
Good morning!

154
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,828
Don't take any detours.
Head straight to school.

155
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:43,468
Okay!

156
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:55,388
What's that sound?

157
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,558
Maybe it's construction work.

158
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:06,928
Looks like they're renovating.

159
00:10:06,928 --> 00:10:07,458
Yeah.

160
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,968
I don't see anything suspicious.

161
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:13,188
Suspicious? Like what?

162
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:18,508
Like pretending to do construction work
so they can rob the jewelry store?

163
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:21,068
What? Is that true, Conan-kun?

164
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:23,588
I don't know that yet.

165
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,538
Let's check it out for ourselves.

166
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:27,938
Conan-kun?

167
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,438
Excuse me.

168
00:10:33,528 --> 00:10:35,328
What is it, kids?

169
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,318
As you can see, I'm renovating my store.

170
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:45,668
The president of the engineering
firm over there is named Kumazawa.

171
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:50,908
We've known each other since middle school,
so he's given me a special discount.

172
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:53,858
Um, is it possible that...

173
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:55,338
That you're pretending to renovate your store

174
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:58,308
so you can steal the watch
from the jeweler next door?

175
00:10:58,308 --> 00:10:58,628
What?

176
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,068
Don't be rude, you two.

177
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:04,558
Marvelous.

178
00:11:05,188 --> 00:11:10,058
If I punched a hole in that wall
and stole some jewels, I'd be rich.

179
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:13,178
Then I could open a store overseas.

180
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:14,568
What a masterpiece.

181
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:20,288
Maybe I'll become a professional thief.

182
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:25,178
I'm joking.

183
00:11:25,838 --> 00:11:29,838
I may not look like it, but the
only thing I can do is make coffee.

184
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:32,628
I'm too clumsy to be a thief.

185
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,718
Who are they?

186
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:39,718
They're Kumazawa's sons.

187
00:11:40,178 --> 00:11:42,718
I've known them since they were in diapers.

188
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,688
You suspect them, too?

189
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,528
Well, uh...

190
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,058
Hello.

191
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,778
Cheetah Transport here.

192
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,938
Hello again.

193
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:56,008
Could you sign or stamp here, please?

194
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:56,988
Sure thing.

195
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:58,228
Café Haronbo

196
00:11:58,228 --> 00:11:59,948
Thanks for the food.

198
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,608

199
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:04,028
Okay.

201
00:12:06,648 --> 00:12:09,748
Well? You heard what he said.

202
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:12,138
He's a little suspicious.

203
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:14,758
He didn't seem like a bad person.

204
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,978
The juice was good.

205
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:24,128
It's certainly risky to rob
the jewelry store next door.

206
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,418
But he made jokes about it earlier.

207
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:30,018
I'm not sure what he actually thinks.

208
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,768
What's got you kids down?

209
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:35,378
Ma'am.

210
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:36,738
Here.

211
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:39,568
Oranges?

212
00:12:39,748 --> 00:12:41,098
On the house.

213
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:43,828
Have some oranges and cheer up.

214
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,358
Head home once you finish those.

215
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:48,578
Okay.

216
00:12:49,148 --> 00:12:51,998
Welcome, ma'am. What can I get you?

217
00:12:57,138 --> 00:12:57,468
Then nothing in particular
happened for several days.

But while Conan-kun thought hard about it,

223
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:09,118
the culprit's plans were steadily advancing.

225
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:18,638
Does this mean there wasn't anyone

226
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:20,828
who thought about stealing that watch?

227
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:22,078
Maybe.

228
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:23,208
You think so?

229
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:27,408
I think the owner of the café is suspicious.

230
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,168
I think the contractors are suspicious.

231
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:35,088
What if it's actually the
lady from the produce store?

232
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:40,088
You should also consider the possibility
that the jeweler might pretend to rob himself.

233
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:44,088
He might do it for the insurance money.

234
00:13:44,378 --> 00:13:48,348
You're right, Haibara-san.
It's certainly possible.

235
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:53,848
Let's all keep an eye out
so there is no burglary.

236
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:55,988
Yeah!

237
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:06,508
With no crime, there wasn't
anything Conan-kun could do,

238
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:11,458
but several days later,
that fateful day would come.

239
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,785
Conan-kun.

240
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:41,695
Ayumi-chan.

241
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,105
Conan-kun, read this.

242
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,305
Your illustrated diary?

243
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:58,755
Thanks, Conan-kun.

244
00:14:58,755 --> 00:14:59,295
Huh?

245
00:14:59,605 --> 00:15:04,575
Thanks to you, I think I got better
at keeping an illustrated diary.

246
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,675
Because of me?

247
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:09,685
Did you forget what you told me?

248
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:15,505
Carefully observe all kinds of things,
and you'll discover the truth.

249
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:16,295
Huh?

250
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:22,055
You should observe your
surroundings in your own way.

251
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:25,755
I'm sure you'll find
something to write about.

252
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:28,125
Is that right?

253
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,375
Yeah.

254
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:36,285
Since then, like you said, I've been
carefully observing my surroundings every day.

255
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:41,755
When I started writing exactly what
I saw and felt, I got better at it.

I think it's Ogino.

00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:06,705
All right.

There's still a lot I need
to confirm, though.

Hold it right there.

281
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:18,745
You nearly pulled it off. Too bad.

282
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:23,595
You can't escape.

283
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:25,465

00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:34,285
You heard an expensive luxury watch
was on display at Jewelry Kaneko.

While waiting to see what would happen,

287
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:41,095
you heard Café Haronbo was renovating
its store and came up with your plan.

288
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:43,875
Isn't that right,

00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:13,425
no matter how much noise you
made, no one would suspect you.

304
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,365
Then you just needed the produce
store workers to go away.

305
00:19:19,495 --> 00:19:25,125
You probably learned the grocer loves
prize contests from that conversation

306
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:30,905
and invited her and her family to Hawaii
by lying and telling her she'd won a prize.

307
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:37,495
Even if you sold it so it couldn't be
traced, it'd probably go for at least 70 million.

308
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:39,295
70 million?

309
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:40,175
No way.

310
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:43,545
I heard you can get several times the market
price if you sell it to a collector.

311
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:48,925
If I got that much money, I'd
take my family to Hawaii.

312
00:19:49,395 --> 00:19:53,745
Speaking of which, did you win that trip
to Hawaii you mentioned the other day?

313
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:55,925
I don't know yet.

314
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:58,935
I hope you win.

315
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:01,425
I'd like to win a trip to Hawaii.

316
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:04,235
H-How do you know that?

317
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:05,775
What's wrong with you?

318
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:08,775
You mean you didn't see that note she posted?

319
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:09,695
What?

320
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,195
It says the shop is temporary closed
because they're on a family trip.

321
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:16,495

00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:26,705
That must've been a lot of work.

324
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:32,885
You've been digging for five days since
they went on their trip, haven't you?

325
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:33,465
Damn it!

326
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:35,215
