1
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.266
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.066
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.466
A novelist's life is sought after by a character

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.866
that appears in her novel!

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.666
Is this fiction or non-fiction?

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.166
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.766
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.666
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:58.901
"Pro Soccer"

10
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:09.201
They're calling.

11
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:10.401
Pops?

12
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:13.501
Excuse me...

13
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.101
Inspector!

14
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:19.401
I have a feeling it's time to make an appearance!

15
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:20.401
Here goes!

16
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:21.601
Hey!

17
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:23.701
-Pops! -Inspector!

18
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:29.701
You must really have a lot of time on your hands.

19
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:33.501
No, this brat tells me in tears to go help

20
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.701
with the invitation so.

21
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:41.401
Inspector, what kind of case is this?

22
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.601
Homicide.

23
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:47.101
The victim is the person who lives in this unit.

24
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:50.301
Ms. Murako Saikawa, age 65.

25
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:51.701
She's living alone.

26
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:55.301
She looks to be a novelist.

27
00:02:55.301 --> 00:02:57.201
Do you know her, Mouri?

28
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.801
Murako Saikawa...

29
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.801
Come to think of it, there was a novelist by the name some time ago.

30
00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:10.401
Murako Saikawa...

31
00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.401
"The Village of Orochi"

32
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.101
Was a once famous mystery writer.

33
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.701
She died instantly after being struck

34
00:03:16.701 --> 00:03:18.801
in the back of the head with a bronze figurine.

35
00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:19.901
From the looks of the corpse,

36
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.501
she was probably killed last night between 7 pm to 9 pm.

37
00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:26.201
As to the estimated time of death,

38
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:29.701
I'm sure we'll be able to find out more in detail after the autopsy.

39
00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:33.101
Who would want to kill that famed mystery writer?

40
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.201
And for what reason?

41
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:41.301
"My Favorite Mystery"

42
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:42.801
Inspector.

43
00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:44.501
They are the two people who first found the body.

44
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.401
"Shunichi Tono (26)" -I'm Tono. I'm editor from Meikyu Publishing

45
00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:49.601
and was in charge of Ms. Saikawa.

46
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:52.301
And he is the manager of the apartment.

47
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:53.901
"Keizo Murata (55)" -I'm Murata.

48
00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:57.001
Please explain how things were when you first found the body once again.

49
00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:00.101
When I came to make arrangements here yesterday,

50
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.401
she asked me to bring her some documents today.

51
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:06.101
But despite pushing the doorbell many times there was no answer.

52
00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:09.601
So I sensed that something was not right.

53
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:11.101
So I went to call the apartment manager,

54
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.001
had him open the door and entered the room.

55
00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:15.201
Ms. Saikawa?

56
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:18.801
We saw Ms. Saikawa lying over there...

57
00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:20.801
I see.

58
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.801
Mr. Tono, were you at Ms. Saikawa's yesterday too?

59
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:26.201
Yes, I was.

60
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.601
From sundown to around 8 pm.

61
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.301
The murder was committed between 7 pm to 9 pm.

62
00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:35.501
You've got great intuition?

63
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:37.901
I mean, you felt that something was not right,

64
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.801
only because after pushing the doorbell, nobody answered, right?

65
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:41.801
That's true.

66
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:44.401
Most people normally wouldn't think that way right off the bat.

67
00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:46.801
Oh, well...

68
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.401
That's because several days ago,

69
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:50.601
Ms. Saikawa received this.

70
00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:52.301
A postcard?

71
00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:57.301
"Dear Ms. Murako Saikawa,"

72
00:04:57.301 --> 00:05:02.101
"I'm thinking of adding your life to my collection next."

73
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.101
"I will go to visit you in the near future to take your life."

74
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:07.501
A murder warning?

75
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:09.701
The sender is...

76
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:12.801
Taniyoshi Ohebi?

77
00:05:12.801 --> 00:05:14.701
It's read, Ryo Orochiya.

78
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:16.301
Ryo Orochiya?

79
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:17.301
It can't be!

80
00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:21.101
"Ryo Orochiya" -Who is this Orochiya person?

81
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.401
He is a genius killer

82
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:26.001
that appears in one of Ms. Saikawa's main novels.

83
00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:29.201
He's somebody who appears in her novel?

84
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:32.101
The novelist was killed by a character that appears in her novel?

85
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:34.301
No darn way!

86
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:36.101
Oh, I guess not.

87
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:39.001
But, that's what actually happened.

88
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:41.001
It's a cheap trick that the killer is using.

89
00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:43.401
To complicate investigations!

90
00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:45.601
To complicate investigations?

91
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.701
I wonder if anyone would do something like this just for that purpose.

92
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:50.901
Mr. Murata, if you have a vacant room,

93
00:05:50.901 --> 00:05:53.201
could you lend it to us?

94
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.401
I would like to use the room as a stronghold for investigation.

95
00:05:55.401 --> 00:05:57.301
Oh, yes.

96
00:05:57.301 --> 00:06:00.101
-Chiba. -Yes, sir.

97
00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:05.301
Mr. Tono, I think you're probably the last person who met the victim.

98
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:07.801
Could you spare us a little more of your time?

99
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.201
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.301
Inspector.

101
00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:13.701
Yeah.

102
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:16.701
You said that the door was locked, didn't you?

103
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:19.701
I guess the killer locked the door when escaping last night.

104
00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:23.901
In order to delay discovery of the body.

105
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:31.701
But, it seems that at this apartment the residents are given two keys.

106
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.801
And both of Ms. Saikawa's keys were found in the room.

107
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:38.001
The killer used a spare key?

108
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.101
Yes.

109
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:42.901
And if someone did use a spare key, the number of people

110
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.201
who can do so is limited.

111
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:46.901
For example, the editor in charge

112
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:48.601
who used to come make arrangements with her.

113
00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:51.201
He could make one, if he waited for the chance to do so.

114
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:54.101
The manager also has a key.

115
00:06:57.801 --> 00:06:59.601
Megure here.

116
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:01.701
Okay...

117
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.901
Got it.

118
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:04.001
Anything?

119
00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:06.101
It's from Mr. Kawanaka who's going around the neighborhood

120
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.001
asking question looking for a lead.

121
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:10.301
He says that somebody heard the victim and the manager

122
00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:12.901
having a heated argument several days ago.

123
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:17.301
It seems that the suspects have been narrowed down already.

124
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:21.001
Mr. Tono was here at the time the murder was committed.

125
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:23.601
Mr. Murata seems to have a motive to commit the murder.

126
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:27.801
And the two men could get spare keys of the room if they wanted to.

127
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:31.201
And if either of the two is the killer.

128
00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:33.101
It may not be a coincidence that the first to ones

129
00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:35.401
to discover the body were the two.

130
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.201
In order to get rid of the evidence they left behind the day before,

131
00:07:40.201 --> 00:07:43.501
they snuck in here pretending to be the first to discover the body?

132
00:07:43.501 --> 00:07:45.501
It's very probable.

133
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:55.001
What?

134
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:57.201
It's just a slice of fresh marinated ginger slices.

135
00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:00.701
Ms. Saikawa hated fresh marinated ginger slices.

136
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:04.401
She used to say she didn't like the sweet sour taste of it.

137
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.401
That's why I think that after having sushi delivered here last night,

138
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.801
she disposed of the ginger slices without eating them.

139
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.901
Ms. Saikawa ordered delivery sushi last night?

140
00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:17.201
Yes. I ordered it because Ms. Saikawa asked me to.

141
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:19.801
Inspector, the room is ready.

142
00:08:19.801 --> 00:08:22.401
Oh, I see. Good work!

143
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.901
Then, Mr. Tono,

144
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.901
will you tell us in detail what happened last night?

145
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:27.901
Yes, sir.

146
00:08:29.901 --> 00:08:31.701
If it was thrown away last night,

147
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:35.001
it would've been left there for half a day.

148
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:37.201
If so, then most naturally...

149
00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:43.401
Ms. Saikawa was killed last night between 7 pm to 9 pm.

150
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:48.701
I came here last night around 6:30 pm.

151
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:52.501
Although she has stopped writing now,

152
00:08:52.501 --> 00:08:56.301
Ms. Saikawa has written many masterpieces so far.

153
00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:59.501
We talked things over for about an hour

154
00:08:59.501 --> 00:09:01.401
on making a compilation of her masterpieces.

155
00:09:01.401 --> 00:09:02.901
This is the Saikawa residence.

156
00:09:02.901 --> 00:09:04.801
Yes, of Pearl Mansion.

157
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:08.001
One serving of the usual prime sushi plate.

158
00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:11.201
The sushi came at about 8 pm.

159
00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:13.301
But I had another place to stop by

160
00:09:13.301 --> 00:09:15.001
so I left soon afterwards.

161
00:09:16.301 --> 00:09:19.001
I'll bring the documents you wanted tomorrow morning.

162
00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:20.201
Thank you.

163
00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:22.001
Well, then. Excuse me.

164
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:27.801
At around 8:15 pm,

165
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:30.901
I joined my friends at a pub in front of the station.

166
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:33.401
And stayed there all the way through till midnight.

167
00:09:33.401 --> 00:09:35.901
"6:30: Business meeting with Mr. Tono" -All through till midnight...

168
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:37.101
"7:30: Ordered sushi, 8.00: Sushi delivered"

169
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:38.501
"8:15: Mr. Tono left, meeting up with friends"

170
00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:41.801
I will have to confirm what you said with your friends too.

171
00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:44.801
I know that you suspect me.

172
00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:48.801
But how could I do something like that

173
00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:51.101
to Japan's jewel of mystery?

174
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.801
I didn't have any brawl with Ms. Saikawa!

175
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:57.701
Somebody saw wrong!

176
00:09:57.701 --> 00:09:59.801
It could be.

177
00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:01.901
Then, what about last night?

178
00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.101
I was in the manager's room right through.

179
00:10:04.101 --> 00:10:08.301
I was alone, so there's no one to prove it, though.

180
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:11.301
That manager's hiding something.

181
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:13.401
8 pm is the point of focus.

182
00:10:13.401 --> 00:10:15.301
If between 7 pm and 8 pm,

183
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:17.701
Mr. Tono could've committed the crime.

184
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.901
If after 8 pm, Mr. Murata could've committed the crime too.

185
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:23.001
Well, split up and find back ups for everyone's testimony!

186
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:24.001
-Yes sir! -Yes sir!

187
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:25.401
"Treasure sushi, Not yet open for business." -What?

188
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:27.101
Ms. Saikawa was?

189
00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:30.101
I hear that you delivered a take-out meal to her last night.

190
00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:34.501
How stupid of me!

191
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:36.101
Excuse me?

192
00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:39.301
It's the mistake of a life time!

193
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:42.101
Why don't you spit it all out?

194
00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:45.001
-The squid and octopus... -What?

195
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:47.601
Squid and octopus?

196
00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:49.701
We don't usually put squid and octopus

197
00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:52.301
in our prime sushi plate.

198
00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:57.601
But we used to specially put them in Ms. Saikawa's order only.

199
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:00.801
Because she used to like them both.

200
00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:04.701
But I carelessly forgot to put them on her plate last night!

201
00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:07.101
I mean, no big deal...

202
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:08.901
What do you mean it's no big deal?

203
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:11.201
I goofed on the last order, you know!

204
00:11:11.201 --> 00:11:14.001
I can't face up to Ms. Saikawa.

205
00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:17.701
I would like to ask you about the time you delivered the order to her.

206
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:18.701
Yes?

207
00:11:20.201 --> 00:11:21.501
He didn't see her?

208
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:26.101
Yeah, he definitely delivered the sushi to her at 8 pm,

209
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:29.001
but he says he didn't see Ms. Saikawa

210
00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:31.601
or hear her voice at all.

211
00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:35.701
At that time, she was no longer in the world.

212
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:38.801
That's a possibility.

213
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:41.401
Excuse me.

214
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:45.401
Who are you?

215
00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:47.301
No, chief editor, please don't!

216
00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:48.401
Let me go!

217
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:56.501
"Yasunobu Shimasaki (50)" -I'm Shimasaki, Head of Meikyu Publishing.

218
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:59.401
I hear that you are considering Mr. Tono a suspect?

219
00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:00.801
Oh, no...

220
00:12:00.801 --> 00:12:04.201
He's a guy that came to work for our company

221
00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:07.701
that specializes in mysteries because he adored Ms. Saikawa, you know?

222
00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:12.001
He even planned the compilation of Ms. Saikawa's stories this time too.

223
00:12:12.001 --> 00:12:14.001
Yeah...

224
00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:17.601
So, he was a fervent fan of Murako Saikawa?

225
00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:21.101
Did you know the novelist called Murako Saikawa?

226
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:23.001
Not until this incident...

227
00:12:23.001 --> 00:12:26.701
Because she's a forgotten novelist, that's why.

228
00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:27.901
But he's the one who insisted,

229
00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:31.201
if so the more the reason to publish her stories.

230
00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:35.301
The public know much too little of how great Ms. Saikawa is.

231
00:12:35.301 --> 00:12:38.201
Creative and unique tricks and a perfect composition.

232
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:40.301
-I have my mind set on letting entire Japan -To be honest with you,

233
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.001
-become aware of her jewel-like sparkle! -I don't think it'll sell much.

234
00:12:43.001 --> 00:12:45.601
Our management is always in dire straits.

235
00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:48.301
If we publish a compilation that is unlikely to sell,

236
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:50.101
it'll only make things worse.

237
00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:53.001
But, I agreed.

238
00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:55.601
I was moved by his wanting to make her happy

239
00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:58.901
for the very last time with his heart and soul.

240
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:00.101
For the very last time?

241
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:04.001
The doctor had told her that.

242
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:07.501
She only had only six more months to live.

243
00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:12.501
The one who would be most vexed by Ms. Saikawa's death is Tono!

244
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:14.901
Excuse me.

245
00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:17.901
Megure here.

246
00:13:17.901 --> 00:13:20.201
Oh, from Beika Medical University Hospital.

247
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:22.501
Yes...

248
00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:25.101
Okay, thank you very much.

249
00:13:27.001 --> 00:13:29.301
We've got the result of the autopsy.

250
00:13:29.301 --> 00:13:31.901
There seems to have been a little rice grain

251
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:34.201
and raw seafood left in the stomach of the body.

252
00:13:34.201 --> 00:13:36.001
Sushi, I guess?

253
00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:41.201
Yeah. She seems to have been killed an hour after eating.

254
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:44.301
Since the food was delivered at 8 pm.

255
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:51.301
She was killed around 9 pm.

256
00:13:51.301 --> 00:13:53.601
So, as for Mr. Tono.

257
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:56.501
Since he was with his friends right through after 8:15 pm,

258
00:13:56.501 --> 00:14:00.101
his alibi has already been established.

259
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:02.301
Alibi established?

260
00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:04.601
We're sorry to have suspected you.

261
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:06.401
You may leave.

262
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:08.301
-I'm happy for you, Tono. -Thank you.

263
00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:10.901
Goodbye then.

264
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:13.901
Then, who's the killer?

265
00:14:13.901 --> 00:14:16.501
What? You saw him last night?

266
00:14:16.501 --> 00:14:17.901
Is it true?

267
00:14:17.901 --> 00:14:19.001
Yes.

268
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:21.501
I had a package I had to deliver at a designated time.

269
00:14:21.501 --> 00:14:23.901
So it was when I came to deliver it.

270
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:29.601
I'm sure it was just around 9 pm.

271
00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:31.001
9 pm?

272
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:33.601
I really love this.

273
00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:39.101
But that old lady found me sipping this since afternoon.

274
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:41.401
And she said she would report it to the maintenance company.

275
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:45.201
No way, if she does, I'll be fired!

276
00:14:45.201 --> 00:14:46.701
That's why last night,

277
00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:50.201
I went to see her to ask her not to report me.

278
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:51.701
But!

279
00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:53.301
No matter how many times I rang the doorbell,

280
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:54.801
that old lady wouldn't answer.

281
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:56.301
If you insist on suspecting me,

282
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.301
show me proof, won't you?

283
00:14:58.301 --> 00:14:59.901
Show me proof!

284
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:01.601
Mr. Murata!

285
00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:03.301
You smell of liquor.

286
00:15:03.301 --> 00:15:05.601
Let me go and air the room out a bit?

287
00:15:13.001 --> 00:15:14.001
"The autopsy report"

288
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:15.201
"Stomach residue: Rice grain, tuna, octopus, squid, egg..."

289
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:17.601
I get it! There was one more...

290
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:19.401
And that marinated ginger slices.

291
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:21.901
I need proof...

292
00:15:29.801 --> 00:15:31.201
I got it.

293
00:15:31.201 --> 00:15:33.601
I've figured out the trick the killer used.

294
00:15:42.652 --> 00:15:44.752
I've figured out the trick.

295
00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:47.252
But why would he kill her?

296
00:15:48.652 --> 00:15:49.852
Inspector.

297
00:15:51.452 --> 00:15:54.652
From among the things that the forensic officers gathered,

298
00:15:54.652 --> 00:15:57.652
nothing points to Mr. Murata as having committed the crime.

299
00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:00.052
Nothing, huh?

300
00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:02.852
Yes... There it is, clearly and bold letters.

301
00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:05.852
"Mystery-novel authoress murdered!" -It's an attention catching headline,

302
00:16:05.852 --> 00:16:07.652
"Murako Saikawa's own character sent a murder notice!" -isn't it?

303
00:16:09.152 --> 00:16:13.552
Murder warning sent from a character in her novel?

304
00:16:13.552 --> 00:16:18.152
Mr. Tono, told the press about the postcard too, didn't he?

305
00:16:18.152 --> 00:16:19.252
It's supposed to be kept a secret

306
00:16:19.252 --> 00:16:21.152
while investigation is underway and yet...

307
00:16:22.852 --> 00:16:24.852
I see. So this is why.

308
00:16:33.752 --> 00:16:34.952
Mouri?

309
00:16:38.152 --> 00:16:39.552
Is it the usual?

310
00:16:39.552 --> 00:16:41.152
Mouri!

311
00:16:41.152 --> 00:16:43.152
Inspector Megure.

312
00:16:43.152 --> 00:16:47.052
Please tell Mr. Tono and Mr. Murata to come back here again.

313
00:16:47.052 --> 00:16:49.952
I've figured out the entire mystery!

314
00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:51.052
Takagi! Chiba!

315
00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:52.452
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

316
00:16:53.952 --> 00:16:58.052
Inspector, the killer used an alibi trick.

317
00:16:58.052 --> 00:16:59.952
An alibi trick?

318
00:17:02.052 --> 00:17:04.952
Let me organize this case.

319
00:17:04.952 --> 00:17:09.852
Ms. Saikawa was killed between 7 pm and 9 pm last night.

320
00:17:09.852 --> 00:17:14.952
And we also know that it was an hour after she had eaten the sushi.

321
00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:17.052
In other words, she was killed around 9 pm.

322
00:17:17.052 --> 00:17:18.952
That's the point.

323
00:17:18.952 --> 00:17:21.752
How can you be so sure?

324
00:17:21.752 --> 00:17:24.252
Because the sushi was delivered to her place at 8 pm.

325
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:27.552
But, that doesn't mean that the sushi

326
00:17:27.552 --> 00:17:29.652
that was found in Ms. Saikawa's stomach was the sushi that was delivered?

327
00:17:29.652 --> 00:17:30.752
Just what do you mean?

328
00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:32.952
There was another sushi package.

329
00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:34.452
Another package?

330
00:17:34.452 --> 00:17:37.352
Other than the sushi that was delivered here at 8 pm,

331
00:17:37.352 --> 00:17:38.852
there was another package

332
00:17:38.852 --> 00:17:41.152
that Mr. Tono had brought along with him as a present.

333
00:17:42.252 --> 00:17:44.452
The sushi that Ms. Saikawa had eaten

334
00:17:44.452 --> 00:17:48.452
was in fact the gift sushi that Mr. Tono had brought along.

335
00:17:48.452 --> 00:17:52.452
She ate the sushi, not after 8 pm but at 6:30 pm.

336
00:17:52.452 --> 00:17:57.252
And an hour later, Ms. Saikawa was killed by Mr. Tono.

337
00:17:57.252 --> 00:18:01.852
This is when Ms. Saikawa's digestive system stopped functioning.

338
00:18:01.852 --> 00:18:05.352
It stopped at an hour after she had eaten the sushi.

339
00:18:05.352 --> 00:18:08.352
After this, Mr. Tono ordered sushi delivery.

340
00:18:08.352 --> 00:18:11.652
Yes, please deliver one order of the usual prime sushi plate.

341
00:18:11.652 --> 00:18:13.552
Thank you for your patronage!

342
00:18:13.552 --> 00:18:16.052
You probably put the sushi that arrived at 8 pm

343
00:18:16.052 --> 00:18:18.452
into a plastic bag or something.

344
00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:21.652
And locked the door using a spare key that you prepared before hand,

345
00:18:21.652 --> 00:18:23.952
to delay discovery of the body.

346
00:18:23.952 --> 00:18:27.052
You got rid of the sushi and spare key on the way.

347
00:18:27.052 --> 00:18:30.352
And went on to establish your alibi from after 8:15 pm.

348
00:18:30.352 --> 00:18:33.752
But, we finally got word after the autopsy that she was killed

349
00:18:33.752 --> 00:18:36.652
after she had eaten the sushi.

350
00:18:36.652 --> 00:18:39.552
Since the sushi was delivered at 8 pm, so...

351
00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:40.952
This most naturally lead us to think

352
00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:43.552
that the time the murder was committed was 9 pm.

353
00:18:43.552 --> 00:18:46.152
As a result, Mr. Tono who had an alibi during that time

354
00:18:46.152 --> 00:18:48.552
was cleared from the list of suspects.

355
00:18:48.552 --> 00:18:50.952
I had things figured out till that point.

356
00:18:52.352 --> 00:18:55.252
In other words, he used the result of the autopsy

357
00:18:55.252 --> 00:18:57.652
that is used to help solve cases

358
00:18:57.652 --> 00:19:00.552
to his advantage for his alibi trick.

359
00:19:00.552 --> 00:19:01.552
So, you!

360
00:19:01.552 --> 00:19:03.652
Wait a second, Mr. Mouri!

361
00:19:03.652 --> 00:19:05.852
However, you made one mistake!

362
00:19:05.852 --> 00:19:07.452
The slices of ginger.

363
00:19:09.552 --> 00:19:11.352
If the slices were ones that came along with the sushi

364
00:19:11.352 --> 00:19:13.352
that was delivered last night,

365
00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:15.552
they would've been dried out long out.

366
00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:16.752
But, the slices of ginger that were found in the disposal

367
00:19:16.752 --> 00:19:19.052
were still soft. Why?

368
00:19:19.052 --> 00:19:21.952
Because when you got rid of the sushi that was delivered last night,

369
00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:24.652
you carelessly also threw away the slices of ginger.

370
00:19:24.652 --> 00:19:27.852
You realized what you did this morning,

371
00:19:27.852 --> 00:19:30.052
so you made Mr. Murata open the room

372
00:19:30.052 --> 00:19:32.152
and when he wasn't watching, you went to the kitchen

373
00:19:32.152 --> 00:19:34.952
and threw the slices of ginger you had on you

374
00:19:34.952 --> 00:19:36.452
into the triangular disposal basket.

375
00:19:36.452 --> 00:19:38.252
That's enough!

376
00:19:38.252 --> 00:19:40.752
What gift sushi are you talking about?

377
00:19:40.752 --> 00:19:42.252
Of course, Ms. Saikawa ate the sushi

378
00:19:42.252 --> 00:19:45.952
that was delivered at 8 pm!

379
00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:47.252
Inspector.

380
00:19:47.252 --> 00:19:52.552
What was left in Ms. Saikawa's stomach after the autopsy?

381
00:19:52.552 --> 00:19:54.652
Like I said, sushi.

382
00:19:54.652 --> 00:19:57.552
We got more detailed information, didn't we?

383
00:19:57.552 --> 00:20:00.252
What? Oh, let see...

384
00:20:00.252 --> 00:20:05.852
Rice, tuna, sea urchin, flatfish, squid and octopus.

385
00:20:05.852 --> 00:20:07.552
Squid and octopus?

386
00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:09.652
Yeah, no mistake about it.

387
00:20:09.652 --> 00:20:12.352
Isn't it strange, Officer Takagi?

388
00:20:12.352 --> 00:20:13.352
Strange?

389
00:20:13.352 --> 00:20:14.952
Yes! It's strange!

390
00:20:16.052 --> 00:20:18.552
How stupid of me!

391
00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:20.852
The squid and octopus...

392
00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:23.652
He forgot to put in on the plate?

393
00:20:23.652 --> 00:20:28.752
You probably made sure that the squid and octopus

394
00:20:28.752 --> 00:20:32.552
that Ms. Saikawa liked was in the sushi gift that you brought for her.

395
00:20:32.552 --> 00:20:36.852
You assumed the sushi's fillings, didn't you?

396
00:20:36.852 --> 00:20:39.252
You were proven guilty by the autopsy that you schemed

397
00:20:39.252 --> 00:20:41.652
to use to your advantage.

398
00:20:41.652 --> 00:20:42.852
Tono, you...

399
00:20:42.852 --> 00:20:45.352
Admit your crime, Mr. Tono.

400
00:20:45.352 --> 00:20:47.452
The criminals that Ms. Murako Saikawa writes

401
00:20:47.452 --> 00:20:50.452
in her books including Ryo Orochiya

402
00:20:50.452 --> 00:20:52.252
all admit their crimes in good grace,

403
00:20:52.252 --> 00:20:54.452
when they are cornered, don't they?

404
00:20:54.452 --> 00:20:56.652
Why, Tono?

405
00:20:58.752 --> 00:21:02.752
Ms. Saikawa had only a few months to live because of her illness.

406
00:21:02.752 --> 00:21:05.652
But, if she dies of an illness,

407
00:21:05.652 --> 00:21:09.952
nobody would make anything of a writer who is long forgotten.

408
00:21:09.952 --> 00:21:12.852
However, if she were killed

409
00:21:12.852 --> 00:21:17.052
and more so by one of the characters who appeared in her books.

410
00:21:17.052 --> 00:21:20.352
The media would make a big thing of it.

411
00:21:20.352 --> 00:21:23.852
It would make Ms. Saikawa's name known to the public.

412
00:21:23.852 --> 00:21:27.152
Therefore, you wrote that strange postcard warning of the murder

413
00:21:27.152 --> 00:21:29.152
and carried it out.

414
00:21:29.152 --> 00:21:30.652
No matter what the motive,

415
00:21:30.652 --> 00:21:34.152
taking another person's life is totally unforgivable!

416
00:21:34.152 --> 00:21:36.352
But, in Ms. Saikawa's case,

417
00:21:36.352 --> 00:21:37.452
-there wouldn't have been a better way... -Tono!

418
00:21:37.452 --> 00:21:41.052
Did you really do it only for Ms. Saikawa's sake?

419
00:21:41.052 --> 00:21:43.852
If people are attracted, the compilation of her work will sell

420
00:21:43.852 --> 00:21:45.352
and the company you work for will benefit.

421
00:21:45.352 --> 00:21:47.852
Didn't you also have that in mind?

422
00:21:49.252 --> 00:21:51.252
I wanted to protect Meikyu Publishing,

423
00:21:51.252 --> 00:21:54.552
the fortress of mystery.

424
00:21:54.552 --> 00:21:56.152
Tono...

425
00:21:56.152 --> 00:21:57.552
You idiot!

426
00:21:58.652 --> 00:22:00.152
Mr. Shimasaki!

427
00:22:02.652 --> 00:22:06.052
Those who really love mysteries

428
00:22:06.052 --> 00:22:09.852
never take the life of others.

429
00:23:44.452 --> 00:23:47.752
What? The manager of this apartment changed.

430
00:23:47.752 --> 00:23:49.852
I'm not surprised.

431
00:23:49.852 --> 00:23:52.252
If the manager was drinking from daytime,

432
00:23:52.252 --> 00:23:54.852
he wouldn't be able to fulfill his duties.

433
00:23:56.052 --> 00:23:57.452
Don't want to waste a drop!

434
00:23:59.652 --> 00:24:02.652
A detective can fulfill his duties despite drinking though?

435
00:24:03.452 --> 00:24:07.252
"Next Episode"

436
00:24:07.252 --> 00:24:09.352
If there are really red handkerchiefs everywhere,

437
00:24:09.352 --> 00:24:10.452
even if you tie yours on,

438
00:24:10.452 --> 00:24:13.552
nobody will know which is yours.

439
00:24:14.652 --> 00:24:17.252
"Hozumi" -Pocket diary? Isn't this...

440
00:24:18.352 --> 00:24:20.352
There's blood on the calendar.

441
00:24:27.952 --> 00:24:33.552
Next Conan, "Sonoko's Red Handkerchief (Part 1)"

442
00:24:49.152 --> 00:24:51.652
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:51.652 --> 00:24:53.452
"Name in katakana character"

444
00:24:53.452 --> 00:24:55.152
How do you write your name in kanji, Conan?

445
00:24:55.152 --> 00:24:56.452
"Co" the kanji meaning moth orchid

446
00:24:56.452 --> 00:24:58.252
-and "nan" the kanji meaning difficult... -What?
