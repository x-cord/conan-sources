1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.540
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.440
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.140
Today's episode is the first in a series of mind boggling mysteries.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.840
We'll start with the adventures of these guys.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.199
Not once, but twice.

9
00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:58.399
Who are you, brave sir who has rescued me?

10
00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.199
Valiant nameless knight dressed in black.

11
00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:06.099
If you wish to grant me my wish,

12
00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.199
please remove that jet black mask

13
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.899
and show yourself to me.

14
00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.399
If that is what the princess wishes,

15
00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.599
I will reveal my ugly scarred-face to you

16
00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.399
beneath the light of this moon!

17
00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.799
Good grief! Dad, be serious!

18
00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.499
There's not too much time left before my school play!

19
00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:28.899
Give me a break!

20
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.899
Nobody can say these lines

21
00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.899
with a straight face, it's so unnatural.

22
00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.199
Who in the blazes

23
00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.099
wrote this syrupy script reading the script anyway?

24
00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.999
It was Sonoko!

25
00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:38.999
She said she wrote the part for the black knight

26
00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.799
with Shinichi in mind.

27
00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:42.899
That Sonoko...

28
00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.599
Hey, wait a minute!

29
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.099
It says right here that the knight and princess kiss passionately!

30
00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.499
What?

31
00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.799
Oh, come on. It's just pretend, don't worry about it!

32
00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.299
Hey, Ran.

33
00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.499
Who's going to do it? You know, that knight's part.

34
00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.899
Why, are you that curious?

35
00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:02.199
Well, just a little...

36
00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.999
I'll bet you got some goofy kid to do the part.

37
00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.199
Actually, it's somebody you both know very well.

38
00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:10.399
Remember, you met him during one of your cases.

39
00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:11.999
It's our school doctor, Dr. Araide.

40
00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.099
All the boys in our school were too embarrassed to do it.

41
00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.999
So, we asked Dr. Araide when he came by to give us our physical exams.

42
00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.299
-Huh? -Huh?

43
00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.599
It seems he played a lot of leads in school plays in his days,

44
00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.899
that's why he's so good at it.

45
00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.699
He says the lines well and he knows how to handle women.

46
00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.699
Hey! I won't allow it!

47
00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.899
No, no! Don't do it, Ran

48
00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:31.299
Just kidding.

49
00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.499
He's just overlooking our rehearsals.

50
00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.799
Sonoko's going to dress like a man to play the part of the knight.

51
00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.599
Oh, I see.

52
00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.699
How stupid.

53
00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:43.999
Oh, no! Look at the time.

54
00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.399
I've got practice in the morning, so I've got to take a bath.

55
00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:48.299
The bath is not working.

56
00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.199
What? I wanted to take a bath, too

57
00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.899
Then, why don't you two go to the public bath?

58
00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:56.699
But I'm sure it's closed today.

59
00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.699
Why don't we go and ask Dr. Agasa to let us use his bath then?

60
00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.399
I was going there tonight anyway

61
00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:03.399
to talk about our camping trip this weekend.

62
00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:04.899
Really? Come on, let's go!

63
00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:06.499
I'll go get my change of clothes.

64
00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.299
Me, too.

65
00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:09.599
Good grief.

66
00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.999
You don't want to trouble the man too much,

67
00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.799
so take your baths together and come home right away, you hear?

68
00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.099
You...

69
00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.399
You've got to be kidding!

70
00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.199
Why do I have to take a bath with Conan?

71
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.699
I meant to say that it wouldn't be proper.

72
00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.599
Isn't that night, Conan?

73
00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.799
I guess...

74
00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.999
"Perilous Return: Detectives In The Cave"

75
00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.699
Something's strange.

76
00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.799
Lately, Ran has been...

77
00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:54.199
Huh? What are you talking about?

78
00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.099
Sometimes I can feel it

79
00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.999
Something Ran's eyes and the way she treats me,

80
00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:00.899
it isn't way a person treats a seven year old,

81
00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:02.299
it's like...

82
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.199
Come on now, Shinichi.

83
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.899
Well, it could just be my imagination I suppose.

84
00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:10.999
Maybe she knows?

85
00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:13.699
About who you really are.

86
00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.499
Ai...

87
00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:18.799
I have something to do in the basement, it'll take me until morning.

88
00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:20.399
So, don't disturb me.

89
00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:24.999
Hey, what if Ai is right...

90
00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:26.099
Impossible.

91
00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.899
If she was suspicious, why wouldn't she ask me about it?

92
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:30.599
That's the way Ran is.

93
00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:31.799
Huh?

94
00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.199
What about me?

95
00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.299
Well, no...

96
00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:36.899
By the way, where is Ai?

97
00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.099
Ai is in the basement.

98
00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.699
I think I'll go say hello.

99
00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.799
Hey, Ran.

100
00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.699
Wait.

101
00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:48.599
Hello!

102
00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.499
Ai...

103
00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.799
Hey, why don't you say hello?

104
00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:57.899
It's all right, Doctor. I shouldn't have bother her.

105
00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.699
Well, I'll see you later, Ai.

106
00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.299
Could it be...

107
00:06:06.299 --> 00:06:07.799
that I'm running away?

108
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.699
That's ridiculous.

109
00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:19.099
"It's the new century"

110
00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.799
Let's start again. One, two..

111
00:06:21.799 --> 00:06:23.199
Hey, Doc.

112
00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.199
About our conversation the other day regarding Ran...

113
00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.099
Can you make a handy robot just in case of an emergency?

114
00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.999
What kind did you have in mind?

115
00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:33.799
You know, something that moves and sounds

116
00:06:33.799 --> 00:06:35.899
exactly me like a robot.

117
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:37.399
If I could make something like that,

118
00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:40.099
I'd already be a millionaire.

119
00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.899
I guess you're right.

120
00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:55.899
There, the tent is up.

121
00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.599
We didn't forget the tent today.

122
00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:01.899
Ai and I will build stove,

123
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.899
so why don't you kids go get some wood for the fire?

124
00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:06.699
Okay!

125
00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.299
Tonight we're going to have barbeque, a barbeque.

126
00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:15.399
You guys! I think we've got enough, let's go back!

127
00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:16.399
-Okay! -Okay!

128
00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:18.799
Hey, guys! Come over here.

129
00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:21.599
I found something interesting.

130
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.399
It's just a limestone cave.

131
00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.599
The sign says "Do Not Enter-Danger".

132
00:07:25.599 --> 00:07:29.599
The words on this is what caught my attention.

133
00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:33.099
Follow the dragon's path

134
00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.299
and a glow of supreme bliss will shine on you.

135
00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:38.199
Glow of supreme bliss?

136
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.799
A glow that makes you very happy.

137
00:07:40.799 --> 00:07:42.199
Do you think it means...

138
00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.799
Treasure?

139
00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:46.299
Oh, here we go again.

140
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:50.599
The catch is this big "to" carved in the stone.

141
00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:52.499
To... tokujo Unaju.

142
00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:54.699
-Topaz. -Tonneru (tunnel).

143
00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.699
Tokugawa buried treasure.

144
00:07:57.699 --> 00:07:59.399
I was just kidding.

145
00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:04.499
Hey, come back here guys.

146
00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:07.899
Don't worry, we're just going to check it out!

147
00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:09.799
Oh, for goodness sakes.

148
00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:11.899
This sure is a huge cave.

149
00:08:11.899 --> 00:08:13.799
It's a limestone cave.

150
00:08:13.799 --> 00:08:16.699
I didn't think it'd be so big inside.

151
00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:19.999
Cigarettes?

152
00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:22.999
The filter is still damp.

153
00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.899
I wonder if someone besides us is in here?

154
00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:29.699
What's keeping them?

155
00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:32.099
Where did they went off to?

156
00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:34.899
They probably exploring the forest.

157
00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:38.199
After all, their leader's very curious detective.

158
00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:40.899
Anyway, never mind them. Give me a hand here.

159
00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:47.599
Look at that, it's a light.

160
00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:49.199
Somebody's over there.

161
00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:51.499
Could it be the person who was smoking?

162
00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:54.999
Maybe somebody's already found the treasure before us?

163
00:08:54.999 --> 00:08:57.399
-Seriously? -Genta!

164
00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:59.899
Darn it, we should've come in here earlier.

165
00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:02.799
Then, the treasure would've been ours.

166
00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:11.999
What's the matter, Genta?

167
00:09:11.999 --> 00:09:13.999
A... body.

168
00:09:13.999 --> 00:09:15.299
Huh?

169
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.899
-Why you... -A gun?

170
00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:21.099
Get down!

171
00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:24.399
Hey! What's going on?

172
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.299
Kids! Some kids saw us!

173
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:29.399
Good grief, you think their parents are with them?

174
00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.299
No, it was only the four kids.

175
00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:33.499
Darn it! What a run of bad luck.

176
00:09:33.499 --> 00:09:37.899
First, we robbed the bank, but one of us gets our face seen.

177
00:09:37.899 --> 00:09:39.699
So we had to kill him and we figured if we buried him in here,

178
00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:41.199
nobody would find out who we were.

179
00:09:41.199 --> 00:09:43.399
But now, those kids saw us.

180
00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.899
Never mind, we've got to get those kids!

181
00:09:45.899 --> 00:09:48.299
Darn it! Where did they go?

182
00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:52.099
Hey, what are we going to do when we find those kids?

183
00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:53.799
Isn't it obvious?

184
00:09:53.799 --> 00:09:58.299
We're going to put them to eternal sleep here in this dark tomb.

185
00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:01.399
We'll blow a hole through their little heads.

186
00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:04.899
You get to the entrance!

187
00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:08.099
Both of us will search around here a little longer.

188
00:10:12.499 --> 00:10:13.999
Hey, Haibara! Can you hear me?

189
00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:15.099
Haibara?

190
00:10:15.099 --> 00:10:17.099
Haibara! Answer me!

191
00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:18.099
Haibara!

192
00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:20.899
Answer me if you can hear me, Haibara!

193
00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:23.499
Haibara!

194
00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:25.899
Look at this, I don't believe you've been cooking your own meals.

195
00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:27.299
Don't tease me!

196
00:10:27.299 --> 00:10:28.899
I wonder what they're doing?

197
00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:31.299
Maybe the switch is off?

198
00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:35.299
I know! I'll go tell those guys that we didn't see anything.

199
00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:36.999
That won't help!

200
00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:40.699
Conan will think of a good idea...

201
00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:42.099
Isn't that right, Conan?

202
00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:47.499
-Conan? -Conan...

203
00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:02.188
Conan...

204
00:11:02.188 --> 00:11:03.788
What's the matter? Why are you bleeding?

205
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:07.288
Don't tell me that the bullet he shot hit you?

206
00:11:07.288 --> 00:11:09.388
Conan, we've got to get out of here right away

207
00:11:09.388 --> 00:11:12.188
before those bad men come back.

208
00:11:12.188 --> 00:11:15.088
Wait... Ai and Doctor are out there waiting for us.

209
00:11:15.088 --> 00:11:19.288
Sooner or later, they'll come in this cave to look for us.

210
00:11:19.288 --> 00:11:21.288
If they come in not knowing what's happening,

211
00:11:21.288 --> 00:11:25.088
those bad men will kill them.

212
00:11:25.088 --> 00:11:30.688
We've got to warn that this cave is dangerous.

213
00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:33.088
But how do we that?

214
00:11:33.088 --> 00:11:35.388
If we write a note and those bad guys find it,

215
00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:37.288
they'll just rip it up!

216
00:11:37.288 --> 00:11:39.488
I guess we'll just have to keep going deeper inside

217
00:11:39.488 --> 00:11:42.888
and keep trying to reach them ith the badge.

218
00:11:42.888 --> 00:11:43.988
Don't be stupid!

219
00:11:43.988 --> 00:11:45.388
If we go in any deeper,

220
00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:47.088
the radio waves won't reach that far.

221
00:11:47.088 --> 00:11:49.188
Then, what are we going to do?

222
00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:51.788
We're going to use these transmitters,

223
00:11:51.788 --> 00:11:54.188
the ones we use to track criminals.

224
00:11:54.188 --> 00:11:58.188
There's a seal on the back, we can peel back about 10...

225
00:11:58.188 --> 00:12:00.788
But what are we going to use them for?

226
00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:03.488
I don't have time to explain.

227
00:12:03.488 --> 00:12:05.188
Just do what I tell you.

228
00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:07.088
Now hurry, take this...

229
00:12:11.988 --> 00:12:15.888
Where did those kids go?

230
00:12:15.888 --> 00:12:17.388
Hey! Did you find them?

231
00:12:17.388 --> 00:12:19.288
No, it didn't look like they made it to the entrance

232
00:12:19.288 --> 00:12:21.088
or to the outside.

233
00:12:21.088 --> 00:12:22.088
That's strange.

234
00:12:22.088 --> 00:12:24.488
We already searched around here.

235
00:12:24.488 --> 00:12:25.888
The only place we haven't looked

236
00:12:25.888 --> 00:12:27.888
is the way that goes deeper in the cave.

237
00:12:27.888 --> 00:12:30.488
That saves us the trouble of going after them.

238
00:12:30.488 --> 00:12:32.188
Those kids are dead.

239
00:12:32.188 --> 00:12:33.588
I hear the inside of this cave is a giant maze,

240
00:12:33.588 --> 00:12:36.288
a lot of people have died without ever finding their way out.

241
00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.588
No, we're going to go after them!

242
00:12:38.588 --> 00:12:40.788
We've got take care of all loose ends.

243
00:12:40.788 --> 00:12:44.488
And it looks like those kids did head inside.

244
00:12:44.488 --> 00:12:46.688
-Glasses? -Those could be...

245
00:12:46.688 --> 00:12:50.088
from somebody else who got lost in here though.

246
00:12:51.988 --> 00:12:54.088
You fool! Look at this.

247
00:12:54.088 --> 00:12:56.488
Blood! It's blood!

248
00:12:56.488 --> 00:12:59.188
Yes, and it's still damp.

249
00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:00.388
I get it.

250
00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:03.588
That means we'll catch up to those kids in no time.

251
00:13:03.588 --> 00:13:05.588
Yes, that's right.

252
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:10.788
Hey.

253
00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:13.388
Don't you think they're too late?

254
00:13:13.388 --> 00:13:16.388
Huh? I guess so.

255
00:13:16.388 --> 00:13:19.188
I'm going to go look in the woods.

256
00:13:19.188 --> 00:13:21.188
Hey, wait!

257
00:13:21.188 --> 00:13:22.288
Ai!

258
00:13:26.788 --> 00:13:28.888
Are you all right, Conan?

259
00:13:28.888 --> 00:13:30.188
Yes, fine.

260
00:13:30.188 --> 00:13:33.488
Now that I put a huge bandage on it.

261
00:13:33.488 --> 00:13:37.088
By the way, Genta, can't you walk any faster?

262
00:13:37.088 --> 00:13:38.788
Those guys might going catch up to us.

263
00:13:38.788 --> 00:13:40.388
But...

264
00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:42.888
I thought it'd hurt if I rocked you too much.

265
00:13:45.788 --> 00:13:47.188
This is all my fault.

266
00:13:47.188 --> 00:13:48.988
If I hadn't come inside

267
00:13:48.988 --> 00:13:50.688
and said it wouldn't hurt to check it out,

268
00:13:50.688 --> 00:13:53.688
Conan wouldn't have got hurt.

269
00:13:53.688 --> 00:13:55.988
No, it's not your fault, Ayumi!

270
00:13:55.988 --> 00:13:59.188
I started it, I shouldn't found this cave in the first place.

271
00:13:59.188 --> 00:14:01.988
You dummy! You know it was my fault.

272
00:14:01.988 --> 00:14:05.988
I got carried away and happened to see those guys with the body.

273
00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:09.688
Idiot.

274
00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:12.788
If you hadn't come inside this cave,

275
00:14:12.788 --> 00:14:14.388
a murder would've gone unsolved.

276
00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:17.688
But thanks to you, we know who the killers are.

277
00:14:17.688 --> 00:14:20.588
Now, as soon as we get away from those guys,

278
00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:22.788
we've got a barbeque to cook!

279
00:14:22.788 --> 00:14:26.188
Let's be optimistic about this!

280
00:14:26.188 --> 00:14:27.388
Right...

281
00:14:31.588 --> 00:14:33.788
Everybody, come quick!

282
00:14:33.788 --> 00:14:35.588
It splits into two here.

283
00:14:35.588 --> 00:14:36.988
You're right.

284
00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:38.488
What should we do?

285
00:14:38.488 --> 00:14:41.388
Let's use rock-paper-scissors to decide.

286
00:14:41.388 --> 00:14:45.288
Genta, hand me the wristwatch light.

287
00:14:47.188 --> 00:14:49.188
Come on, hurry!

288
00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:51.188
Oh, sure!

289
00:14:51.188 --> 00:14:54.988
Hey, kids! Where are you!

290
00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:58.188
Hey, answer me!

291
00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:01.088
Look. It's wood for the fire.

292
00:15:01.088 --> 00:15:02.888
What?

293
00:15:02.888 --> 00:15:05.888
Four piles stacked neatly in front of the cave.

294
00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:09.588
That means those kids

295
00:15:09.588 --> 00:15:11.388
are inside this cave.

296
00:15:15.988 --> 00:15:18.488
What's this, the road splits?

297
00:15:18.488 --> 00:15:20.788
Darn it! Which way did they go?

298
00:15:20.788 --> 00:15:22.988
Hey! What's that?

299
00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.988
Something's shining.

300
00:15:26.788 --> 00:15:29.188
It's a wristwatch with a light.

301
00:15:29.188 --> 00:15:31.888
Those kids have fancy stuff.

302
00:15:31.888 --> 00:15:34.888
Then we're on the right track, those kids went this way...

303
00:15:34.888 --> 00:15:36.488
Wait.

304
00:15:36.488 --> 00:15:38.788
It's a trap.

305
00:15:38.788 --> 00:15:40.288
Think about it.

306
00:15:40.288 --> 00:15:41.488
They may be only kids

307
00:15:41.488 --> 00:15:42.788
but do you think they wouldn't notice

308
00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:45.188
if they dropped something with a light?

309
00:15:45.188 --> 00:15:49.288
And they were thoughtful enough to tuck the belt away.

310
00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:51.688
They made it look like they went this way,

311
00:15:51.688 --> 00:15:53.588
but actually, they went that way.

312
00:15:53.588 --> 00:15:54.988
Darn it!

313
00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:57.388
Those kids think they're so smart.

314
00:15:57.388 --> 00:15:58.788
I'm getting curious,

315
00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:03.588
I can't wait to see what those kids look like.

316
00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.788
Yes. Their faces full of fear,

317
00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:08.288
begging for their life!

318
00:16:13.088 --> 00:16:15.288
Are you sure it'll work?

319
00:16:15.288 --> 00:16:16.788
You know, deliberately leaving the watch

320
00:16:16.788 --> 00:16:19.688
showing them we came this way.

321
00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:25.288
Yes, I'm sure those guys are going the other way.

322
00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:27.688
Those men robbed a bank,

323
00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:30.688
I'm sure there's at least one smart guy among them.

324
00:16:30.688 --> 00:16:34.688
But what happens if they split in two groups

325
00:16:34.688 --> 00:16:37.188
and come this way, too?

326
00:16:37.188 --> 00:16:38.488
It won't happen.

327
00:16:38.488 --> 00:16:41.288
They can't even use a transmitter in this cave,

328
00:16:41.288 --> 00:16:46.088
they know it could cost them their life if they split up.

329
00:16:48.888 --> 00:16:50.288
Look, a fish!

330
00:16:50.288 --> 00:16:51.488
What?

331
00:16:51.488 --> 00:16:54.288
Hey, does that fish have eyes?

332
00:16:55.888 --> 00:16:57.288
Yes, it does.

333
00:16:57.288 --> 00:16:58.888
I think it's a sweetfish.

334
00:16:58.888 --> 00:16:59.988
What? What was that?

335
00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:01.188
Are we going to eat it?

336
00:17:01.188 --> 00:17:02.788
No, you silly!

337
00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:06.388
We're not running away without thinking up a plan.

338
00:17:06.388 --> 00:17:07.788
Huh?

339
00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:10.888
Fish that live in caves have no eyes,

340
00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:13.388
if this fish has eyes,

341
00:17:13.388 --> 00:17:16.888
there's a good chance it swam in here from some river.

342
00:17:16.888 --> 00:17:20.188
I'm saying that if we move upstream his underground river...

343
00:17:20.188 --> 00:17:22.988
Maybe we'll find a way out...

344
00:17:22.988 --> 00:17:24.388
That's right.

345
00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:29.588
These are Kudo's, aren't they?

346
00:17:29.588 --> 00:17:30.688
Yes.

347
00:17:30.688 --> 00:17:33.888
Then, they must have gotten Iost in here after all.

348
00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:37.388
But why did he leave them here?

349
00:17:37.388 --> 00:17:40.288
This is terrible, we've got to find them right away.

350
00:17:41.588 --> 00:17:42.788
Wait!

351
00:17:43.788 --> 00:17:46.488
Something's on the ground around here a lot of them.

352
00:17:46.488 --> 00:17:47.688
What?

353
00:17:51.588 --> 00:17:54.288
These are the button shaped transmitters.

354
00:17:54.288 --> 00:17:55.488
Don't touch them!

355
00:17:55.488 --> 00:17:57.288
I think they form a shape.

356
00:17:57.288 --> 00:17:59.188
A shape?

357
00:17:59.188 --> 00:18:02.388
Let me reduce the transmission area.

358
00:18:02.388 --> 00:18:03.588
This is...

359
00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:06.388
An emergency?

360
00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:12.988
Hey, what is this? It's a dead end!

361
00:18:12.988 --> 00:18:14.688
Those kids!

362
00:18:14.688 --> 00:18:17.388
They pulled one on us!

363
00:18:19.188 --> 00:18:21.788
Hurry, let's head back and find them!

364
00:18:21.788 --> 00:18:23.688
I'm going to kill them!

365
00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:27.288
No way...

366
00:18:27.288 --> 00:18:29.688
I don't believe this...

367
00:18:29.688 --> 00:18:33.188
We couldn't possibly get out through there.

368
00:18:35.888 --> 00:18:38.888
The fish does seem to come from here though.

369
00:18:38.888 --> 00:18:42.188
Does that mean we'll never get out alive?

370
00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:43.488
No way!

371
00:18:43.488 --> 00:18:45.688
It's too early to give up hope.

372
00:18:45.688 --> 00:18:46.688
Huh?

373
00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:49.888
Look, the roots of a tree are growing through the roof of the cave.

374
00:18:49.888 --> 00:18:51.888
That means we're right under the surface of the ground.

375
00:18:51.888 --> 00:18:55.088
The way out is probably very close by.

376
00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.888
But I don't see any way to get out.

377
00:19:03.788 --> 00:19:05.888
It's an egg!

378
00:19:05.888 --> 00:19:08.088
There's something like a giant egg here.

379
00:19:09.788 --> 00:19:13.788
It's just an egg shaped rock on top of another rock.

380
00:19:14.888 --> 00:19:16.788
What a bummer.

381
00:19:19.688 --> 00:19:21.688
We've come to a very strange place.

382
00:19:21.688 --> 00:19:24.888
Yes, the path splits into five.

383
00:19:24.888 --> 00:19:28.588
I wonder which one leads to the way out.

384
00:19:28.588 --> 00:19:29.788
That's strange.

385
00:19:29.788 --> 00:19:33.188
It isn't natural for a rock Iike that to rest on another rock.

386
00:19:33.188 --> 00:19:35.288
Someone put it there deliberately.

387
00:19:35.288 --> 00:19:37.988
But for what reason?

388
00:19:40.588 --> 00:19:41.888
Look at that!

389
00:19:41.888 --> 00:19:44.688
Something's carved on it.

390
00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:48.188
"Those lost in the darkness, follow the dragon's path

391
00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:51.088
and a glow of supreme bliss will shine upon you."

392
00:19:51.088 --> 00:19:53.688
Those lost in the darkness?

393
00:19:53.688 --> 00:19:55.788
It's almost the same words we found

394
00:19:55.788 --> 00:19:57.688
on the stone monument outside.

395
00:20:03.688 --> 00:20:06.588
Bats!

396
00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:07.988
Oh, no!

397
00:20:10.088 --> 00:20:11.488
Those voices...

398
00:20:11.488 --> 00:20:13.188
No doubt about it, it's those kids!

399
00:20:13.188 --> 00:20:14.388
They're close by. Hurry!

400
00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:15.588
Let's go!

401
00:20:15.588 --> 00:20:16.888
Go away!

402
00:20:16.888 --> 00:20:19.188
Don't move! Just keep still!

403
00:20:24.888 --> 00:20:27.788
Bats that live in caves eat bugs.

404
00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:31.788
That's why they respond to slight movements and sounds.

405
00:20:34.788 --> 00:20:37.788
Ayumi, don't go finding anymore weird things.

406
00:20:37.788 --> 00:20:40.888
-But... -No, we're lucky you did.

407
00:20:40.888 --> 00:20:42.388
Bats that live in caves

408
00:20:42.388 --> 00:20:46.388
nest no more than 300 meters from the entrance.

409
00:20:47.388 --> 00:20:54.888
That means the way out is very close by.

410
00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:57.288
-Are you sure? -Are you sure?

411
00:20:57.288 --> 00:20:58.588
But...

412
00:20:58.588 --> 00:21:00.488
Our problem is, we don't know which one of tunnels

413
00:21:00.488 --> 00:21:03.588
leads to the way out.

414
00:21:03.588 --> 00:21:05.088
If my deduction is right,

415
00:21:05.088 --> 00:21:08.688
the dragon's path will show us, but...

416
00:21:08.688 --> 00:21:11.588
Darn it, my eyes are getting fuzzy.

417
00:21:17.288 --> 00:21:19.588
The key to the puzzle is

418
00:21:19.588 --> 00:21:22.888
the huge "to" carved on the stone in front of the cave

419
00:21:22.888 --> 00:21:24.488
and the words dragon's path,

420
00:21:24.488 --> 00:21:27.988
and the egg shaped rock on top of the other rock.

421
00:21:27.988 --> 00:21:31.888
"To", "dragon's path" and "egg"?

422
00:21:33.888 --> 00:21:37.688
Then, let's try each of the tunnels.

423
00:21:37.688 --> 00:21:40.188
No, we're only going to one.

424
00:21:40.188 --> 00:21:42.088
Huh?

425
00:21:42.088 --> 00:21:43.888
The words,

426
00:21:43.888 --> 00:21:47.988
those lost in the darkness refers to those lost in the cave.

427
00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:52.088
Glow of supreme bliss means the light of the way out.

428
00:21:52.088 --> 00:21:56.388
That means the carvings on the stone in front of the cave

429
00:21:56.388 --> 00:22:00.488
and on that rock are hints as how to get out of here.

430
00:22:00.488 --> 00:22:02.988
The dragon's path that leads out is...

431
00:22:02.988 --> 00:22:05.588
Is that...

432
00:22:09.088 --> 00:22:10.388
Conan?

433
00:22:12.688 --> 00:22:16.188
-Conan? -He's bleeding so badly!

434
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:20.288
-Footsteps! -Oh, no.

435
00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:21.688
Those guys are coming!

436
00:22:21.688 --> 00:22:22.888
What should we do?

437
00:23:58.688 --> 00:23:59.788
"Next Episode" -Oh, no.

438
00:23:59.788 --> 00:24:01.188
Those guys are coming!

439
00:24:05.088 --> 00:24:06.288
You idiot.

440
00:24:06.288 --> 00:24:09.388
I've already read your next move.

441
00:24:09.388 --> 00:24:10.488
What?

442
00:24:10.488 --> 00:24:11.888
Excuse me.

443
00:24:11.888 --> 00:24:14.488
I have the same blood type as him.

444
00:24:18.088 --> 00:24:19.288
Ran.

445
00:24:19.288 --> 00:24:22.588
So, you do know...

446
00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:28.509
Next Conan, "Perilous Return: The Wounded Detective"

447
00:24:28.906 --> 00:24:31.706
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:31.706 --> 00:24:33.506
"Shogi"

449
00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:35.206
Next time, that person will do something crazy!

450
00:24:35.206 --> 00:24:37.606
I think it's time to wake up from your dream.
