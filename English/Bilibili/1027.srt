1
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.130
Wow!

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.270
It looks so good!

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.480
Yeah!

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.010
Shall we eat?

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.290
Thanks for the food!

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.280
By the way, why aren't
Conan and Haibara here?

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.620
Ai-chan has a TV show she wants to watch, and
Conan-kun's home alone at the detective agency.

8
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.150
It's too bad they couldn't come with us.

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.260
Yeah.

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.860
Yeah.

11
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.640
Everyone, look at that.

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.890
Huh?

13
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.500
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

14
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.120
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

15
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.330
A vanishing case witnessed as a silhouette!

16
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.080
Cast a bright light on it
and you'll find the culprit!

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.680
Always determining the one truth

18
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.330
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

19
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.010
his name is Detective Conan!

20
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.470
Beyond the Curtain

21
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.640
Beyond the Curtain
"Beyond the Curtain!"

22
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.020
Beyond the Curtain

23
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.280
A man and a woman?

24
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.680
You can see their silhouettes so clearly.

25
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.780
They look like shadow puppets.

26
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.030
Do you suppose they're eating?

27
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.040
They're probably throwing a party.

28
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.300
Things seem to be going well between them.

29
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.550
Wait, are they...

30
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.180
C-C-C-Could it be?

31
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.310
K-Kissing?

32
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.560
Like I said, things are going excellently!

33
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.310
H-H-H-Hey! This isn't appropriate
for children's eyes!

34
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.320
Huh?

35
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.200
Wh-What's going on?!

36
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.390
Aren't they making up?

37
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.530
They're clearly fighting.

38
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.450
Oh, no!

39
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.460
Call the police immediately!

40
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.070
He's here.

41
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.470
Hurry, officer!

42
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.170
Yes?

43
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.450
Excuse me, I'm with the police.

44
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.750
Could I have a few minutes of your time?

45
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.110
What do the police want with me?

46
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.040
Well, someone reported that they saw a man

47
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.100
attacking a woman inside your
home through the curtains.

48
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.320
They saw a man attacking a
woman through the curtains?

49
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.790
In that case, I have a large pet dog.

50
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.480
Perhaps that's what Chocolat playing with
me looked like through the curtains.

51
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.050
That's not what happened!

52
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.630
That wasn't a dog. It was a man.

53
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.450
What do you think? Could I
take a look around inside?

54
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.140
Very well. In that case, officer, would
it be all right if you only you came in?

55
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.940
I don't want strangers looking
around inside my home.

56
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.180
Understood.

57
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.950
That way! They went that way!

58
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.910
That way! They went that way!
Mori Detective Agency

59
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.290
Don't let them escape!

60
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.920
Over there! Hurry!

61
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.420
You're not getting away!

62
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.420
Conan-kun.

63
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.840
Ayumi-chan? What happened, guys?

64
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.840
We'd like to get your advice on a situation.

65
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.460
Advice?

66
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.100
Last night, when we went to a
restaurant with Professor Agasa...

67
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.100
Everyone, look at that.

68
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.860
A man and a woman?

69
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.110
You can see their silhouettes so clearly.

70
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.370
They look like shadow puppets.

71
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.490
Do you suppose they're eating?

72
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.620
They're probably throwing a party.

73
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.760
Things seem to be going well between them.

74
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.760
Huh?

75
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.960
W-What's going on?!

76
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.640
So you witnessed the incident
through the curtains,

77
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.350
but the police wouldn't take you seriously?

78
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.340
We really did see something!

79
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.970
Then why are the police
saying nothing happened?

80
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.450
It's not like we could do anything about it.

81
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.460
The cop said there was only a woman inside.

82
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.070
Are you sure it wasn't just
a mistake on your part?

83
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.160
No, it wasn't!

84
00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.530
We all saw it!

85
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.580
Okay, I believe you.

86
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.730
But there's too little information.

87
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.850
Anything helps. Tell me
everything you remember.

88
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.610
According to the police,

89
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.060
the woman who lives in that apartment
is Kokubun Yuko-san, 26 years old.

90
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.860
She works at an event planning company.

91
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.120
This is the photo we found of her on
their website, taken when she was hired.

92
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.620
You've done your research, Mitsuhiko.

93
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.930
So, what were the two silhouettes doing?

94
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.000
The man brought dishes and wine to the table.

95
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.800
The woman stayed seated the whole time.

96
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.630
Yeah.

97
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.130
We thought they were
enjoying a party together,

98
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.890
and then the man suddenly became violent.

99
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.130
Now that I think about it,
maybe that wasn't a party.

100
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.400
It kind of looked like a police
officer questioning a suspect.

101
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.650
To me, they looked like a
couple just before a proposal.

102
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.410
I think they looked like an old
man and woman basking in the sun.

103
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.950
How did you guys all see different things?

104
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.660
We can't help that. That's
what it looked like to us.

105
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.440
Silhouettes, huh?

106
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.630
Depending on the perspective and angle,

107
00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:06.640
Depending on the perspective and angle,
their size and overall impression can
change completely, like shadow puppets.

108
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.670
their size and overall impression can
change completely, like shadow puppets.

109
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.680
The police claim only the woman who
was allegedly attacked was inside.

110
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.540
That's the exact opposite
of what they're claiming.

111
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.100
What's going on here?

112
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.480
Interrogation!

113
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.770
Sunbathing!

114
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.980
How do you sunbathe at night?

115
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.870
What? Uh...

116
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.110
They were having an afternoon nap at night.

117
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.280
They'd been staying up all
night from that afternoon.

118
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.160
You two have got everything backwards.

119
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.620
Backwards?

120
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.120
I see. So that's how it is.

121
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.790
Conan-kun, did you figure something out?

122
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.860
Yeah, I did.

123
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:55.010
If everything you're saying is true,
then this is the only possible answer.

124
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.580
Sorry to bother you while you're
so busy, Detective Takagi.

125
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.700
It's fine.

126
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.070
Did Kokubun-san really
say they have a pet dog?

127
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.570
I've said repeatedly that
we don't allow pets here.

128
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.940
Looks like no one's home.

129
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.830
Yeah.

130
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.830
Hey, kids!

131
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.850
She loves sports, huh?

132
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.940
So a woman lives alone here.

133
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.340
Is that blood?

134
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.540
Looks like it.

135
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:16.360
This blood someone tried to wipe clean,
the broken glasses and plates in the trash.

136
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.920
And it doesn't look like she has a pet dog.

137
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.390
Conan-kun.

138
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.140
Look at this.

139
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.630
She must've really hated him.

140
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.150
Conan-kun, what we saw last night...

141
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.560
Yeah, last night you guys
watched a crime take place.

142
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.840
But what we saw was...

143
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.110
You had it backwards.

144
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.410
Backwards?

145
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.910
People tend to get stuck
on their first impressions.

146
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.430
And it doesn't make sense that
the man was delivering dishes

147
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.670
and wine to the table when the woman who
lives here was sitting the whole time.

148
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.420
If you swap the genders of the people,

149
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.850
then it also explains why the police officer
said there was only a woman inside.

150
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.530
In other words, the person you thought
was a man was a short-haired woman,

151
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.190
and the person you thought was
a woman was a long-haired man.

152
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.440
What?

153
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.200
Look. This is a recent photo of her.

154
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.740
You're right.

155
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.450
We had no idea.

156
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.400
She only let the police
officer inside the apartment

157
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.380
because he'd been told that
the victim was a woman.

158
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.710
That did in fact allow
her to get away with it.

159
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.560
Though she made it through that visit,

160
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.910
she must sense the investigation
turning up the heat on her.

161
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:49.520
In other words, she's already
acted on the next step?

162
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.950
Detective Takagi.

163
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.980
I checked the security cameras.

164
00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:01.240
I saw Kokubun Yuko-san leaving early
this morning with a large suitcase.

165
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.900
Head back to the station
and report what you saw.

166
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.080
Yes, sir.

167
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.240
I'm going to check the
security cameras in the area.

168
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.320
We don't need to help?

169
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.330
Nah, I think it'll be fine.

170
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.740
Are you sure?

171
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.640
Surely not even you can deduce
where the culprit went, right?

172
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.400
I don't know about that.

173
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.510
What does that mean?

174
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.520
She probably still believes that
as long as the body isn't found,

175
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.520
she can keep evading the police.

176
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.770
Which means she's probably doing
what she'd do on any other day.

177
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:36.470
Today's the first day of the event I'm running!

178
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:37.190
Today's the first day of the event I'm running!
See?

179
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.880
Today's the first day of the event I'm running!

180
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.310
Today's the first day of the event I'm running!
What is this?

181
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.780
Today's the first day of the event I'm running!

182
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.570
Kokubun Yuko-san's social media profile.

183
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.740
But maybe she buried the
body before going to work.

184
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.790
No, she's probably still
pretending everything is normal.

185
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.320
Since it seemed like a premeditated crime,

186
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.280
if she's going to bury the body,
she'll probably do it after work.

187
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.550
Hey, look. We've arrived.

188
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.200
It's the flower park.

189
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.590
It's so pretty.

190
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:21.610
Thank you for visiting the park today.

191
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:28.120
The Haido City Flower Park will be closing soon.

192
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.080
Let's hurry. She'll make
her move once work is over.

Kokubun-san? Oh, she already left.

195
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:36.410
Kokubun-san? Oh, she already left.

196
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.640
When?

197
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.740
Just now, I think.

198
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.940
The truth is...

199
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.090

Slow her down until the police arrive.

205
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.850
How?

206
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.540
Leave that to me. I've got an idea.

207
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.540
I found her. She's heading
towards the exit from the plaza.

208
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.480
All right. Follow the plan, guys.

209
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.630
Got it.

210
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.880
That way! They went that way!

211
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.920
Don't let them escape!

212
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.770
Over there! Hurry!

213
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.590
Where did they go?

214
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.770
Don't worry. They're trapped in here.

215
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.660
It worked.

216
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.200
Professor.

217
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.910
Good work, everyone.

218
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.830
Now let's leave the rest up to Conan-kun.

219
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.110
You're Kokubun Yuko-san, correct?

220
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.120
What?

221
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:35.520
Kokubun Yuko (26)
Event Planning Company Employee

222
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.450
Kokubun Yuko (26)
Event Planning Company Employee
Uh, yes. That's me.

223
00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:38.750
Kokubun Yuko (26)
Event Planning Company Employee
Who are you?

224
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.620
Who are you?

225
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.130
My name is Mori Kogoro. I'm a detective.

226
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.700
What does a detective want with me?

227
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.880
I'm actually looking for someone.

228
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.760
And you think I can help you?

229
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.570
Of course you can.

230
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.640
Nobody else knows where he is.

231
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.650
Who are you talking about?

232
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.860
Don't play dumb.

233
00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.150
I'm talking about the man you
had dinner with last night.

234
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.160
I have no idea what you're talking about.

235
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.770
The police investigation
is already closing in.

236
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.910
See? They're just over there.

237
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.340
By the way, what's inside that suitcase?

238
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.670
What do you think is in here?

239
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.930
If I'm correct, he should be in there.

240
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.440
You're not very nice, are you?

241
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.430
Most detectives aren't.

242
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.190
It's his fault.

243
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.890
After naming me his guarantor
and borrowing a bunch of money,

244
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.410
he bilked his debts and pushed
all the responsibility onto me.

245
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.710
Apparently he spent the money on other women.

246
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:21.720
He destroyed my life, forced his debts
onto me, and then tried to dump me.

247
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:26.850
So I destroyed him!

248
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.480
What do you want me to do to you?

249
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.480
Shall I start by cutting all
your fingernails to the quick?

250
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.330
Or perhaps I'll make you
swallow a thousand needles.

251
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.720
Or would you prefer to be electrocuted?

252
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.590
You don't like pain? In that case...

253
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.310
How's this?

254
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:19.660
Apparently if you drink these together,
you can end your life pleasantly.

255
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.300
But we can't do that.

256
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.790
You have to experience the worst
possible pain and suffering.

257
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.500
Otherwise, I won't be satisfied.

258
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.000
You think I'll let you go?!

259
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.300
I can't believe someone was watching.

260
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.270
Uh, everything's fine.

261
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.220
Ahem.

262
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.270
More importantly, you must've
been rather surprised

263
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.610
when the police paid you
a visit after the murder.

264
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.190
Excuse me, I'm with the police.

265
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.670
Could I have a few minutes of your time?

266
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.990
What do the police want with me?

267
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.790
Well, someone reported that they saw a man

268
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.790
attacking a woman inside your
home through the curtains.

269
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.250
They saw a man attacking a
woman through the curtains?

270
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.720
In that case, I have a large pet dog.

271
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.260
Perhaps that's what Chocolat playing with
me looked like through the curtains.

272
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.950
What do you think? Could I
take a look around inside?

273
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:32.900
Very well. In that case, officer, would
it be all right if you only you came in?

274
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.230
I don't want strangers looking
around inside my home.

275
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:43.070
I thought that was pretty clever of
me, but apparently it didn't work.

276
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.100
Crimes are a gamble you have
a slim chance of winning.

277
00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.800
You shouldn't have done it to begin with.

278
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.160
Mr. Detective.

279
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.450
Yes?

280
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.990
Do you smell something burning?

281
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.840
Huh? What?

282
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.490
Hot, hot!

283
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:03.820
Are you all right?

284
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:06.600
Y-Yes, of course. I'm fine, obviously.

285
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.760
Mr. Detective, you're alone, aren't you?

286
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.600
What do you mean by that?

287
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:17.360
Do you think you'd be willing to let me go?

288
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.000
I can't do that.

289
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.860
I see. That's too bad.

290
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:28.480
Mr. Detective, you know
what that means, don't you?

291
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.620
Mr. Detective, why won't you let me see you?

292
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.130
I'd like to see your face.

293
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:41.630
I want to see the face of the
detective who hunted me down...

294
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.360
Up close!

295
00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.360
Why, you...!

296
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.610
Kokubun Yuko, the time is 19:58.

297
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.640
You're under arrest for a weapons violation.

298
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.700
You got here quick, Detective Takagi.

299
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.080
Sorry to keep you waiting, Conan-kun.

300
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.920
Okay, what's this?

301
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920
A sea urchin!

302
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.710
What are you talking about? It's a crab.

303
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.800
What?

304
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.300
Genta-kun, does that really
look like a sea urchin to you?

305
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.780
What? I'm just being honest.

306
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.060
At least they're both sea creatures.

307
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:06.570
Anyway, I can't believe what we thought was
a pleasant date was actually a ghastly affair.

308
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.890
Seriously, and there was only a
single curtain between you and it.

309
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.660
As they say, the future lies beyond the veil.

310
00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.070
Hey, Conan.

311
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.250
What does that look like to you?

312
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.250
Huh? Isn't that a rabbit?

313
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.730
Right?

314
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.000
What?

315
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.010
It's clearly an eel carrying a leek.

316
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:29.760
What?

317
00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.310
How does this look like an eel to you?!

318
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.950
This is the eel's head, and this is the leek.

319
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.190
It's ducks that carry leeks.

320
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.020
Is that right?
