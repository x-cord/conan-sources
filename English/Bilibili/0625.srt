1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,840
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,340
You must be true to yourself.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,240
Screams echo throughout the haunted house!

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,440
What was supposed to be an act turns into reality.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,540
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,499
"Screaming Operation Room (Part 1)"

9
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:04,499
"Beika University Summer Festival"

10
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,499
The light music club concert will start from 15:00!

11
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,299
How about some famed mountain hut style

12
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:13,199
fried noodles of the Wandervogel club?

13
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,399
Entry number 5, English major Ms. Alisa Arisugawa!

14
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,599
Don't break the set!

15
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,099
What're we going to do about evening performance?

16
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:26,999
How about some cold drinks?

17
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,999
We're loading two more Adamski type UFOs!

18
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,099
Okay!

19
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,199
The costume play photo studio is open!

20
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,899
Please come!

21
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,599
Let me introduce to you!

22
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,199
An OB of Beika University as well as a famed detective.

23
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,899
Mr. Kogoro Mouri!

24
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,599
Hello!

25
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,099
It's the Sleeping Kogoro!

26
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:50,899
How does it feel, visiting your alma mater after a long while?

27
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,699
Do you feel nostalgic?

28
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:54,099
Yes, sort of.

29
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,399
The school building is as rundown as was always, though.

30
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:58,799
But...

31
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,599
There are so many beauties here.

32
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,399
Geez, since he said he was going to give a lecture at his alma mater,

33
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,099
I came to look in on things,

34
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,899
and sure enough, all he was after was the girl students here!

35
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,799
Well, I guess it's not all that bad

36
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,499
to spread your wings freely at times in places like these, no?

37
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,599
The only thing that's spread long is the space under his nose.

38
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,699
And? Did you get to spread you wings in London, Ran?

39
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,199
You wrote me that you coincidentally ran into Shinichi, right?

40
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,899
Yeah, sort of.

41
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:37,599
Don't tell me you two did things you weren't supposed to do?

42
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,199
Just what do you mean by that?

43
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,399
Talking about London...

44
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:44,699
Shut up! I wish you'd stay out of it!

45
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:48,099
This is a story of adults that have nothing to do with brats!

46
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,699
Yes, it has everything to do with me.

47
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:54,899
Well, I guess when it comes to that Holmes freak,

48
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:58,499
he ended up talking your ears off about Holmes, right?

49
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:01,099
Well...

50
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,799
The thing is...

51
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,299
What?

52
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,199
Shinichi confessed that he loves you?

53
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,699
Keep your voice down, Sonoko!

54
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,899
Oh, so the time's finally come around for him to settle down.

55
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,299
But, if under those circumstances, rather than confess...

56
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,299
Can't you tell?

57
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:26,799
You're a detective, aren't you?

58
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:30,199
If so, why don't you at least deduce what's going on inside of me!

59
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,999
You dumb-dumb!

60
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,899
Hey, hold it, Ran!

61
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,899
Wait, I said!

62
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:40,199
Hey!

63
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,499
No. Let me go!

64
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:44,899
You're a nuisance!

65
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,299
What?

66
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,599
You're a nuisance of a difficult case to solve!

67
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,099
You've got so much unnecessary emotions mixed up inside of you,

68
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:53,699
that I wouldn't be able to make you out

69
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,999
even if I were Holmes himself!

70
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:58,599
I could never accurately make out

71
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,099
the feelings of a girl I care for!

72
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:18,599
It seems as if you pressured him into confessing how he felt.

73
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,099
I guess so.

74
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,599
And? You answered truthfully too, didn't you, Ran?

75
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,899
Answered... what?

76
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:30,999
No joke. I don't believe it.

77
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,699
I loved you all this time too.

78
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,299
Like this?

79
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,999
Of course I wouldn't say something like that.

80
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:42,499
I mean, should I have said something too?

81
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,299
Why, of course!

82
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,999
If you're not clear about it,

83
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,799
he may think that he was brushed off or something.

84
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,599
Idiot.

85
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:54,499
It was obvious at that point.

86
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,499
If you're going to tell him, tell him right now on the phone!

87
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:00,299
-I'll watch you while you do! -What?

88
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:03,399
Hey, are you calling now?

89
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,699
Then, I would like to tell you the story of the 108 bags

90
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,299
that are indispensible for detectives!

91
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:12,299
The first is a wisdom bag!

92
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,599
Geez.

93
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,999
At this rate, who knows when he'll finish talking.

94
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,499
I mean after hearing that a detective was coming,

95
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,999
I wanted him to take a look and then.

96
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:26,999
Oh, I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

97
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,799
Did you want to see my father about something?

98
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,999
Could it be that you want him to investigate a case?

99
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,799
No. That's not it but...

100
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:37,599
If you're his daughter, do you go to investigate cases at times?

101
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,999
-Yes, at times. -Well, very frequently!

102
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,199
Then, you've seen it, haven't you?

103
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,599
What?

104
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:50,299
"Screaming Hospital"

105
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:51,999
Go inside that haunted house

106
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,599
to check out how well the zombie is made?

107
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,299
Yeah. I think that someone who has been

108
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:00,799
to the actual scene of a crime many times

109
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,199
would be able to evaluate the looks of things more realistically!

110
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,799
Oh, well...

111
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,799
But...

112
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,899
The fact is, we belong to the department of literature and fine arts

113
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:11,699
and are majoring in the art of imagery!

114
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,299
We're shooting a horror movie as our graduation production

115
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,299
but we were told by a nagging broad who thinks

116
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:18,799
she's some big shot director that the scene

117
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:22,099
where a person dies, doesn't look real enough.

118
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,799
So, we told her to show us

119
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,699
a sample of what she's talking about.

120
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,599
Are you talking about me?

121
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:37,899
Who are these children?

122
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,099
When's the Sleeping Kogoro coming?

123
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,999
So, we've brought his daughter and her friend over!

124
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:48,699
Because she seems to have seen corpses at murder sites.

125
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,099
Okay, then, Go tell your father how you felt looking at it

126
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:54,999
and bring him here later, will you?

127
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,799
Anna! It's about time we shift!

128
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,799
Hey, what's with you, Mutsumi?

129
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,699
You don't even have your make-up on yet!

130
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,099
Because even if I were to do it myself,

131
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,299
you're going to fix it, aren't you, Anna?

132
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,399
That's why I thought it'd be better

133
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,099
if you did it for me to begin with.

134
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:14,999
Geez, talk about a hopeless case!

135
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:18,399
Okay, we'll let them in in 30 minutes, then!

136
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,099
You want to show them the part you're playing the zombie,

137
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,599
while you're at it anyway, don't you?

138
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,499
Okay!

139
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:28,499
Take a good look at the way I look dead, then!

140
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:35,599
So, she says...

141
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,599
Oh, no, I'm not going inside!

142
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:42,199
Don't worry about it! They're all only props after all!

143
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:46,799
But you were shocked a while ago too, weren't you, Sonoko?

144
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,099
That was just because I was taken by surprise.

145
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:53,099
That's what a haunted house is all about, isn't it?

146
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,699
Ran! Being the way you are,

147
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:58,299
you won't be able to tell Shinichi that you like him forever!

148
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,299
That's why you see!

149
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,199
Do it to conjure up some guts in you!

150
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:05,099
If you clear this, no doubt you'll step up

151
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:08,299
to becoming a woman stronger than you are now!

152
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,799
You think so?

153
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,299
That's totally out of this world.

154
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,399
You can say that again.

155
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,099
See.

156
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:25,899
It's looks like fun.

157
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,599
It doesn't look like fun at all!

158
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:31,699
If you're that scared, I can escort you inside.

159
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:34,699
After all, he knows where what gadgets are set.

160
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,499
Okay, please do!

161
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,599
Then, she'll go inside too!

162
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,499
Hey, Sonoko!

163
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,199
Don't worry!

164
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,199
It's only the beginning that's really scary!

165
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,999
Gosh...

166
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,099
"Entrance"

167
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,399
Hey, this is just the beginning.

168
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,799
Don't get lost, sonny!

169
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,999
How the heck can I get lost?

170
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:26,699
I'm being carried right through.

171
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:31,999
Well, it's pretty well made for a school festival haunted house.

172
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:34,299
It's of bad taste, though.

173
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:39,499
I'd like to have shown this to Hashiguchi too.

174
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:42,799
Yeah. After all, Hashiguchi's the one

175
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,099
who planned this graduation project haunted house

176
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,099
and the movie too!

177
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:51,399
Did that person quit school?

178
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,799
No.

179
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,399
He committed suicide by drinking poison.

180
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,299
It was only a month ago.

181
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,599
What?

182
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,199
It seems that he was told by the doctor

183
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,199
that he had an incurable disease

184
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:06,399
and that he had only six months more to live.

185
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,999
He took it heavily and took his own life.

186
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,899
It was written in his suicide note.

187
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:14,199
Moreover, the ones who found his body are

188
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:19,499
we two, and Mutsumi and Anna who were just here a while ago.

189
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:23,899
I was haunted by nightmares for a while.

190
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,999
It was after his death,

191
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,099
that Anna started to get all worked up saying

192
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:29,199
she was going to offer it to Hashiguchi

193
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:32,299
and started really getting carried away with making the movie.

194
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,699
Isn't that right, Tsujiei?

195
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:36,399
Tsujiei?

196
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,299
Hey.

197
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,199
Where'd he disappear to?

198
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,599
He was here till a while ago, wasn't he?

199
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:47,299
I'll go look for him around here, so you guys go outside!

200
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,999
The exit is right up ahead!

201
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,299
What?

202
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,499
Straight up ahead.

203
00:11:56,499 --> 00:11:59,699
It's so dark that you can hardly see anything.

204
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,999
There seems to be a surgery room.

205
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:11,199
Excuse me.

206
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,299
Wow.

207
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:16,599
It looks like a real surgery is being performed.

208
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:19,199
The patient is Anna that we saw a while ago.

209
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,599
The doctors performing the surgery are all mannequins.

210
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,999
There's the exit.

211
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,799
I guess we can't go outside

212
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,799
unless we pass by the pillow of the bed.

213
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,399
Yes.

214
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:06,999
There's nothing to be so surprised about, is there?

215
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,599
Ladies.

216
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,499
That's right.

217
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:18,699
These are just props.

218
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,299
See!

219
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,799
You guys are too exaggeratedly terrified!

220
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:29,499
But, Anna's strange.

221
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,899
Yeah. Every time after she ejects blood,

222
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,099
she gets up, opens her eyes wide and laughs.

223
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,999
Hey, Anna. Let's not get lazy!

224
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,799
Weren't you going to show us your awesome death sight?

225
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:49,499
Hey. Come on, say something! Anna!

226
00:13:51,099 --> 00:13:54,599
Hey. She doesn't seem to be breathing?

227
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:55,899
Hey, Anna?

228
00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:57,699
Get a hold of yourself, Anna?

229
00:13:57,699 --> 00:13:59,999
Anna?

230
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,099
What? Is something wrong?

231
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,899
The inside of her mouth smells like almonds.

232
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:07,599
Hey, Anna? Answer me, Anna?

233
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,799
Get out of the way!

234
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,499
I'll take Anna to the hospital.

235
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:13,899
Don't touch her!

236
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:16,599
There is smell of almond from inside her mouth!

237
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:19,899
She could've drank potassium cyanide poison!

238
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,399
Poison?

239
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,299
The smell of almond?

240
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,799
-Really? -Amateurs shouldn't smell it!

241
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,799
The almond smell is caused by the poison

242
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,699
that was drunk combining with stomach acids and stuff,

243
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,099
resulting in the smell of cyanide gas!

244
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:34,099
If you mistakenly sniff it in, you'll die!

245
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:37,199
I mean, I saw it on a police drama.

246
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,199
The almond smell is not the familiar one of the almond

247
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,999
that is usually sweet and aromatic,

248
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,599
but rather, the sweet sour smell of the almond fruit

249
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,299
and flower before harvest.

250
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:49,999
Oh.

251
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:54,199
But, from what it looks like now, Anna's...

252
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,099
committed suicide.

253
00:15:01,004 --> 00:15:03,804
"Screaming Hospital"

254
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,604
Suicide?

255
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,704
Did she drink the poison in front of you all?

256
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:11,904
Yes, probably...

257
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:15,104
What is her name?

258
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:17,004
Beika University, Senior of

259
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:20,304
the Literature Department of Performing Fine Arts, Ms. Anna Tadami.

260
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:22,604
Is that correct?

261
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:24,204
Yeah.

262
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:27,604
Oh, well... because of her monster make-up,

263
00:15:27,604 --> 00:15:30,404
the picture of her student ID that we found in her belongings

264
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,704
seemed so very different.

265
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:33,704
And?

266
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,304
What is your testimony

267
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:37,604
that Ms. Anna Tadami committed suicide based on?

268
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,904
She suddenly started to suffer!

269
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,804
We followed the guide board here...

270
00:15:42,804 --> 00:15:46,704
And passed through the pillow of the bed like this.

271
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:50,004
Her body suddenly went into convulsion.

272
00:15:56,604 --> 00:15:59,704
She was struggling kicking her legs up and down.

273
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:04,404
So much that the bed started shaking

274
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:05,904
making rattling sounds too!

275
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:09,304
Then, right after that blood gushed out of her stomach...

276
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:10,504
Blood?

277
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:13,704
Hey, wasn't the cause of her death toxication?

278
00:16:13,704 --> 00:16:15,104
Oh, yes.

279
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:17,504
But since the coroner hasn't arrived yet,

280
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:19,704
we can't say for sure.

281
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:22,404
There is an almond smell coming from her mouth

282
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,304
and there is something that looks like a capsule

283
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:26,004
stuck between her teeth too.

284
00:16:26,004 --> 00:16:27,904
She probably took poison.

285
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,004
The blood oozing out is done by a gadget.

286
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,504
A gadget?

287
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:34,704
There is a switch inside the bed.

288
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,704
And when you push it...

289
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:42,204
-Hey. -Oh, it splattered on you?

290
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:44,304
It usually flies over there!

291
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,404
But it's water based, so it'll wash off right away.

292
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:50,604
Then, was the bed shaking also done with a gadget?

293
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:53,304
Yes. It's a gadget alright but...

294
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,304
the top right leg of this bed

295
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:58,904
and the lower left leg that is diagonal to it,

296
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:01,804
is slightly short,

297
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,604
so when the person playing the patient

298
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:05,604
shakes the bed with his body,

299
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:09,704
the bed will sways.

300
00:17:09,704 --> 00:17:12,704
If so, did she kick her legs up and down

301
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:14,504
-using some device too? -No.

302
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:19,404
That could've only been done by the person on the bed!

303
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,204
Oh, wait.

304
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:22,904
See, like so!

305
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:25,904
There's nothing here except for the gadget to eject blood!

306
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:29,604
Please do not touch things at the site without permission!

307
00:17:29,604 --> 00:17:30,804
Right, right!

308
00:17:30,804 --> 00:17:33,804
Those legs with red pedicure on them!

309
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,904
When kicked her legs up and down, they came into view, right?

310
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:40,204
Yes, the covers that were on her flipped up

311
00:17:40,204 --> 00:17:42,604
and her right foot came into view.

312
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:46,404
I see. It seems to be true that

313
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:48,904
she drank the poison when Ran and Sonoko passed by her bed.

314
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:53,104
There was nobody around her at that time, was there?

315
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:55,404
Especially near her face.

316
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:59,304
Yes, it was dark, but I think only we were there.

317
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:01,204
If anyone made her drink poison,

318
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:02,804
I think we would've been able to see it.

319
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:05,904
By the way, when she started to suffer,

320
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:08,104
where were you both?

321
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:10,004
Us?

322
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:13,104
I was approaching the two girls secretly

323
00:18:13,104 --> 00:18:15,104
wearing this on my chest.

324
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:17,204
I was with those children right through

325
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:19,904
as they're escort through this haunted house but...

326
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,704
I deliberately pulled away from them a while

327
00:18:21,704 --> 00:18:23,704
to wear this simple item

328
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,004
to scare the girls in the operation room

329
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,504
as I talked over with Hacchiya.

330
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,404
Well, but after we separated,

331
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:33,504
I was doing different things from Tsujie.

332
00:18:33,504 --> 00:18:35,104
Then, what about you?

333
00:18:35,104 --> 00:18:38,304
I was in the X-Ray room next door.

334
00:18:38,304 --> 00:18:43,404
I was waiting for people to come right through.

335
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:45,604
I see.

336
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:48,204
But, I heard a scream and despite it, no one came,

337
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:49,504
so I got anxious and...

338
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,604
Anxious?

339
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:53,004
Because...

340
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:55,004
In order to get out of here,

341
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,804
you have to first go through the operation room

342
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,804
and later pass through the X-ray room.

343
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,004
I came here to check things out, wondering what happened.

344
00:19:02,004 --> 00:19:03,904
And saw that Anna... Anna...

345
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:07,204
Hey, Mutsumi, look at yourself!

346
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:09,404
Your make-up is all smeared with tears!

347
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:11,904
But, Anna died, you know!

348
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,904
I can't see how you can be so calm!

349
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,204
Of course we're not calm.

350
00:19:16,204 --> 00:19:19,604
I feel the same way I felt when Hashiguchi committed suicide.

351
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:21,004
Suicide?

352
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:23,004
If you're officers, you already know, don't you?

353
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,904
The case about the Beika University Senior

354
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:25,904
who committed suicide

355
00:19:25,904 --> 00:19:29,004
drinking poison in his apartment, a month ago.

356
00:19:29,004 --> 00:19:31,004
Yeah. If I remember correctly,

357
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,404
it's the case where a classmate of his who coincidentally

358
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:35,904
dropped by found his body.

359
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:40,304
The classmates were me, Tsujiei, Mutsumi and

360
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,804
Anna, over here.

361
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:46,104
Hashiguchi was really into producing

362
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:48,504
the graduation project movie and yet...

363
00:19:48,504 --> 00:19:51,704
He didn't come to class for a whole week.

364
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,504
We got worried and decided to

365
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:57,004
drop into his place after school one day.

366
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,804
But, there was no answer when we pushed the door bell.

367
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:05,204
So, we thought he was either asleep or out somewhere.

368
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,004
Therefore, we were talking about coming back some other time.

369
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:09,704
Anna suddenly...

370
00:20:09,704 --> 00:20:11,804
I sense something is wrong!

371
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:15,304
Let's go ask the manager to open the door to the room!

372
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:17,604
And, so we got inside.

373
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:21,704
And found Mr. Hashiguchi who had poisoned himself to death?

374
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:24,104
Yes. In the suicide note that was written

375
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:25,404
in his handwriting that was left in the room,

376
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:27,404
the following was written.

377
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:29,104
I haven't been feeling well recently,

378
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,004
and was examined by a doctor.

379
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:33,204
I was told that I had osteogenic sarcoma that was pretty far gone,

380
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:35,504
and have only about six months to live.

381
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:37,804
I'll leave the rest to you

382
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:43,004
and cross over to the world beyond a step ahead of you both.

383
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:46,304
We heard from the officer later that

384
00:20:46,304 --> 00:20:47,804
he died that day around the time

385
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:51,904
when we all took the seminar together.

386
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:55,704
It was from about that time that Anna changed, right?

387
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:58,804
Yeah. She suddenly said that she's going to make a tribute to Hashiguchi,

388
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,504
and started really working on the graduation project movie production

389
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:02,904
and putting her all into this haunted house too.

390
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:05,404
But, isn't it normal to want to carry things out

391
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:07,404
for the sake of a friend that had died?

392
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:10,404
But, she wasn't all that normal!

393
00:21:10,404 --> 00:21:13,204
There was a time when she overdosed on sleeping pills

394
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,104
and was taken to the hospital too.

395
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:16,204
Her reason for this was that

396
00:21:16,204 --> 00:21:18,404
she wanted to experience the in between of life and death

397
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:19,404
to use it as a realistic reference

398
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,404
for how she should play the role of being dead.

399
00:21:21,404 --> 00:21:22,704
Am I correct?

400
00:21:22,704 --> 00:21:25,804
Yeah. I thought that she was being quite reticent one day,

401
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:29,004
and found out that she had nails in her mouth one whole day.

402
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,804
Nails?

403
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:33,304
Maybe Anna

404
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:36,704
put the poison that was in the capsule into her mouth.

405
00:21:36,704 --> 00:21:39,104
I see! Like she did the nails!

406
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:42,004
Then, she bit it accidentally.

407
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:44,204
And before she could experience what it's like to be

408
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:45,604
in between life and death,

409
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,004
she really ended up dead.

410
00:21:48,004 --> 00:21:52,004
So, should we deem that she did commit suicide after all?

411
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:55,004
I wonder if it's really so?

412
00:21:57,204 --> 00:21:59,104
Conan?

413
00:21:59,104 --> 00:22:03,604
Because look at the cheek of that lady.

414
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:04,604
It's not make-up

415
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:07,304
but looks like she's really been scratched

416
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:10,004
and it looks like she's bleeding a bit too!

417
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:13,804
I think that somebody tried to cover her mouth

418
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:18,004
so she tried to pull away and ended up scratching herself.

419
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,604
What?

420
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:24,104
Inspector! Skin and blood were found in between her nails.

421
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:26,404
What?

422
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:29,704
This is a homicide made to look like suicide!

423
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:32,504
Who on earth poisoned Anna in the dark

424
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:34,904
and killed her?

425
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,304
Mutsumi, you're the culprit!

426
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,404
Then, Mr. Kiichi Hachiya, you're the culprit!

427
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:09,604
Mr. Tsujiei, you've been playing with you feet from a while ago!

428
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:12,604
I'll bet you're doing that because you feel guilty?

429
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:16,804
There's a red line.

430
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:20,104
Anna was already poisoned to death

431
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:23,004
by one of her friends.

432
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,504
Next Conan,

433
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:28,504
"Screaming Operating Room (Part 2)"

434
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:31,673
Next Conan's Hint:

435
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:33,673
"Pedicure"

436
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:34,773
I've figured out who the culprit is.

437
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,373
Just as expected of the deduction queen!

438
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:38,477
Nothing's come out yet.
