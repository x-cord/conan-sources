1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,530
Sera suspects that Haibara may
have been turned into a child

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,690
and is trying to get close to her.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,620
In order to dodge her investigation,

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:17,230
we accepted Professor Agasa's invitation to
visit an antique appraiser along with Subaru-san.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,870
However...

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,770
Nishitsu-san.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,580
Where are you, Nishitsu-san?

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,320
Nishitsu-san.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,600
Nishitsu-san?

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,170
What happened?

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,130
Who did this to you?

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,400
Th-This... This is the real tray...

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,020
Wh-What's this?

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,670
A crane design?

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,400
Must be the black lacquer tray he mentioned.

16
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,820
In any case, we need to call
an ambulance and the police.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,320
Oh, no. My phone is in my car.

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,830
Nishitsu-san, wait here. I'll be right back.

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,600
That's the room.

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,020
What's this?

21
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,160
It's no use. He's dead.

22
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,390
Hey, Conan-kun.

23
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,090
I don't see a tray anywhere.

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,740
What?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,280
What's going on here?

26
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,240
You're making quite a lot of noise.

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,570
Who are you?

28
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,220
You're not scoundrels here
to steal my tray, are you?

29
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,260
If you're outsiders, could you please leave?

30
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,520
Later, the police arrived,
and in another room,

31
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,210
they questioned the three people who were
inside the house when the murder occurred.

32
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,130
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

33
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,760
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Behind the scenes of the case,
the Akai family's secrets intertwine!

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,970
Always determining the one truth

36
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,850
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

37
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,470
his name is Detective Conan!

38
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,620
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden
(Part Two)

39
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,620
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden
(Part Two)
"The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden, Part Two!"

40
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,980
The Antique Tray Can't Be Hidden
(Part Two)

41
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,020
Is there nobody else in this house?

42
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,650
Normally the son and his wife live here,

43
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,380
but they're currently on vacation.

44
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,320
Huh.

45
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,660
I see.

46
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,210
In other words, excluding the
three of us in the entryway,

47
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,760
at the time of the murder,
the people in this house were

48
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,170
Tojima Motoyuki-san who got lost
on his way back from the bathroom,

49
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,630
Tojima Motoyuki-san who got lost
on his way back from the bathroom,
Tojima Motoyuki (41)
Securities Company Employee

50
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:38,970
Tojima Motoyuki-san who got lost
on his way back from the bathroom,

51
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,420
Chono Kinji-san who was reading
books on antiques in the study,

52
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,790
Chono Kinji-san who was reading
books on antiques in the study,
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President

53
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:43,840
Chono Kinji (74)
Former Real Estate Company President

54
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,140
and Sakamaki Suzue-san who was
alone in this reception room.

55
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,600
and Sakamaki Suzue-san who was
alone in this reception room.
Sakamaki Suzue (46)
Art Museum Director

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,350
and Sakamaki Suzue-san who was
alone in this reception room.

57
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,810
The three of you could move
freely throughout the house.

58
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,860
Any one of you could've stabbed
Nishitsu-san to death with a spear.

59
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,190
We'll know immediately who the culprit is.

60
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,950
After all, I'm sure they put the real
black lacquer tray inside their own box.

61
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,000
You're right.

62
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,360
Once an appraiser examines the
trays inside those three boxes,

63
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,390
it'll be clear as day who the culprit is.

64
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,610
You really are grown up, aren't you?

65
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,810
"Clear as day" is an expression used to describe
something very easy to see or understand.

66
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,260
It's extremely unusual for a first-year
grade school student to use that expression.

67
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,150
How old are you actually?

68
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,900
You took the same thing
as Conan-kun, didn't you?

69
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,600
Is it that strange?

70
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,410
What?

71
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,380
In this day and age, even grade school
students walk around with smartphones.

72
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,170
They can immediately look up any terms
they see or hear on TV or in books.

73
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,650
On top of that, the professor
often uses complicated language.

74
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,350
It wouldn't be that odd if his roommate
picked up some of his language.

75
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,930
I suppose not.

76
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,330
In that case, get another
appraiser to come here.

77
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,180
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,270
Hey, wait.

79
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,660
Did the culprit really put the
real tray inside their own box?

80
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,200
Maybe they simply put it
back inside the empty box.

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,450
Y-Yes, that's right, in order to make it seem
like the culprit was after the black lacquer tray.

82
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,210
Maybe this was the work of some other
person who held a grudge against him.

83
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:46,210
Yeah. For example, maybe the tray they
brought received harsh criticism.

84
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:53,470
In any case, I won't stand for being named the
culprit just because the real tray is in my box.

85
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,300
Either way, we can't not call an appraiser.

86
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:06,370
Getting a noted appraiser to come
here would probably take some time.

87
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,030
Hey, Professor.

88
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:14,020
Didn't you say Nishitsu-san said the
tray in front of him was the real tray?

89
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,620
Y-Yeah...

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,340
He touched the tray with his bloody...

91
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,750
That's right.

92
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,530
Nishitsu-san's bloody fingerprints
are on the back of the real tray.

93
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,750
Really?

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,260
Yes, when I found Nishitsu-san
and ran to his side...

95
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,380
Who did this to you?

96
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Th-This... This is the real tray...

97
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,070
You should be able to identify the culprit
if you turn over those three trays.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,640
In that case, everyone, so nobody
tries to make excuses later,

99
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,350
could you all sit behind your own box?

100
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:06,250
Let's begin by checking the back of
the tray inside Tojima-san's box.

101
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,650
Naturally, whoever owns the bloody
tray will become our prime suspect.

102
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,500
There's blood on this.

103
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,390
What?

104
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,850
I see. So you're the culprit.

105
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,270
N-No! It wasn't me!

106
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,270
Now, now. Just to be sure,
let's look at the other two trays.

107
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,650
Whoa, whoa.

108
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,190
There's blood on the
backs of all three trays.

109
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,080
What's going on here?

110
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,490
Well, uh...

111
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,960
The culprit probably noticed the
blood on the back of the tray,

112
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,380
and used quick thinking to put the same
bloody mark on the other two trays.

113
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,720
So we wouldn't know which
one is the real tray.

114
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,110
Which means we'll have to
call an appraiser after all.

115
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,220
Agasa-san, is there anything else that
would help us identify the real tray?

116
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,100
I'm not so sure.

117
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,500
Come to think of it, when I flipped
the bloody tray over sideways,

118
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,280
the crane's beak was right at
the same spot as the blood.

119
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:23,940
If you turn them over sideways, the beak's
position will tell us which one is the real tray.

120
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,840
To make things clearer, let's turn
the trays so the blood is at the top.

121
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,350
When we turn them over sideways, whichever
tray's crane's beak is pointing straight up is...

122
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,340
None of the beaks are pointing straight up.

123
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,350
That's impossible.

124
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,720
Come on.

125
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,480
Didn't you say this would
identify the culprit?

126
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,990
This is nonsense.

127
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,980
Identify?

128
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,720
Come to think of it, how did you identify me?

129
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,440
You spoke to me while I was watching the
professor's house from behind the gate.

130
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,540
Hey, you.

131
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,000
If you're interested in someone
inside, why don't you come with me?

132
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,380
And you answered Conan-kun's
question in this way...

133
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,160
More importantly, did you
see anyone at the gate?

134
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,890
Yes, I did.

135
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,040
There was a girl wearing a motorcycle helmet.

136
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,520
How did you know I was a girl?

137
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,030
Normally you'd assume someone dressed like this
wearing a motorcycle helmet would be a man.

138
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,030
What about me seemed feminine to you?

139
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:50,290
You don't actually know who I am, do you?

140
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,470
How did you know I was a woman?

141
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,970
It was your bottom.

142
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,770
What?

143
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,580
My b-bot...?

144
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,730
Yes, your uniquely feminine
hips make it quite obvious.

145
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,780
I didn't think it was
necessary to say out loud.

146
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,740
I see.

147
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,880
My butt, huh?

148
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,950
Isn't Sera your younger sister?

149
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,050
You know everything, don't you?

150
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,340
Then why don't you tell her?

151
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,010
Because I want to keep my sister
out of this as much as possible.

152
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:54,180
Anyway, I can't believe it's been 17 years.

153
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,900
Why?

154
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,110
Why do I have to go to Japan?

155
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,240
I already have so many friends in England!

156
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,250
Shukichi, have you forgotten what
Father told us in his message?

157
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:10,630
Akai Shuichi (15)

158
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,000
Akai Shuichi (15)
We're going to hide the fact that
we're English and live in Japan.

159
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,630
We're going to hide the fact that
we're English and live in Japan.

160
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,020
Akai Shukichi (11)

161
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,380
Akai Shukichi (11)
But I didn't get to say
goodbye to my friends.

162
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,310
But I didn't get to say
goodbye to my friends.

163
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,390
Shukichi.

164
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,410
Do you remember Father's friend Haneda-san?

165
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,220
Yeah.

166
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,350
Remember his son Koji?

167
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,640
Oh, yeah. The guy who's
good at that shogi game.

168
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:33,990
Akai Mary (36)

169
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,190
Akai Mary (36)
Apparently Koji-san died a mysterious
death in the United States.

170
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,470
Apparently Koji-san died a mysterious
death in the United States.

171
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,650
Father traveled there because Haneda-san
asked him to uncover the truth.

172
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,490
He discovered a vile
organization is involved,

173
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,620
so we're seeking refuge
in Japan, just to be safe.

174
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,670
It's all right, though.
He's a very strong person.

175
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,920
He'll round up those evil people
and return to us right away.

176
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,180
He has two adorable sons
waiting for him, and besides,

177
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm sure he'll want to meet her, too.

178
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,930
Her, who?

179
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,980
Your younger sister.

180
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,440
Come on, Ai-chan.

181
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,910
What are you talking about?

182
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,950
She's grown so much.

183
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,960
I see. I understand.

184
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,450
Bye.

185
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,780
Well? Were you able to get an appraiser?

186
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,380
Apparently they can't come until tomorrow.

187
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,390
What? You mean every appraiser in Tokyo?

188
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,750
Yes.

189
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,810
All the noted appraisers are either on
business trips to other prefectures or overseas,

190
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,440
or else they're not feeling well.

191
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,520
Whoa, whoa. Surely you don't mean...

192
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,940
You don't expect us to stay
here until tomorrow, do you?

193
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,150
Uh, well...

194
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,920
Give me a break.

195
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm supposed to meet a buyer
for this tray tonight.

196
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,640
They're visiting from overseas.

197
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,540
If I miss tonight, I don't know
when I'll be able to see them next.

198
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,340
I'm in the same boat.

199
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,910
Tonight is the 40th anniversary party
for the real estate company I founded.

200
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:31,480
How could I attend such a monumental
event without this tray?

201
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,040
My speech includes an anecdote about the
difficult time I had acquiring this.

202
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,530
And I need to leave in three hours.

203
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:47,900
I hired a cameraman and studio to shoot
photos for the museum's reopening pamphlet.

204
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:54,470
Naturally, the photos will be of this tray, so
I'll be taking mine with me when the time comes.

205
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,950
No, wait.

206
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,810
That tray is evidence in a murder case.

207
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,920
The police will be holding
on to it for a while.

208
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,590
And the other trays, too.

209
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,940
You can't be serious. What
about tonight's party?

210
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,220
What about my buyer?

211
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,390
Please calm down.

212
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,030
We can't allow a murderer to walk free.

213
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,890
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

214
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,540
Inspector Megure.

215
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,800
What is it?

216
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,400
Forensics found this next to the body.

217
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,410
It seems to be a hearing aid.

218
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,070
A hearing aid?

219
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,130
Ah, that's the "Deaf Angel" I invented.

220
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,710
"Deaf?"

221
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,210
It's a wireless hearing aid the
late Nishitsu-san bought from me.

222
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:55,120
It turns the voices and sounds around you
into the gentle whispers of an angel.

223
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,770
Which means it probably fell out of his
ear when the culprit struck the victim.

224
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,710
Do you recognize this?

225
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,110
Yes.

226
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,020
I did notice that he had
something in his ear.

227
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,250
I didn't realize it was a hearing aid.

228
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,490
He spoke with us just fine.

229
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,400
Of course he did. My inventions work great.

230
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,170
Excuse me, Agasa-san. Could I talk to you?

231
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,270
What is it?

232
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:36,120
The victim's phone received a message from
you about 20 minutes before the murder.

233
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,010
Does that sound familiar?

234
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,810
Yes, I sent him a message
telling him we were on our way.

235
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,810
For some reason it looks like
that message was never opened.

236
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,130
The phone was set to play
notification sounds, though.

237
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,240
I don't know what to tell you.

238
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,700
It was probably already
malfunctioning by then.

239
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,220
It's what you'd expect from a "Deaf Angel."

240
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,950
What a fitting name for the device.

241
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,290
I can't hear you.

242
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,880
Fitting?

243
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,840
If you ask me, your behavior
is hardly fitting for a child.

244
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,970
Come on, Ai-chan. Tell me about the drug.

245
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,940
You turn back into an adult
periodically like Conan-kun, right?

246
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,100
If you've got it, could
you share some with me?

247
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,110
That drug that restores the flow of time.

248
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,870
"Restore the flow of time?"
What do you mean by that?

249
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,870
What?

250
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,620
"Restore" implies there's something
wrong with the current situation.

251
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,130
Or perhaps there's something wrong
with someone other than you.

252
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,050
It's none of your business!

253
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,840
No way. He vanished?

254
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:55,630
Huh?

255
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,390
That was a 50-50.

256
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,270
It's my fault for touching a nerve, but
you're also at fault for suddenly kicking me.

257
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,440
Perhaps my advice is unwelcome,

258
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:21,110
but if you want to be more feminine,
perhaps you should behave less violently.

259
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,160
I'll be fine. I don't have to do
anything to become more feminine.

260
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,920
My mom's chest used to be huge.

261
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,420
"Used to be?"

262
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,660
Does that mean your mother passed away?

263
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,930
No, it's not like that, but...

264
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,350
But?

265
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,770
Seriously, it's none of your business.

266
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,320
I see. Akai-san wants to confirm
his mother's well-being.

267
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:11,950
Which means that middle-school-aged
girl is Sera and Akai-san's mother.

268
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:18,300
She's that Mary woman I met
at the beach a long time ago.

269
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,180
Since Sera keeps asking about
the drug, then as I thought,

270
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:30,060
that must mean she was shrunk after
being forced to take APTX 4869, too.

271
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,940
But who is she? Why did she take the drug?

272
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,440
All I know is that she has
exceptional deductive skills,

273
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,820
Sleep is a biological function

274
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,050
of the periodically repeated
loss of consciousness.

275
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,670
In other words, it's practically impossible
for a person to speak while sleeping.

276
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,940
In other words, it's practically impossible
for a person to speak while sleeping.
The old man's voice...

277
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,460
In other words, it's practically impossible
for a person to speak while sleeping.

278
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,970
A smartphone behind his neck?

279
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,660
A smartphone behind his neck?
Naturally, sleep talking is an exception.

280
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,950
Naturally, sleep talking is an exception.

281
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,590
Naturally, sleep talking is an exception.
Where did that come from?

282
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,460
Where did that come from?

283
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,000
The words I'm speaking now must sound like

284
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,610
nonsensical sleep talking to you.

285
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,210
But since they are the words of the
detective who has solved this ridiculous case,

286
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,980
I ask that you listen.

287
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,480
is an excellent martial artist,

288
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
What's it doing there?

289
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,650
I should take one of under the balcony, too.

290
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,660
I-Is he dead?

291
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,620
No, they struck his vitals
and knocked him unconscious

292
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,660
during the seconds it
took for me to run here.

293
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,170
They're as quick as a secret service agent.

294
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,120
It must've been the sister out of territory.

295
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,830
and is English.

296
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,650
After all, you're the apprentice
of my country's greatest detective.

297
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,000
Y-Your country?

298
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,780
You're English?

299
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,910
Yeah, although I'm an American now.

300
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,410
England?

301
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:25,050
No way! Does "sister out of
territory" actually mean...?

302
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,220
Hey, you.

303
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,690
Making us stay here won't get you anywhere.

304
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,700
B-But...

305
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,860
I'm leaving.

306
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,610
You can't leave.

307
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,980
Judging by the situation,

308
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:53,870
it's likely that one of you struck Nishitsu-san
the appraiser on the head with a spear,

309
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,120
and used that same spear to stab
him in the back and kill him.

310
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,000
We'd like you to stay a little longer.

311
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,010
How much longer?

312
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,760
How are you going to find the culprit when
none of the appraisers can make it here?

313
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,900
We're currently reaching out to
appraisers from other prefectures.

314
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,270
If you could wait just a little longer...
