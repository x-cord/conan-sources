1
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:04,224
"Poirot"

2
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,424
Thank you for waiting.

3
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:19,724
Your ham sandwich.

4
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:43,524
Hey.

5
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:47,124
That customer's been bothering you for a while, right?

6
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:48,124
What?

7
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:52,724
-Really? -Yeah, yep...

8
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:55,024
Dad, you're eating breakfast

9
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:56,524
while reading the horse race newspaper

10
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,024
and yet it's amazing you noticed.

11
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,624
Well, I'm a famed detective after all, you see!

12
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:05,324
From the looks of it, that man's not an officer worker, right?

13
00:01:05,324 --> 00:01:09,824
Yet he's here at this time at this coffee shop before going to work.

14
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:11,824
Is that why he concerns you?

15
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:15,024
There are customers like him.

16
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:17,824
We're not much different either.

17
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,324
He's not ordering the morning set

18
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:22,524
that most customers here are ordering at this time

19
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:25,324
but is ordering sandwich

20
00:01:25,324 --> 00:01:27,424
without even looking at the menu too.

21
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:30,324
Does that mean he's a regular here?

22
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:34,824
But, he's not talking to Amuro or Azusa

23
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:38,724
and he's been watching the counter this whole time.

24
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,624
It's simple.

25
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:44,524
He's probably got his eyes on Azusa.

26
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:47,524
Oh, I see. You're a detective after all.

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,524
I can do something like this hands down!

28
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:52,024
I mean I got my hands on breakfast right now!

29
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:55,224
No, that man's not looking at Azusa,

30
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:57,824
but rather he's been eyeing Amuro all the way.

31
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:00,624
Why?

32
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:04,724
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

33
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,024
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

34
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:08,924
Toru Amuro who is working at Poirot.

35
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:11,224
An unexpected person approaches him.

36
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:12,824
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:14,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:17,024
His name is Detective Conan!

39
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:07,588
"Darkness Creeps Upon Amuro"

40
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:11,888
What? Playing games at Doc's house again?

41
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:14,188
I mean that's all we ever do.

42
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:16,088
Then, what else do you want to do?

43
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,188
You all have homework to do today, don't you?

44
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:19,988
So do your homework.

45
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,288
Just let's do our homework like Haibara suggested.

46
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:26,188
No, let's play games.

47
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:28,888
Conan?

48
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:32,288
He was at Poirot in the morning too.

49
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:36,688
It could be he lives nearby or works nearby, right?

50
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:38,888
Why is he so interested in that man?

51
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:41,588
He gets interested in anything and everything.

52
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:46,788
But whenever Conan is interested in something, a case always pops up.

53
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,488
Thank you very much.

54
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,988
Oh, he came out.

55
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:01,788
If he bothers you so much, let's follow him.

56
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:03,588
Good idea!

57
00:05:03,588 --> 00:05:06,788
It sounds more interesting than playing games at Doc's house.

58
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:09,788
Yep. It's more like the youth detective squad.

59
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:11,488
Okay. Let's go!

60
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:12,488
Okay.

61
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:16,188
Don't get noticed.

62
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:18,388
Hey, you guys.

63
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,488
Conan, Ai, come on hurry.

64
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,888
I pass.

65
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,788
I think you guys should get going home

66
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:25,788
and do your homework too.

67
00:05:27,488 --> 00:05:30,288
It's your fault, so make sure you take responsibility

68
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,388
and see to it that they go home!

69
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:39,188
What? Conan?

70
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,188
Are you alone?

71
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:41,688
Oh, yep.

72
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:45,688
You mean the customer who just left?

73
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,888
I don't know his name

74
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,788
but now that you mentioned it, he comes a lot recently.

75
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:53,188
What does he do?

76
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,588
Beats me...

77
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,788
He's gone! He vanished.

78
00:06:31,788 --> 00:06:34,488
I'm sure he went into one of the shops.

79
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:37,988
Okay, let's split up and check out all the shops!

80
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,288
Aye!

81
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:43,388
He was watching me?

82
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:46,088
Yes, that's how it looked to me.

83
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:49,188
I guess so. It looked the same to me too.

84
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,888
He followed me too the other day.

85
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:54,088
Followed you? When?

86
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,688
Three days ago, I think it was...

87
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:59,688
when I went out shopping to a nearby supermarket?

88
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:01,088
And?

89
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,288
And, what?

90
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,788
Are you letting him be?

91
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:08,188
Well, it's not like he did anything.

92
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,288
From the Black Organization, maybe...

93
00:07:11,888 --> 00:07:13,388
That's not a possibility?

94
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,688
Nope, no way.

95
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,388
But it's not like

96
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:19,788
you know all of the men in black either, right, Amuro?

97
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:21,088
I guess not...

98
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:24,888
but that man didn't seem to be one of them.

99
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:31,588
Then, could he be a security police just like you?

100
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,688
You really like to scrutinize, don't you?

101
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:46,288
Hey, how was it?

102
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:48,388
No good, he isn't around.

103
00:07:49,188 --> 00:07:51,788
We checked all the shops, right?

104
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:54,988
Yes, but he's nowhere.

105
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:58,388
I think he vanished after all!

106
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:03,788
No joke.

107
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:06,088
He vanished in the shopping arcade!

108
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,088
Yes, I'm sure he did.

109
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:09,788
I'm sure he's into something.

110
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:13,088
Oh, Amuro.

111
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:20,588
What's up, Haibara?

112
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:23,988
I just remembered something, so I'm going home.

113
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,688
Ai.

114
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,488
It's all your fault, Genta.

115
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:30,988
Why?

116
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,288
It's him.

117
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:47,988
What does this mean?

118
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:51,888
Yes. I wonder why he's following Amuro around?

119
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:54,488
He's starting to look more and more suspicious.

120
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,188
Watch out.

121
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,488
It's a dead end up ahead.

122
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,788
Can I help you?

123
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,788
Not really...

124
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,688
I have business up ahead.

125
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:36,088
It's a dead end up ahead.

126
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,488
You're a customer of Poirot who's been coming around

127
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:40,088
a lot recently, right?

128
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:44,088
Why are you following me around?

129
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:12,688
-Yes. -Amuro! Emergency!

130
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,088
Yes?

131
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:16,788
Will you go get ice cream?

132
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:19,788
Ice cream?

133
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:24,388
The manager forgot to buy it, but I took an order for cream soda!

134
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,188
Please buy it as soon as possible!

135
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,788
I'm leaving him up to you then, Mr. Great Detective.

136
00:10:50,188 --> 00:10:51,688
He vanished again.

137
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:53,988
The same shopping arcade as yesterday.

138
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,388
Let's look through all the shops again!

139
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,588
Okay!

140
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:11,688
Maybe he's...

141
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,088
Thank you for waiting.

142
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:15,688
Here's your ham sandwich.

143
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:19,188
He's not ordering the morning set

144
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:21,188
that most customers here are ordering at this time

145
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:23,788
but is ordering sandwich...

146
00:11:40,888 --> 00:11:44,288
He was at Poirot this morning too.

147
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:48,588
It could be that he lives nearby or works nearby, right?

148
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:51,588
He was watching me?

149
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,288
Yep, that's how it looked to me.

150
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:57,488
I guess so. It looked the same to me too.

151
00:11:57,488 --> 00:12:00,088
He followed me too the other day.

152
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:01,888
Followed you? When?

153
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,888
Three days ago, I think it was...

154
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:08,088
when I went out shopping to a nearby supermarket?

155
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:10,688
Conan!

156
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:14,988
No good! He's not in any shop after all.

157
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:16,288
Same here.

158
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:18,588
I wonder about this shop?

159
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:21,688
Nope! He's not here either.

160
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,988
So he disappeared again!

161
00:12:23,988 --> 00:12:26,188
No.

162
00:12:26,188 --> 00:12:28,388
I'm sure he'll appear soon.

163
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:30,688
Huh, appear soon?

164
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:34,988
Hey, Conan.

165
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,388
He sure is late.

166
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,588
Maybe...

167
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,288
What?

168
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:43,988
Amuro found out that the man was following him, right?

169
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,588
Yes. So?

170
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,088
I see!

171
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:51,488
Hey, Conan!

172
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,455
Amuro!

173
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:16,955
Conan.

174
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:21,255
Sir, you're...

175
00:13:22,555 --> 00:13:24,255
You're a baker, aren't you?

176
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:25,255
What?

177
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:27,155
A baker?

178
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:33,755
You ate sandwiches here in the morning and at sundown, right, sir?

179
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:37,355
Yes, the sandwich that Amuro made.

180
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:40,255
He always keeps his fingernails clean.

181
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:41,955
True.

182
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:47,855
Moreover, you have a characteristic mark on your forehead.

183
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:51,555
What is it? That mark on your forehead.

184
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:52,855
A cap?

185
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:55,255
Oh, it's the mark of rubber.

186
00:13:55,255 --> 00:13:58,255
Right, the mark made from a cap that can be tightened by rubber.

187
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:05,055
A cap worn by bakers and noodle makers who handle flour goods

188
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,355
and stay inside kitchen rather than

189
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:09,555
take care of the customers in the shop.

190
00:14:09,555 --> 00:14:12,255
Come to think of it, that shopping arcade...

191
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:15,655
No good! He's not in any of the shops.

192
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,855
Nor is he here.

193
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,755
How about this shop?

194
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:22,355
There was a bakery inside.

195
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:26,255
If he's the type of baker who doesn't interact with customers,

196
00:14:26,255 --> 00:14:29,455
he most likely makes bread early every morning

197
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:33,055
and makes more, after noon, to make up for whatever is lacking.

198
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:37,255
From the looks of it, that man's not an officer worker, right?

199
00:14:37,255 --> 00:14:41,855
Yet he's here at this time at this coffee shop before going to work.

200
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:43,855
Is that why he concerns you?

201
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:47,155
There are customers like him.

202
00:14:47,155 --> 00:14:50,055
In other words, your job makes you free most often

203
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,355
in the morning and at sundown, right?

204
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:56,555
I see! You didn't vanish, but went into the bakery!

205
00:14:56,555 --> 00:14:59,455
So you weren't a customer but someone who worked at the shop!

206
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:02,355
So, most naturally if we waited in front of that bakery for a while,

207
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:05,355
you would get changed and appear.

208
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,355
I thought so and waited but...

209
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:10,855
no matter how long we waited a while ago, you never showed up.

210
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:13,555
Hey, Conan!

211
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:15,955
He sure is late.

212
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:17,455
Maybe...

213
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:18,755
What?

214
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:22,555
Amuro found out that the man was following him, right?

215
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,255
And... so?

216
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:27,855
So, I thought that since Amuro found out about you,

217
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:30,755
you would act on last resort.

218
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,555
Act on last resort?

219
00:15:34,555 --> 00:15:37,255
You decided to ask him directly, right?

220
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,655
About how to make sandwich from Amuro.

221
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:43,655
What?

222
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:45,155
Is that right?

223
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:49,655
I recently heard that the sandwiches here are cheap and good so...

224
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,455
I came to try some.

225
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,255
I was shocked...

226
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,755
by how delicious they were!

227
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:04,055
The ham sandwich in particular is superb.

228
00:16:06,355 --> 00:16:09,655
So, I got to thinking I wanted to make sandwiches

229
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,355
that tasted just as good.

230
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,755
But no matter how much I watched how you made it,

231
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,455
I couldn't figure it out.

232
00:16:23,155 --> 00:16:25,455
That's why I followed you.

233
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,055
I checked out

234
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:32,855
the bread, ham, lettuce and mayonnaise that you bought.

235
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:38,655
But there was nothing special about anything.

236
00:16:39,355 --> 00:16:41,455
I tried to make it the same way,

237
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:44,355
but it wouldn't come out the same no matter how I tried.

238
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:47,555
How do you make sandwiches as delicious as those you make?

239
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:52,255
That's all I could think of everyday.

240
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:55,655
I'm on the verge of going nuts already.

241
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:56,755
Just how?

242
00:16:56,755 --> 00:17:00,655
Just how do you make sandwiches as delicious as yours?

243
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:10,655
Sir, that's Amuro's business secret.

244
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:14,055
I'm sure he won't tell you how he...

245
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:17,955
I know... I know but...

246
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,855
It's okay with me to tell you how.

247
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,855
Oh, really?

248
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:30,055
Cheap ham will do

249
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:33,655
but please choose something with as less fat as possible.

250
00:17:33,655 --> 00:17:36,855
You spread olive oil on it.

251
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:41,255
Oh, I see! The rich taste of that ham was the olive oil!

252
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:44,455
Yes, but that's not all.

253
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:47,355
The mayonnaise is ordinary too but...

254
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:52,655
Huh, miso?

255
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,155
Oh, that's why miso was in the refrigerator.

256
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:59,055
Only a really small amount for a subtle taste will do.

257
00:18:01,555 --> 00:18:04,355
You mean putting miso inside mayonnaise makes it taste better?

258
00:18:04,355 --> 00:18:08,055
Olive oil and miso really make a great match.

259
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:10,555
I see. So, that sauce

260
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:13,655
brings out the flavor of the ham with olive oil on it.

261
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:19,155
And, this is regular hot water, this is also ordinary lettuce.

262
00:18:23,555 --> 00:18:26,255
When eating sandwich and the contents are cold,

263
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:27,655
don't you feel that you can taste only the cold

264
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:31,555
and not get too much of a taste of it?

265
00:18:31,555 --> 00:18:33,455
-Yes. -True.

266
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:37,255
I never thought of something like that when eating.

267
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:40,355
Doing this gets rid of such worry.

268
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:42,755
But won't it get all watery?

269
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,755
No need to worry about that either.

270
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:48,655
No...

271
00:18:48,655 --> 00:18:50,655
The point is to use water that is only as hot as the water

272
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:52,455
you take a bath in.

273
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:56,155
Moreover, by doing this, the lettuce stays crisp for a while

274
00:18:56,155 --> 00:18:59,055
even after you put it in the sandwich.

275
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:03,355
Amuro, who on earth are you?

276
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,655
Oh, and though the bread is the main material,

277
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:07,855
"Price cut" -this type of bread will do.

278
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,855
What?

279
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:10,655
That's the kind you were using?

280
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:13,355
This way, I can get it at half price.

281
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:16,155
I guess so, but...

282
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,655
But, the taste...

283
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:21,455
Rather, bread that's a bit hard is better.

284
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,155
What? Why?

285
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:24,955
The secret is this.

286
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,655
A steamer?

287
00:19:30,355 --> 00:19:32,655
Please try touching the bread that is inside.

288
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:38,155
Fantastic! It's soft and fluffy!

289
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:41,455
Just before making the sandwich, you steam it a bit.

290
00:19:41,455 --> 00:19:45,355
That way, the bread absorbs as much moisture as it has hardened.

291
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,455
I see.

292
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:49,655
That's why the bread was warm even though it wasn't toasted.

293
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,055
Moreover, you can keep the price down.

294
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:55,355
Amuro, you were taking your job

295
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:57,755
at this coffee shop seriously too, weren't you?

296
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,255
Miso mayonnaise sauce, eh.

297
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,855
But the soft fluffiness you get by doing all this

298
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,155
doesn't keep for long.

299
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:11,555
That's why it's good to eat at the shop,

300
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:14,555
but not good for take-out.

301
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:16,555
I'm a baker.

302
00:20:16,555 --> 00:20:19,455
I can improvise with bread.

303
00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:24,155
Please let me sell your sandwich at my shop!

304
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:25,655
What?

305
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,855
But, sir... I don't think...

306
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,055
Okay.

307
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,455
You mean... it's okay?

308
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:36,055
You fell in love with my ham sandwich.

309
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:38,655
I'd really like someone like you to sell my sandwiches.

310
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:45,355
"Poirot"

311
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:15,555
They're ready. Please try them.

312
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,655
Dig in.

313
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:20,855
-Delicious! -Super soft and fluffy!

314
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,955
This sauce is good.

315
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:27,155
True. The bread is warm and the contents aren't cold either.

316
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:29,355
This is it! This taste!

317
00:22:30,655 --> 00:22:33,555
If the customers want to eat it at the shop, they can do so at Poirot

318
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:36,855
and if they want to take it home, they can buy it at your bakery.

319
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,855
I think it's a great idea.

320
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:41,455
Thank you very much!

321
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:44,155
I'll develop bread that can keep soft a fluffy for a long time

322
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,655
and keep the taste of the sandwich as close to yours as possible,

323
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:49,855
so as to keep up the good reputation that Poirot has made for itself.

324
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:52,255
Yes. Please do that.

325
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:53,755
Well...

326
00:22:53,755 --> 00:22:55,755
If you're going to use the name Poirot,

327
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:58,555
I think we should get permission from the store manager first.

328
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:02,155
Oh, please excuse me.

329
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:03,855
Yes, Amuro here.

330
00:23:03,855 --> 00:23:05,555
Hi, Bourbon.

331
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:09,855
Vermouth.

332
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:15,255
It seems that you've recently been secretly checking.

333
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:18,255
Checking? What?

334
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:26,655
If I knew what, I wouldn't be calling you like this.

335
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,455
I guess not.

336
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:31,155
Well, you'd better watch yourself.

337
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:34,255
It seems that they're keeping a close watch over you recently.

338
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:36,655
Keeping close watch over me...

339
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:37,655
Who is?

340
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:40,155
Gin.

341
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:54,455
What're you looking at?

342
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:57,255
Kyona Shono's blog.

343
00:23:57,255 --> 00:23:59,655
Come to think of it, she was saying that

344
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:03,755
the secret of Saya Kitami was written on her blog or whatnots.

345
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:05,055
Yeah...

346
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:06,955
Please open the door!

347
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,655
Yes, but...

348
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:12,055
Kyona?

349
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,155
Next Conan,

350
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:22,155
"The Actress Blogger's Locked Room Case (Part 1)"

351
00:24:22,598 --> 00:24:24,798
