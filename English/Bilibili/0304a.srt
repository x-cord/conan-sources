1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,440
Happy New Year, everybody!

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
Detective Conan enters the eighth year.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,940
And we have broadcast more than 3,000 times.

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,740
We will do our best in...

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,740
TV's,

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,740
movies,

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,540
magazines and books.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,740
So, be sure to stay with us, folks!

9
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,140
Evacuation of residents in a three-block radius has been completed.

10
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,040
Defusal at Location One is now in progress.

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,840
Defusal at Location One has been completed.

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,140
The helmet is equipped with a duct for cooling

13
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,940
for respiration that alternates as the mist remover for the lens.

14
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,240
And we are heading to Location Two with Officer Matsuda with us.

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,740
To protect against the hot air of explosion,

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,040
the structure of the protective gear does not allow any openings.

17
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,540
The pockets all over the wear have metal protective plates in them.

18
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,240
The gear is so complex that you cannot put it on by yourself.

19
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,740
It weighs 40 kilogra m.

20
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,740
In the protective gear, it's a sauna even in cold winter.

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
You can't keep wearing it for more than five minutes.

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,340
I'd say it's impossible.

23
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,740
All police units, all police units.

24
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,240
Disperse from area 1.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Proceed to secure area 2...

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,240
All units in city limits,

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,440
watch out for suspicious vehicles.

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,140
That is all.

29
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,540
DC unit 80, roger that.

30
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,440
AV unit, roger that.

31
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,340
Keep cool and collected.

32
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,540
No baggage, please. Evacuate quickly and quietly.

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,640
Please be careful not to push others.

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
There is no need to rush.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Evacuation of the residents of this building is completed.

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,440
Roger.

37
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,940
"Kenji Hagiwara" -Well, let's start...

38
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,940
working on it.

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,940
"Jimpei Matsuda, MPD Riot Squad Bomb Disposal Unit"

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,840
You've done a good job, Matsuda.

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,540
How's Hagiwara?

42
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,540
Well, analysis shows a photosensitive trigger.

43
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,140
A white cord from a mercury tilt switch.

44
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,240
From the LCD panel...

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,440
Matsuda. What's up?

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,240
Hagiwara! What's taking you so long?

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,340
Go, tear it apart fast.

48
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,240
You're too loud, man.

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,440
You're making my fingers shake.

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,140
Have you finished already?

51
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,440
Yeah.

52
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,840
I opened it and found out it's rather simple clockwork.

53
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,040
It's so simple.

54
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,140
Three minutes was long enough?

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,040
How about yours?

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Takes more than 3 minutes for sure.

57
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,340
It looks simple, but there're so many traps around it.

58
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,740
I suppose this is the real one.

59
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,340
Right.

60
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,140
By the way, you're in protective gear, aren't you?

61
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,240
In that hot torturing thing? No way.

62
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,140
Moron! You want to get killed, man?

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,240
Well, you can get the guy for me.

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,740
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

65
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,840
Can't take a joke?

66
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,340
I'm not a klutz.

67
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,140
Anyway, finish ASAP and get on back here.

68
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,040
I'll buy you a drink tonight.

69
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,540
Lucky me!

70
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,140
You lured me into full throttle.

71
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm gonna work at full speed.

72
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,040
What's that?

73
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,640
What's up, Hagiwara?

74
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,540
Run, everybody!

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,040
Get out of here!

76
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,540
The timer started counting again!

77
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,940
Hagiwara?

78
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,240
Hey! Hagiwara!

79
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,840
Hagiwara...

80
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,440
Hagiwara!

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,640
Why? How did you find out?

82
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,940
I asked that boy wearing glasses.

83
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,040
So, that's why.

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,840
By the way, Shinichi,

85
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,340
what're you going to do about the all-country sim-test?

86
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,640
All-country sim-test?

87
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,740
You can't make it, can you?

88
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,940
I'll bet you're going to say you're tied up with a new case or something.

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,340
Wait! What's this?

90
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,940
"I have stolen your sleeping face." -How did you do that?

91
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,440
Gotcha!

92
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,140
Gosh.

93
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,689
Dad, Conan!

94
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:24,889
Don't be late. Breakfast is ready!

95
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,489
Dad.

96
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:30,289
What's all the commotion about from so early in the morning?

97
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,089
It's noon already.

98
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,089
I'm going to prepare for tomorrow test.

99
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,189
Sonoko and I are going to work on it today.

100
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,289
Will you finish up quickly?

101
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,889
That's your problem, not mine.

102
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,789
You're taking your report to a client, aren't you?

103
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:47,489
And, Conan, you promised Ayumi and the others

104
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:50,389
that you'll go to Haido Shopping Mall with them.

105
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,189
Yeah.

106
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:55,589
Haido Shopping Mall?

107
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:59,289
Oh, the mall with that huge Ferris Wheel.

108
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,689
Yeah.

109
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:05,389
January 6th, Monday.

110
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:08,389
The Winter holidays were almost over.

111
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:10,289
That first day started very peacefully

112
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:12,489
but the following two days were turned out to be a nightmare.

113
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:19,789
"Unsettled Metropolitan Police Department, 12 million hostages"

114
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,589
Sato, what do you think of this disguise of mine?

115
00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:33,889
It's cool, isn't it?

116
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:36,689
Sato?

117
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,389
What's the matter with you? Anything wrong?

118
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,689
Sato?

119
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,989
Miwako?

120
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,889
Hey, Miwako.

121
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:54,489
Miwako!

122
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,389
Yumi.

123
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:02,389
What's the matter with you? In a coma or something?

124
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,789
I'm all right.

125
00:10:03,789 --> 00:10:05,589
Just a little tired, I guess.

126
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,489
I'm going out for a while.

127
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:13,289
I thought you said you were going to do paperwork all day today.

128
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:15,089
I just remembered something. I have to go out, and take a look.

129
00:10:16,989 --> 00:10:19,689
Don't forget the karaoke tonight.

130
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:22,289
Oh, yeah. What time was it?

131
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,889
Nine o'clock.

132
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,589
I sent mail to your cell. You can look at it.

133
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:27,889
Huh?

134
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,789
Well...

135
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:33,889
Sorry. I've deleted it already.

136
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,789
Gosh. Stop deleting mails right after you finish reading them.

137
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:38,089
That's one of your bad habits.

138
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,289
If I don't delete them, I'll soon get a mailbox full of junk mails

139
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,489
and lose track of important mails.

140
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:49,889
So, you mean mine is not important.

141
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,489
That's not what I meant.

142
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,689
You better not.

143
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,789
Okay. Nine o'clock.

144
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,189
Don't be late!

145
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,589
Roger and out.

146
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,989
Mail that you can't delete...

147
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,089
"Haido Shopping Mall"

148
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,889
It's so high!

149
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:20,889
Really. Great!

150
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,789
This Ferris Wheel is 125 meter high.

151
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:26,889
It's the highest in Japan.

152
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,689
It takes 18 minutes to make one round.

153
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,089
I could make six cups of ramen!

154
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:36,389
The diameter of the circle is 105 meters

155
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:39,389
and it takes 18 minutes to go once around.

156
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,189
That means the speed of this car

157
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:44,489
is about 30 centimeters per second.

158
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:48,989
Come on. Can't you think of anything else?

159
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:54,289
Oh? Such as the power necessary to make one round?

160
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:56,789
Cut it out.

161
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:09,389
It's been three years now.

162
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:15,789
Everybody. Let me introduce...

163
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,989
Mr. Jimpei Matsuda.

164
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:21,389
He will start working with us as of today

165
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:23,689
in the Criminal Investigation Section.

166
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:27,289
He has been in the Security Department, Special Task Force,

167
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,189
and I'd say that he is a bit of a stranger here.

168
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:31,789
We can do without that kind of introduction, Inspector.

169
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:35,189
I'm not exactly a new kid from the country.

170
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,089
And I don't think this show and tell about me

171
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,489
would be of any use to anybody.

172
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:42,289
I was stationed where I don't want to be

173
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,189
and I'm upset about it.

174
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:49,889
Well then, Officer Sato!

175
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:52,289
You help him out and...

176
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,289
Me, sir?

177
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,489
Don't shy away!

178
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,289
He is here for certain reasons,

179
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:01,189
and they asked me in person to play along.

180
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:03,289
Will you take care of him?

181
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,689
Yes, sir.

182
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:15,089
Hey, what kind of questioning was that supposed to be?

183
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:17,289
Questioning people like a mobster like that,

184
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:19,589
nobody will answer you.

185
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:22,989
Gosh. You have been with us for 6 days now.

186
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:26,589
Why don't you listen to me and do as I say?

187
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,889
Oh, you got mail?

188
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,489
You're pretty fast.

189
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:30,989
Yeah.

190
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:34,189
I just happen to be clever with my fingers.

191
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,589
Are you mailing your girlfriend?

192
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,789
No. I'm sending my best friend mail,

193
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:43,589
though I know he's not going to write back to me

194
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,389
because he blew up 4 years ago.

195
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:47,689
What?

196
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,789
Pass? Pass what? Are you crazy?

197
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:58,689
I have to wait here today.

198
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:00,389
I'm sure you guys can bring the old suspect

199
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:03,889
from the local police up here without me.

200
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,489
Now, you listen to me.

201
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,289
I am.

202
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,889
You said you receive it on January 6th every year. Today is the day.

203
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:16,289
Yes. Every year for three years,

204
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:21,189
you mean the fax with just one large number on it, right?

205
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,889
Number 3 was written on it three years ago;

206
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,389
number 2, two years ago,

207
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:25,989
and number 1, a year ago.

208
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,389
I'm sure

209
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,089
it's the time bomb count down.

210
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,889
If the guy's making any moves, today is the day.

211
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:39,589
Inspector! We got one this year, too.

212
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,989
That fax with a number on it, you mean.

213
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:46,189
And? What is the number this time?

214
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:49,489
It's not a number this time.

215
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,889
"I am a knight of the round table.

216
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:56,089
Let the foolish, cunning police know that

217
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:58,089
today at noon, at the 14th hour,

218
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,389
we will bury the head our fellow knight,

219
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:02,289
and in his memory, we will set off fireworks.

220
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,889
If you want to stop it, come to us.

221
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,989
We prepared the 72nd seat for you and we are ready."

222
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,689
What does it mean?

223
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:11,889
I don't know.

224
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,989
Hey! Just where do you think you're going?

225
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,989
Where else?

226
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:25,189
The knight of the round table says there are 72 seats.

227
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:28,389
If it's round and has 72 seats,

228
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:31,589
it's the big Ferris Wheel...

229
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:33,989
in the Haido Shopping Mall.

230
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:35,689
Please, go ahead.

231
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:49,189
Gosh! We are too late.

232
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,689
But it's 30 minutes to noon.

233
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:56,389
Police. What happened?

234
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,789
The control room of the Ferris Wheel suddenly blew up.

235
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:02,089
We can't stop the wheel.

236
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,389
We'd like to get the people out of cars, but...

237
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,689
Where is the 72nd car right now?

238
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:09,289
What?

239
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,889
It's coming down soon.

240
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:19,289
-Matsuda! -Stop right there!

241
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,889
The knight was not waiting for us,

242
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,289
but there's something beneath the seat.

243
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,189
You don't say... a bomb?

244
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,789
Wait, Matsuda!

245
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,789
I'm all right.

246
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:36,189
Let a pro handle work like this.

247
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,489
Wait a second, Matsuda!

248
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,189
What does he mean by pro?

249
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,689
He was at the explosives disposal team until last year,

250
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:49,589
in the Security Task Force.

251
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:53,389
Then the pal he was talking about that he said had passed away...

252
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:58,189
That's probably his pal Hagiwara of the same team,

253
00:16:58,189 --> 00:17:00,589
who was killed on duty while he was disposing a bomb,

254
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:03,989
four years ago, on January 6th.

255
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,030
In that case, there were two bombs in separate places.

256
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,630
Matsuda disposed of one bomb.

257
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,930
But Hagiwara didn't have enough time.

258
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,230
The bomber has not yet been identified.

259
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,830
Matsuda requested transfer to the special team

260
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,330
that is investigating on the bomber.

261
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,730
He kept requesting the transfer, but was turned down.

262
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,230
Since they thought he wanted to do things for his pal,

263
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,630
they chose to transfer him, so he could cool off,

264
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,930
and sent him to our section.

265
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,730
Inspector, what shall we do?

266
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,930
It's six minutes to noon.

267
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,930
It'll take the car 10 more minutes to make a round and return.

268
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,730
We have no choice but to leave it to Matsuda.

269
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,130
What's that?

270
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,530
It stopped.

271
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,830
Put out the fire quick!

272
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,230
We've got trouble.

273
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,230
Hello! Matsuda? Are you all right?

274
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,530
Yeah.

275
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,830
But with the shock just now, and odd switch was turned on.

276
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,930
What?

277
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,530
The mercury lever.

278
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,630
Mercury lever?

279
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,730
A slight shake can make the mercury-drop roll,

280
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,930
and if the drop touches the wire, that's it.

281
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,530
If you don't want to see me blow up,

282
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,330
keep the car still until I dispose of this bomb.

283
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,730
But we have less than five minutes until the blow-up.

284
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,630
Three minutes would be more than enough for this kind of device.

285
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,230
"To the brave police officer..."

286
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,730
"To the brave police officer.

287
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,330
In praise of your courage, we will give you a prize."

288
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,230
Wait, what are you talking about?

289
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,430
"A clue to another bigger firework will be displayed

290
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,730
at 3 seconds before the explosion.

291
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,230
With best wishes."

292
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,830
These are the words displayed on the LCD panel right now.

293
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,730
I suppose if we stop the bomb and turn off the power,

294
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,230
we will never be able to read the clue again.

295
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,230
That is, the guy intended to put someone into this car

296
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,230
and show these words to him.

297
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,730
Then, that blow-up was turned on

298
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,230
because the guy saw you enter the car.

299
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,830
In other words, the bomber is somewhere close by.

300
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,430
It's very difficult to identify him out of this crowd of people.

301
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,030
But I can guess where he set the other bomb.

302
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,530
You can?

303
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,530
The fax says, "the head of our fellow knight."

304
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,830
The knights of the round table were from medieval Europe.

305
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,030
And those medieval knights wore helmets designed with a cross in front.

306
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,730
It's obvious now, isn't it?

307
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,430
A diagram sign of a hospital?

308
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,830
You guessed right.

309
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,130
I'll tell you which hospital it is after I read the clue.

310
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,030
You'll tell me after you read it?

311
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,930
But the clue comes up just 3 seconds before.

312
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,930
Well, the battery is almost out.

313
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,130
Bye now.

314
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,030
Matsuda...

315
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,230
Matsuda...

316
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,330
Allow me for today, will you?

317
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,830
Hell, no. There's only one minute left.

318
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,830
Everybody! Get out of here!

319
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,130
What?

320
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,430
Matsuda!

321
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,930
Don't, Sato! It's too late!

322
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,830
But...

323
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,430
Too dangerous! Back off, please!

324
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,730
But he's still there!

325
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,730
He's inside!

326
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,830
"Sending mail"

327
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,730
Sorry, Hagiwara.

328
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,830
I guess I couldn't keep my word.

329
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,530
What?

330
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,930
What are we going to do? The fax says there's another bomb.

331
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,630
I know there is!

332
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,730
Beika Central Hospital.

333
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,930
What?

334
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,430
Beika Central Hospital.

335
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,530
The other bomb is there!

336
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,430
Dispatch the bomb disposal squad on the double!

337
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,330
He was like a puff of wind.

338
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,530
"Jimpei Matsuda: Beika Central Hospital."

339
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,430
"I kinda liked you."

340
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,630
He vanished in an instant.

341
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,830
All he left behind is the sad sound.

342
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,430
Officer Sato!

343
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,730
Hey.

344
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,930
I didn't know such a thing took place three years ago.

345
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,130
Yes.

346
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,030
If Sato still has lingering memories about the incident,

347
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,130
we don't have a chance.

348
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,330
I suppose so.

349
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:09,530
If you want to be like him, you can die on duty.

350
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,930
Hey! Don't say things like that.

351
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,830
Unlucky things may come true, you know.

352
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,030
Wait! It's Sato.

353
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,830
Takagi and Shiratori.

354
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,430
What's the matter?

355
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,930
Conan and the kids are here too.

356
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,530
I just happened to run into them.

357
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,930
Because I am grateful to them for helping out in the case,

358
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,830
I'm going to get them sweets or something.

359
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,030
-All the cake we can eat. -Yes.

360
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,730
And, what brings you here?

361
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:37,530
We sort of got a squeal.

362
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,430
We looked through inside this restaurant,

363
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,130
but nothing showed up.

364
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,130
It's very likely to be a false lead.

365
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,430
Okay, then, I am going to karaoke with Yumi this evening.

366
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,630
Would you guys care to join us?

367
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,330
What? Sure we do.

368
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,930
Well, then, you go ahead, Takagi.

369
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,730
I'm not in the mood for singing today.

370
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,230
And I guess I'd rather not.

371
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,030
Hey, let's hurry up and go.

372
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,030
-Yeah. -Yes.

373
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,030
What kind of squeal was it?

374
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,330
Yeah. It was a phone call, a warning,

375
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,330
that a bomb is set up in this restaurant.

376
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,930
Today is January 6th.

377
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,830
The same day as the bombing of 7 years ago and 3 years ago.

378
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,230
So, we came and checked.

379
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,630
A bomb threat warning, a false lead...

380
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,030
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter."

381
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,030
"Now, this is the beginning of an extended game."

382
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,130
Don't tell me...

383
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,930
Shiratori!

384
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:51,982
What's that?

385
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:53,682
Bombing, again?

386
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:55,482
Shiratori!

387
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:00,182
Shiratori!

388
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:02,782
Shiratori!

389
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,382
It's dangerous.

390
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:08,182
Get out of here, quickly.

391
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:12,182
Are you all right, Shiratori?

392
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:18,682
Yeah. I couldn't run as you did.

393
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:22,582
Takagi! Block off this road and get an ambulance.

394
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:24,382
I will.

395
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:28,882
But he can speak, that means he's okay.

396
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:32,282
No. He's bleeding at the side of his head,

397
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,582
with paralysis in the left limbs.

398
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:35,982
This could be...

399
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:38,582
Accute subdural hemorrhage.

400
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:42,182
We'd better take him ASAP to the hospital.

401
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:43,182
He's in critical condition.

402
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:44,982
Oh, no.

403
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:47,182
Anyway, if the gas catches fire,

404
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:49,182
it might cause secondary explosion.

405
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:50,682
Let's move Inspector Shiratori away from the car

406
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,882
until the ambulance gets here.

407
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:54,982
Yes, let's do that.

408
00:25:57,982 --> 00:26:00,582
This is terrible. Really terrible.

409
00:26:00,582 --> 00:26:04,382
Yeah. Who on earth would do such a thing?

410
00:26:04,382 --> 00:26:06,382
I don't know the bomber,

411
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:09,282
but I'm sure that he's after a police officer.

412
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:10,282
What?

413
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:13,582
He gave false lead saying that he set up a bomb in the restaurant,

414
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,382
and lured the police into the restaurant.

415
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:17,982
While the officers were looking for the bomb,

416
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:21,582
he planted the real bomb into the car,

417
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,482
hiding himself among the customers

418
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:26,482
who were lead out of the restaurant.

419
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:27,982
From what I saw,

420
00:26:27,982 --> 00:26:29,682
the trigger mechanism seems to work

421
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:32,782
in a way that the safety pin goes off when the door is first opened.

422
00:26:32,782 --> 00:26:35,382
And when the door is opened again in order to exit,

423
00:26:35,382 --> 00:26:36,982
then it explodes.

424
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:38,782
The question is,

425
00:26:38,782 --> 00:26:42,182
why did Inspector Shiratori try to get out immediately?

426
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:46,482
This...

427
00:26:46,482 --> 00:26:47,582
What's that?

428
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:50,982
I wanted to show this to you as soon as possible.

429
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:55,682
The memory that you harbor within you and cannot erase...

430
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:59,282
This is a chance to get rid of it.

431
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,482
"I am a Major Leaguer, a strong pitcher as well as batter.

432
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,982
Now, this is the beginning of an extended game.

433
00:27:07,982 --> 00:27:10,882
The game starts at noon tomorrow.

434
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:13,282
It ends at three in the afternoon.

435
00:27:13,282 --> 00:27:16,982
No use getting ready a good stopper.

436
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:19,282
Because I will win in the end.

437
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:23,182
And if you want to stop the game, come to me.

438
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:24,882
I will be waiting for you

439
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:31,182
to climb up the bloody mound in the steel batter's box."

440
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,982
What?

441
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,282
It's...

442
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:36,182
Hey.

443
00:27:36,182 --> 00:27:37,682
Could it be...

444
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:39,482
This is...

445
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:41,682
I am a knight of the round table.

446
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:44,782
Let the foolish, cunning police know that...

447
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:47,082
Let a pro handle work like this.

448
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,782
It's him.

449
00:27:55,782 --> 00:27:57,682
It's him again.

450
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:10,982
Really?

451
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:14,482
Did Shiratori get involved in an explosion?

452
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:15,682
Yes, sir.

453
00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:19,582
He was taken by an ambulance to a nearby hospital just now.

454
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:21,082
He has been seriously injured.

455
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:23,982
What is the situation over there, sir?

456
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:27,882
The same fax with the same words you just told me.

457
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:29,582
The same faxes have been sent to

458
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,482
all the police stations in the metropolitan district.

459
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:33,882
They are all upset over the fax.

460
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:36,582
There's a possibility that it is the same one

461
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:40,082
responsible for the bombings 7 years ago and 3 years ago.

462
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:43,582
No doubt about it. It's from the bomber.

463
00:28:43,582 --> 00:28:45,982
Please tell Director Matsumoto about it, sir.

464
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:47,982
In the incident of three years ago,

465
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:50,082
only the first portion of the warning notice

466
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:51,982
was released to the public.

467
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,182
An imitator couldn't have made up such a detailed warning notice.

468
00:28:57,382 --> 00:29:00,882
Sato, I brought your car here.

469
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,782
Thanks, Chiba.

470
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,682
Now, I will go join the investigation team, sir.

471
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:09,282
Hey, Sato! Sato!

472
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,482
He's not getting away. Not this time.

473
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:16,982
I'll take him in myself.
