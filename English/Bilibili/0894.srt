00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.240
"Mouri Detective Agency"

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.040
Out of the fourth corner, Number 7, Darkest Nightmare is in the lead!

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.940
-All right! Come on... -Behind him is Number 4, Kid the Sunflower!

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.940
Will Nightmare stay ahead? Or will Kid catch up?

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.440
Will it be Nightmare or Kid?

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.240
Nightmare is closing in! So is Kid!

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.440
-It's Darkest Nightmare! -No! I lost again!

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.640
Number 7, Darkest Nightmare wins!

9
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.040
So, how much did you bet on this race?

10
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.940
Huh? Not much.

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.940
How much?

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.240
A thousand each on four or five races in the second half.

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.640
And you lost all of that?

14
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.140
Yes.

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.240
Fine. No allowance for you this month.

16
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.740
Hey, the G1 race is next week!

17
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.440
Darn it! Today's just not my lucky day.

18
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.540
What do you mean?

19
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.340
It was sunny when I left for the betting booth,

20
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.640
but it started raining the second I got there.

21
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.440
When I went to buy cigarettes after getting my tickets,

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.940
"Sold Out" -my usual ones were sold out.

23
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.940
Not only that, someone ran into me,

24
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.840
and all the change fell out of my wallet.

25
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.540
To top it all off, my wallet fell into a puddle.

26
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.440
The tickets in my wallet

27
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.140
"4, Kid the Sunflower" -got soaking wet, too.

28
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.540
Well, they're losing tickets, so it's not like it matters.

29
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.240
Anyway, what do you want for dinner?

30
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.440
I'm in a bad mood, so let's celebrate with...

31
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.240
We can't afford to celebrate!

32
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.340
-What? -Sheesh.

33
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.440
Huh?

34
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.940
What is it?

35
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.140
Didn't Pirate's Spirit from race nine win?

36
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.540
-What? -In third was Number 6,

37
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.140
"Tansho, 8 Pirate's Spirit" -Raven Chaser.

38
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
Tansho tickets for Number 8 win 10500 yen.

39
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.940
-Umaren tickets... -Seriously?

40
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.440
That was the dark horse! This pays out a hundred-fold!

41
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.540
How much is it?

42
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.440
Well, he bought it for ten thousand, so...

43
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840
"One Million Yen" -One million yen?

44
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.440
I knew I could do it! All right!

45
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.340
But he only bet a thousand on the other tickets.

46
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.340
Why did he bet ten thousand on just that one?

47
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.240
Maybe when he dropped his wallet,

48
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.040
he picked up someone else's ticket and put it in his wallet?

49
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.840
I could've accidentally added another digit.

50
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.840
Besides, even if I did pick up a ticket

51
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.240
and put it in my wallet,

52
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.740
the buyer's name isn't written on the ticket.

53
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.540
It's their fault for dropping it.

54
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.040
All right, tonight we're having sushi for dinner, sushi!

55
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.040
We're heading to Beika Iroha Sushi next door!

56
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.940
Today is a great day.

57
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.840
I thought you weren't lucky today.

58
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140
Feel that bright morning sunlight!

59
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.240
Saturday is when the love and cases start!

60
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.040
A ten thousand yen ticket yields an easy payout!

61
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.140
But I smell a case at Iroha Sushi!

62
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.840
He sees through the one and only truth.

63
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

64
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.540
His name is Detective Conan!

65
00:04:53.082 --> 00:04:58.882
"The Tokyo-Style Detective Show Next Door (Part 1)"

66
00:05:00.882 --> 00:05:01.982
There.

67
00:05:01.982 --> 00:05:03.882
Welcome.

68
00:05:04.882 --> 00:05:06.482
Huh?

69
00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:08.882
We're the only customers.

70
00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:13.782
Don't make it sound like business is slow.

71
00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:17.982
Just imagine you've reserved the restaurant for yourselves, sir.

72
00:05:18.882 --> 00:05:22.482
One beer and three extra specials.

73
00:05:22.482 --> 00:05:25.082
Make one without wasabi for the kid.

74
00:05:25.082 --> 00:05:26.082
You got it.

75
00:05:26.082 --> 00:05:29.882
One beer and three extra specials, one without wasabi.

76
00:05:29.882 --> 00:05:33.382
Dad. I can't believe you ordered extra specials.

77
00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:37.382
Don't worry. We've got this.

78
00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:39.482
You're misappropriating a lost ticket.

79
00:05:39.482 --> 00:05:40.582
Shut up.

80
00:05:40.582 --> 00:05:43.982
Anyway, sir, you're a curious person.

81
00:05:46.382 --> 00:05:50.382
I can't believe you bet all that money on Pirate's Spirit.

82
00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:51.582
Huh?

83
00:05:51.582 --> 00:05:53.482
How did you know?

84
00:05:53.482 --> 00:05:56.582
You didn't see me pick it up, did you?

85
00:05:56.582 --> 00:05:59.482
Pick it up? What are you talking about?

86
00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:02.182
I just used my detective skills.

87
00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:03.482
Detective skills?

88
00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:07.382
My neighbour Kogoro Mouri loves horse racing.

89
00:06:07.382 --> 00:06:13.082
The boss said you only come here when you win at the races.

90
00:06:13.082 --> 00:06:18.082
And I heard you normally only order regulars or specials,

91
00:06:18.082 --> 00:06:20.282
but today you ordered the extra special.

92
00:06:20.282 --> 00:06:22.982
You must've won big.

93
00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:25.482
The radio said they were only selling dark horse payout tickets

94
00:06:25.482 --> 00:06:30.582
for Pirate's Spirit today, so I thought that had to be it.

95
00:06:30.582 --> 00:06:35.382
Well? How are my detective skills, Sleeping Kogoro?

96
00:06:35.382 --> 00:06:39.682
Huh? They're all right.

97
00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:42.882
Anyway, I don't recognize you.

98
00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:45.282
-Are you new? -Yeah.

99
00:06:45.282 --> 00:06:48.482
"Kanenori Wakita (56), Cook" -I'm Kanenori Wakita, a cook.

100
00:06:48.482 --> 00:06:52.382
I'm not the type of guy to settle down in one place.

101
00:06:52.382 --> 00:06:56.982
I eventually ended up here. I'm what you'd call a drifter.

102
00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:58.282
I see.

103
00:06:58.282 --> 00:07:00.982
I'd rather be in the kitchen,

104
00:07:00.982 --> 00:07:04.182
but it's too dangerous for me to use a knife with one eye.

105
00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:05.382
The boss told me to handle customers

106
00:07:05.382 --> 00:07:08.082
-until my left eye gets better... -Come to think of it, Rum...

107
00:07:09.582 --> 00:07:11.482
Lose?

108
00:07:11.482 --> 00:07:14.982
Come to think of it, that's what they all said.

109
00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:17.582
That he was missing one.

110
00:07:17.582 --> 00:07:19.182
He?

111
00:07:19.182 --> 00:07:20.382
Rum.

112
00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:22.882
He injured an eye in some kind of accident.

113
00:07:22.882 --> 00:07:26.582
Either his right or left eye is an artificial eye.

114
00:07:27.382 --> 00:07:28.682
Hey, mister.

115
00:07:28.682 --> 00:07:31.582
-Huh? -What happened to your left eye?

116
00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:35.182
Oh, it's a real mess.

117
00:07:35.182 --> 00:07:36.282
You want to see?

118
00:07:36.282 --> 00:07:38.182
No, thank you...

119
00:07:39.182 --> 00:07:44.082
Anyway, tell me about the cases you've solved.

120
00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:48.982
I've loved mysteries since I was a little kid.

121
00:07:48.982 --> 00:07:51.482
Since I heard you live next door to this place,

122
00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:54.782
I've been dying to meet you.

123
00:07:55.782 --> 00:07:57.282
In that case...

124
00:08:00.082 --> 00:08:02.682
"Iroha Sushi"

125
00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:05.082
I see...

126
00:08:05.082 --> 00:08:08.082
So she used the footage from an old home video

127
00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:12.382
to make it seem like the dead man had come back to life as a zombie.

128
00:08:12.382 --> 00:08:15.882
Now that's an incredible case.

129
00:08:15.882 --> 00:08:18.082
Isn't it? Another beer.

130
00:08:18.082 --> 00:08:22.082
Oh, sorry. I didn't notice.

131
00:08:22.082 --> 00:08:27.382
Dad, Hattori solved that case.

132
00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:29.282
I helped.

133
00:08:29.282 --> 00:08:32.482
I'm the one who found the zombie first.

134
00:08:32.482 --> 00:08:36.482
You were bedridden after eating some poisonous mushrooms.

135
00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:41.182
Anyway, sushi doesn't taste right without wasabi.

136
00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:44.682
Here's your beer.

137
00:08:45.682 --> 00:08:47.382
Welcome!

138
00:08:53.582 --> 00:08:55.982
What'll it be, sir?

139
00:08:55.982 --> 00:08:57.282
"Tsunetaka Harashima (25), Customer" -I'll have

140
00:08:57.282 --> 00:09:00.582
the nigiri special, some chawanmushi

141
00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:02.182
and a cola.

142
00:09:02.182 --> 00:09:04.282
Cola?

143
00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:06.082
What was that, old man?

144
00:09:06.082 --> 00:09:08.682
Nothing.

145
00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:11.182
-And extra ginger, please. -You got it.

146
00:09:11.182 --> 00:09:15.082
Kids these days drink cola with their sushi?

147
00:09:15.082 --> 00:09:18.482
Apparently they go together surprisingly well.

148
00:09:18.482 --> 00:09:20.882
Really?

149
00:09:20.882 --> 00:09:22.182
Hey.

150
00:09:22.182 --> 00:09:23.882
What is it?

151
00:09:23.882 --> 00:09:24.982
Where's your bathroom?

152
00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:28.882
The bathroom's back there.

153
00:09:28.882 --> 00:09:29.982
Thank you.

154
00:09:30.982 --> 00:09:33.482
What'll it be, sir?

155
00:09:33.482 --> 00:09:37.482
The regular nigiri and an oolong tea.

156
00:09:37.482 --> 00:09:38.782
"Tameshige Munechika (42), Customer" -Also,

157
00:09:38.782 --> 00:09:43.182
do you have the limited availability seasonal grilled fish today?

158
00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:46.082
Yeah. We've got horse mackerel today.

159
00:09:46.082 --> 00:09:47.982
Then I'll have one of those, too.

160
00:09:47.982 --> 00:09:49.182
You got it.

161
00:09:49.182 --> 00:09:51.482
You have grilled fish?

162
00:09:51.482 --> 00:09:54.182
Apparently we added it to the menu recently.

163
00:09:54.182 --> 00:09:57.082
We can't make it selling sushi alone.

164
00:09:57.082 --> 00:09:58.982
What a tough world.

165
00:09:58.982 --> 00:10:01.682
Come to think of it, they have anmitsu, too.

166
00:10:01.682 --> 00:10:04.182
No way. I want some.

167
00:10:04.182 --> 00:10:05.482
Sheesh.

168
00:10:06.282 --> 00:10:09.582
What's with this rain?

169
00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:10.982
Welcome!

170
00:10:14.382 --> 00:10:16.782
What'll it be, miss?

171
00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.682
The usual.

172
00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:22.082
And what would that be?

173
00:10:22.082 --> 00:10:24.682
You know, the usual.

174
00:10:24.682 --> 00:10:27.282
Huh? Where's the regular guy?

175
00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:30.482
He got hurt in a traffic accident.

176
00:10:30.482 --> 00:10:31.882
"Natsume Ashino (33), Customer" -Oh, really?

177
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:34.682
In that case, I'd like a highball and seafood chirashi.

178
00:10:34.682 --> 00:10:37.082
Extra sea urchin, salmon roe, and wasabi.

179
00:10:37.082 --> 00:10:38.182
You got it.

180
00:10:38.682 --> 00:10:40.282
Thanks for the food.

181
00:10:40.282 --> 00:10:42.882
-Check, please! -Sure thing.

182
00:10:42.882 --> 00:10:45.782
-That anmitsu was good. -Yeah.

183
00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:50.082
Seriously? They were complaining before we got here.

184
00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:55.382
Kogoro, come back and tell me more interesting stories.

185
00:10:55.382 --> 00:10:59.282
I'll take your bill out of my wages and give you a discount.

186
00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:01.382
Thanks.

187
00:11:01.382 --> 00:11:04.382
If you take me to a crime scene,

188
00:11:04.382 --> 00:11:07.782
I'll give you something extra special.

189
00:11:07.782 --> 00:11:11.082
Well, I doubt any crimes will be happening here.

190
00:11:14.182 --> 00:11:16.982
"Suzuyo Hijirisawa (47), Customer?"

191
00:11:19.282 --> 00:11:21.982
Who stole my pouch?

192
00:11:21.982 --> 00:11:25.282
I know the thief is in here.

193
00:11:25.282 --> 00:11:29.782
Hey, you. What are you talking about?

194
00:11:30.582 --> 00:11:32.082
What's your problem?

195
00:11:38.982 --> 00:11:40.182
Hey, you!

196
00:11:40.182 --> 00:11:43.582
You can't just come in here and start picking fights with our...

197
00:11:43.582 --> 00:11:45.482
Where's the bathroom?

198
00:11:45.482 --> 00:11:48.082
The bathroom's back there.

199
00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:54.582
Hey, you! If you wanted to use the bathroom, you should've said so!

200
00:11:54.582 --> 00:11:56.682
I found it!

201
00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:58.382
Found what?

202
00:11:58.382 --> 00:12:00.182
It's not here!

203
00:12:00.182 --> 00:12:05.382
Who threw my pouch in the trash can?

204
00:12:07.182 --> 00:12:08.882
What's going on?

205
00:12:08.882 --> 00:12:11.682
It was just stolen from me on the train.

206
00:12:11.682 --> 00:12:14.082
This pouch I had in my bag.

207
00:12:14.082 --> 00:12:17.782
I see. But how'd you know it'd be here?

208
00:12:17.782 --> 00:12:20.782
My wallet and phone were in this pouch.

209
00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:24.482
I hurried home and used the GPS on my spare phone

210
00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:27.082
to find it in this shop.

211
00:12:27.082 --> 00:12:32.882
But none of your customers have a bag they could have put my pouch in.

212
00:12:32.882 --> 00:12:36.682
So I thought they hid it in the bathroom.

213
00:12:36.682 --> 00:12:37.982
I see.

214
00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:40.582
So, when was it stolen?

215
00:12:40.582 --> 00:12:43.382
About an hour ago.

216
00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:47.782
That's shortly before Kogoro and his family arrived.

217
00:12:47.782 --> 00:12:51.982
And since none of the customers who arrived after him have left...

218
00:12:52.882 --> 00:12:56.582
They might still be inside this store.

219
00:12:56.582 --> 00:13:00.482
The thief who stole your pouch on the train.

220
00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:05.082
How are you going to find them, though?

221
00:13:05.082 --> 00:13:06.582
If they're smart,

222
00:13:06.582 --> 00:13:10.182
they'll have wiped their fingerprints off the pouch.

223
00:13:10.182 --> 00:13:12.282
Don't worry.

224
00:13:12.282 --> 00:13:15.382
I put this on the thief.

225
00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:17.482
A band-aid?

226
00:13:17.482 --> 00:13:21.382
My hand slipped while I was peeling and apple and I cut my finger.

227
00:13:21.382 --> 00:13:25.282
It was bad enough that I bled through the band-aid.

228
00:13:25.282 --> 00:13:29.582
I grabbed the right sleeve of the thief

229
00:13:29.582 --> 00:13:31.982
who stole my pouch with this hand,

230
00:13:31.982 --> 00:13:34.482
so it should still be on them.

231
00:13:34.482 --> 00:13:37.082
The sleeve of someone in here

232
00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:40.982
should be stained with my red blood that seeped through the band-aid.

233
00:13:40.982 --> 00:13:42.982
Fine.

234
00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:44.182
Here.

235
00:13:47.782 --> 00:13:50.882
No one has blood on their sleeve.

236
00:13:50.882 --> 00:13:53.082
No way. It can't be.

237
00:13:53.082 --> 00:13:54.682
That's not possible.

238
00:13:54.682 --> 00:13:57.482
Just how much was stolen?

239
00:13:57.482 --> 00:14:00.282
None of the money in my wallet was stolen.

240
00:14:00.282 --> 00:14:02.182
Then who cares?

241
00:14:02.182 --> 00:14:05.882
But the ticket I had with my cash is missing!

242
00:14:05.882 --> 00:14:08.382
My dark horse payout ticket worth a million yen!

243
00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:09.482
What?

244
00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:21.449
A dark horse payout ticket worth a million yen?

245
00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:24.649
And the wallet it was inside was stolen?

246
00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:28.949
Yeah. I was on the way to get dinner with a friend.

247
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:31.449
I was listening to the race results on the radio.

248
00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:34.649
No way. I won.

249
00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:36.349
Won what?

250
00:14:36.349 --> 00:14:39.649
My dark horse payout ticket. It's a million yen.

251
00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:40.949
What?

252
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:42.549
All right!

253
00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:45.649
Then you're paying for dinner tonight.

254
00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:49.249
Okay. I'll buy you whatever you want.

255
00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:54.349
In that case, you're taking me someplace really expensive.

256
00:14:54.349 --> 00:14:55.949
Go ahead.

257
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:58.149
How do you feel about French cuisine?

258
00:14:59.849 --> 00:15:02.149
Hey! What are you doing?

259
00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:05.549
It was stolen from me in the blink of an eye.

260
00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:09.149
You didn't see the thief's face?

261
00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:11.749
I didn't have time for that.

262
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:14.349
I was doing my best to keep them from stealing my pouch.

263
00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:17.849
But couldn't your friend have seen them?

264
00:15:17.849 --> 00:15:20.349
My friend is really nearsighted.

265
00:15:20.349 --> 00:15:23.449
On top of that, she had her glasses pushed up on her forehead

266
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:26.349
so she could read the small print on her phone.

267
00:15:26.349 --> 00:15:29.549
But I got a firm grip on the thief's white sleeve

268
00:15:29.549 --> 00:15:33.649
with this finger that's bleeding through the band-aid.

269
00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:36.449
It must be on them.

270
00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:39.549
On the sleeve of someone in this store!

271
00:15:39.549 --> 00:15:44.349
But there wasn't any blood on anyone's sleeve.

272
00:15:44.349 --> 00:15:47.849
Let me get a better look at the rest of your sleeve, too.

273
00:15:49.049 --> 00:15:51.149
It seems a little damp.

274
00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:55.349
Yeah. It got wet when I washed my hands in the bathroom.

275
00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:58.649
Maybe you washed it off in the bathroom.

276
00:15:58.649 --> 00:15:59.949
Don't be ridiculous!

277
00:15:59.949 --> 00:16:03.149
You can't wash blood out with water!

278
00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:05.949
Then show me your sleeve.

279
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:10.249
All right. My sleeve is wet, too.

280
00:16:10.249 --> 00:16:14.949
Like him, it got wet when I washed my hands in the bathroom.

281
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:18.949
My sleeve's wet, but it's not from the bathroom.

282
00:16:19.049 --> 00:16:20.949
It got wet in the rain.

283
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:23.549
It was coming down pretty hard until a minute ago.

284
00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:26.649
I did go to the bathroom once, though.

285
00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:28.649
Hey, Dad.

286
00:16:28.649 --> 00:16:29.649
Huh?

287
00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:34.749
Maybe the ticket you picked up belongs to that woman.

288
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:37.649
You idiot. There's no way.

289
00:16:37.649 --> 00:16:41.049
It was stolen about an hour ago.

290
00:16:41.049 --> 00:16:45.549
I was watching the races in my office around then.

291
00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:50.649
But the TV broadcast of the races ended about 50 minutes ago.

292
00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:55.649
Since you were out buying tickets, you only saw the last race.

293
00:16:55.649 --> 00:17:00.649
An little over an hour ago, you would've been near the ticket booth.

294
00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:02.749
I guess you could say that.

295
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:07.149
Maybe the thief was in a rush to redeem the ticket,

296
00:17:07.149 --> 00:17:10.649
ran into you, and dropped it.

297
00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:13.149
I guess you could say that.

298
00:17:13.149 --> 00:17:16.849
And you picked it up and put it in your wallet.

299
00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:18.849
Maybe you...

300
00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.949
You can't be serious, idiots!

301
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:23.149
Come to think of it, Kogoro,

302
00:17:23.149 --> 00:17:26.049
didn't you have a winning dark horse ticket?

303
00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:27.449
Yikes!

304
00:17:27.449 --> 00:17:28.649
What's with the reaction?

305
00:17:28.649 --> 00:17:32.549
Oh, no. I mean to say, uh...

306
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:34.349
Blood! Yeah, blood!

307
00:17:34.349 --> 00:17:35.649
Blood?

308
00:17:35.649 --> 00:17:39.349
If you cut yourself deep enough that you bled through your band-aid,

309
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:44.349
then your blood must be on the ticket, too.

310
00:17:44.349 --> 00:17:49.849
There wasn't any blood on the ticket in my wallet.

311
00:17:49.849 --> 00:17:52.949
Of course there isn't.

312
00:17:52.949 --> 00:17:58.149
I made sure to use my uninjured right hand when touching my ticket.

313
00:17:58.149 --> 00:18:00.749
Of course.

314
00:18:00.749 --> 00:18:03.449
Hey, Kogoro.

315
00:18:03.449 --> 00:18:07.449
Why don't we make this a contest?

316
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:08.749
A contest?

317
00:18:08.749 --> 00:18:15.149
Let's see which of us can find the thief first.

318
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:21.349
But there wasn't any blood on anyone's sleeve.

319
00:18:21.349 --> 00:18:25.449
Doesn't that make this an unsolvable case?

320
00:18:25.449 --> 00:18:27.049
Dad!

321
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:30.649
What's your problem? I was joking.

322
00:18:31.449 --> 00:18:34.049
I don't have time for this.

323
00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:36.649
I'll leave my money here.

324
00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:39.149
I'm leaving.

325
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:41.249
Hey, you! You're running away?

326
00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:44.949
What was that? I finished eating, so I'm leaving.

327
00:18:44.949 --> 00:18:48.749
Is there some reason you have to leave?

328
00:18:48.749 --> 00:18:51.749
Huh? Well, yeah.

329
00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:55.549
There's a show on TV that I can't miss.

330
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:58.049
A TV show?

331
00:18:58.049 --> 00:19:02.249
I'd understand wanting to watch a sporting event live,

332
00:19:02.249 --> 00:19:05.549
but these days don't people record

333
00:19:05.549 --> 00:19:08.949
TV shows they're that excited about?

334
00:19:08.949 --> 00:19:13.349
It's hard to imagine a young man casually ordering

335
00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:15.249
the special at a sushi restaurant

336
00:19:15.249 --> 00:19:19.249
doesn't have a DVD or Blu-ray recorder.

337
00:19:20.049 --> 00:19:23.249
Yeah, it's set to record.

338
00:19:24.849 --> 00:19:28.149
Sheesh. Bring me some ginger, then.

339
00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:29.949
I'll stay.

340
00:19:29.949 --> 00:19:31.749
Right away, sir.

341
00:19:31.749 --> 00:19:36.049
Excuse me, but I'd like to leave soon, too.

342
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:37.649
Why?

343
00:19:37.649 --> 00:19:42.049
I'm meeting my wife's parents for a drink tonight.

344
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:45.349
They've been calling to tell me to hurry up.

345
00:19:45.349 --> 00:19:48.449
They haven't stopped calling.

346
00:19:50.249 --> 00:19:52.849
Honey, what are you doing?

347
00:19:52.849 --> 00:19:58.749
I told you. I got involved in an incident at a sushi restaurant.

348
00:19:58.749 --> 00:20:00.949
What kind of incident?

349
00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:02.349
Hey!

350
00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:04.949
I've taken your husband's phone.

351
00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:06.949
What? Who are you?

352
00:20:06.949 --> 00:20:11.449
I'm Wakita, an employee at Beika Iroha Sushi.

353
00:20:11.449 --> 00:20:15.249
A drunk tried to pick a fight with your husband.

354
00:20:15.249 --> 00:20:19.449
He tripped, and his clothes got soaked in the rain.

355
00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:23.449
We're drying his clothes at the restaurant right now.

356
00:20:23.449 --> 00:20:26.549
Then could you tell him we'll be waiting for him

357
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:29.049
at Arsene at the Beika Center building?

358
00:20:29.049 --> 00:20:33.049
Sure. We'll send him on his way as soon as his clothes are dry.

359
00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:36.749
You should be good for a while.

360
00:20:36.749 --> 00:20:38.749
I see.

361
00:20:38.749 --> 00:20:41.949
But Arsene is a classy restaurant.

362
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:45.149
Why aren't you having dinner there?

363
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:48.349
My wife's parents are very strict.

364
00:20:48.349 --> 00:20:51.549
I'm too nervous to eat around them,

365
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:53.649
so I thought I'd eat here.

366
00:20:53.649 --> 00:20:56.549
Family can be complicated.

367
00:20:56.549 --> 00:21:01.549
I don't mind playing along with this charade for a while.

368
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:04.549
But I'm leaving before 8pm.

369
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:07.149
There's a painting I want to buy in an online auction,

370
00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:10.349
and it closes tonight at 10pm.

371
00:21:10.349 --> 00:21:15.449
I'm the highest bid right now, but it's a popular painting.

372
00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:17.749
If I'm not careful, someone else will outbid me.

373
00:21:17.749 --> 00:21:21.149
Huh? Miss, you seem like a regular.

374
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:23.649
You don't live near here?

375
00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:26.049
I live nearby. It's a 30-minute walk.

376
00:21:26.049 --> 00:21:29.849
Then you could easily make it in time if you left by 9pm.

377
00:21:29.849 --> 00:21:32.449
My computer's on the fritz,

378
00:21:32.449 --> 00:21:34.849
so I use my phone to bid in auctions.

379
00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:38.249
But it's running out of battery, so I need to charge it.

380
00:21:38.249 --> 00:21:42.249
In that case, it can't be helped.

381
00:21:42.249 --> 00:21:45.249
Oh, and could I get some more wasabi?

382
00:21:45.249 --> 00:21:48.149
I got less than normal today.

383
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:50.349
And another highball.

384
00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:54.349
In that case, I'd like some more grated radish.

385
00:21:54.349 --> 00:21:56.049
I ran out.

386
00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:58.949
And if possible, another oolong tea.

387
00:21:59.849 --> 00:22:03.249
Then I'll take some more cola and ginger.

388
00:22:03.249 --> 00:22:04.949
It's on the house, right?

389
00:22:04.949 --> 00:22:06.949
Sure thing.

390
00:22:07.449 --> 00:22:09.949
That's odd, though.

391
00:22:09.949 --> 00:22:14.849
It's strange that the woman's blood wasn't on anyone's sleeve.

392
00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:19.549
But why did the thief leave the stolen pouch in the bathroom?

393
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:23.149
A professional thief would've taken the money

394
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:27.549
and left the incriminating wallet in a nearby trash can.

395
00:22:28.449 --> 00:22:31.849
So why did they bring it into Iroha Sushi?

396
00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:55.849
"Next Episode"

397
00:23:55.849 --> 00:23:58.549
Involved and erase?

398
00:23:58.549 --> 00:24:03.649
The person who has either a million yen in cash

399
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:08.449
or the stolen dark horse ticket on them is the thief.

400
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:14.449
The thief's already a carp on a cutting board.

401
00:24:14.449 --> 00:24:18.449
All that's left is for me to name them and for them to confess.

402
00:24:19.049 --> 00:24:20.749
Next Conan,

403
00:24:20.749 --> 00:24:24.349
"The Tokyo-Style Detective Show Next Door (Part 2)"

404
00:24:24.592 --> 00:24:26.792
Next Conan's Hint:

405
00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:29.392
"Wasabi, pickled ginger, and grated radish"

406
00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:30.892
It's your fault for picking up that ticket.

407
00:24:30.892 --> 00:24:31.992
So I got caught up in a case too?

408
00:24:31.992 --> 00:24:33.592
Conan, that's always happening to you.
