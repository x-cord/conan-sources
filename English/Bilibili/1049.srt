1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:05,213
(Tenma-cho Road,
within Tokyo Metropolitan Area, 9pm)

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,841
- What's the situation?
- It was an anonymous report

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,009
- through the emergency number.
- Inspector Megure,

4
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,050
- Someone has died.
- you're here.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,430
According to the driver's licence we found,

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,890
(Iwao Yamakabe (56), Imported Goods Distributor)
the victim is Iwao Yamakabe, who lives in Hikaridai.

7
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,101
He was 56 years old.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,937
The cause of death
is thought to be a cerebral contusion

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,022
due to being hit in the head
with a dull object.

10
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,735
The estimated time of death
was around 7 pm,

11
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,528
which was nearly two hours ago.

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,406
But since the victim's shoes
are nowhere to be found,

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:34,350
he might not have been killed here.

14
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,911
So he could have been killed indoors

15
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,205
and his body was brought here?

16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,390
Inspector Megure.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,419
I've been trying
to contact the victim's family,

18
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,000
but no one has picked up.

19
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,000
He could be living alone.

20
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,009
Hikaridai, was it?

21
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,428
I'll check with the police station there.

22
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,850
When the local police officer

23
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,350
(Yamakabe)
When the local police officer

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,000
When the local police officer

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,308
(Hikaridai, Metropolitan area, Yamakabe's house)
visited the victim's house...

26
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,400
(Hikaridai, Metropolitan area, Yamakabe's house)
This is Kawai from Hikaridai East Police Station,

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,934
This is Kawai from Hikaridai East Police Station,

28
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,019
arriving at the victim's home.

29
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,604
I'm going in to check.

30
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,235
Mr. Yamakabe! It's the police!

31
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,612
Mr. Yamakabe?

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,323
Mr. Yamakabe?

33
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,034
Is anyone home?

34
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,430
Mr. Yamakabe.

35
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,537
It's the police.

36
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,914
What is this?

37
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,070
There are traces of a struggle in the house.

38
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,638
The distinctive shape of this decoration

39
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,432
with blood and hair on it

40
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,935
matches the mark left on the victim's head

41
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,430
from being hit. That means...

42
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,024
This must be where the murder took place.

43
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,820
It should have been the right interpretation,

44
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:10,213
but I have unexpectedly
made a great mistake...

45
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,925
Mysterious clouds
obstruct the field of vision.

46
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,802
A sparkle that clears them up with deduction!

47
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,512
Inspector Megure's regretful mistake.

48
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,514
Where does the investigation
that led to his resignation go?

49
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

50
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,101
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

51
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,436
His name is Detective Conan!

52
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:13,002
"Megure and the Danger of Police Detective Life"

53
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,560
(Tenma Police Station)
It was two days after the incident.

54
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,215
Inspector Megure!

55
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,635
A suspicious individual has emerged
in the criminal investigation!

56
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,500
Pardon?

57
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,638
This possible suspect
has been following the victim around,

58
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,223
and the victim seemed to have avoided them.

59
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,017
We also heard
that they have had problems with money.

60
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,519
I see...

61
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,104
There are a few points of concern

62
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,439
regarding the man named Kyosuke Temukai,

63
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,030
- who lives in Tenma-cho...
- Kyosuke Temukai?

64
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,318
Yes...

65
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,028
Do you know him?

66
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,180
It was about three years ago now.

67
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,536
There was a Kyosuke Temukai

68
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,913
who worked at the government office

69
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,417
and emerged as a suspect
in a certain murder.

70
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,335
When I wanted to ask him
to come to the police station

71
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,921
to obtain his alibi for the time of the murder,

72
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,214
though he was reluctant to do so,

73
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:03,803
he admitted to meeting
with a certain contractor in secret,

74
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,930
His relation to the murder was made clear,

75
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,433
- but the government office found out
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

76
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,030
he had inappropriate dealings
with that contractor.

77
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,450
I'm fired as of today.

78
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,108
If I weren't suspected of murder,

79
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,027
it wouldn't have turned out like this.

80
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:23,450
I won't forget what you did, Inspector.

81
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,909
But that was what he deserved.

82
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,703
It wasn't your responsibility.

83
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,331
Well, that's the thing.

84
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,680
So, he works at a publisher now?

85
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,419
He seems to be getting
with people who have made it in society

86
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,837
by making them write autobiographies

87
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,180
and publish them at their own expense.

88
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,300
But there isn't a market
for those kinds of books,

89
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,450
so it's a dodgy business that doesn't sell.

90
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,015
Mr. Yamakabe, who made his name
by selling imported goods,

91
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,934
was strongly recommended
to write an autobiography.

92
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,020
And he then avoided him.

93
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,441
(Temukai Publishing)

94
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,319
Excuse me.

95
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,613
I'm with the police...

96
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,908
What do the police have to do with me?

97
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,536
It has been a while, Temukai.

98
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,704
You...

99
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,627
I'm surprised

100
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,750
that you're in charge of
investigating this incident, Inspector.

101
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,420
(Temukai Kyosuke (38), Book Publishing Manager)
that you're in charge of
investigating this incident, Inspector.

102
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,610
(Temukai Kyosuke (38), Book Publishing Manager)
What did you do two days ago,

103
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,218
on the 7th, at about 7 pm?

104
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,638
I was working alone at the office.

105
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,641
So you don't have an alibi, then.

106
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,935
But I didn't do it.

107
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,730
Yamakabe was killed
at his home in Hikaridai, right?

108
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,941
And his body was brought here to Tenma-cho,

109
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,401
where it was found.

110
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,820
No culprit would go out of the way

111
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,404
to take the body to the town they live in,

112
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,700
especially when it's an hour away by car.

113
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,702
There is the possibility
of deliberately taking the body

114
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,913
as an excuse for that reason.

115
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,039
There will be no end to it

116
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,707
if you keep reading between the lines.

117
00:06:56,707 --> 00:07:00,128
You must have destroyed your car

118
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,130
by crashing it yourself.

119
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:12,807
It happened the morning

120
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,650
after Mr. Yamakabe was murdered.

121
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,104
That had nothing to do with the murder!

122
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,940
The car you used to transport the body

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,900
must have had traces
that are inconvenient to you,

124
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,405
such as the victim's blood or hair.

125
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,823
You caused the accident

126
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,201
so that the evidence went up in flames.

127
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,704
You're thinking too much.

128
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:39,050
In any case, I was not the one
who killed Yamakabe.

129
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,210
I'll take my leave now.

130
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,800
Without any conclusive evidence,

131
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,136
the section chief
had expressed his reluctance,

132
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,806
but I pushed on

133
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,600
and apprehended Kyosuke Temukai.

134
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,603
Even so, the next morning...

135
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,650
Meaning this morning...

136
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,024
A woman named Yasuko Chikaba,

137
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,901
(Chikaba Yasuko (57), Supermarket Manager)
who saw a report of the arrest,

138
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,300
(Chikaba Yasuko (57), Supermarket Manager)
came to the investigation headquarters.

139
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,532
When you say that he isn't the culprit...

140
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,409
I run a chain of stores

141
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,620
called Super Cheap Supermarket,

142
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,413
and I've been writing an autobiography

143
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,707
on Temukai's suggestion.

144
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,918
I had a meeting with Temukai on the 7th,

145
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,921
the day of the incident.

146
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,715
We were at my home here in Tenma-cho

147
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,750
from evening until about 9 pm.

148
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,305
Yamakabe was murdered in Hikaridai

149
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,432
at approximately 7 pm.

150
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,309
For Temukai, who was in Tenma-cho

151
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,229
meeting with Chikaba at that time...

152
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,760
He couldn't possibly have done it.

153
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,903
In other words, it's...

154
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,650
A mistaken arrest.

155
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,909
Why didn't you say you had an alibi?

156
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,537
Well, I was mistaken.

157
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,915
I thought the meeting with Ms. Chikaba
was on a different day.

158
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,626
Besides, I wasn't fazed when I was arrested.

159
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,503
After all, I trusted an outstanding inspector

160
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,922
such as yourself.

161
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,008
I know you'd find the real culprit.

162
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:15,930
When that time comes,
I will be immediately cleared of the crime.

163
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,807
So that's how it is!

164
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,320
You were waiting for this the entire time!

165
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,437
You were set up.

166
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,605
Yes...

167
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:29,110
That Temukai knew
you were the investigating officer

168
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,820
and came up with it
on the spur of the moment.

169
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,531
As revenge for what happened three years ago,

170
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,827
he made me bear the dishonour
of having arrested someone by mistake.

171
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:42,707
I can't believe this is
how my life as a police detective will end.

172
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,709
No way, Inspector!

173
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,627
I went against the section chief's wishes
and apprehended Temukai

174
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,130
even though it would result
in my getting fired.

175
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,841
No, I'm sure the section chief

176
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,009
won't take those words at face value!

177
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,219
But my conviction won't allow it!

178
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,600
I was here before I realised it.

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,310
It seems you're the only one

180
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,938
I can vent my frustrations to.

181
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,525
Inspector...

182
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,402
Yes, this is Megure.

183
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,613
Yes. Okay.

184
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,090
Got it.

185
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,618
Temukai has just been released.

186
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,412
I was going to write my resignation letter

187
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,039
once the real culprit was arrested,

188
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,832
but I don't know if I can find them.

189
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,280
This isn't like you, Inspector.

190
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,630
Are you going to
let your career end so dishonourably?

191
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,007
Let me help you find the real culprit,

192
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,650
even though you're feeling down on yourself!

193
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,804
I got it. Thanks.

194
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,102
Now, where do I find...

195
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,770
Pops Kogoro!

196
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,107
Inspector Megure's not going to resign, right?

197
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:54,290
If this Kyosuke Temukai is really the culprit.

198
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,614
Well, that is the case...

199
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,909
But he has a legit alibi.

200
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,537
But something just isn't right with him...

201
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,832
You're right.

202
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,730
If we can establish proof that he is guilty...

203
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,839
We'll save the inspector!

204
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,512
The police have acknowledged
that I was arrested by mistake,

205
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,307
so why is the great Detective Mouri here to see me?

206
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,309
I just wanted to see the man

207
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,311
who deceived Inspector Megure,

208
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,605
who used to be my superior.

209
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,107
I'm also here to declare that

210
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,026
I won't let the culprit run away!

211
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:40,032
I don't know
why you're declaring it to me,

212
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,828
but you're welcome to find the real culprit.

213
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,706
He gives off the air of a guilty man.

214
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,000
But from his confident laugh,

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,712
he's sure he'll be able to get away.

216
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:54,900
Yes.

217
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,900
Yes. And other than that...

218
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,635
Understood.

219
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,430
Not at all. Sorry for disturbing you.

220
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,780
I hoped that forensics
had picked up anything,

221
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,730
but it turned out to be
just a piece of clay that was on the table.

222
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,890
Clay?

223
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:16,000
It might have been Mr. Yamakabe's hobby.

224
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,400
He could have collected junk like that.

225
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,240
About that...

226
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,910
The murder weapon was full of bumps, right?

227
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,330
Why would the culprit
use something like that?

228
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,417
Something like this
would be much easier to handle.

229
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,128
He happened to have grabbed it, that's all!

230
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,922
Happened, he said...

231
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,132
When the accident occurred,

232
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,635
did Temukai's car have a full tank?

233
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,013
Yes, which was why it exploded

234
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,433
and went up in flames.

235
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,518
I can't help but think he got rid of
any incriminating evidence.

236
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:53,660
It's as if he expected Inspector Megure
to investigate it.

237
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,613
Are you certain that Temukai was at your house

238
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,824
from evening until about 9 pm
on the day of the incident?

239
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,911
Yes. Aside from going out to buy cigarettes,

240
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,120
he was there the entire time.

241
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,831
Did Mr. Temukai go out to buy cigarettes?

242
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,001
Yes. But he was only out
for about ten minutes or so.

243
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,629
He went out at some point...

244
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,425
Did that happen at about 7 pm?

245
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,930
Well, the news was starting at that time,

246
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,015
so I'm sure it was at 7 pm.

247
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,600
That's it!

248
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,450
We can save the inspector now!

249
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,313
Did you figure something out?

250
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,734
Yes! It's the cliched trick that he used!

251
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,202
Temukai actually killed Mr. Yamakabe

252
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,622
near Ms. Chikaba's home!

253
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,708
While pretending to go
and buy cigarettes,

254
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,002
Temukai snuck out of the house

255
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:02,132
and set up to meet Mr. Yamakabe at 7 pm

256
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,427
before murdering him
with the decoration he brought!

257
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,139
He went back to Ms. Chikaba's home
to continue the meeting

258
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,935
and then carried the body
to the place we found it.

259
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,813
He then went to the Yamakabe residence
to steal money,

260
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:19,108
make it look as if there was a struggle there,

261
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,820
and turned the ornament on its side.

262
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,322
But wouldn't that be impossible?

263
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,907
What did you say?

264
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:32,204
(Hikaridai, Yamakabe's House)
(Tenma-cho, Chikaba's House)
He didn't leave the house in Tenma-cho until 9 pm,

265
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,916
(Hikaridai, Yamakabe's House)
(Tenma-cho, Chikaba's House)
and it takes an hour to get to the Yamakabe residence,

266
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,835
so the earliest he could have arrived there
was 10 pm, right?

267
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,750
(Hikaridai, Yamakabe's House)
(Tenma-cho, Chikaba's House)
But Mr. Yamakabe's body was found after 9 pm,

268
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,338
(The spot of corpse)
But Mr. Yamakabe's body was found after 9 pm,

269
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,340
(Hikaridai, Yamakabe's House)
and when the local policemen

270
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,190
(Hikaridai, Yamakabe's House)
who were alerted by Inspector Megure visited...

271
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,802
Mr. Yamakabe.

272
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,300
It's the police.

273
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,700
What is this?

274
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:53,309
It already looked like there was a struggle,

275
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,811
and the decoration in question
was already there.

276
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,610
Of course, I'm also fully aware of that!

277
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,140
It's rather well thought out...

278
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,650
It just needs another element
to make it work.

279
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:16,310
It turned out to be just a piece of clay
that was on the table.

280
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,208
Perhaps...

281
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:22,129
Hello? It's Mouri.

282
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,505
About the clay you mentioned earlier...

283
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,300
What kind of clay was it?

284
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,801
So it's that type of clay?

285
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,100
Thank you.

286
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,900
That's it!

287
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,601
Yes... If Temukai had used that method,

288
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,228
it would have been possible.

289
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,938
But even if that's the case,

290
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:42,232
it only made the crime a possibility.

291
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:46,612
We need conclusive evidence to prove
that he's the real culprit.

292
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,600
That's why, Inspector...

293
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,032
Inspector Megure!

294
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,620
We haven't found any witnesses at all.

295
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,205
How about we widen the scope a little more...

296
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,206
Let's go.

297
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,207
Sorry?

298
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,150
Has Mouri not contacted you yet?

299
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,720
- Pardon?
- Didn't he tell you that

300
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,806
he's seen through the culprit's tricks

301
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,015
and ask you to secure the evidence?

302
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,310
He said there might be evidence,
and he could guess what it was already!

303
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,728
Secure the evidence?

304
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,813
It couldn't be...

305
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,607
- Isn't that...
- Temukai?

306
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,670
It's still here!

307
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,928
I didn't expect it would come to this...

308
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,723
Maybe I should have thrown it
into the ocean after all.

309
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,560
So that's how it is.

310
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,604
That must've been the real murder weapon.

311
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,530
You think you've cornered me this time?

312
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,405
I'll leave it to you
to explain what happened

313
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,850
since you were the one
who solved it, Mouri.

314
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,327
Me, sir?

315
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,414
Mouri?

316
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,126
Kyosuke Temukai,

317
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,837
you planned to kill Iwao Yamakabe

318
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:32,040
and steal the money
that was kept in his safe.

319
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,137
Your plan was to arrange things

320
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,139
to murder him in Tenma-cho

321
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,516
while making it look like

322
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,311
he was killed in faraway Hikaridai

323
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,439
and securing an alibi.

324
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,734
In that case,
wouldn't I have carried the body

325
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,528
all the way to the Yamakabe residence?

326
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,529
If I had the body,

327
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,114
I could have made it look like

328
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,824
it was the crime scene at once!

329
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,000
No.

330
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,411
If the body was moved,

331
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,830
there would have been traces of it on the body,

332
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,832
and we would have found out that

333
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,180
the victim was killed somewhere else
before being brought to his home.

334
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,422
You used that knowledge to your advantage

335
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:15,302
and left the body close to
where you murdered the victim.

336
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,012
At the same time,

337
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,515
if you ransacked the Yamakabe residence
from the inside,

338
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,225
just as you wanted,

339
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:27,620
you could make it look like
he was murdered there.

340
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,527
In addition, you would need
two murder weapons,

341
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,237
a fake one and a real one,

342
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,240
so that you could fabricate your alibi.

343
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,324
On the day of the murder,

344
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,535
you visited the Yamakabe residence

345
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,411
with the excuse of something
related to your publishing business.

346
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,750
You threatened Mr. Yamakabe
and forced him to open his safe.

347
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,503
Then, you waited for the sleeping drug
you slipped him to take effect

348
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,450
while preparing the two murder weapons.

349
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,716
Using a type of clay that softens when heated

350
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,600
and hardens when cooled,

351
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,014
you prepared the real murder weapon
by creating a mould

352
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,100
and filling it with resin
that hardens in UV light

353
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,518
as well as inserting a metal shaft

354
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,150
so that it weighs heavier than it looks.

355
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:12,109
Meanwhile, you placed Mr. Yamakabe's blood and hair
on the decoration

356
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:16,700
to disguise it as the item
that was used to kill him.

357
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,908
Then, you laid waste to the place

358
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:23,050
and carried the sleeping Yamakabe
out of his home.

359
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,708
In other words, the crime scene was set up

360
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,890
hours before he was killed.

361
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,922
It was fake, however.

362
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:40,137
After that,
with Mr. Yamakabe fast asleep in his car,

363
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,180
he visited Yasuko Chikaba's home.

364
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,810
At about 7 pm,
he went out to buy cigarettes...

365
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,313
And he killed Mr. Yamakabe in the car

366
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,732
using the real murder weapon.

367
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,403
In the end, you left Ms. Chikaba's home,

368
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,739
left Mr. Yamakabe's body
where it was found,

369
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,290
and got rid of the real murder weapon.

370
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,660
Then, you anonymously reported to the police
using the emergency number.

371
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,705
You made the police go out

372
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,625
as soon as possible to find Yamakabe's body,

373
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,502
determine the estimated time of death,

374
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,422
and visit his home.

375
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,717
It was all so that you could
clear yourself of a crime

376
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,303
that would be deemed impossible for you to do.

377
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,512
The next morning,

378
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,430
you caused a fake accident
to burn your car to ashes

379
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,519
so that there is no trace of the crime

380
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,313
that was done inside it.

381
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,025
Now that you've said it,

382
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,527
I can't talk my way out of this.

383
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,530
Everything is just
as Detective Mouri described.

384
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,202
You might have won this time,
Inspector Megure.

385
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,204
I could have easily thrown
this murder weapon

386
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,415
into the sea, you know.

387
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,504
I can't have you
underestimating the police, Temukai.

388
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:01,635
Even if the murder weapon
couldn't be found as you said,

389
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,429
as long as we found
that the alibi was fabricated,

390
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,070
we'd investigate you thoroughly.

391
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,935
We'll trace where the money went,

392
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,312
search the security camera,

393
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,731
confiscate every last item left behind

394
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,234
at the Yamakabe residence,

395
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,680
and have the entire forensics team
analyse the evidence.

396
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,406
We'll do everything we can

397
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,700
until we find evidence
that you did the crime!

398
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,470
This time, you saw me
following Detective Mouri's plan...

399
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,000
But that is what the police do!

400
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,715
Well then, Mr. Temukai,

401
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,800
please come with us to the station.

402
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,638
It looks like I didn't have to

403
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,933
turn in my resignation this time, Mouri.

404
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,727
You can always vent to me again

405
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,937
when you need to.

406
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,025
As if I'd let myself get down so often.

407
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,903
Wake up, Pops Kogoro!

408
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,531
It's already nightfall.

409
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,117
I just thought of a great idea, boy!

410
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,120
We're going to lure Temukai into a trap!

411
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,831
When we do that, we'll make him spit out

412
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,917
what kind of tricks he used!

413
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,002
You're not getting away with this, Temukai!

414
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,922
In the end, he's not solving the case himself...

415
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,800
(Next Episode)
Don't make me laugh!

416
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,530
You're never going to be able to
handle the accounting!

417
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,139
What did you say?

418
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,932
Stop it, you two!

419
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,930
Don't fight when we have people coming over!

420
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,227
Yes?

421
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,104
Mr. Yuichiro!

422
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,400
Was that the ingredient
for the new soft-serve ice cream?

423
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,318
Well, yes.

424
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,321
I want to take a look!

425
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,907
Next Conan,

426
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:15,036
"The Morikawa Palace's Plot (Part 1)"

427
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,804
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,931
"Key"

429
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,600
Is it true that you're in trouble, Inspector?

430
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,435
Yes, Mouri!

431
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,820
Are they really getting along?
