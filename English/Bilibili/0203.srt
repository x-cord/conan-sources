1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.640
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.340
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.240
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.940
Today's stage is at a hotel in the highlands.

5
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.840
A nasty customer attracts an unwanted case.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
He looks through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.040
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.699
Excuse me, I'd like to go to Hotel Arimori.

10
00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:02.199
Oh, cross this bridge and go straight down the road.

11
00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:04.099
Thank you very much.

12
00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.099
Dad, how did you find a hotel in a place like this?

13
00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.499
This place is well known for beer that is distinct of this area.

14
00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.299
Pops is after liquor after all.

15
00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.199
-It's over there! -We've finally arrived!

16
00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:34.599
"The Black Wings Of Icarus (Part 1)"

17
00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.399
Welcome.

18
00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.199
I am Mouri, and I have reservations here.

19
00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.299
You're Mr. Kogoro Mouri, I believe.

20
00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.199
We've been expecting you.

21
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.099
I am Arimori, the manager here.

22
00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.999
Yes, nice to be here.

23
00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.599
Please fill in this card.

24
00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.599
Welcome...

25
00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.099
You two are...

26
00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.499
the ones that were involved in the case of the cursed mask.

27
00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.599
Thank you so much for all you did for us back then.

28
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.799
What brings you here?

29
00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.699
An acquaintance introduced them to us.

30
00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:13.699
They were both looking forward to seeing you, too.

31
00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:18.099
I hope there are no cursed things here.

32
00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.099
I'm Shiromoto, and I have reservations here.

33
00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.599
Welcome.

34
00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.399
Mr. Shiromoto...

35
00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:30.699
Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto?

36
00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.799
You have reservations for two?

37
00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.399
Yes. My wife and I.

38
00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.799
I'm sure she'll be here in a minute.

39
00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.699
I don't know if it's some problem that the producer has or what,

40
00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.299
but he has no right to tell me to give my part up just like that!

41
00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.599
What? You're headed this way?

42
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.999
You don't have to come!

43
00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:48.199
Gosh!

44
00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.099
She's actress Chizuru Bizen.

45
00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.099
Yeah.

46
00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.599
You, just what is the meaning of this?

47
00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.699
Huh?

48
00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.699
I heard it was a nice place,

49
00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.299
and I'm brought all the way out in the mountains!

50
00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.299
It's a nice quiet place.

51
00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:07.899
I can't stand to think that I'm going to have

52
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.599
to spend 5 days together with you!

53
00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.699
Front desk clerk. Please give me a separate room.

54
00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.799
But...

55
00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.199
You can give my wife the suite that we reserved.

56
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.999
And get me another room.

57
00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.699
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.299
Take care of my bags, will you?

59
00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.299
Gosh! They don't even have an elevator!

60
00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:34.299
She sure is different from what she portrays

61
00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:36.099
to be on TV and in the movies.

62
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.699
Right.

63
00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.399
Minaho and Honami, please show them in.

64
00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.799
Yes, sir...

65
00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.599
This way, please.

66
00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.999
Mr. Mouri. If it's all right with you,

67
00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.899
would you like to rest a while in the restaurant?

68
00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:58.099
The restaurant?

69
00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.799
We can serve you some cold herb tea if you'd like.

70
00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:03.899
How nice!

71
00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.099
Dad, let's drop in for a rest.

72
00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.799
All right.

73
00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:10.599
I'd prefer a shot to herb tea though.

74
00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:15.399
What a nice restaurant!

75
00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:17.899
Welcome.

76
00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:19.899
She is our chef.

77
00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:25.399
I am Shinobu Shimon. Welcome to our restaurant.

78
00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.399
She designed everything

79
00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:30.899
from the layout to interior of this restaurant.

80
00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:33.099
Wow!

81
00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.499
It is my wish that our guests enjoy their meal

82
00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.099
in a relaxed atmosphere,

83
00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.599
with dishes made of ingredients that are unique of this district.

84
00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.499
I just can't wait for dinner time.

85
00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:47.099
I hear that you've got some really good local beer here.

86
00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.499
Of course, we've got that ready for you too.

87
00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:53.199
Shinobu, please serve our guests some herb tea.

88
00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.699
Yes, sir.

89
00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.999
I'd like to taste some of that local beer.

90
00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.199
Wait till night time!

91
00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:08.799
This sure is good!

92
00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:12.699
Dad, why don't you stop drinking and eat something?

93
00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.599
This soup is really good.

94
00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.899
I've never tasted such lousy soup!

95
00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:17.899
What?

96
00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:20.299
And you claim to be a chef?

97
00:06:20.299 --> 00:06:21.999
Cut it out, Chizuru.

98
00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:23.499
You stay out of this!

99
00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:28.799
Would you please tell me what you don't like about the soup?

100
00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:30.899
What I don't like?

101
00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:32.699
A guest is saying it tastes terrible!

102
00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.499
Can't you at least apologize?

103
00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:36.699
I am very sorry!

104
00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.299
I'll bring you a new bowl of soup immediately.

105
00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:41.399
Shinobu.

106
00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.099
Mr. Arimori!

107
00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.999
Understood.

108
00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:50.099
That's what you should've done in the first place.

109
00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:06.299
I heard from my husband

110
00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:10.999
that you are the renown detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

111
00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:13.099
It's an honor to meet you all.

112
00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.999
I... I am the one who is honored!

113
00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:19.499
I'm always looking forward to

114
00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:21.599
your great capacity of solving cases.

115
00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.399
I am Chizuru's husband, Shiromoto.

116
00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:31.499
Since I'm here on an inspection tour

117
00:07:31.499 --> 00:07:33.099
of the development of Leisure Land,

118
00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:35.499
we've decided to spend a holiday here while we're at it.

119
00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:39.499
Oh, so you're a business man.

120
00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:42.099
So, the rumor about the development was true after all.

121
00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:43.299
Huh?

122
00:07:43.299 --> 00:07:45.099
There are unusual butterflies

123
00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.299
inhabiting this highland area, as well as alpine plants.

124
00:07:48.299 --> 00:07:52.199
What are your plans on the preservation of all these things?

125
00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.899
As to that, we are planning to have a discussion

126
00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:56.299
with the local people here in time.

127
00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:57.999
Heck with the locals!

128
00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:59.999
There are people who are all worked up

129
00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:01.299
about preserving nature and all that anywhere.

130
00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:03.599
It's about cash, plain cash.

131
00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:05.899
What a thing to say, Chizuru.

132
00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:08.499
Did I say something upsetting?

133
00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:11.599
I'll divorce you any time if you want me to.

134
00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.199
But I wonder if you can pay me alimony

135
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.799
in your state of affairs right now?

136
00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:18.999
Chizuru!

137
00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:24.199
Chizuru, please, just this time!

138
00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:26.699
Please forget about the part! Please!

139
00:08:26.699 --> 00:08:30.099
You're still talking nonsense like that?

140
00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:32.099
For what reason in the first place?

141
00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:35.899
Well, Chizuru, I can't talk about that at here.

142
00:08:35.899 --> 00:08:38.299
Never mind! Just tell me!

143
00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.399
The sponsor doesn't want you.

144
00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:42.399
They want somebody who's younger...

145
00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:44.199
Rather, they want to use Reika,

146
00:08:44.199 --> 00:08:46.499
who debuted last year, since her popularity is on the rise.

147
00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:48.799
They say they won't dish out the cash otherwise.

148
00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.599
Reika belongs to our production too.

149
00:08:50.599 --> 00:08:52.099
So if this movie goes down the drain,

150
00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:53.699
we'll be thrown into hot water.

151
00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.599
Please try to understand, Chizuru!

152
00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:00.799
What? What's with that look on your face?

153
00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:04.399
I'll bet you'll all wishing that I were gone!

154
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.699
Okay, I'll die just like you want me to!

155
00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:08.499
Chizuru!

156
00:09:10.899 --> 00:09:12.699
She's troublesome.

157
00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:15.599
Well, don't let it bother you too much.

158
00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:18.899
Is this you, Mr. Arimori?

159
00:09:18.899 --> 00:09:19.899
Huh?

160
00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:22.899
See, that picture...

161
00:09:22.899 --> 00:09:24.399
Mr. Arimori is in the middle

162
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.799
and the one to the very right is Shinobu, right?

163
00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:28.799
Yes, that's right.

164
00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:32.799
We've been doing hand-gliding together.

165
00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:34.899
Hand-gliding?

166
00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:37.299
We used to be able to hand-glide

167
00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:39.699
in the highlands at the peak of a mountain before.

168
00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:40.699
We can't do so anymore

169
00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:42.699
because of all the developments that have been going on.

170
00:09:42.699 --> 00:09:44.799
That's too bad.

171
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:47.299
I used to do it too when I was young.

172
00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:50.799
Who is the man that is standing to the left of you, Mr. Arimori?

173
00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:51.799
Huh?

174
00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:54.399
Oh, that's my younger brother.

175
00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:57.599
We used to fly a lot together in the past.

176
00:09:57.599 --> 00:10:00.499
We haven't flown for 5 years already.

177
00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:03.999
The hand-gliders are left stored in the storage on the roof.

178
00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:08.799
Conan, let's go to the highlands tomorrow.

179
00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:10.899
It's just perfect for the sketch you have to do for your homework.

180
00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:11.999
Okay!

181
00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:26.799
Pops is snoring so loud that I can't sleep.

182
00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:30.499
I'm going to go buy some juice.

183
00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:38.799
Gosh, I can't reach the slot!

184
00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:40.699
Cut it out, won't you?

185
00:10:40.699 --> 00:10:43.799
What on earth did I do anyway? I have nothing to do with it!

186
00:10:59.599 --> 00:11:02.899
I wonder why Chizuru's so angry?

187
00:11:09.188 --> 00:11:11.488
"Next morning, 9 am"

188
00:11:18.388 --> 00:11:19.888
Mr. Shiromoto.

189
00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.088
How is Chizuru?

190
00:11:22.088 --> 00:11:24.388
I'm sorry about what happened last night.

191
00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:27.888
She always like that, so please don't let it bother you.

192
00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:29.488
I'm sure that she'll soon...

193
00:11:35.588 --> 00:11:37.888
Chizuru...

194
00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:41.188
Well, I mean...

195
00:11:41.188 --> 00:11:43.688
Hey, lady. You know last night...

196
00:11:43.688 --> 00:11:46.888
How rude to address her like that!

197
00:11:46.888 --> 00:11:49.388
Please don't let his remark bother you.

198
00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:53.188
Oh, no.

199
00:11:53.188 --> 00:11:57.188
Gosh! What am I supposed to do?

200
00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:59.488
It's impossible to convince her now.

201
00:11:59.488 --> 00:12:01.788
What do you say we go fishing together

202
00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:03.888
while we wait for her to cool off?

203
00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:05.688
My work schedule starts from tomorrow,

204
00:12:05.688 --> 00:12:09.188
so I was planning to spend the whole day fishing today.

205
00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:11.788
I'll lend you a fishing pole if you need one too.

206
00:12:11.788 --> 00:12:15.188
Yes, I'd like to go with you.

207
00:12:15.188 --> 00:12:18.988
Dad, let's go to the highlands at the top of the mountain.

208
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.988
You guys go on by yourselves!

209
00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:23.388
I've got an important mission to carry out.

210
00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:24.388
A mission?

211
00:12:24.388 --> 00:12:28.888
First, I've got to watch Yoko Okino's new release promotion video.

212
00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:31.188
Then, I'm going to watch her concert video

213
00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:33.288
which I got a hold of by a top secret method.

214
00:12:33.288 --> 00:12:34.388
Furthermore,

215
00:12:34.388 --> 00:12:38.388
I've got to watch the rerun of Yoko s drama special.

216
00:12:38.388 --> 00:12:41.288
Dad, what on earth did you come all the way here for?

217
00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:44.688
The rerun is broadcasting only in this district.

218
00:12:45.388 --> 00:12:48.188
So, you came all the way here to watch it.

219
00:12:48.188 --> 00:12:49.188
If you don't mind,

220
00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:51.888
would you like me to show you up the mountain?

221
00:12:51.888 --> 00:12:52.888
Huh?

222
00:12:52.888 --> 00:12:54.988
That would be a great help!

223
00:12:54.988 --> 00:12:58.788
Oh, right! Why don't you go along with them, too, Shinobu?

224
00:12:58.788 --> 00:13:02.388
-Huh? -I'll keep watch over the hotel.

225
00:13:02.388 --> 00:13:05.688
But I have to get everyone's meal ready, so...

226
00:13:05.688 --> 00:13:07.988
As for lunch, all you have to do is

227
00:13:07.988 --> 00:13:10.188
leave us some box lunches or something.

228
00:13:10.188 --> 00:13:13.788
We're going out too, so box lunch will be fine.

229
00:13:13.788 --> 00:13:16.988
But I still have to get dinner ready.

230
00:13:16.988 --> 00:13:20.888
Why don't you have barbecue out in the yard then?

231
00:13:20.888 --> 00:13:23.388
That'll save you the trouble of preparation, won't it?

232
00:13:23.388 --> 00:13:25.888
Since my wife gave you a bad time last night,

233
00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:29.088
why don't you go out today for a change and enjoy?

234
00:13:29.088 --> 00:13:33.188
We can handle preparations for the barbecue for you...

235
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.788
We aren't expecting any guests today,

236
00:13:35.788 --> 00:13:38.788
so why don't we accept their kindness and go?

237
00:13:38.788 --> 00:13:41.588
Go ahead...

238
00:13:41.588 --> 00:13:43.988
Okay, thank you so much.

239
00:13:45.488 --> 00:13:47.788
It'll only take about 15 minutes to the lake by car.

240
00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:49.488
"Start off time, 10 am" -Do you know the way?

241
00:13:49.488 --> 00:13:51.588
Yes, thank you.

242
00:13:51.588 --> 00:13:54.388
You'll get better catch after sundown there.

243
00:13:54.388 --> 00:13:57.188
Okay, we'll take our time and enjoy fishing till night then.

244
00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:01.288
Bye!

245
00:14:05.288 --> 00:14:07.288
I'll follow from behind using the van

246
00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:08.888
after I check if all the doors are locked,

247
00:14:08.888 --> 00:14:11.088
so you go on ahead.

248
00:14:11.088 --> 00:14:12.788
Please hurry, okay?

249
00:14:12.788 --> 00:14:13.888
Sure.

250
00:14:18.888 --> 00:14:21.188
I'm sure that Chizuru will start feeling better

251
00:14:21.188 --> 00:14:23.888
if she came out with us instead of staying locked up.

252
00:14:26.588 --> 00:14:28.588
Mission number 1!

253
00:14:28.588 --> 00:14:31.388
Watch Yoko's new release promotion video

254
00:14:31.388 --> 00:14:34.088
and master her new song completely!

255
00:14:34.088 --> 00:14:36.588
Yoko!

256
00:14:36.588 --> 00:14:38.288
Mr. Mouri.

257
00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:39.688
Yes?

258
00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:43.588
These are the master keys. I'll leave them to you

259
00:14:43.588 --> 00:14:45.688
Sure thing.

260
00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:54.788
Gosh, dad's hopeless!

261
00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:56.588
Mr. Arimori is not here yet?

262
00:14:56.588 --> 00:14:58.488
Huh?

263
00:14:58.488 --> 00:15:00.588
There he is.

264
00:15:06.288 --> 00:15:10.388
"10:50 am, at the highlands"

265
00:15:12.788 --> 00:15:15.188
The wind sure feels good!

266
00:15:31.188 --> 00:15:32.788
How wonderful!

267
00:15:32.788 --> 00:15:34.888
Fantastic!

268
00:15:53.188 --> 00:15:55.988
The real color of the sky is a clear blue like this one.

269
00:15:55.988 --> 00:15:57.888
Now we know.

270
00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:02.988
I feel like I could fly to the sun if I had wings.

271
00:16:02.988 --> 00:16:06.288
You talk like you were Icarus, don't you?

272
00:16:06.288 --> 00:16:08.288
Icarus?

273
00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:10.088
He appears in Greek Mythology.

274
00:16:10.088 --> 00:16:12.188
Icarus, who had wings...

275
00:16:12.188 --> 00:16:16.188
He forgot his father's warning telling him to keep from going to high,

276
00:16:16.188 --> 00:16:18.888
and flew high,

277
00:16:18.888 --> 00:16:22.088
believing that he could fly to the sun.

278
00:16:22.088 --> 00:16:25.488
However, since Icarus had flown too close to the sun,

279
00:16:25.488 --> 00:16:28.288
his wings could not tolerate the heat.

280
00:16:28.288 --> 00:16:30.388
And, Icarus, whose-wings were burned,

281
00:16:30.388 --> 00:16:33.588
went falling straight down to the ground.

282
00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:37.688
It's a sad story.

283
00:16:41.788 --> 00:16:43.288
How cute!

284
00:16:43.288 --> 00:16:46.288
Oh, it's called Miyama White Butterfly

285
00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:47.888
and lives only up here in the highlands here.

286
00:16:55.788 --> 00:16:57.388
That butterfly...

287
00:16:59.188 --> 00:17:04.288
This butterfly cannot live unless the water is clean.

288
00:17:10.288 --> 00:17:15.588
Yoko...

289
00:17:16.288 --> 00:17:18.088
Love you! Love you!

290
00:17:18.088 --> 00:17:21.188
"12:30 pm, at hotel lobby"

291
00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:24.488
I absentmindedly forgot my lunch.

292
00:17:25.888 --> 00:17:28.288
Is Chizuru still in her room?

293
00:17:28.288 --> 00:17:31.288
Yes. She hasn't come down since...

294
00:17:31.288 --> 00:17:33.788
I guess I'll go check on her.

295
00:17:39.088 --> 00:17:43.288
"1 pm, at the lakeside"

296
00:17:49.488 --> 00:17:52.788
I wonder if Chizuru's in a better mood by now.

297
00:17:56.688 --> 00:17:59.088
"1:30 pm, at hotel lobby"

298
00:17:59.088 --> 00:18:03.088
How's your wife doing?

299
00:18:03.088 --> 00:18:05.788
It seems that she's asleep

300
00:18:05.788 --> 00:18:08.588
because she won't answer the door in spite of me knocking.

301
00:18:08.588 --> 00:18:12.688
It's not easy having a wife who's strong willed, is it?

302
00:18:12.688 --> 00:18:15.288
You can say that again.

303
00:18:15.288 --> 00:18:17.788
I'm going back fishing.

304
00:18:17.788 --> 00:18:19.388
Enjoy.

305
00:18:22.388 --> 00:18:23.588
There!

306
00:18:23.588 --> 00:18:26.488
"1:50 pm, at the highlands"

307
00:18:29.488 --> 00:18:32.788
Line out! It's Conan's win.

308
00:18:32.788 --> 00:18:34.288
What do you say, it's about time we have lunch?

309
00:18:34.288 --> 00:18:36.388
Oh, my. It's already this time of day.

310
00:18:36.388 --> 00:18:38.088
I'll go get our lunches.

311
00:18:45.788 --> 00:18:48.688
"2:15 pm, at the lake" -Wow, this is a big one!

312
00:18:50.588 --> 00:18:52.088
We've got a big catch today!

313
00:18:52.088 --> 00:18:53.088
Yes, very true!

314
00:18:58.288 --> 00:19:03.488
"2:25 pm, at hotel lobby" -Yoko! Don't go that way!

315
00:19:07.088 --> 00:19:09.188
How beautiful.

316
00:19:09.188 --> 00:19:11.188
Really.

317
00:19:11.188 --> 00:19:14.588
The view of the sunset from here is always beautiful.

318
00:19:14.588 --> 00:19:17.488
See? The building that is lighted up at the foot of the mountain

319
00:19:17.488 --> 00:19:19.088
is Hotel Arimori.

320
00:19:19.088 --> 00:19:22.288
Wow, it's so far below.

321
00:19:22.288 --> 00:19:25.088
So, shall we start heading back?

322
00:19:25.088 --> 00:19:26.488
Yes.

323
00:19:26.488 --> 00:19:30.288
"6:05 pm, they head down the mountain"

324
00:19:36.388 --> 00:19:38.388
What's the matter?

325
00:19:38.388 --> 00:19:40.688
The engine seems to be in bad shape.

326
00:19:40.688 --> 00:19:42.788
You can go on ahead.

327
00:19:42.788 --> 00:19:44.288
Okay.

328
00:19:51.388 --> 00:19:54.188
"7 pm, at the hotel" -We're back!

329
00:19:54.188 --> 00:19:57.188
You should've come with us, dad.

330
00:19:57.188 --> 00:19:59.488
The sunset was beautiful!

331
00:19:59.488 --> 00:20:01.688
We saw a rare butterfly, too.

332
00:20:01.688 --> 00:20:04.188
One that is said to never to come near people,

333
00:20:04.188 --> 00:20:07.088
but that butterfly stopped on Mr. Arimori's shoulder.

334
00:20:07.088 --> 00:20:09.688
Yeah, okay okay!

335
00:20:09.688 --> 00:20:11.688
Hi, there.

336
00:20:11.688 --> 00:20:13.588
Big catch we have here!

337
00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.488
Welcome back.

338
00:20:15.488 --> 00:20:17.088
How is Chizuru doing?

339
00:20:17.088 --> 00:20:20.488
Come to think of it, she hasn't come down at all.

340
00:20:20.488 --> 00:20:21.788
Not at all?

341
00:20:21.788 --> 00:20:24.788
What a nuisance.

342
00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:27.988
Mr. Mouri, could I have the master key?

343
00:20:27.988 --> 00:20:30.988
Yes, sure.

344
00:20:30.988 --> 00:20:32.488
Thank you.

345
00:20:35.688 --> 00:20:36.988
Here go the catch for today.

346
00:20:36.988 --> 00:20:39.788
-I'll leave the rest up to you two. -Yes, Hotel Arimori.

347
00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:41.688
Oh, Mr. Arimori.

348
00:20:41.688 --> 00:20:43.488
I can't get my car started.

349
00:20:43.488 --> 00:20:45.588
I hate to trouble you, but could I have you come pick me up?

350
00:20:45.588 --> 00:20:46.788
Okay.

351
00:20:50.788 --> 00:20:54.188
I will go with you, just in case.

352
00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:56.488
I'm very sorry, Ran.

353
00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:10.288
Mr. Mouri! Chizuru doesn't look well!

354
00:21:10.288 --> 00:21:11.388
What?

355
00:21:11.388 --> 00:21:13.088
I opened the door of her room with the key,

356
00:21:13.088 --> 00:21:14.688
but the door guard is set,

357
00:21:14.688 --> 00:21:17.088
and she won't answer no matter how much I call out to her!

358
00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:19.288
Oh, no!

359
00:21:24.688 --> 00:21:27.288
Chizuru...

360
00:21:27.288 --> 00:21:28.788
Let's break the door open.

361
00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:30.188
Yes, sir!

362
00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:41.288
"7:20 pm, corpse found"

363
00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:45.188
-Chizuru! -Chizuru!

364
00:21:51.588 --> 00:21:54.088
Mr. Mouri, how is she?

365
00:21:54.088 --> 00:21:55.488
I'm sorry to say that

366
00:21:55.488 --> 00:21:59.288
it's been a while since she's passed away.

367
00:22:03.988 --> 00:22:06.188
It can't be...

368
00:22:10.488 --> 00:22:12.388
The metal part of the door guard...

369
00:22:13.288 --> 00:22:15.488
Scratches?

370
00:22:15.488 --> 00:22:17.088
Don't tell me that...

371
00:22:19.888 --> 00:22:22.488
Just as I thought.

372
00:22:22.488 --> 00:22:24.088
Chizuru...

373
00:22:24.088 --> 00:22:26.588
did not commit suicide!

374
00:22:27.988 --> 00:22:30.288
She was killed by someone!

375
00:23:58.688 --> 00:23:59.888
"Next Episode" -Look!

376
00:23:59.888 --> 00:24:01.688
There are strange scratches here.

377
00:24:01.688 --> 00:24:02.788
Scratches?

378
00:24:02.788 --> 00:24:06.088
That's the part that the metal part of the door guard used to be.

379
00:24:07.188 --> 00:24:08.588
The air conditioner!

380
00:24:08.588 --> 00:24:11.588
It wasn't running since we found the corpse.

381
00:24:11.588 --> 00:24:14.388
Don't tell me that Chizuru was...

382
00:24:14.388 --> 00:24:17.288
-You mean she was killed? -The murderer is among us?

383
00:24:17.288 --> 00:24:20.188
Yes. The killer is...

384
00:24:20.188 --> 00:24:22.688
the only one possible is you!

385
00:24:23.488 --> 00:24:28.509
Next Conan, "The Black Wings Of Icarus (Part 2)"

386
00:24:28.806 --> 00:24:30.906
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:33.806
"Wind"

388
00:24:33.806 --> 00:24:35.106
The case is solved in the next episode.

389
00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:37.606
Oh, dad, you're a suspect again.
