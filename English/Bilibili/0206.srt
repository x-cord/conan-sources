1
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.940
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.840
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.740
Mystery after mystery, the case of arson and robbery.

4
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.740
The two cases overlap and become one.

5
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.199
After Ayumi says that she had witnessed the arsonist

9
00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.799
of the succession of arson cases in the city,

10
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.699
we, the Youth Detective Squad,

11
00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:05.299
Officer Takagi and Sato start investigating the case.

12
00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:10.199
That day also happened to be the memorial day

13
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.899
when Officer Sato's father died on duty,

14
00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.199
so his friends during his school days were also having a get together.

15
00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:23.999
"Love Story At Headquarters 3 (Part 2)"

16
00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.899
What're you doing?

17
00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.099
What's the matter? Officer Sato, you're soaking with sweat.

18
00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.399
It's this pub, isn't it?

19
00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.699
Okay, then let's get off quick!

20
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.099
No.

21
00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.999
I'm in there alone.

22
00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.999
I'm coming right back, so you all stay put.

23
00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.499
Gosh.

24
00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.699
What're you doing, Ai?

25
00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.699
Since we've got nothing to do while we're waiting,

26
00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.299
I thought I'd check the places

27
00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.599
that were attacked by the arsonist up to now.

28
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.499
Do any of you remember the places where the fire took place?

29
00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.399
Oh, I remember!

30
00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.599
All of them happened near the station.

31
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.999
The first happened in Ikebukuro,

32
00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:11.399
the second one in Asakusabashi,

33
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.499
the third in Tabata and the fourth in Shimokitazawa.

34
00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.399
The third in Tabata and the fourth in Shimokitazawa...

35
00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.999
And the fifth is Yotsuya, where Ayumi saw the arsonist.

36
00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.499
It's just a simple trapezoid even if connected.

37
00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.899
There seems to be no special consistency or anything.

38
00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.899
It sure looks like a scooper from here.

39
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:33.299
You mean a soup ladle, right?

40
00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.599
Soup ladle?

41
00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.899
Maybe this is the shape of an unfinished Big Dipper?

42
00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:40.799
No. Because if so,

43
00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
the handle of the ladle should be on the left side.

44
00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.699
Hey, Conan. Why don't you help us out?

45
00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.199
Huh?

46
00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:49.399
He's gone!

47
00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.099
Not again.

48
00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.199
What? They left?

49
00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.599
All four together?

50
00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.699
Yeah, just about 40 minutes ago.

51
00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.499
Something about feeling uncomfortable about the arson

52
00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:04.699
still at large in this area, so they left.

53
00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.499
Do you know what the four were talking about with each other?

54
00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.699
Conan?

55
00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.499
Yeah! They were having a ball

56
00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:14.999
saying that good things kept coming.

57
00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.399
Mr. Inomata was saying

58
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.299
that today was his company's 15th anniversary.

59
00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.599
Something about his company had never been

60
00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.499
in the reds since its establishment.

61
00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.999
Mr. Kano was saying that tomorrow was his 50th birthday.

62
00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.499
He said that his studying in Italy for 3 years bore fruit,

63
00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.999
and that his shop was doing just great.

64
00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:34.299
Mrs. Kandori looked happy saying that her daughter just got married

65
00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:35.799
to a well-to-do man yesterday.

66
00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:37.999
As for Mr. Saruwatari, he said that

67
00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.199
his son just had their second baby boy this morning,

68
00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.599
but he added, he had mixed feelings

69
00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:46.799
because today was also your father's memorial day.

70
00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:52.199
The killer of that case is sure a ruthless one, isn't he?

71
00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.399
Not only did the robber take off with 500,000,000 yen,

72
00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.799
he killed the security guard that tried to stop him

73
00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:58.299
by hitting him on the head with the rifle

74
00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:00.699
that he had hidden behind his coat.

75
00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.999
On top of that, he kills the Police Commissioner.

76
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.799
Killed...

77
00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:07.999
Didn't he die of an accident?

78
00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:09.499
There was a witness.

79
00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:10.899
Huh?

80
00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:12.199
The witness said that it looked to be

81
00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.299
that my father was pushed in front of the truck from behind.

82
00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:20.899
I'm sure that Conan's in the store.

83
00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:23.899
He's really good at being sneaky.

84
00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:26.499
Don't tell me he's eating something in there?

85
00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.899
Like fried chicken or pork skewers!

86
00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:33.099
All you have in your head is eels over rice and meat, don't you?

87
00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.699
You'll have to eat vegetables to or you'll die young.

88
00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.099
The bad guy was saying something about

89
00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.999
he had just one more vegetable and it'll be over.

90
00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:43.999
-Vegetable? -Yes.

91
00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:46.899
Vege, eve or something like that.

92
00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.699
Eve?

93
00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.799
Just one more and the eve will be over?

94
00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.199
Don't tell me that this is...

95
00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.399
Gosh! I wonder what he's eating?

96
00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:01.999
Ai?

97
00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.999
-I'm closing the door. -Okay.

98
00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.599
Hey! No fair, Ai!

99
00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.299
What? She's going to eat something!

100
00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:15.099
Stay out until I get back.

101
00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.699
Gosh.

102
00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:22.399
How come we end up staying in here?

103
00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:34.999
What's wrong?

104
00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:37.499
He... he's the one!

105
00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:39.499
The bad man that I saw!

106
00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.799
What?

107
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.599
But don't you think the shop owner is too well-informed?

108
00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:47.599
What?

109
00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.099
Like knowing that he was struck by a rifle.

110
00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.899
I knew nothing about it.

111
00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:54.299
On the day of the incident,

112
00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:55.899
the shots that were taken by the surveillance camera

113
00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:57.899
was aired on TV.

114
00:06:57.899 --> 00:07:01.199
It was too violent so it was cut immediately.

115
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.799
I'm more worried about Officer Takagi right now.

116
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.599
The least we need to figure out is

117
00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.399
whether the one who attacked him

118
00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.599
was the killer of 18 years ago, or the arsonist.

119
00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.599
Otherwise, there is no way finding him.

120
00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:13.099
Shinagawa.

121
00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.499
Ai?

122
00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:19.799
The next place the arson is going to show up is Shinagawa.

123
00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:22.399
What? Shinagawa?

124
00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.999
Look.

125
00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:25.699
Leaving the first arson that occurred in Ikebukuro

126
00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.599
and the second arson that occurred in Asakusabashi as is,

127
00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.199
then connect the third site of the arson that occurred in Tabata

128
00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:33.199
to the fourth that occurred in Shimokitazawa

129
00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.499
with a line to the fifth site, Yotsuya,

130
00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:37.599
over to Shinagawa here.

131
00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:40.199
Fire?

132
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.399
Yes. The arsonist was writing the Japanese kanji character "fire"

133
00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.899
on the ground of Tokyo,

134
00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.699
in the correct writing order of the word.

135
00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.799
Then, don't tell me that the one who attacked Officer Takagi is...

136
00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:53.599
Yes. If the arsonist mistakenly thought

137
00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:58.099
that he had been witnessed, it's possible.

138
00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:00.699
If that were to be true,

139
00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:02.999
there should be a corpse rolling around

140
00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:04.499
nearby the next site of the fire,

141
00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:06.599
just like in the fourth case.

142
00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:19.499
Okay, everybody...

143
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:20.699
Huh?

144
00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:22.499
What? Oh, no!

145
00:08:22.499 --> 00:08:24.499
The children are gone!

146
00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:25.599
Huh?

147
00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:30.699
Officer Sato.

148
00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.399
Officer Shiratori.

149
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:35.099
Didn't you see the children?

150
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:38.199
No. Weren't they with you?

151
00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:40.299
Well, you see...

152
00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:46.899
Conan, Conan. Can you hear me?

153
00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:48.299
Ayumi!

154
00:08:48.299 --> 00:08:51.299
Hey! Where are you guys and what're you doing?

155
00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:57.699
Don't yell. The killer will hear you!

156
00:08:57.699 --> 00:08:59.199
What? The killer?

157
00:08:59.199 --> 00:09:00.799
The man that Ayumi had seen before

158
00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:03.299
coincidentally walked by the pub,

159
00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:05.399
so we're tailing him now.

160
00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.399
What?

161
00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:10.299
We're at the warehouse district in Shinagawa 6-chome right now.

162
00:09:10.299 --> 00:09:11.399
Hey, take a look at that.

163
00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:14.299
He's pouring something onto the newspaper.

164
00:09:14.299 --> 00:09:17.199
What? The guy hasn't set fire yet?

165
00:09:17.199 --> 00:09:19.399
Which means that the one who attacked Officer Takagi

166
00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:21.599
wasn't the arsonist.

167
00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:23.199
Excuse me, Officer Shiratori.

168
00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:24.799
Did you notice anything strange

169
00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:27.399
before parting with Officer Takagi?

170
00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:30.099
I think he was looking up at the board with the names of the stations

171
00:09:30.099 --> 00:09:32.799
on the platform of Shinagawa Station.

172
00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:34.499
Station name board?

173
00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:38.299
I see!

174
00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:40.699
That's why Officer Takagi figured it out.

175
00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:44.199
The meaning of the last words of Officer Sato's father, "Shushiro",

176
00:09:44.199 --> 00:09:47.299
the identity of the "kan-o" that was written in his police book,

177
00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.099
and the reason why he was able to specify the killer

178
00:09:49.099 --> 00:09:51.199
with only a few clues.

179
00:09:51.199 --> 00:09:52.899
There's no doubt about it.

180
00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:55.799
The killer is among the four.

181
00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:59.299
And the one who attacked Officer Takagi is also...

182
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.899
Hey, you guys.

183
00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.499
We'll head on that way with Officer Shiratori's car right now,

184
00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:05.599
so don't move.

185
00:10:05.599 --> 00:10:08.899
-Huh? -Let's go in my car, then.

186
00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:12.299
No. Your destination is not there, Officer Sato.

187
00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:13.399
Huh?

188
00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:16.999
You'll have to go and settle the case that happened 18 years ago.

189
00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:18.499
Settle the case?

190
00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:21.399
Perhaps it isn't over yet.

191
00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:30.199
Yeah, that's a good boy. Grow...

192
00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:32.899
Hey, I don't believe it.

193
00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:35.099
He really set fire.

194
00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:58.288
The hint is the row of the Roman alphabet where the letter "na" is.

195
00:10:58.288 --> 00:11:00.088
I'm sure that Officer Takagi realized it

196
00:11:00.088 --> 00:11:03.288
when he was looking at the board with the names of the station on it.

197
00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.088
It's a very simple magic of letters.

198
00:11:06.088 --> 00:11:10.188
That person probably also knows where Officer Takagi is.

199
00:11:10.188 --> 00:11:12.888
Although it may be impossible to arrest him now,

200
00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:15.588
he may reveal the truth to you.

201
00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:17.688
The truth of what happened 18 years ago.

202
00:11:20.188 --> 00:11:22.088
Is it going to be okay?

203
00:11:22.088 --> 00:11:24.788
The fire is getting bigger.

204
00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:27.188
I'm sure everything will be all right

205
00:11:27.188 --> 00:11:30.088
because Conan should've contacted the fire department by now.

206
00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:34.188
Don't we need to tail the arsonist?

207
00:11:34.188 --> 00:11:37.788
No! Remember, Conan told us not to move?

208
00:11:37.788 --> 00:11:41.388
But I think that it's been 10 minutes since then already.

209
00:11:41.388 --> 00:11:44.688
No, not even 5 minutes have passed yet.

210
00:11:44.688 --> 00:11:46.688
It's too dark that I can't see.

211
00:11:50.388 --> 00:11:53.988
Now you can see it clearly, can't you? Brats.

212
00:11:55.688 --> 00:11:57.488
Don't worry.

213
00:11:57.488 --> 00:12:00.388
I'll line you all up in a row

214
00:12:00.388 --> 00:12:03.288
as the sacrificial offering of the real carnival

215
00:12:03.288 --> 00:12:05.188
that is about to begin.

216
00:12:20.688 --> 00:12:22.988
Hi, Miwako.

217
00:12:22.988 --> 00:12:25.088
Did you finish work?

218
00:12:25.088 --> 00:12:27.388
Well, sort of.

219
00:12:27.388 --> 00:12:29.888
But as you can see, they're almost ready to close.

220
00:12:29.888 --> 00:12:31.588
Who cares.

221
00:12:31.588 --> 00:12:33.588
Let me at least treat you to a drink.

222
00:12:33.588 --> 00:12:37.988
Tomorrow's your long awaited 50th birthday, isn't it?

223
00:12:37.988 --> 00:12:39.888
I guess so, but at 50,

224
00:12:39.888 --> 00:12:42.288
you don't really care about birthdays anymore.

225
00:12:42.288 --> 00:12:44.688
I'm sure you've been looking forward to the day.

226
00:12:46.088 --> 00:12:47.888
Because after midnight this evening,

227
00:12:47.888 --> 00:12:50.688
the "Shushiro" incident that occurred 18 years ago

228
00:12:50.688 --> 00:12:52.588
will to your joy expire.

229
00:12:52.588 --> 00:12:54.288
Huh?

230
00:12:56.088 --> 00:13:00.388
So, let's toast in celebration, shall we?

231
00:13:00.388 --> 00:13:02.288
Mr. "Kan-o"?

232
00:13:07.088 --> 00:13:10.288
Gosh. What is going on?

233
00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:14.288
I remember! Somebody hit me from behind.

234
00:13:15.988 --> 00:13:19.288
I've got to do something about these handcuffs.

235
00:13:19.288 --> 00:13:22.288
All right! My gun's still here!

236
00:13:22.288 --> 00:13:25.188
Okay, I'll shoot the chain off.

237
00:13:31.888 --> 00:13:33.688
Kan-o.

238
00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:34.888
The three mysterious letters

239
00:13:34.888 --> 00:13:37.488
that were written in my father's police I.D. book.

240
00:13:37.488 --> 00:13:41.088
If written in Roman letters, it is read "KANO".

241
00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.488
If "n" is put together with the vowel "0", it is read...

242
00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:45.288
Kano.

243
00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:46.688
I called Mr. Saruwatari and the others

244
00:13:46.688 --> 00:13:48.788
and confirmed with them too just a while ago.

245
00:13:48.788 --> 00:13:50.688
They told me that "Kan-o" is probably the nickname my father gave you

246
00:13:50.688 --> 00:13:53.788
when you used to play baseball together in your school days.

247
00:13:53.788 --> 00:13:56.688
But until I asked them about it,

248
00:13:56.688 --> 00:13:58.488
they told me that they thought you used to be called by a strange name,

249
00:13:58.488 --> 00:14:00.888
something like Kan-o" or "Kao".

250
00:14:00.888 --> 00:14:03.688
They never really figured out for sure what you were being called.

251
00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:06.388
The reason why my father specified you as the suspect was because

252
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.588
he saw the picture of the man who hit the security guard with the rifle

253
00:14:08.588 --> 00:14:11.888
on the surveillance camera.

254
00:14:11.888 --> 00:14:14.088
Father used to always tell me

255
00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:16.088
that although you had a unique batting form,

256
00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:19.188
you were the most skilled batter of the team.

257
00:14:20.488 --> 00:14:21.588
You've got to be kidding,

258
00:14:21.588 --> 00:14:24.188
suspecting me as the killer just because of something like that.

259
00:14:24.188 --> 00:14:27.888
Besides, that case expired 3 years ago, didn't it?

260
00:14:27.888 --> 00:14:29.588
No, not yet.

261
00:14:29.588 --> 00:14:31.988
To put it accurately, there's still 8 minutes and 17 seconds to go.

262
00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:35.688
You should know that if the suspect goes abroad,

263
00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:40.188
the period that the suspect is abroad is counted out.

264
00:14:40.188 --> 00:14:43.588
I've already checked it out with the Ministry of Justice.

265
00:14:43.588 --> 00:14:46.488
And I've also figured out that you set it up

266
00:14:46.488 --> 00:14:50.088
to come back from Italy on your 50th birthday,

267
00:14:50.088 --> 00:14:53.088
so that you wouldn't forget the expiration date of the case.

268
00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:12.988
No! Not until you tell me what really happened.

269
00:15:12.988 --> 00:15:14.688
What?

270
00:15:14.688 --> 00:15:16.288
Father used to say that

271
00:15:16.288 --> 00:15:17.988
a suspect who is on the verge of confessing the crime

272
00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:21.488
always gulps and reaches out for a cup of tea.

273
00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:23.588
And if you give the suspect the tea,

274
00:15:23.588 --> 00:15:27.088
he will swallow the confession together with the tea.

275
00:15:27.088 --> 00:15:30.088
I won't let you swallow this case into yourself.

276
00:15:30.088 --> 00:15:32.688
Not even if your throat gets so parched

277
00:15:32.688 --> 00:15:33.988
that you dry out and wither!

278
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.488
Ayumi!

279
00:15:40.488 --> 00:15:42.988
No...

280
00:15:42.988 --> 00:15:45.788
-Let go of me! -You all come here quietly too.

281
00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:47.388
Hey.

282
00:15:48.588 --> 00:15:50.188
What's another way of saying,

283
00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:51.988
being kicked in the rear end?

284
00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:59.988
Butt kick...

285
00:16:00.788 --> 00:16:02.588
Right.

286
00:16:04.288 --> 00:16:07.888
I sure kicked something really stupid again.

287
00:16:07.888 --> 00:16:09.988
Officer Shiratori! This way!

288
00:16:09.988 --> 00:16:12.088
-Huh? -This way...

289
00:16:12.088 --> 00:16:13.488
Hurry!

290
00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:17.188
A can of kerosene and matches.

291
00:16:17.188 --> 00:16:19.188
I think we've really got him this time.

292
00:16:19.188 --> 00:16:22.388
Is that warehouse going to be all right, letting it burn on like that?

293
00:16:22.388 --> 00:16:24.588
It's burning pretty badly.

294
00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:26.988
That warehouse was scheduled to be demolished next week anyway,

295
00:16:26.988 --> 00:16:28.488
and it's empty inside.

296
00:16:28.488 --> 00:16:31.088
Besides, the firefighters are busy extinguishing the fire now.

297
00:16:33.988 --> 00:16:35.988
Darn it!

298
00:16:50.788 --> 00:16:52.488
Congratulations.

299
00:16:52.488 --> 00:16:54.288
I lose.

300
00:16:56.788 --> 00:16:59.488
I had no intention of killing him.

301
00:16:59.488 --> 00:17:01.788
Huh?

302
00:17:01.788 --> 00:17:04.188
You mean my father?

303
00:17:04.188 --> 00:17:07.088
No! The security guard!

304
00:17:07.088 --> 00:17:08.288
I just tried to brush him away,

305
00:17:08.288 --> 00:17:10.088
but I seem to have hit him in the wrong place.

306
00:17:10.088 --> 00:17:12.388
What about my father, then?

307
00:17:12.388 --> 00:17:15.988
You kicked him at the intersection, didn't you?

308
00:17:15.988 --> 00:17:20.688
No. I'm the one who was kicked.

309
00:17:20.688 --> 00:17:22.788
Huh?

310
00:17:22.788 --> 00:17:26.688
Back then, he saw through all of me

311
00:17:26.688 --> 00:17:29.488
and I was about to be taken to the station by him.

312
00:17:30.488 --> 00:17:33.388
I suddenly got scared

313
00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:36.488
when I thought about my future

314
00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.788
that I dashed out in front of the truck...

315
00:17:40.088 --> 00:17:42.488
Then he...

316
00:17:42.488 --> 00:17:44.188
He pushed me...

317
00:17:49.288 --> 00:17:53.688
He gave me another chance to do my life over again.

318
00:17:53.688 --> 00:17:57.088
But even if you start over with the money you robbed...

319
00:17:57.088 --> 00:18:00.288
No! I haven't touched that money!

320
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.388
I have it hidden under the Buddhist altar at home.

321
00:18:03.388 --> 00:18:04.688
I was planning to give the money back

322
00:18:04.688 --> 00:18:06.788
as soon as the case expired.

323
00:18:06.788 --> 00:18:09.288
This is true! Please believe me!

324
00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:11.688
Sure, I'll believe you.

325
00:18:11.688 --> 00:18:13.588
Officer Chiba, did you hear all that?

326
00:18:13.588 --> 00:18:14.988
Yes, all of it.

327
00:18:14.988 --> 00:18:17.388
Get a warrant immediately and confiscate everything.

328
00:18:17.388 --> 00:18:20.188
If the license number matches, we've no better proof.

329
00:18:20.188 --> 00:18:22.488
Attach the tape of this conversation onto the money

330
00:18:22.488 --> 00:18:23.688
and send it in to the criminal Investigation section.

331
00:18:23.688 --> 00:18:26.688
Make sure he is indicted today, understand?

332
00:18:26.688 --> 00:18:27.688
Yes!

333
00:18:27.688 --> 00:18:30.388
Hurry, because we've only got one day left!

334
00:18:30.388 --> 00:18:31.988
One day left?

335
00:18:31.988 --> 00:18:33.688
You mean you didn't realize

336
00:18:33.688 --> 00:18:36.288
that when you came back from Italy,

337
00:18:36.288 --> 00:18:37.688
remember, there was a typhoon?

338
00:18:37.688 --> 00:18:39.388
Yeah.

339
00:18:39.388 --> 00:18:41.888
The flight that was scheduled to arrive at 21:00,

340
00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:45.688
was delayed and arrived at 00:04.

341
00:18:45.688 --> 00:18:48.488
Which means that your calculation of the expiration date of the case,

342
00:18:48.488 --> 00:18:51.888
was one day off.

343
00:18:51.888 --> 00:18:53.688
My sympathies.

344
00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:59.088
I had a bad feeling

345
00:18:59.088 --> 00:19:01.288
because your face when you came here today

346
00:19:01.288 --> 00:19:03.988
Iooked just like your father's back then.

347
00:19:03.988 --> 00:19:06.288
If you refused to confess,

348
00:19:06.288 --> 00:19:09.388
I was ready to turn your house over

349
00:19:09.388 --> 00:19:11.388
and look for the money in order to arrest you.

350
00:19:11.388 --> 00:19:13.688
But my father was different.

351
00:19:13.688 --> 00:19:17.188
He could've told me your name in the ambulance,

352
00:19:17.188 --> 00:19:20.388
but he believed you, so he didn't.

353
00:19:20.388 --> 00:19:22.888
My father turned towards you

354
00:19:22.888 --> 00:19:25.188
as you fled from the intersection and said,

355
00:19:25.188 --> 00:19:26.888
"Turn yourself in."

356
00:19:27.888 --> 00:19:30.588
Because his gasping remark sounded like "Shushiro"

357
00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:34.788
to the people who were there at that time, they heard wrong.

358
00:19:34.788 --> 00:19:37.288
Now, tell me where Officer Takagi is.

359
00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:38.788
Where is he?

360
00:19:38.788 --> 00:19:42.388
Inside a dilapidated warehouse in Shinagawa 6-chome.

361
00:19:42.388 --> 00:19:45.488
I was going to report it to the police later and inform them though.

362
00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:47.688
Hey, that's...

363
00:19:49.688 --> 00:19:51.488
Is that true?

364
00:19:51.488 --> 00:19:53.688
Is Officer Takagi really in there?

365
00:19:53.688 --> 00:19:55.888
If so, he's probably already...

366
00:19:55.888 --> 00:19:58.188
What do you think you're saying? You'll still make it!

367
00:19:58.188 --> 00:19:59.388
Move!

368
00:19:59.388 --> 00:20:00.688
No, Officer Sato!

369
00:20:00.688 --> 00:20:02.188
Move, I said!

370
00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:07.688
You idiot.

371
00:20:07.688 --> 00:20:09.988
I have been appointed here today.

372
00:20:09.988 --> 00:20:11.288
My name is Wataru Takagi!

373
00:20:11.288 --> 00:20:14.188
Uh, Officer Sato...

374
00:20:14.188 --> 00:20:16.188
Officer Sato?

375
00:20:16.188 --> 00:20:18.588
Officer Sato!

376
00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:20.088
You idiot, idiot!

377
00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:24.988
It seems that today is my super lucky day.

378
00:20:24.988 --> 00:20:27.788
You idiot Takagi!

379
00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:29.388
Oh, yes.

380
00:20:34.088 --> 00:20:35.488
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:35.488 --> 00:20:38.288
-Takagi! -Just what are you doing there?

382
00:20:38.288 --> 00:20:40.388
Well, I'm...

383
00:20:41.388 --> 00:20:43.888
When I pulled on the bars, it came off

384
00:20:43.888 --> 00:20:45.688
so I got out through the window.

385
00:20:45.688 --> 00:20:47.588
I was walking back and forth,

386
00:20:47.588 --> 00:20:50.388
then was mistaken for one of the onlookers.

387
00:20:50.388 --> 00:20:51.788
Hey!

388
00:20:51.788 --> 00:20:53.988
-Get an ambulance! -Hurry!

389
00:20:53.988 --> 00:20:55.188
Yes, sir!

390
00:20:55.188 --> 00:20:57.788
How can you walk around hurt like this?

391
00:20:57.788 --> 00:21:00.988
What? Come on, you've got your gun!

392
00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:04.188
Why didn't you use your gun to blow the chain off the handcuffs?

393
00:21:04.188 --> 00:21:07.488
He didn't want to break those handcuffs.

394
00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:10.688
That's your father's keepsake, isn't it, Officer Sato?

395
00:21:10.688 --> 00:21:12.388
That's why he didn't use his gun.

396
00:21:12.388 --> 00:21:14.288
Really cool.

397
00:21:14.288 --> 00:21:16.388
He's the type that'll die young.

398
00:21:18.488 --> 00:21:19.988
You fool.

399
00:22:55.388 --> 00:22:58.188
Huh? Never mind, I don't deserve any token of appreciation.

400
00:22:58.188 --> 00:23:00.588
No! A promise is a promise.

401
00:23:00.588 --> 00:23:04.988
Okay, then could I ask you out, just the two of us?

402
00:23:04.988 --> 00:23:06.688
Is that all you want?

403
00:23:06.688 --> 00:23:08.888
Okay, then wait for me next Saturday at 18:00

404
00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:11.588
in front of the main entrance of the Budokan.

405
00:23:11.588 --> 00:23:13.588
I'm sorry!

406
00:23:13.588 --> 00:23:15.488
Did you wait long?

407
00:23:15.488 --> 00:23:19.188
No, I just got here too.

408
00:23:19.188 --> 00:23:20.788
I'm sorry.

409
00:23:20.788 --> 00:23:23.288
Remember the arsonist? He started confessing,

410
00:23:23.288 --> 00:23:24.488
so I got all absorbed.

411
00:23:24.488 --> 00:23:27.088
Let's not talk about work.

412
00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:29.288
Right, we're dating today!

413
00:23:29.288 --> 00:23:30.788
Right!

414
00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:34.588
Sato here.

415
00:23:34.588 --> 00:23:36.688
I've caught sight of the younger sister of the guy in question.

416
00:23:36.688 --> 00:23:39.488
-Huh? -Okay, keep tailing her.

417
00:23:39.488 --> 00:23:41.088
Make sure she doesn't fine out that you're a cop.

418
00:23:41.088 --> 00:23:42.088
Yes, sir.

419
00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:46.188
Officer Sato. Don't tell me that this is...

420
00:23:46.188 --> 00:23:48.688
Okay, let's go, Officer Takagi.

421
00:23:48.688 --> 00:23:51.588
Wait...

422
00:23:54.088 --> 00:23:56.288
Officer Sato!

423
00:23:58.588 --> 00:24:01.588
"Next Episode"

424
00:24:01.588 --> 00:24:04.888
To think that a detective as renown as Kogoro Mouri

425
00:24:04.888 --> 00:24:08.788
was not able to stop a murder that happened right before his eyes...

426
00:24:08.788 --> 00:24:11.388
Thank you for your cooperation.

427
00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:13.988
I'll take the evidence.

428
00:24:13.988 --> 00:24:15.688
Don't tell me that...

429
00:24:15.688 --> 00:24:19.688
But if thought of that way, it is convincing.

430
00:24:19.688 --> 00:24:22.388
Even Pop's superb power of deduction...

431
00:24:23.688 --> 00:24:28.509
Next Conan, "An Overly Superb Deduction"

432
00:24:28.606 --> 00:24:31.506
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:31.506 --> 00:24:33.506
"Cassette tape"

434
00:24:33.506 --> 00:24:34.706
Next time is the number one face off.

435
00:24:34.706 --> 00:24:37.606
-I'm gonna go nuts! -Me, too.
