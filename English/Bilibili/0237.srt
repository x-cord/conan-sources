1
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.740
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.940
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.640
This is the first time Conan is handling a case like this.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.640
Were you able to enjoy his facial expressions

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.840
as well as his deductions?

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.440
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.340
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:58.853 --> 00:02:03.453
We set off on a trip to White Sand Beach in Wakayama Prefecture.

10
00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:06.253
Despite having a feeling that somebody was watching us,

11
00:02:06.253 --> 00:02:08.153
we continued sightseeing.

12
00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:11.053
Later,

13
00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:12.953
we find out that one of the five Naniwa University students

14
00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:15.553
that we met the previous day,

15
00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:18.853
Maki Shinjou was found dead at Sandanbeki.

16
00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:21.953
Among her belongings,

17
00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:25.253
her wallet and her car key are missing.

18
00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:27.253
In the pocket of her top,

19
00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:29.453
she has working gloves.

20
00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:30.653
Also,

21
00:02:30.653 --> 00:02:34.053
what is the meaning of the tiny bottle

22
00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:37.453
and the Sour Boy easel?

23
00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:41.553
Murder-robbery is probably just a camouflage.

24
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:43.653
It's most likely that this murder was committed

25
00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:45.253
by an acquaintance of hers.

26
00:02:45.253 --> 00:02:49.153
If so, the murderer is among the people here.

27
00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:57.553
"South Kishu White Sand Beach Mystery Tour (Part 2)"

28
00:02:57.553 --> 00:02:59.253
Okay, everyone,

29
00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:02.553
please tell us where and what you were doing

30
00:03:02.553 --> 00:03:05.053
from 10:26 in the morning to 11:00.

31
00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:06.653
Just what do you mean by that?

32
00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.553
Do you suspect us?

33
00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:11.153
No, we're just verifying things.

34
00:03:11.153 --> 00:03:13.953
I was sketching at White Sand Beach.

35
00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:17.853
Since there were a lot of tourists,

36
00:03:17.853 --> 00:03:20.053
it shouldn't be hard to verify.

37
00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:21.953
In your case, Ms. Mitsui.

38
00:03:21.953 --> 00:03:24.853
Since you were so near the scene of the crime,

39
00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:26.753
your alibi may not help you much.

40
00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:29.153
But did you do the sketching there the whole time?

41
00:03:29.153 --> 00:03:30.153
That's right.

42
00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:32.053
Any witnesses?

43
00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:33.053
No.

44
00:03:33.053 --> 00:03:37.653
I don't like to be watched what I'm sketching.

45
00:03:37.653 --> 00:03:38.853
So that's why I had them show me a place

46
00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:41.253
where there were not too many people.

47
00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:42.553
Who told you of this place?

48
00:03:42.553 --> 00:03:44.053
Maki did.

49
00:03:44.053 --> 00:03:46.753
She seems to have come to White Sand Beach many times,

50
00:03:46.753 --> 00:03:49.353
so she knew this place very well.

51
00:03:49.353 --> 00:03:50.953
What about you, Ms. Miyahara?

52
00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:54.353
I was at a restaurant near Engetsu Island

53
00:03:54.353 --> 00:03:56.553
from about 10:30 to 12:00.

54
00:03:56.553 --> 00:03:59.453
Oh, the parking lot where a woman was standing

55
00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:01.153
calling out to the customers.

56
00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:03.653
The shop where Engetsu Island is in view, right?

57
00:04:03.653 --> 00:04:05.653
Yes, that's right.

58
00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:07.553
At first, I was sketching in the vacant lot

59
00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:08.953
where Marine Palace used to be.

60
00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:11.453
Right inside the tunnel from the Memorial hall.

61
00:04:11.453 --> 00:04:12.953
A tunnel?

62
00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:17.453
Back there...

63
00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:18.853
Maki was the one who told you about

64
00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:20.553
the vacant lot where Marine Palace used to be too, right?

65
00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:21.653
That's right.

66
00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:23.853
Because I didn't want to be bothered.

67
00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:26.053
But somehow I didn't feel like drawing,

68
00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:28.153
so I went to drink a cup of coffee to refresh myself

69
00:04:28.153 --> 00:04:29.753
and ended up eating lunch there.

70
00:04:29.753 --> 00:04:33.353
So, you didn't draw anything?

71
00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:35.153
Nope, not at all.

72
00:04:35.153 --> 00:04:37.953
I was sketching at the beach from afternoon.

73
00:04:37.953 --> 00:04:41.153
You mean the one on the way to the Memorial Hall?

74
00:04:41.153 --> 00:04:42.453
But from there,

75
00:04:42.453 --> 00:04:45.853
you can only get a side view of Engetsu lsland, right?

76
00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:47.953
Why didn't you sketch from the rocky area

77
00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.853
where you could get a frontal view of Engetsu Island?

78
00:04:49.853 --> 00:04:51.453
I didn't want to draw anything

79
00:04:51.453 --> 00:04:52.753
that resembled picture postcards.

80
00:04:52.753 --> 00:04:55.253
That's what art is all about!

81
00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:56.853
Don't ask such silly questions!

82
00:04:56.853 --> 00:04:58.553
By the way, Ms. Miyahara,

83
00:04:58.553 --> 00:05:01.053
we found in Ms. Maki Shinjou's caller ID records

84
00:05:01.053 --> 00:05:03.353
that you were the last person to have called her.

85
00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:05.353
Yes, I called her.

86
00:05:05.353 --> 00:05:07.553
I was wondering how she was.

87
00:05:07.553 --> 00:05:09.953
But since she didn't answer, I hung up.

88
00:05:11.753 --> 00:05:13.353
And now, Mr. Fuji.

89
00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:16.953
I was at Adventure World

90
00:05:16.953 --> 00:05:20.253
from 10:26 to about 11:00.

91
00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:23.153
I think I was watching the Marine show.

92
00:05:23.153 --> 00:05:24.853
Do you have any witnesses?

93
00:05:26.353 --> 00:05:28.253
I didn't run into anyone,

94
00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:30.453
but I took a picture using my digital camera.

95
00:05:30.453 --> 00:05:32.353
Would you like me to connect it to the TV set?

96
00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:33.453
What?

97
00:05:33.453 --> 00:05:36.053
You mean you can do something like that with a digital camera?

98
00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:45.053
This is the picture that Maki sent me this morning.

99
00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.653
She sent it first to Kanako, Yura and Madoka,

100
00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:50.353
then me, in that order.

101
00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:51.353
After this,

102
00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:54.553
I took several more pictures inside Adventure World.

103
00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:56.653
Then, I watched the seal, dolphin, and orca shows

104
00:05:56.653 --> 00:05:59.253
that were 30 minutes each.

105
00:05:59.253 --> 00:06:01.653
See, from here.

106
00:06:06.453 --> 00:06:08.453
It's the show that we saw, isn't it?

107
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:12.253
Yes! We saw the one from 11:00.

108
00:06:12.253 --> 00:06:14.753
Then, we just missed each other.

109
00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.653
That's it!

110
00:06:20.653 --> 00:06:22.153
But could there be a possibility

111
00:06:22.153 --> 00:06:26.153
that he took the next orca and dolphin show?

112
00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:28.253
Just what do you mean by that?

113
00:06:28.253 --> 00:06:31.953
In other words, if he takes a picture of the seal show from 9:30 to 10:00,

114
00:06:31.953 --> 00:06:35.353
and then takes the next dolphin show from 11:30,

115
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:39.153
it would serve as his alibi from 10:00 to 11:30.

116
00:06:39.153 --> 00:06:40.253
I see!

117
00:06:40.253 --> 00:06:42.453
I don't think so.

118
00:06:42.453 --> 00:06:44.753
I think that's an interesting deduction,

119
00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:48.053
but she's not the same woman we saw.

120
00:06:49.753 --> 00:06:50.953
Oh, you're right.

121
00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:53.653
The person we saw had braids.

122
00:06:53.653 --> 00:06:57.153
Which means that Mr. Fuji has a perfect alibi.

123
00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:01.653
But why didn't you take a picture of the orca Show until 1:15 pm

124
00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:05.553
after taking the orca Show before 11:00?

125
00:07:05.553 --> 00:07:07.053
The next picture is the one that you took

126
00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:10.153
when you saw us at 1:15 pm, isn't it?

127
00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:12.953
Isn't it strange that you didn't take any pictures

128
00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:15.053
for a period of more than 2 hours and 15 minutes?

129
00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:18.353
That's because I was riding jet coasters, and having meals.

130
00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:20.353
Besides, I had nothing that I wanted to take during that time.

131
00:07:20.353 --> 00:07:23.753
I tell you, cut out your stupid questions!

132
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:29.353
Please let me copy your pictures on your driver's license,

133
00:07:29.353 --> 00:07:31.853
so I can go verify what you just testified.

134
00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:35.053
I'm pretty sure

135
00:07:35.053 --> 00:07:38.253
that my intuition is correct.

136
00:07:38.253 --> 00:07:41.453
If so, what's with the pictures taken by the digital camera?

137
00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:44.053
Wait a second.

138
00:07:44.053 --> 00:07:46.753
A laptop?

139
00:07:46.753 --> 00:07:48.153
Maybe...

140
00:07:49.153 --> 00:07:51.253
May I go outside for a while?

141
00:07:51.253 --> 00:07:54.053
Okay, but keep away from dangerous places.

142
00:07:54.053 --> 00:07:55.153
Okay.

143
00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:10.553
"Adventure World"

144
00:08:10.553 --> 00:08:13.153
Excuse me, I left just a while ago,

145
00:08:13.153 --> 00:08:14.753
but may I go back in again?

146
00:08:14.753 --> 00:08:16.753
My father is inside.

147
00:08:16.753 --> 00:08:17.753
Okay,

148
00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:20.453
I guess you didn't get your hand stamped when you went out.

149
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:21.653
What?

150
00:08:21.653 --> 00:08:23.253
A stamp?

151
00:08:25.853 --> 00:08:26.853
Okay.

152
00:08:26.853 --> 00:08:28.953
I got a hold of one evidence!

153
00:08:31.253 --> 00:08:33.253
What? Down with a fever?

154
00:08:33.253 --> 00:08:36.853
Right, that's why we're so busy.

155
00:08:36.853 --> 00:08:39.253
Just as I thought.

156
00:08:42.953 --> 00:08:46.953
Why did Maki go to Sandanbeki where Madoka was

157
00:08:46.953 --> 00:08:50.453
after she saw us at Shirahama Station?

158
00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:52.753
Moreover, the greatest mystery yet is

159
00:08:52.753 --> 00:08:56.253
that I still can't figure out who killed Maki.

160
00:08:56.253 --> 00:08:58.653
Just one more time.

161
00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:00.753
Please let me ride the Adventure Coaster, okay?

162
00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:02.553
My goodness.

163
00:09:02.553 --> 00:09:04.353
Will you promise to study when we get home?

164
00:09:04.353 --> 00:09:05.953
I will, I will! I promise!

165
00:09:05.953 --> 00:09:07.953
Okay then, just one more time!

166
00:09:07.953 --> 00:09:09.853
All right!

167
00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.453
That boy's not going to study for beans.

168
00:09:24.253 --> 00:09:28.253
I see, so that's what happened.

169
00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:31.653
If so, everything's been solved.

170
00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:35.353
No doubt about it.

171
00:09:35.353 --> 00:09:37.253
That person's the killer!

172
00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:47.161
I'm sure that person is the killer,

173
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:48.261
but I have no proof.

174
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:50.461
Oh, goodness!

175
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:55.061
Today is really hot, and it's already the time of day!

176
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:02.561
I see!

177
00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:04.861
This was a blind spot for men!

178
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:08.661
I've found a conclusive evidence!

179
00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:11.061
Hey, aren't you the boy staying with Mr. Mouri?

180
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:12.461
Oh, officer.

181
00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:13.861
Why are you here?

182
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:17.361
Did you come to verify the time of the Marine Show, too?

183
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:19.161
Yes, just to be sure.

184
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:22.261
Mr. Mouri said that he wanted you

185
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:24.261
to check on something else, too.

186
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:26.561
What? Mr. Mouri said so?

187
00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:34.761
First of all, Mr. Yura

188
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:38.661
was witnessed sketching right through from about 09:00 to after 11:00

189
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:41.961
by the life guard who was on duty at the beach park.

190
00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:45.461
Next, as for Ms. Miyahara,

191
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:48.561
we were able to get testimony from the people at the restaurant.

192
00:10:50.361 --> 00:10:52.761
You're the one with the problem, Mr. Fuji

193
00:10:52.761 --> 00:10:54.161
What?

194
00:10:54.161 --> 00:10:56.361
We questioned the trainer and found out

195
00:10:56.361 --> 00:10:59.761
that the same members have been on duty all day today.

196
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.361
Nevertheless, a person that was not even there today

197
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:05.461
was taken on your digital camera!

198
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.361
Well, that's because...

199
00:11:07.361 --> 00:11:11.261
Mr. Fuji, you left Adventure World once, didn't you?

200
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:14.861
No use lying about it,

201
00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:16.661
because all we have to do

202
00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:18.161
is use this black light to disclose that you did!

203
00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:19.461
What is that?

204
00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:20.961
Come on, Mr. Mouri,

205
00:11:20.961 --> 00:11:22.661
let's cut out that horse play.

206
00:11:22.661 --> 00:11:25.161
You're the one who told us to check on it.

207
00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:27.561
Please go ahead.

208
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:29.061
Please show me your right hand.

209
00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:32.961
Some letters have appeared?

210
00:11:32.961 --> 00:11:35.361
Mr. Fuji, the mark

211
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:39.561
is stamped on your hand for those who want to re-enter

212
00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:41.861
when you leave Adventure World temporarily.

213
00:11:41.861 --> 00:11:43.461
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:46.061
The pictures I just showed you were the edited version

215
00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:48.661
of the ones that I had taken when I came to Adventure World before.

216
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:50.861
I edited them with my laptop.

217
00:11:50.861 --> 00:11:52.661
And just why did you do something like that?

218
00:11:52.661 --> 00:11:54.461
That's...

219
00:11:56.161 --> 00:11:59.361
You're going out with Ms. Madoka, right, Mr Fuji?

220
00:11:59.361 --> 00:12:00.661
What?

221
00:12:01.761 --> 00:12:04.361
What a thing to say! Ms. Madoka is...

222
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:08.561
Mr. Fuji, you left Adventure World at about 09:50

223
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.861
to see Ms. Madoka who was at Sandanbeki, didn't you?

224
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.861
And you stopped over at Shirahama Station on the way, right?

225
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:16.361
But, sonny,

226
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.661
why would he go from Adventure World to Shirahama Station

227
00:12:18.661 --> 00:12:22.361
that is in the opposite direction from Sandanbeki?

228
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.861
He went to buy the key holder that Madoka wanted.

229
00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:28.361
See, the one that is on that bag.

230
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:31.261
Sour Boy that is only sold at the shop at the station.

231
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:35.461
That's when you saw Ms. Maki, right, Mr. Fuji?

232
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:36.861
That's why...

233
00:12:39.261 --> 00:12:41.761
I was really surprised back then.

234
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:48.061
I didn't think I would run into her in the place like that.

235
00:12:48.061 --> 00:12:49.561
Maki!

236
00:12:52.161 --> 00:12:53.161
Thanks again!

237
00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:55.561
To top things off, I run into all of you too, Mr. Mouri.

238
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:00.661
I didn't want anybody to find out

239
00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:02.861
that I was going out with Madoka.

240
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:05.561
Especially when it came to Maki and Yura.

241
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:07.261
I knew.

242
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:10.561
That's why I went to see Madoka part way, too.

243
00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:12.461
What?

244
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:16.661
I got to Sandanbeki a little before 12:00.

245
00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:19.061
But you weren't there,

246
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:21.661
and that key holder was hanging from the easel.

247
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:24.861
We were having lunch then.

248
00:13:24.861 --> 00:13:27.661
I sensed right away that you were with Fuji.

249
00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:30.561
That's why you threw away the bottle with sand in it, right?

250
00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:34.961
The sand of White Sand Beach?

251
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:36.961
You got it for me?

252
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:40.461
Because I said that I wanted to take it home?

253
00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:42.661
So, you found it.

254
00:13:42.661 --> 00:13:45.061
It cracked just like my broken heart.

255
00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:50.861
Why did you keep something so important hidden?

256
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:52.961
Now, now. Let's calm down a bit here, Mr. Mouri.

257
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:54.961
Which means you took those pictures with your digital camera

258
00:13:54.961 --> 00:13:55.961
just so that you could show your friends

259
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:58.361
that you had an alibi of not being with Ms. Madoka?

260
00:13:58.361 --> 00:14:01.061
Yes, almost as if I were playing a game...

261
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:03.761
I'm really sorry about it.

262
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:05.861
But how did you figure it out, Conan?

263
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:08.061
How did you find out that I was going out with her?

264
00:14:08.061 --> 00:14:10.861
Because you were the very first person that Ms. Madoka called

265
00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:13.761
to report what had happened to Ms. Maki

266
00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:17.461
when it would've been more natural for her to call Mr. Yura, right?

267
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:21.161
Besides, when we got to Sandanbeki,

268
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:24.761
you knew where Ms. Madoka was sketching.

269
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:28.361
That's why I thought maybe you had already seen her today.

270
00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:30.761
-Oh, I see. -No!

271
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:35.561
Maki happened to see you together with Madoka,

272
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:38.661
so in order to contain the secret,

273
00:14:38.661 --> 00:14:41.661
you decided to shut her up!

274
00:14:41.661 --> 00:14:43.961
Southern White Sand Beach...

275
00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:50.461
What seems to be the matter, Mr. Mourl?

276
00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:51.561
Don't tell me that...

277
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:55.061
This is the rumored, "Sleeping Kogoro" pose!

278
00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:56.161
Now,

279
00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.861
Mr. Fuji has absolutely nothing to do

280
00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:00.561
with the incident that had happened.

281
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:01.961
He's not involved?

282
00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:04.161
The main point of this case is

283
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.461
that there was a switch of the main characters part way.

284
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:09.361
The victim of the murder

285
00:15:09.361 --> 00:15:11.461
which was supposed to have been Madoka had also switched to Maki.

286
00:15:13.261 --> 00:15:15.561
Let me explain.

287
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:16.561
First of all,

288
00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:20.861
Maki who was angry at Madoka for taking her lover away,

289
00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:23.961
hated her and schemed to kill her.

290
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:25.761
Maki was scheming to kill me?

291
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:31.161
And she chose Sandanbeki as the place to carry out her plan.

292
00:15:31.161 --> 00:15:32.261
However,

293
00:15:32.261 --> 00:15:34.161
since Maki had a motive to kill,

294
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:37.561
she decided to make herself an allbl.

295
00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:39.961
She let that person pretend to be her

296
00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:42.361
and made her do something that caught the eyes of people

297
00:15:42.361 --> 00:15:44.761
at Shirahama Station.

298
00:15:44.761 --> 00:15:47.461
Does that mean she had an accomplice?

299
00:15:47.461 --> 00:15:48.661
Right.

300
00:15:48.661 --> 00:15:51.861
Maki who ran into us at Shirahama Station

301
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:56.261
thought of setting up us as witnesses.

302
00:15:56.261 --> 00:16:00.161
That's why Maki asked us for our schedule.

303
00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:02.761
She set it up so that we would arrive at Shirahama Station

304
00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:04.861
at 10:00 today.

305
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:11.761
However, Maki's accomplice had other plans.

306
00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:13.361
Other plans?

307
00:16:13.361 --> 00:16:16.661
That plan was to switch Maki's alibi

308
00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:19.961
and kill her.

309
00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:23.561
Wait, dad!

310
00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:26.661
Then, the Ms. Maki that we saw at Shirahama Station

311
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:28.261
at about 10:10 was...

312
00:16:28.261 --> 00:16:30.661
Yes, it's an imposter.

313
00:16:30.661 --> 00:16:33.961
The imposter wore a wig, hat, sunglasses and even make-up

314
00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:36.461
just like Maki's.

315
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:39.961
And this imposter

316
00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:44.061
had probably already killed Maki at around 09:25 at Sandanbeki

317
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:47.861
before coming to Shirahama Station.

318
00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:51.161
What? 35 minutes before we met her?

319
00:16:51.161 --> 00:16:54.461
Who is that imposter anyway, Mr. Mouri?

320
00:16:54.461 --> 00:16:56.661
A person who was trusted enough

321
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:59.261
to be asked to be an accomplice in committing the murder

322
00:16:59.261 --> 00:17:01.961
as well as disguise herself to look just like Makl.

323
00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:04.961
There is only one person among the four that is capable of doing this.

324
00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:08.361
Ms. Kanako Miyahara,

325
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.261
only you could've done it.

326
00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:15.161
Me?

327
00:17:15.161 --> 00:17:16.461
But, Mr. Mouri,

328
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:18.461
Kanako already told Maki yesterday

329
00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:20.661
that she would not listen to Maki anymore!

330
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:24.961
Well, that's what Maki told her to say

331
00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:27.861
so that the police wouldn't suspect her saying

332
00:17:27.861 --> 00:17:30.061
that Kanako was only making up an alibi

333
00:17:30.061 --> 00:17:33.461
because she was forced to say what she did.

334
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:38.661
This morning, after Maki dropped everyone off at their destination,

335
00:17:38.661 --> 00:17:40.761
she returned to Engetsu Island,

336
00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:43.261
and made Kanako get into her car.

337
00:17:44.461 --> 00:17:50.361
Kanako disguised herself as Maki as they drove along.

338
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:53.461
According to Maki's plan,

339
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:56.461
she was supposed to get off at the inner alley of Sandanbeki

340
00:17:56.461 --> 00:18:00.361
which after, Kanako drives to Shirahama Station.

341
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:02.461
Then after her alibi was established,

342
00:18:02.461 --> 00:18:06.361
Maki was supposed to kill Madoka.

343
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:07.461
I see!

344
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:10.361
That's why there were working gloves in Maki Shinjou's jacket.

345
00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:11.961
Right!

346
00:18:11.961 --> 00:18:14.261
She was going to use them when committing the crime.

347
00:18:14.261 --> 00:18:18.661
However, Maki's plan suddenly shatters to pieces.

348
00:18:23.461 --> 00:18:25.461
After committing the murder,

349
00:18:25.461 --> 00:18:29.261
Kanako took Maki's knife and wallet.

350
00:18:29.261 --> 00:18:32.561
She did this to make it Iook like a murder-robbery!

351
00:18:33.761 --> 00:18:36.261
She then speeds along

352
00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:41.261
and arrived at Shirahama Station a little before we got there.

353
00:18:41.261 --> 00:18:43.761
Then, she observed us

354
00:18:43.761 --> 00:18:48.561
and waited for the right time to appear before us.

355
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:49.661
Which means that

356
00:18:49.661 --> 00:18:53.261
when Conan said that he felt as if he was being watched...

357
00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:56.361
Right! It was Kanako.

358
00:18:57.461 --> 00:19:04.161
After that you made us witness Maki at around 10:10.

359
00:19:04.161 --> 00:19:05.561
Then you went to Sanjo Shrine

360
00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:07.361
while at the same time getting rid of the evidence.

361
00:19:07.361 --> 00:19:10.761
Then, you abandoned the car and went back to Engetsu Island.

362
00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:12.361
Please wait!

363
00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:14.761
Do you have any grounds for saying all of this?

364
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:17.061
Of course!

365
00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:20.461
Although you mentioned not wanting be bothered by others,

366
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:22.761
you went out of your way to choose a beach

367
00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:24.861
where there were a lot of tourists and began sketching.

368
00:19:24.861 --> 00:19:28.861
Fearing the estimated time of death being extended to a later time,

369
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:31.261
you called Maki to make Madoka realize as soon as possible

370
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:34.761
that Maki was lying dead on the ground.

371
00:19:34.761 --> 00:19:37.361
That's only forced interpretation!

372
00:19:37.361 --> 00:19:40.561
If you insist that I'm the killer, show me proof!

373
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:42.361
If I'm not mistaken,

374
00:19:42.361 --> 00:19:46.361
Maki was using make-up that she ordered from Paris, wasn't she?

375
00:19:46.361 --> 00:19:48.461
Huh?

376
00:19:48.461 --> 00:19:49.961
You may have been able to get a hold of the clothes

377
00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:52.261
that Maki wore or the bags she carried in Japan

378
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:55.161
but as for the characteristic color lipstick that she used,

379
00:19:55.161 --> 00:19:57.861
you could find no substitute here.

380
00:20:00.861 --> 00:20:05.461
And your saliva was found on that lipstick.

381
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:08.861
The saliva of the last person who used it, which is you.

382
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:12.061
Moreover,

383
00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:15.261
Maki's lipstick that you could not wipe off completely

384
00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:18.161
is still on your lips.

385
00:20:18.161 --> 00:20:20.161
Under Mr. Mouri's orders,

386
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:22.161
we have already received the results of the forensic analysis

387
00:20:22.161 --> 00:20:24.861
of Ms. Maki Shinjou's lipstick.

388
00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:27.161
Would you like me to explain in detail

389
00:20:27.161 --> 00:20:29.361
on saliva and blood type?

390
00:20:31.761 --> 00:20:33.661
No, thank you.

391
00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:37.061
I am aware of that amount of medical knowledge, too.

392
00:20:38.061 --> 00:20:41.461
When did you figure out that I was the killer?

393
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:45.361
It took me quite a while to put my fingers on you.

394
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:49.361
I did have a hunch that it was one of you.

395
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:53.261
But when I found the key holder near the dead body...

396
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:55.261
Key holder?

397
00:20:55.261 --> 00:20:58.861
Mam had the rental car key

398
00:20:58.861 --> 00:21:02.861
attached to the key holder together with her house keys, didn't she?

399
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:07.761
But the key of the rental car key was missing from that key holder.

400
00:21:07.761 --> 00:21:10.261
That's because Maki...

401
00:21:10.261 --> 00:21:11.761
Yes.

402
00:21:11.761 --> 00:21:16.061
A robber would've taken the key holder

403
00:21:16.061 --> 00:21:20.961
because Maki's key holder was not the hook type key holder,

404
00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:24.761
but the coil type that is harder to remove the key from.

405
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:27.761
So, I'm sure that Maki gave you the key to the car

406
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:29.961
after she removed it from the key holder.

407
00:21:31.861 --> 00:21:34.061
Just as expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

408
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:37.761
I've completely lost.

409
00:21:37.761 --> 00:21:40.861
But, Kanako, why did you?

410
00:21:40.861 --> 00:21:43.961
I entered the university illegally.

411
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:45.261
Huh?

412
00:21:45.261 --> 00:21:48.861
I asked Maki's father to get me in.

413
00:21:48.861 --> 00:21:51.061
After I got in,

414
00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:54.061
Maki threatened to disclose what happened if I didn't listen to her.

415
00:21:54.061 --> 00:21:56.961
That's why I kept following her orders all this time.

416
00:21:56.961 --> 00:21:59.361
I wanted to be freed

417
00:21:59.361 --> 00:22:00.761
from Maki.

418
00:23:35.061 --> 00:23:38.161
I guess we'll be able to get back to Tokyo by tonight somehow.

419
00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:40.861
Yes, it's time to say goodbye to White Sand Beach, too.

420
00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:46.661
I'm so sleepy that I can't stand it.

421
00:23:47.661 --> 00:23:49.461
Then, have some of this.

422
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:51.261
A pickled plum.

423
00:23:53.561 --> 00:23:55.161
Sour!

424
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:58.361
I'm awake!

425
00:23:58.361 --> 00:24:02.361
Only if this could also awaken your talent as a detective.

426
00:24:05.261 --> 00:24:07.161
"Next Episode"

427
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:08.561
Ray, okay!

428
00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:09.761
I've arrived.

429
00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:12.461
Ricardo, it's not there.

430
00:24:12.461 --> 00:24:13.661
Left, left.

431
00:24:16.961 --> 00:24:18.261
Hey, wait!

432
00:24:21.061 --> 00:24:23.161
He's...

433
00:24:23.161 --> 00:24:25.661
the journalist we just a while ago?

434
00:24:27.761 --> 00:24:29.261
He is holding something in his left hand.

435
00:24:29.861 --> 00:24:31.061
Next Conan,

436
00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:35.182
"The 3k's Incident In Osaka (Part 1)"

437
00:24:35.579 --> 00:24:38.179
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:39.979
"Sushi"

439
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:41.479
Osaka is the stage for the next episode.

440
00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.379
Crab, radish and shellfish,

441
00:24:43.379 --> 00:24:44.579
the three "Ks" of sushi.
