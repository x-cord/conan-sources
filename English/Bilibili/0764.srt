1
00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:05,613
I, the members of the Detective Squad and Ai, bump into a man

2
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:09,774
who seemed to be pursued by cop-like men in the rain.

3
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,254
You brat! Watch it!

4
00:00:15,374 --> 00:00:16,644
There he is!

5
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,254
Hold it!

6
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:28,914
The man seems to be a drug dealer,

7
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:31,268
and from the pocketbook that he dropped.

8
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:34,368
I deduced the date, time and place of the drug deal.

9
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:41,994
In other words, E22 to "ma", Y21 to "tsuki",

10
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:45,714
G11 to "nihon", each symbolizes a Chinese character.

11
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,485
With these clues,

12
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:52,204
you can tell right off that they are subway routes and station numbers!

13
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:53,443
Huh?

14
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:58,201
Since in E22 of Azabu Juban, the 3rd number is circled,

15
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:01,728
so the 3rd kanji character "ju" is chosen.

16
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:03,511
Using this rule,

17
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:08,001
if you read up to the 5th line of the code, E22 is "ju"!

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,729
C10 is Nijubashimae on the Chiyoda Line,

19
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,819
the 1st letter is circled so it's "Ni"!

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:18,424
Y21 is Tsukishima on the Yurakucho Line, so it's "Tsuki"!

21
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:22,774
M09 is Shinjuku Sanchome on the Marunouchi Line, so it's "san"!

22
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:26,414
G11 is Nihonbashi on the Ginza Line, so it's "hi"!

23
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:30,064
If you line everything up, it comes out "December 3rd"!

24
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:35,614
But there were codes that I couldn't decipher,

25
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:39,914
so Heiji offered to help over the phone.

26
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,444
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:44,332 --> 00:01:48,642
Codes using subway lines and station numbers.

28
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,586
Interesting!

29
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:55,039
Some of these codes are written to the left

30
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,384
and others are written to the right, aren't they?

31
00:01:57,644 --> 00:02:01,384
-Huh? -True, it looks to be so.

32
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:06,394
Then! Maybe one side are the stations in Tokyo and the other in Osaka?

33
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:09,824
If so, the codes that you deciphered,

34
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:13,404
until the 5th line are all written on the left side, so they're all no good.

35
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:16,443
-That's right! Escalators! -Huh?

36
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:18,534
When riding escalators,

37
00:02:18,624 --> 00:02:22,034
in Osaka people move to the right and open the left side,

38
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,014
while in Tokyo it's the other way around, right?

39
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:28,134
That's why the stations written on the right are stations in Osaka

40
00:02:28,254 --> 00:02:31,794
and the ones on the left are stations in Tokyo!

41
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,464
Hey, Hattori. Is there a bridge called Ebisu there, too?

42
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:40,524
Hattori?

43
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:44,044
There is, here in Osaka.

44
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:47,164
The kanji characters are different,

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,580
but there's a bridge that people often use to meet each other!

46
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:56,797
Hattori? What's up? Hattori!

47
00:02:57,274 --> 00:03:01,627
-You can't hear him? -Maybe something happened?

48
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:05,874
Don't tell me he got caught trying to get the dealers.

49
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:09,801
He's so hot-blooded. It's possible.

50
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:13,594
Hey, Hattori? Answer me, Hattori!

51
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:16,424
-Hattori! -There're three.

52
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:21,167
I'm looking around Ebisu Bridge,

53
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:27,236
and I see three people with a rose on, holding it, or waiting for somebody.

54
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:34,444
-There's only 5 minutes to go before noon! -Yeah.

55
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:39,274
I guess we'll have to narrow down the tart to one by then.

56
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,364
Just the two of us!

57
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:46,964
The hidden lines on the palm are the fuse.

58
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,874
The deduction catches fire on the line to the heart.

59
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,874
Joint deduction using smartphone images.

60
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:52,964
What will Hattori do when he sees Kazuha?

61
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:54,492
He sees through the one and only truth.

62
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,296
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

63
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,586
His name is Detective Conan!

64
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:46,171
"Conan and Heiji, Code of Love (Part 2)"

65
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:50,601
"Ebisubashi"

66
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:54,311
And? What kind of people are those three?

67
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:56,911
Two men and one woman.

68
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:59,811
I can show then to you using my smartphone if you like.

69
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:03,101
Even if the drug dealer were to show up,

70
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:05,701
I'm sure you would be able to recognize him.

71
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,861
Then stay connected

72
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:11,161
-and send me the images. -Okay!

73
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:15,981
How about it? Can you see it okay?

74
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,441
-Yes! -Yeah!

75
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:21,611
-Perfect. -And, what about the three?

76
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:28,024
The first one is this rugged faced dude!

77
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:32,201
He looks like bad news.

78
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:36,344
He looks suspicious. He's keeps checking the time.

79
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:39,049
His wristwatch looks super expensive, too.

80
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:42,261
Speaking of checking... See!

81
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:46,159
He's taking something out of his jacket pocket and looking at it.

82
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,401
A cell phone?

83
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:53,021
He's shaking it in front of his face! Maybe it's some kind of signal?

84
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,601
Maybe he hasn't slept well. He keeps yawning.

85
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:04,573
And? I don't see the white roses. In his right hand?

86
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,580
Right!

87
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:12,336
He's holding it carefully in his right hand. A bouquet of white roses.

88
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:17,411
Isn't he the bad guy?

89
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:20,174
-I think so, too! -Me, too!

90
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:22,221
What about the other two?

91
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:27,010
Next, she wearing a white rose decoration

92
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,587
on her hair!

93
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:35,011
-Her hair's fluffy and cute. -Maybe she's a model?

94
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:38,151
-Maybe she's waiting for her date? -She looks suspicious.

95
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:43,464
-Huh? -Take a good look! That bag that she's holding!

96
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,291
It's the newest model of the Fusae Brand!

97
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:49,421
It's so expensive, your eyeballs will pop out.

98
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,621
She's wearing a rose corsage, too!

99
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:56,613
It's not sold yet in Japan, you know? I wonder where she got it.

100
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,673
So, that's your concern?

101
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,461
Look, she's looking at her shoes.

102
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,749
-Did she step on something? -She bent down!

103
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,213
She put something in her shoe.

104
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:15,121
-She looks suspicious. -I agree!

105
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:16,401
Me, too!

106
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,330
And the third one is this fickle looking guy

107
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:25,055
wearing a white rose on his chest!

108
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:28,911
Hey, he looks like he's talking to somebody.

109
00:08:29,191 --> 00:08:33,811
Yeah, to a girl, a girl! He's been talking to some girl.

110
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,611
Kazuha?

111
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,631
What're you doing?

112
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:46,021
Hey, Hattori.

113
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:50,158
That girl looks like Kazuha.

114
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:53,151
Yeah. It's her. It's Kazuha!

115
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:57,401
She's being picked up by a good-for-nothing guy, that idiot.

116
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:01,401
But, well... I don't think he's the one.

117
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:05,611
No idiot picks up girls before a deal.

118
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:09,861
Could he be one of Kazuha's law enforcement acquaintances?

119
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:12,031
Idiot! Look close!

120
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:16,191
Bleached hair, with nose pierce, and a tattoo on his neck?

121
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,541
I've never seen such cops! Moron!

122
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:20,511
True.

123
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:23,171
Only less than 2 minutes to noon.

124
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:27,353
-Hattori! No time left! -Don't rush me.

125
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,933
Since it's not that fickle one,

126
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:33,791
it's either that man or that woman...

127
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,606
Hey, Hattori! I'll tell you my deduction, okay?

128
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:56,761
Hattori? Hey, Hattori!

129
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,501
Hattori!

130
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:03,591
No good. I can't concentrate.

131
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:08,511
Hattori? Hey! Hattori!

132
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:11,511
Are you listening, Hattori?

133
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:15,011
-Hattori? -Quit hollering!

134
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:18,341
Get on with your deduction!

135
00:10:18,461 --> 00:10:21,521
Okay. As for the first one...

136
00:10:21,825 --> 00:10:25,777
The rugged face man that had the white rose bouquet

137
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:28,012
isn't the one.

138
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:33,201
-What? -He looks the most suspicious from his looks, though.

139
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,951
Besides, he took something secretly out of his pocket.

140
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,461
He was making queer signals, too!

141
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:45,051
As to that, he was checking his bangs with a hand mirror.

142
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:48,461
He fixed his bangs holding the mirror

143
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,851
so it looked sort of weird.

144
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:53,221
Then, what about his yawning?

145
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:58,161
He was just checking his breath.

146
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:01,831
He was holding the roses behind his back

147
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:05,621
because he wanted to give them to her as a gift and surprise her.

148
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:10,491
I guess you're right. If he were using the white roses as a sign,

149
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:14,281
he would've held them in a more obvious way. So...

150
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,241
this man probably...

151
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:23,483
Was waiting for his date!

152
00:11:23,697 --> 00:11:25,357
True!

153
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,981
-Wow! -Way to go, Conan's master!

154
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:32,381
Wait a minute. Those deductions were virtually all mine.

155
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:35,061
What about the brand loving woman

156
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,261
who was wearing the white rose on her head?

157
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:40,521
She seemed to be looking at her shoes.

158
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:43,581
She bent down and put something in her shoe, right?

159
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:46,021
Maybe a small weapon or something?

160
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:51,631
No, I think she had a shoe sore, so she took off her shoe for a while.

161
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,901
She was putting band aid on her heel, too.

162
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,381
Bad people also get shoe sore, right?

163
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:00,858
But ill-fitting shoes to a deal?

164
00:12:00,979 --> 00:12:03,791
I don't think so.

165
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:08,687
If someone suspects and reports them,

166
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,548
they have to run for it,

167
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:16,221
so wearing heels they're not used to walking in are the pits!

168
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:22,070
Besides, she looks like she just got her hair done at the beauty salon!

169
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:28,019
-She's not the one. -Why not? Bad women don't dress up or what?

170
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,581
The person's waiting for a drug dealer, you know.

171
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,061
Normally, you'd think he'd come

172
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,661
dressed in plain inconspicuous clothes, right?

173
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,531
He was actually dressed way, too.

174
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:41,201
If the deal takes place in a deserted back alley or something, well...

175
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:44,351
but, Ebisu Bridge is bustling with people.

176
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:48,701
If a mismatched couple meets here, they would stand out,

177
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:52,091
and the passersby would definitely remember them.

178
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:56,672
Besides, the corsage on her bag doesn't fit in too, does it?

179
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:59,506
If the sign is a white rose,

180
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,732
she'd match the corsage to be the same color, too.

181
00:13:02,971 --> 00:13:04,461
She would never use a rose of a different color

182
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:06,561
that would only cause confusion!

183
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:07,981
I see.

184
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:13,041
A fancy hairdo, ill-fitting high heels, and a rose corsage...

185
00:13:13,161 --> 00:13:15,894
These all show that she's...

186
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:19,211
-Over here! -been invited to a wedding party or something,

187
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,991
and is waiting for her partner.

188
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:25,661
-Right again! -Pretty good, Osaka detective!

189
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,751
-Impressive! -I'm telling you, it's all me...

190
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:34,261
Wait a sec! So that fickle guy talking to Kazuha

191
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:37,911
is the drug dealer?

192
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,381
No way! Like I just said,

193
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,211
no idiots pick up girls before a deal.

194
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:49,771
Why do you keep insisting that he's trying to pick her up?

195
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:54,781
Maybe Kazuha made the first move, right?

196
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:57,401
Huh? No way!

197
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,791
Why would Kazuha want talk to that fickle looking guy?

198
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:05,491
Moreover, try get intimate with a drug dealer. Are you nuts?

199
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,411
They could've just happened to be friends, right?

200
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:12,585
Besides, the deal may have been called off for some reason,

201
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:15,873
so that guy may have ended up being just another ordinary guy, right?

202
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,312
Cool it, Hattori!

203
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:23,612
You'd normally figure out something like this right away, right?

204
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:26,341
I understand how you feel, though.

205
00:14:28,022 --> 00:14:31,558
-It's one minute past time! -No joke?

206
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:36,200
Then maybe the dealer's already by the bridge!

207
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:38,401
Hattori! Time's up!

208
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:42,441
If the dealer comes, there's danger that Kazuha may get mixed up in this!

209
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:45,131
So, hurry, go get her and get out of there, both of you!

210
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:49,163
What're you doing? The video chat stopped?

211
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:54,374
I'm texting Kazuha! I'm going to ask her who that fickle guy is!

212
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:56,951
Give me a break, Kazuha.

213
00:14:57,071 --> 00:15:00,151
No way! I'm not letting you go.

214
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:02,811
Hey, wait up.

215
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,331
Oh, it's mail from Heiji.

216
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:09,481
Huh, what am I doing? He says.

217
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:16,481
What's with his jacket?

218
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:20,131
That bulge under his arm...

219
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,491
That's...

220
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:24,461
A gun!

221
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:40,712
What's with his jacket?

222
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:43,892
That bulge under his arm...

223
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,722
That's...

224
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,012
A gun!

225
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:50,972
That guy...

226
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:56,825
Hey, listen well. That fickle guy...

227
00:15:56,945 --> 00:16:00,297
-has a gun hidden in his chest. -What?

228
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:04,782
That guy... I don't know if he's a dealer or not,

229
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,632
but he's not ordinary guy.

230
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:11,202
Hey, Hattori! Fort the deal already!

231
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:14,932
Grab her by the arm and get out of there.

232
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:19,234
-Huh? Just what're you talking about? -She's in danger!

233
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:24,152
Oh no, not you! I just got mail from Kazuha!

234
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:27,753
She says, "He's Yakumaru who used to live near me.

235
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,453
I saw him at Ebisu Bridge,

236
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:31,995
and though, he told me that he was

237
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:34,695
in the pharmaceutical department at the university,

238
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,193
he's dressed gaudy and looks super fickle!

239
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:39,559
He's going on a date, he says.

240
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,554
That's why I decided to stick around to get a glimpse of his girl."

241
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:45,862
I got this stupid mail from her.

242
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:47,928
He's lying!

243
00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:49,272
He belonged to a pharmaceutical department

244
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:53,172
and he has bleached hair, a tattoo and nose pierce?

245
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:54,492
No way!

246
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:58,622
He's just pretending to be straight to get close to Kazuha.

247
00:16:59,022 --> 00:17:00,974
Kazuha's Dad is the head of criminal investigations department

248
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:02,974
of the Osaka Prefectural Police Department.

249
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:06,232
He's probably trying to get police information or something

250
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:07,932
by getting close.

251
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,727
Hey!

252
00:17:10,342 --> 00:17:13,142
Hey, who are you guys? Just what do you think you're doing?

253
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,062
Kazuha!

254
00:17:15,342 --> 00:17:18,522
Wait up, Hattori! Maybe that guy is...

255
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:21,322
Hey! Are you listening, Hattori?

256
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,862
Ouch! Let go, you dunce!

257
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:27,542
Where do you think you're touching, you imbecile! No, I said!

258
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:30,677
Who are you guys? Where are you taking me?

259
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:33,262
Kazuha!

260
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:35,312
Heiji.

261
00:17:38,482 --> 00:17:40,832
Sorry. You're a lifesaver.

262
00:17:45,712 --> 00:17:50,314
-Hey... What, hey... -Don't take the words out of my mouth!

263
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:55,766
How dare you... Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha!

264
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:59,022
-Heiji. -What?

265
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,312
You brought a whole army with you, huh?

266
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:08,042
How can you guys all be so ugly?

267
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:11,032
-Hey, wait... -Too late!

268
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,997
I'll throw all of you over the Dotonbori River so you can take a dive!

269
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:16,597
Bring it on!

270
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:20,442
Hey, Hattori!

271
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:24,482
He hung up.

272
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:35,232
What? That fickle man was narcotics agent?

273
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:40,447
Yeah! They investigate drug-related crimes.

274
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:43,957
They're called narcs or drug agents.

275
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:46,652
But, aren't they cops?

276
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,622
You said he wasn't a police detective!

277
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:53,792
No. Narcotic agents aren't police officers!

278
00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:56,952
They work for the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare,

279
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:00,292
and since decoy investigations are legal,

280
00:19:00,412 --> 00:19:04,302
bleached hair, tattoos, nose pierce, anything goes.

281
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:09,552
Of course if their job requires, their also allowed to carry guns!

282
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:12,213
I've heard of something like that before.

283
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,841
That a lot of narcs are former pharmaceutical students

284
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:17,541
because of the nature of their jobs.

285
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:21,312
Yeah, that's why it hit me!

286
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:26,464
-So he was there for the investigation. -Right.

287
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:30,361
Inspector Otaki told me on the phone a while ago,

288
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:33,712
that the drug dealer that they arrested in Osaka,

289
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:36,412
spit out the locations and signs of the drug deals,

290
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:42,122
so he was disguised as the drug dealer and waited for the other party.

291
00:19:42,392 --> 00:19:43,492
I see.

292
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:48,512
That's why he asked his colleagues to get Kazuha out of there, right?

293
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:52,562
Yeah. He didn't want the buyer to come along, and get suspicious,

294
00:19:52,682 --> 00:19:55,262
nor did he want Kazuha to get involved.

295
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:58,232
It seems that the drug dealer was arrested

296
00:19:58,352 --> 00:20:00,932
at the manga cafe where he was hiding,

297
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:03,072
so case closed.

298
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:06,142
I wonder if your master's okay?

299
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:10,516
Yeah. It seems he was released

300
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,516
after Inspector Otaki explained the situation.

301
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:17,062
Well, that's the least of his worries, though.

305
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,502
Those darn narcs.

306
00:21:51,032 --> 00:21:53,882
I can't believe they went hard on a mere high school kid.

307
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:56,382
They don't know how to go easy.

308
00:21:57,952 --> 00:22:01,842
-Hey. -On top of that, they went all out lecturing me.

309
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:03,512
Hey, Heiji.

310
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:08,377
"We'll let your father know about this."

311
00:22:08,444 --> 00:22:10,614
Darn it, none of their business!

312
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:14,522
-Hey, just what did you mean back then? -Huh?

313
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,162
Since when did I become yours?

314
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:23,149
What're you talking about?

315
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:30,942
You said it, didn't you? "Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha!"

316
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:32,832
"I'm gonna beat you all up!"

317
00:22:34,262 --> 00:22:37,712
I didn't say something that stupid, idiot!

318
00:22:38,522 --> 00:22:43,401
It could've been a bit different, but it sounded something like it.

319
00:22:45,374 --> 00:22:47,464
Hey, Heiji! Answer me!

320
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:52,982
-Heiji? -Shut up! Do I have to tell you?

321
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,532
Heiji...

322
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:00,192
I'm only going to say it once, so listen closely.

323
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:04,212
The most important thing for me is...

324
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:11,162
-Evidence. -Huh?

325
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:15,562
Don't say things that you have no evidence to back up with!

326
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:19,532
Hey, Heiji! What evidence?

327
00:23:19,652 --> 00:23:22,012
My ears heard what you said.

328
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:24,302
Your ears are rotten!

329
00:23:24,422 --> 00:23:26,822
To my dearest, precious, dear Kazuha...

330
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:30,092
-Dear Kazuha, my foot! -So, you do remember after all!

331
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:33,210
My ears are ringing so badly that I can't hear a thing!

332
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:35,072
Heiji!

333
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,062
Ouch!

334
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,245
-That's right! I'll mail Ran. -Don't!

335
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,700
I've recorded it but, oh well...

336
00:23:46,222 --> 00:23:49,032
