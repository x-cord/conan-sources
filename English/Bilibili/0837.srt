1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.870
After school, Sonoko suggests

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.570
to Ran and Sera at Poirot that they make a girls' band.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.870
Therefore, Amuro and I who happened to be there,

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.370
went to a rental studio to practice.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.370
But the members of a girls' band that we run into there...

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.070
Is she dead?

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.070
Hey. Hagie?

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.070
No joke?

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570
Hagie? Hagie?

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.470
Nothing was on the security camera.

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.270
And the murder weapon isn't found either.

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.470
However, Sera is wary of Amuro.

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.970
And? And?

14
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.970
Did you get his name?

15
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.970
No, I didn't.

16
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.770
But another man who came to the platform called him.

17
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.070
Scotch!

18
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.370
But, the man who called him that

19
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.770
had his hat deep over his eyes

20
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.370
so I didn't get a good view of what he looked like.

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.570
He looked very similar to you, Amuro!

22
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.370
It's someone else.

23
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.170
Never mind such old time stories.

24
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.870
Why don't we get to solving the case that just happened here?

25
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.070
You're a detective too, aren't you?

26
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.370
Yeah, I guess so.

27
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.370
A canvas stained black with crime.

28
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.770
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

29
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.870
Bourbon and Scotch are bothersome.

30
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.170
But first priority is to figure out where the murder weapon disappeared.

31
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.770
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

33
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.470
His name is Detective Conan!

34
00:03:27.127 --> 00:03:32.827
"A Girls' Band on Bad Terms (Part 2)"

35
00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:34.627
What?

36
00:03:34.627 --> 00:03:37.127
You want to body check us once more?

37
00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:39.127
You check us thoroughly earlier, didn't you?

38
00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:41.327
Well, just to be sure, you see.

39
00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:45.927
Maybe you haven't found the murder weapon yet?

40
00:03:45.927 --> 00:03:50.227
That's why you think that we have it hidden somewhere on us, right?

41
00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:53.927
Don't tell us you think we swallowed it or something?

42
00:03:53.927 --> 00:03:56.727
If so, take an X-Ray picture or whatever!

43
00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:59.827
That's fine if it's going to clear us of suspicion.

44
00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:03.627
By the way, did you check the members of the other bands too?

45
00:04:03.627 --> 00:04:05.827
No, not yet.

46
00:04:05.827 --> 00:04:09.227
Because Hagie used to argue a lot with the members of other bands.

47
00:04:09.227 --> 00:04:11.527
They could've had a grudge against her.

48
00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:15.127
The other time too, a band that we met at a live house said.

49
00:04:15.127 --> 00:04:17.927
What's this? You guys are still playing?

50
00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:20.727
I thought your vocalist dropped dead.

51
00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:24.927
This freckled face one is going to sing in her place, right?

52
00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:26.527
Poor thing.

53
00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:31.927
Well, your vocalist lost her voice and committed suicide.

54
00:04:31.927 --> 00:04:33.727
You don't have a choice, do you?

55
00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:40.727
The vocalist who committed suicide?

56
00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:42.827
A girl called Akane Shuto.

57
00:04:42.827 --> 00:04:45.227
She had a nice voice.

58
00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:49.227
Anybody on the outside could've seen

59
00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:52.827
that half the security camera's image was cut off

60
00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:55.327
if they looked at the monitor at the reception, right?

61
00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:56.327
Yes.

62
00:04:56.327 --> 00:05:00.027
If someone knew that they always did so,

63
00:05:00.027 --> 00:05:03.527
they could've searched and found which studio they were using.

64
00:05:03.527 --> 00:05:06.827
Which means that someone from the outside

65
00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:09.027
could've snuck into the room,

66
00:05:09.027 --> 00:05:13.227
strangled the victim and leave with the murder weapon.

67
00:05:13.227 --> 00:05:15.027
It's just as the girls say.

68
00:05:15.027 --> 00:05:18.327
I guess we need to investigate the members of other bands too.

69
00:05:18.327 --> 00:05:21.827
Oh, but since we only had our eyes on these three,

70
00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:24.627
we let two or three groups leave already.

71
00:05:24.627 --> 00:05:27.827
Tell them to get back here immediately!

72
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.827
Yes, sir.

73
00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:33.127
Excuse me.

74
00:05:33.827 --> 00:05:36.927
Which of you first suggested to form a band?

75
00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:38.527
Hagie.

76
00:05:38.527 --> 00:05:41.527
We were classmates in college.

77
00:05:41.527 --> 00:05:44.427
One day Hagie brought Akane along saying that she found a good vocalist,

78
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.027
so we formed a band.

79
00:05:46.027 --> 00:05:50.427
Akane not only sang but could play the guitar, bass and keyboard too.

80
00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:52.327
So, she taught us a lot of things.

81
00:05:52.327 --> 00:05:57.127
But, Akane couldn't do anything girls could do.

82
00:05:57.127 --> 00:05:59.627
Hagie taught her how to cook

83
00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:02.827
and I taught her about make-up and fashion.

84
00:06:02.827 --> 00:06:07.027
I tried to teach Akane sewing and embroidery too,

85
00:06:07.027 --> 00:06:10.227
but she wouldn't stick with things like that for long.

86
00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:14.127
The only thing she kept up with was knitting that Rumi taught her.

87
00:06:14.127 --> 00:06:18.327
Yes, but all of you that I taught along with Akane

88
00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.427
got better at it than me.

89
00:06:20.427 --> 00:06:21.527
Come to think of it,

90
00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:25.127
I want to see the video of your practice session that you took.

91
00:06:25.127 --> 00:06:26.227
Sure thing.

92
00:06:26.227 --> 00:06:28.827
Since the power was switched off when we weren't practicing,

93
00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:32.227
I don't think the perp is in it.

94
00:06:32.227 --> 00:06:33.227
See!

95
00:06:36.827 --> 00:06:40.327
Didn't you turn it in to the police?

96
00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:42.627
The officer we saw earlier gave it back to me

97
00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:45.627
saying that it seemed to have nothing to do with the case.

98
00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:48.627
After all, it's our last performance with Hagie.

99
00:06:48.627 --> 00:06:50.627
Why was the video shot vertically?

100
00:06:50.627 --> 00:06:54.527
I think the band would fit in better if it was shot horizontally.

101
00:06:54.527 --> 00:06:57.027
Oh, we decided to shoot it vertically

102
00:06:57.027 --> 00:06:59.627
so that our feet wouldn't be cut off, right?

103
00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:00.627
Yeah.

104
00:07:00.627 --> 00:07:03.927
Because it's not like a TV screen and more interesting that way.

105
00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:06.827
I see.

106
00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:08.927
So, that's the story.

107
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:14.027
Seriously?

108
00:07:14.027 --> 00:07:15.927
Haven't you found the murder weapon yet?

109
00:07:15.927 --> 00:07:17.527
No, sir.

110
00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:19.827
The victim Ms. Hagie Yamaji

111
00:07:19.827 --> 00:07:22.527
was strangled using a rope like weapon,

112
00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:25.627
and Yoshikawa lines that indicate she resisted when being choked

113
00:07:25.627 --> 00:07:27.427
are found on her neck.

114
00:07:27.427 --> 00:07:30.927
In other words, the murder weapon with Ms. Yamaji's blood on it

115
00:07:30.927 --> 00:07:33.427
should be somewhere in this studio

116
00:07:33.427 --> 00:07:34.827
and yet it can't be found. Why not?

117
00:07:34.827 --> 00:07:37.927
We've checked all the string like things we could possibly find,

118
00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:40.327
but detected no luminol reaction.

119
00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:44.527
Come to think of it, a band member Someka Kibune

120
00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:46.927
replaced the strings of her guitar, didn't she?

121
00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:51.527
Of course we checked her guitar first thing, but found nothing.

122
00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:55.527
So maybe the string was cut into pieces and flushed down the toilet?

123
00:07:55.527 --> 00:07:58.127
We thought of that too, but...

124
00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:04.027
We also examined the scissors in Ms. Tadako Fuekawa's sewing kit

125
00:08:04.027 --> 00:08:08.827
and Ms. Rumi Kogure's nail clipper

126
00:08:08.827 --> 00:08:10.527
but found nothing.

127
00:08:10.527 --> 00:08:12.127
If these were used to cut a string with blood on it,

128
00:08:12.127 --> 00:08:14.727
blood reaction would've been detected.

129
00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:20.527
So, maybe a member from another band strangled Ms. Yamaji,

130
00:08:20.527 --> 00:08:23.427
and left with the murder weapon, after all.

131
00:08:23.427 --> 00:08:24.527
In that case,

132
00:08:24.527 --> 00:08:27.627
I think the murder weapon would've been disposed of already.

133
00:08:29.127 --> 00:08:31.927
If only the forensics can find a piece of the perp's skin

134
00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:34.027
under the fingernails of Ms. Yamaji's body,

135
00:08:34.027 --> 00:08:38.027
it could serve as a clue.

136
00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:40.527
It seems that she was strangled from behind,

137
00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:43.527
so the chance of her having scratched the perp is slight.

138
00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:48.427
And? Did you call back the members of the other bands that went home?

139
00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.627
Well, there were two or three people that we couldn't get a hold of,

140
00:08:51.627 --> 00:08:54.527
-so not all of them are here. -No need for that!

141
00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:58.027
Because the perp hasn't fled from here yet.

142
00:08:58.027 --> 00:08:59.027
What?

143
00:08:59.427 --> 00:09:01.727
Hasn't fled?

144
00:09:01.727 --> 00:09:03.527
Then, the perp is...

145
00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:04.527
Yes.

146
00:09:04.827 --> 00:09:07.227
It means that the perp is among the three members

147
00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:10.427
in the same band as Ms. Yamaji.

148
00:09:10.427 --> 00:09:13.627
-What? -What? Seriously?

149
00:09:13.627 --> 00:09:17.527
Why don't we just go to the break room in the basement

150
00:09:17.527 --> 00:09:20.527
where all the girls are left waiting?

151
00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.227
What?

152
00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:26.027
The perp who killed Hagie is among us three?

153
00:09:26.027 --> 00:09:27.627
You still insist on it?

154
00:09:27.627 --> 00:09:32.227
Well, we, the police are not the ones saying that actually.

155
00:09:32.227 --> 00:09:35.427
The one's helping us with the investigation are.

156
00:09:35.927 --> 00:09:37.027
Geez.

157
00:09:37.027 --> 00:09:39.427
I don't care if you think you're detectives.

158
00:09:39.427 --> 00:09:43.327
But none of us have the string-like weapon.

159
00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:46.127
So I don't see why we should be suspected.

160
00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.327
If you insist that we got rid of the murder weapon,

161
00:09:48.327 --> 00:09:51.427
it should be somewhere in this studio, right?

162
00:09:51.727 --> 00:09:53.327
Did you find it?

163
00:09:53.327 --> 00:09:56.027
No, not yet.

164
00:09:56.027 --> 00:09:58.527
If so, we're innocent, right?

165
00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:00.127
I wish you'd let us go already.

166
00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:01.427
But...

167
00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:03.327
There's no way we'll find it.

168
00:10:04.327 --> 00:10:09.727
Because the murder weapon has already been taken out of this studio.

169
00:10:09.727 --> 00:10:12.327
Hey, just what're you talking about?

170
00:10:12.327 --> 00:10:15.327
We haven't stepped foot out of this room, you know?

171
00:10:15.327 --> 00:10:18.227
How would we be able to get the murder weapon out of the room?

172
00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:22.427
Because you're not the ones who took it outside.

173
00:10:22.427 --> 00:10:24.527
It was the police.

174
00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.127
What?

175
00:10:37.493 --> 00:10:41.793
Because you're not the ones who took it outside.

176
00:10:41.793 --> 00:10:43.593
It was the police.

177
00:10:43.593 --> 00:10:44.693
What?

178
00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:47.293
The police took the belongings and things the victim had on

179
00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:50.193
to the station now, to investigate them, right?

180
00:10:50.193 --> 00:10:51.993
Yeah.

181
00:10:51.993 --> 00:10:55.793
But there weren't any string like things in her belongings.

182
00:10:55.793 --> 00:10:58.193
What if that string like thing was knitted into something

183
00:10:58.193 --> 00:11:00.193
that looked totally different?

184
00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:03.093
Don't tell me that...

185
00:11:03.093 --> 00:11:06.693
Yeah, the knitted cap that Hagie was wearing.

186
00:11:06.693 --> 00:11:09.693
The murder weapon was the yarn that was knitted into that cap!

187
00:11:09.693 --> 00:11:12.193
The yarn was knitted in?

188
00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:15.293
The perp probably

189
00:11:15.293 --> 00:11:20.493
prepared beforehand yarn of the same color as Hagie's knitted cap.

190
00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:23.993
Then, after strangling her to death using that yarn,

191
00:11:23.993 --> 00:11:27.893
removed the decoration that was on the edge of the knitted cap once,

192
00:11:27.893 --> 00:11:32.193
and knitted in the yarn that was used to commit the crime to that area,

193
00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:35.993
replaced the decoration and put the cap on Hagie again.

194
00:11:35.993 --> 00:11:39.093
If the folded part of the knitted cap is raised a bit more than before,

195
00:11:39.093 --> 00:11:41.293
no one would really notice.

196
00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:44.593
But don't you use two pointed sticks

197
00:11:44.593 --> 00:11:48.593
called knitting needles when knitting?

198
00:11:48.593 --> 00:11:52.693
None of the girls had anything like that on them, right?

199
00:11:52.693 --> 00:11:53.893
They were there!

200
00:11:54.393 --> 00:11:56.693
Near the lady who died.

201
00:11:56.693 --> 00:11:59.393
-What? -They were there?

202
00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:04.693
See, on top of the snare drum to the left of the victim.

203
00:12:04.693 --> 00:12:07.393
The drum sticks that you use to play the drums with!

204
00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:12.193
If you use those two sticks skillfully, maybe you can knit with them?

205
00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:14.293
True.

206
00:12:14.293 --> 00:12:16.593
I guess you could.

207
00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:19.693
All three of them were in the studio

208
00:12:19.693 --> 00:12:22.993
for only a matter of 10 minutes when they went to wake Hagie up.

209
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:27.893
Tadako was sewing the button onto Someka's jacket.

210
00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:30.693
I also sewed on her cuffs that came apart!

211
00:12:30.693 --> 00:12:35.093
Someka was replacing the broken guitar string.

212
00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:37.793
I told you I was also tuning my guitar, right?

213
00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:41.293
And Rumi, you were revising your song, correct?

214
00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:44.693
Yes, while playing the keyboard.

215
00:12:44.693 --> 00:12:48.593
I don't think the three had time to knit.

216
00:12:48.593 --> 00:12:51.493
There's one person

217
00:12:51.493 --> 00:12:54.393
who was able to prepare beforehand among them, isn't there?

218
00:12:56.393 --> 00:13:00.193
You could've prepared beforehand, right?

219
00:13:00.193 --> 00:13:01.893
Ms. Rumi Kogure.

220
00:13:05.293 --> 00:13:06.993
I see!

221
00:13:06.993 --> 00:13:09.993
Someka's jacket button coming off

222
00:13:09.993 --> 00:13:12.693
and the guitar string broking were by coincidence!

223
00:13:12.693 --> 00:13:16.293
Moreover, the guitar was one that she had rented today at the studio,

224
00:13:16.293 --> 00:13:19.693
so the strings couldn't have been rigged to break off easily.

225
00:13:19.693 --> 00:13:22.093
But as for revising the song,

226
00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:23.893
if the revision was done beforehand while at home,

227
00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:27.493
all that needs to be done is to rewrite it the same way at the studio.

228
00:13:27.493 --> 00:13:28.893
I see!

229
00:13:28.893 --> 00:13:33.193
Moreover, unlike the others,

230
00:13:33.193 --> 00:13:35.793
Rumi had her back facing the security camera,

231
00:13:35.793 --> 00:13:37.893
so she could've been pretending to play the keyboard

232
00:13:37.893 --> 00:13:40.293
when she was actually knitting, right?

233
00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:41.893
I see.

234
00:13:41.893 --> 00:13:46.493
It seems you were good enough to teach others to knit too, right?

235
00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:50.293
But, I can knit too.

236
00:13:50.293 --> 00:13:53.393
In the first place, unless you hide half of the security camera,

237
00:13:53.393 --> 00:13:55.493
you can't commit the crime, right?

238
00:13:55.493 --> 00:13:56.793
Right? Rumi.

239
00:13:56.793 --> 00:13:58.193
Yes.

240
00:13:58.493 --> 00:14:02.793
We set the cell phone onto a selfie stick, then onto a mic stand.

241
00:14:02.793 --> 00:14:05.793
The fact that it was place right in front of the security camera

242
00:14:05.793 --> 00:14:07.093
was a mere coincidence.

243
00:14:07.093 --> 00:14:08.793
The three of us decided where to put it

244
00:14:08.793 --> 00:14:11.293
by looking at the image displayed on the cell phone

245
00:14:11.293 --> 00:14:12.993
and exchanging opinions.

246
00:14:12.993 --> 00:14:15.593
Or are you saying that we all worked together

247
00:14:15.593 --> 00:14:19.193
to position the cell phone in a way as to block off the security camera?

248
00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:21.593
We've already figured out that trick

249
00:14:21.593 --> 00:14:26.193
after watching the video on your cell phone of you performing.

250
00:14:26.193 --> 00:14:27.893
What?

251
00:14:27.893 --> 00:14:32.493
I saw that video too but I didn't notice anything in particular.

252
00:14:32.493 --> 00:14:35.393
Will you show it to me once more?

253
00:14:35.393 --> 00:14:36.593
Yes.

254
00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:43.593
What about this helped you figure it out?

255
00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:46.693
The positions in which all of them are.

256
00:14:46.693 --> 00:14:48.393
The positions they're in?

257
00:14:48.393 --> 00:14:52.293
The position of the drums is set to begin with and cannot be changed.

258
00:14:52.293 --> 00:14:54.393
The two playing the guitar and the bass

259
00:14:54.393 --> 00:14:57.193
will stay within the frame no matter how they move.

260
00:14:57.193 --> 00:14:59.193
The position of the cell phone used to take that video

261
00:14:59.193 --> 00:15:02.893
depends on keyboardist Rumi, who is in the upper left corner.

262
00:15:02.893 --> 00:15:04.693
In other words, only Rumi would've been able to control

263
00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:06.993
where the cell phone was to be set

264
00:15:06.993 --> 00:15:09.793
depending on where she put her keyboard.

265
00:15:09.793 --> 00:15:10.993
What?

266
00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:12.693
I'm saying that you could've have controlled it

267
00:15:12.693 --> 00:15:17.293
so that the cell phone would hide half the image on the security camera.

268
00:15:19.293 --> 00:15:21.593
If she got too close to the drums,

269
00:15:21.593 --> 00:15:23.393
the cell phone would also come close

270
00:15:23.393 --> 00:15:25.493
and pull away from the security camera

271
00:15:25.493 --> 00:15:27.593
and prevent her from blocking it.

272
00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:29.693
On the other hand, if she pulled away from the drums,

273
00:15:29.693 --> 00:15:31.093
the phone would pull away too

274
00:15:31.093 --> 00:15:34.393
and she would frame out from the security camera.

275
00:15:34.393 --> 00:15:38.293
In this way, you blocked off half the image of the security camera,

276
00:15:38.293 --> 00:15:42.293
pretended to go to wake Hagie who was sleeping in the studio

277
00:15:42.293 --> 00:15:44.893
and choked her to death using the yarn that you had prepared beforehand.

278
00:15:44.893 --> 00:15:49.893
Then you knitted in that yarn to Hagie's cap using the drumsticks

279
00:15:49.893 --> 00:15:53.193
while pretending to revise the song!

280
00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:56.393
You put the cap back onto Hagie

281
00:15:56.393 --> 00:15:59.993
and left to go back to the break room as if nothing had happened.

282
00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:01.893
Am I wrong?

283
00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:04.993
But, then she had to know beforehand that

284
00:16:04.993 --> 00:16:07.193
Hagie would be sleeping by the drums...

285
00:16:07.193 --> 00:16:10.093
I think Someka mentioned earlier that

286
00:16:10.093 --> 00:16:13.793
Hagie always used to sleep in that fashion.

287
00:16:13.793 --> 00:16:15.393
If she had a habit of sleeping that way,

288
00:16:15.393 --> 00:16:18.893
after putting a sleeping drug in her drink,

289
00:16:18.893 --> 00:16:22.893
it would've been easy to assume that

290
00:16:22.893 --> 00:16:27.993
she would go off to the studio alone to take a nap on the drums.

291
00:16:27.993 --> 00:16:31.893
Well, if the trash boxes of this rental studio are searched,

292
00:16:31.893 --> 00:16:35.493
I'm sure the PET bottle laced with the sleeping drug will be found.

293
00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:36.993
Okay! Search on the double!

294
00:16:36.993 --> 00:16:37.993
Yes, sir!

295
00:16:39.393 --> 00:16:44.293
Oh, and tell the forensics to check the knitted cap of the victim!

296
00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:45.493
Yes, sir!

297
00:16:47.993 --> 00:16:52.193
Ms. Rumi Kogure. Will you please come to the station with me?

298
00:16:52.193 --> 00:16:53.293
Rumi.

299
00:16:53.293 --> 00:16:55.893
But what about the scissors?

300
00:16:55.893 --> 00:16:57.693
Without scissors to cut the yarn with,

301
00:16:57.693 --> 00:17:00.993
the pompoms can't be removed, can they?

302
00:17:00.993 --> 00:17:02.893
You used the nail clipper, right?

303
00:17:02.893 --> 00:17:05.893
-What? -You figured Tadako would lend them to you

304
00:17:05.893 --> 00:17:07.693
if your nails were long.

305
00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:11.493
You just imagined all this, right?

306
00:17:11.493 --> 00:17:14.193
You don't have any proof that I did it, do you?

307
00:17:14.193 --> 00:17:16.193
-It's all too obvious. -What?

308
00:17:16.193 --> 00:17:20.093
Because you went out of your way to borrow the nail clippers

309
00:17:20.093 --> 00:17:22.093
but you didn't cut your nails!

310
00:17:23.893 --> 00:17:29.493
Which means that you knew that you wouldn't be practicing today, right?

311
00:17:29.493 --> 00:17:32.093
So you wouldn't have to cut your nails.

312
00:17:33.293 --> 00:17:36.993
Besides, along with the murder weapon yarn with Hagie's blood on it,

313
00:17:36.993 --> 00:17:41.193
I think they'll also find your fingerprints.

314
00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:46.893
Modern forensic investigators can even collect fingerprints

315
00:17:46.893 --> 00:17:50.193
from the fluffy surface of tennis balls.

316
00:17:52.193 --> 00:17:54.493
That's all baloney!

317
00:17:54.493 --> 00:17:57.793
Rumi couldn't have used that knitted cap as a tool to commit murder!

318
00:17:57.793 --> 00:18:01.493
Right! Because she knitted that cap together with Akane

319
00:18:01.493 --> 00:18:02.693
who she was best friends with.

320
00:18:02.693 --> 00:18:04.793
That's right.

321
00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:09.293
I used that knitted cap because it was something that Akane knitted.

322
00:18:09.293 --> 00:18:12.193
So that Hagie could get a taste of Akane's hatred!

323
00:18:12.193 --> 00:18:13.993
What?

324
00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:17.393
You know why, Akane ruined her throat, right?

325
00:18:17.393 --> 00:18:21.793
It was because of what drunk Hagie told her, right?

326
00:18:21.793 --> 00:18:24.793
That she wanted more depth in her voice.

327
00:18:24.793 --> 00:18:28.093
Right! Akane took it seriously

328
00:18:28.093 --> 00:18:30.393
and gargled using liquor that she couldn't take

329
00:18:30.393 --> 00:18:33.693
or covering her face with a cushion and yelling at the top of her lungs

330
00:18:33.693 --> 00:18:36.793
in an attempt to attain a husky voice, which she finally acquired.

331
00:18:36.793 --> 00:18:38.893
But Hagie had the nerve to tell her.

332
00:18:38.893 --> 00:18:40.793
What's with that voice of yours?

333
00:18:40.793 --> 00:18:43.093
You sounded better before!

334
00:18:43.093 --> 00:18:46.693
We can't do anything about it so you sing for the next live, Tadako!

335
00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:48.193
Akane, don't sing!

336
00:18:49.893 --> 00:18:51.893
She had the nerve to say that.

337
00:18:51.893 --> 00:18:53.093
It's too cruel!

338
00:18:53.093 --> 00:18:56.993
That Hagie didn't have the slightest idea how Akane felt!

339
00:18:58.193 --> 00:18:59.893
A few days after that,

340
00:18:59.893 --> 00:19:02.593
Akane jumped in front of a car and committed suicide.

341
00:19:02.593 --> 00:19:07.993
That's why I'm avenging Akane's death for her.

342
00:19:07.993 --> 00:19:11.293
No, it wasn't suicide. It was an accident.

343
00:19:11.293 --> 00:19:12.893
It was suicide, she killed herself!

344
00:19:12.893 --> 00:19:15.793
Otherwise, Akane would've never ignored the traffic light.

345
00:19:15.793 --> 00:19:17.193
Wrong, Rumi.

346
00:19:17.193 --> 00:19:19.793
Some boy was the one who ignored the traffic light

347
00:19:19.793 --> 00:19:21.693
and ran into the street.

348
00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:25.693
Akane got run over trying to save that boy.

349
00:19:25.693 --> 00:19:28.293
What? That's a lie.

350
00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:30.193
I know that's a lie.

351
00:19:30.193 --> 00:19:33.793
Because Hagie said at Akane's funeral

352
00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:36.693
that it was her fault that Akane died.

353
00:19:36.693 --> 00:19:41.193
That's probably because Akane obeyed what Hagie had told her.

354
00:19:41.993 --> 00:19:44.293
Obeyed what she was told?

355
00:19:44.293 --> 00:19:47.393
Don't use your voice until it recovers!

356
00:19:47.393 --> 00:19:48.893
That amount of hoarseness can be cured

357
00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:52.893
and you'll get your nice voice back again.

358
00:19:52.893 --> 00:19:54.893
She also apologized for saying what she shouldn't have

359
00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.693
when she was drunk.

360
00:19:59.593 --> 00:20:03.293
The people who witnessed the accident

361
00:20:03.293 --> 00:20:04.693
said she jumped into traffic to save the boy

362
00:20:04.693 --> 00:20:06.893
instead of calling out to him.

363
00:20:06.893 --> 00:20:09.193
You didn't know about this

364
00:20:09.193 --> 00:20:12.293
because after Akane died, you were sick in bed from the shock.

365
00:20:12.293 --> 00:20:14.193
Oh, no!

366
00:20:15.593 --> 00:20:18.493
What shall I do?

367
00:20:20.493 --> 00:20:22.793
I killed Hagie.

368
00:20:23.493 --> 00:20:26.493
No! No!

369
00:20:31.593 --> 00:20:36.293
A scream of regret echoed throughout the rental studio.

370
00:20:37.593 --> 00:20:41.293
Until the voice of the killer went hoarse.

371
00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:11.293
No, you mean that keyboardist was the killer?

372
00:22:11.293 --> 00:22:12.393
Yeah.

373
00:22:13.093 --> 00:22:15.293
But, you're really something, Sera!

374
00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:17.693
Because you solved a case again!

375
00:22:17.693 --> 00:22:19.293
Oh, yeah?

376
00:22:19.293 --> 00:22:24.593
Well, since Amuro and Conan helped me, it was no big deal!

377
00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:26.993
Just as would be expected of a high school girl detective.

378
00:22:26.993 --> 00:22:31.193
Well, my brother influenced me to becoming a detective!

379
00:22:31.193 --> 00:22:33.793
You mean your smart brother that you mentioned

380
00:22:33.793 --> 00:22:35.593
during the Red Woman case?

381
00:22:35.593 --> 00:22:38.193
No, that's my brother in the middle!

382
00:22:38.193 --> 00:22:41.093
The one who influenced me is my oldest brother!

383
00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:44.693
I thought your oldest brother passed away?

384
00:22:44.693 --> 00:22:47.493
Don't tell me he was a cop and died on duty?

385
00:22:47.493 --> 00:22:48.893
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:22:48.893 --> 00:22:50.793
But, he didn't work for the Japanese Police.

387
00:22:50.793 --> 00:22:55.093
He worked in the States as an FBI agent!

388
00:22:55.093 --> 00:22:56.593
Really?

389
00:22:57.193 --> 00:23:00.893
It seems he had a tough time getting his green card.

390
00:23:00.893 --> 00:23:03.793
That's why your big brother was in the States.

391
00:23:03.793 --> 00:23:04.793
Yeah.

392
00:23:04.793 --> 00:23:08.193
Your brother's name is...

393
00:23:08.993 --> 00:23:11.493
Shuichi Akai!

394
00:23:11.493 --> 00:23:12.993
Awesome, don't you think?

395
00:23:13.493 --> 00:23:15.293
I thought so.

396
00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:19.593
But, you saw him on the platform of a station in Japan, right?

397
00:23:19.593 --> 00:23:22.693
Yeah, that's why I was surprised.

398
00:23:22.693 --> 00:23:25.893
Which means that maybe the guy who taught you how to play the bass

399
00:23:25.893 --> 00:23:27.793
was also an FBI agent?

400
00:23:27.793 --> 00:23:29.093
No way.

401
00:23:29.093 --> 00:23:33.293
He was probably a friend my brother met while he was on vacation.

402
00:23:34.393 --> 00:23:36.493
No, he was...

403
00:23:37.593 --> 00:23:40.893
a MPD security police undercover agent.

404
00:23:41.893 --> 00:23:46.993
A man your older brother, Shuichi Akai,

405
00:23:49.093 --> 00:23:51.193
killed.

406
00:23:54.793 --> 00:23:56.693
It's full of hot air balloons.

407
00:23:59.893 --> 00:24:01.793
Watch out! They'll crash!

408
00:24:06.193 --> 00:24:09.493
It may have been an accident but a person died.

409
00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:12.793
You could be accused of Corporate Manslaughter.

410
00:24:12.793 --> 00:24:14.293
No.

411
00:24:14.993 --> 00:24:16.293
This is...

412
00:24:16.293 --> 00:24:18.393
This could be...

413
00:24:19.093 --> 00:24:24.293
Next Conan, "Mystery in a Hot Air Balloon"

414
00:24:24.936 --> 00:24:27.236
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:27.536 --> 00:24:29.236
"Hat"

416
00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:32.136
Shuichi Akai is some guy!

417
00:24:32.136 --> 00:24:33.736
I know him really well.
