1
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.010
"Yoshi Koda (77)"

2
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.310
A commemorative coin?

3
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.210
Robber?

4
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.010
Robber!

5
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.510
Somebody help!

6
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.510
The smell is gone.

7
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510
-Let's see... -Move, move it! You rice ball kid!

8
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.210
It hurts...

9
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.110
I've got a bump!

10
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.610
You jerk!

11
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.410
You're not getting away! Hold it!

12
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.710
Hold it, you violent jerk!

13
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.410
Hold it...

14
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.110
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

15
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.510
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

16
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.110
A star-crossed fate descends upon a robber

17
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.110
that gets entangled with Genta.

18
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.710
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.410
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:41.967
"The Two Who are Born to Meet"

22
00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:44.367
Yeah, you got a bump...

23
00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:45.667
It looks painful.

24
00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:49.567
I'm going to get that guy and turn him in to the police.

25
00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:51.267
Of course we'll help you!

26
00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:56.367
And why were you walking by Oku-Beika, Genta?

27
00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:58.767
It's quite some distance from Beika-cho.

28
00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:01.167
That's...

29
00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:04.667
We've got to find him quickly or he'll get away!

30
00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:05.767
That's right!

31
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.267
You only saw him from behind, right?

32
00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:11.467
Yeah. He was wearing a red jacket and jeans.

33
00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.567
There's nothing conclusive.

34
00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.867
I guess we start by splitting up and ask around.

35
00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.967
Please wait!

36
00:04:17.967 --> 00:04:21.867
Calling him the violent guy wearing a red jacket is inconvenient.

37
00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:23.467
So let's give him a temporary name!

38
00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:24.967
-Temporary name? -Temporary name?

39
00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:26.167
Is it necessary?

40
00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.767
How about Gonbei?

41
00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:32.767
After all, "The Nameless Gonbei" is a term for an unknown man.

42
00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:35.467
Gonbei?

43
00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.867
Since he's Gonbei who knocked Genta down,

44
00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:39.967
how about Gonta?

45
00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:41.867
You're starting to sound like Dr. Agasa.

46
00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:43.767
Nice!

47
00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:45.367
On your toes as usual, Haibara!

48
00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:47.267
That's a fantastic name!

49
00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:50.467
Since he's Gonbei who knocked Genta down, we call him Gonta!

50
00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:51.567
Fantastic!

51
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.067
But it sort of sounds like Dr. Agasa, no?

52
00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:56.267
They're not making fun of me, are they?

53
00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:57.367
Probably not.

54
00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:05.367
It hurts...

55
00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:10.867
Right. I fell from there.

56
00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:14.367
He's to blame.

57
00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.367
At any rate, I've gotta get out of here quick.

58
00:05:18.367 --> 00:05:22.067
Wait. Nobody's seen my face.

59
00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:23.767
So long as I change clothes...

60
00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:34.667
I'm not the perpetrator!

61
00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.767
I was made to change clothes while I was passed out!

62
00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:42.167
Do you think that the police would believe a such a convenient story?

63
00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.267
Right?

64
00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.067
How was it, you guys?

65
00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:53.667
-No good. -No eye-witness information.

66
00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:54.867
Same here!

67
00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:58.167
Darn it! Where did that violent man go?

68
00:05:58.167 --> 00:05:59.167
It's Gonta.

69
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:00.467
Oh, right.

70
00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:03.067
Hey, you guys.

71
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.467
What're you doing here?

72
00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:09.367
Rather, did you see a suspicious looking man?

73
00:06:09.367 --> 00:06:11.667
One who was wearing a red jacket and jeans?

74
00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:17.067
He's a robber that broke into Mrs. Koda's residence right up here.

75
00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:19.167
He was a robber?

76
00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:20.967
Yeah.

77
00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.667
Who?

78
00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:24.867
Did you see that man by any chance?

79
00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:28.067
Oh, no. It's not that I saw his face.

80
00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:29.467
He was probably fleeing

81
00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:32.167
and Genta was in his way so he knocked Genta down.

82
00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:33.467
Knocked him down?

83
00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:35.067
Yeah!

84
00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:38.967
See! He hit my head and got a bump!

85
00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:40.367
So, I was thinking of catching him

86
00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:42.567
-and turning him in to the police. -Yes, sir.

87
00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:45.767
Officer Takagi! There no one who matches the description of that man

88
00:06:45.767 --> 00:06:48.067
on the security cameras near the station.

89
00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:49.567
I see.

90
00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:53.867
If so, it's possible that he's still hiding somewhere near here.

91
00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:55.967
-Let's go! -Yes!

92
00:06:55.967 --> 00:06:58.167
So he wasn't just some violent man

93
00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.167
but a vicious robber. That Gonta.

94
00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:02.167
-Yeah! -Yeah!

95
00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:04.167
We've got to catch him with our own hands

96
00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:05.467
-no matter what. -What now?

97
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.867
It's getting pretty exciting but...

98
00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:11.167
It seems that he's a lone perpetrator.

99
00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:13.067
If worse comes to worse, I'll use this.

100
00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:16.067
Haibara! Conan! Let's go.

101
00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:17.467
Okay.

102
00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:29.667
It hurts.

103
00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:33.667
Darn it. How'd I get here?

104
00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:36.667
What am I doing in a place like this?

105
00:07:38.567 --> 00:07:41.767
Who am I?

106
00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:44.267
I wonder if I have a name card or something.

107
00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:45.867
A driver's license, maybe.

108
00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:47.067
Something.

109
00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:54.167
Why do I have something like this?

110
00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:58.767
Excuse me.

111
00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:00.667
Do you know me?

112
00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:02.167
Yes?

113
00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:06.567
I can't remember who or where I came from.

114
00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:08.967
You don't even remember your name?

115
00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:11.267
No, not at all...

116
00:08:13.867 --> 00:08:16.167
A red jacket and jeans.

117
00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:19.567
Don't tell me you're the robber on the run?

118
00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:21.167
Robber?

119
00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.367
No way.

120
00:08:23.467 --> 00:08:26.967
I want to ask you some questions.

121
00:08:26.967 --> 00:08:29.467

it seems Gonta is suffering from amnesia.

Right. I was suddenly struck from behind.

And when I gain my consciousness,

161
00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:56.767

Yeah.

he maybe doing evil things to those who can't pay back their debts.

A typical villain.

Let's trace Gonta's tracks.

179
00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:42.867
He knocked the granny of that house and fled.

180
00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:45.867
He then knocked me down really hard over here.

181
00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:48.867
You mean you lost sight of him just about here?

182
00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:51.367
What's the matter?

183
00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:54.267
It looks like somebody rolled down from here.

184
00:11:54.267 --> 00:11:55.767
Okay!

00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:58.567
Gonta couldn't make this turn

186
00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:00.867
and accidentally fell from here.

187
00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:04.867
He then hit his head and lost his memory.

188
00:12:04.867 --> 00:12:06.167
Let's take a look below!

189
00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:12.867
There seems to be no mistake about it.

190
00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:16.367
There are two traces.

191
00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:19.167
There were two people who came falling here?

192
00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:20.767
-That's right. -That's right.

193
00:12:20.767 --> 00:12:23.167
Somebody got messed up with him!

194
00:12:23.167 --> 00:12:25.767
When Gonta turned the corner,

195
00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:29.167
he bumped into someone and they fell down here!

196
00:12:29.167 --> 00:12:30.767
But if so...

197
00:12:30.767 --> 00:12:32.967
That person who got messed up in this

198
00:12:32.967 --> 00:12:35.367
would've naturally reported this to the police, right?

199
00:12:35.367 --> 00:12:38.867
But Officer Takagi said nothing like that!

200
00:12:38.867 --> 00:12:42.567
Why didn't that person go to the police?

201
00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:48.167
I see. He doesn't know what happened to him

202
00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:49.967
because he lost his memory.

203
00:12:49.967 --> 00:12:51.567
Wrong, Conan.

204
00:12:51.567 --> 00:12:55.667
The one who lost his memory isn't the one who got messed up

205
00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:58.267
but it was Gonta!

206
00:12:58.267 --> 00:13:00.167
Edogawa, don't tell me that...

207
00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:01.367
Yeah.

208
00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:04.867
Come to think of it, something bothered me back then.

209
00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:07.267
The clothes he was wearing was strangely baggy.

210
00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:09.967
Genta?

211
00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:11.967
The guy who knocked you down.

212
00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:14.267
Was it really Gonta?

213
00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:18.067
Well, now that you mentioned it.

214
00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:22.967
I feel like he was a little bigger.

215
00:13:22.967 --> 00:13:25.067
I guess that settles it.

216
00:13:25.067 --> 00:13:29.667
They switched after they changed clothes after falling here!

217
00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:33.067
In other words, the Gonta that we've been pursuing...

218
00:13:33.067 --> 00:13:36.167
He's not the robber that knocked me down hard.

219
00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:38.767
But the one who got messed up in the incident?

220
00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:42.867
And yet he believes that he's a robber

221
00:13:42.867 --> 00:13:44.267
and is still on the run.

222
00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:47.567
When he actually did nothing wrong.

223
00:13:47.567 --> 00:13:48.967
"Obstructing Performance of Public Duty" "Trespassing"

224
00:13:48.967 --> 00:13:50.567
"Damage to Property" "Entering a Restricted Area"

225
00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:52.067
"Larceny" "Mugging"

226
00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:56.867
In order to run, he ended up doing things that are really bad.

227
00:13:58.067 --> 00:14:00.867
We're going back to Beika-cho.

228
00:14:00.867 --> 00:14:02.367
Beika-cho?

229
00:14:02.367 --> 00:14:04.567
That Ujihara guy, right?

230
00:14:04.567 --> 00:14:05.767
Yeah.

231
00:14:05.767 --> 00:14:09.767
If that guy made the real robber commit the robbery

232
00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:12.367
then it's understandable why he appeared at the crime scene.

233
00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:14.367
To check on whether things went well or not.

234
00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:17.767
Worried about whether they'd find out if he was pulling the strings.

235
00:14:17.767 --> 00:14:20.167
That's very likely!

236
00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:22.467
If we get to him,

237
00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:25.267
I'm sure we'll find the real perpetrator!

238
00:14:33.934 --> 00:14:37.034
"Ujihara Finance"

239
00:14:44.234 --> 00:14:46.234
Who are those kids?

240
00:14:47.634 --> 00:14:48.834
The sixth floor.

241
00:14:48.834 --> 00:14:51.734
How are we going to check on him?

242
00:14:51.734 --> 00:14:53.934
That rice ball kid.

243
00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:03.634
Maybe.

244
00:15:04.734 --> 00:15:06.534
Conan?

245
00:15:06.534 --> 00:15:07.934
Officer Takagi.

246
00:15:07.934 --> 00:15:10.134
What brings you all here?

247
00:15:10.134 --> 00:15:12.834
Rather, why are you here?

248
00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:15.734
We came to talk to Masuzo Ujihara.

249
00:15:15.734 --> 00:15:17.934
We're going to show him this drawing.

250
00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:19.234
Oh, no.

251
00:15:19.234 --> 00:15:21.034
Officer Takagi.

252
00:15:21.034 --> 00:15:22.134
He's...

253
00:15:22.134 --> 00:15:25.834
The elevator's undergoing maintenance.

254
00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:27.934
That man is not the robber.

255
00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:30.134
Wait...

256
00:15:30.134 --> 00:15:32.234
I was just over imagining things.

257
00:15:33.334 --> 00:15:35.134
It's this man.

258
00:15:35.134 --> 00:15:38.034
You know him, don't you, Mr. Ujihara?

259
00:15:42.234 --> 00:15:44.934
I don't know such a man.

260
00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:48.634
But, when you looked at this drawing you...

261
00:15:48.634 --> 00:15:50.834
Wait. Wait a minute.

262
00:15:54.734 --> 00:15:56.534
Something's strange.

263
00:15:56.534 --> 00:15:58.034
Strange?

264
00:15:58.034 --> 00:16:03.034
Because he just happened get messed up and is a victim.

265
00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:05.934
Messed up?

266
00:16:05.934 --> 00:16:10.434
Despite that, Ujihara looked flustered when he saw that drawing.

267
00:16:10.434 --> 00:16:12.134
It sure is strange.

268
00:16:12.134 --> 00:16:13.434
Wait a second.

269
00:16:13.434 --> 00:16:15.234
If I'm not mistaken, Inspector Megure...

270
00:16:16.534 --> 00:16:17.934
So, that's the story!

271
00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:23.234
Yes?

272
00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:26.334
We'd like to talk to you regarding the robbery that occurred at Oku-Beika.

273
00:16:27.634 --> 00:16:29.834
He was the one after all.

274
00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:32.334
You remember me, don't you?

275
00:16:34.634 --> 00:16:35.734
I'm not letting you get away!

276
00:16:35.734 --> 00:16:36.834
Wait!

277
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:43.734
How dare you knock me down!

278
00:16:49.534 --> 00:16:50.834
Yes.

279
00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:52.134
Officer Takagi?

280
00:16:52.134 --> 00:16:54.334
We've captured the suspect!

281
00:16:57.834 --> 00:17:01.134
"Koda" -The robber that I saw!

282
00:17:01.134 --> 00:17:03.134
This red jacket and jeans!

283
00:17:03.134 --> 00:17:06.634
Oh, no, that's not it...

284
00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:08.334
That's not it?

285
00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:12.534
Rather it's pretty complicated, you see.

286
00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:14.134
Shinya Torimaru.

287
00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:17.534
I just happened to hear yesterday.

288
00:17:17.534 --> 00:17:20.734
About a loan shark called Ujihara.

289
00:17:20.734 --> 00:17:23.934
There's a rich person called Koda in Oku-Beika.

290
00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:26.534
"Ujihara Finance"

291
00:17:26.534 --> 00:17:29.934
If you can't make money, go and rip money off of that house.

292
00:17:29.934 --> 00:17:33.034
Are you telling me to commit a robbery?

293
00:17:33.034 --> 00:17:36.534
It's easy, because the old lady lives alone.

294
00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:41.734
And since I thought it sounded profitable,

295
00:17:41.734 --> 00:17:43.734
so I snuck in.

296
00:17:43.734 --> 00:17:46.534
Then I found the old lady fainted

297
00:17:46.534 --> 00:17:49.034
and the whole house was ransacked.

298
00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:53.334
I figured I'm inside already so I may as well.

299
00:17:55.234 --> 00:17:57.534
A commemorative coin.

300
00:17:57.534 --> 00:17:59.334
Robber?

301
00:18:01.134 --> 00:18:03.334
Robber!

302
00:18:03.334 --> 00:18:04.834
Someone help!

303
00:18:18.934 --> 00:18:20.534
The smell is gone.

304
00:18:20.534 --> 00:18:22.634
-Let's see... -Move, move it! You rice ball kid!

305
00:18:32.234 --> 00:18:34.734
Hold it...

306
00:18:39.634 --> 00:18:40.934
It hurts...

307
00:18:44.534 --> 00:18:46.834
Right. I fell from there.

308
00:18:48.534 --> 00:18:50.334
He's to blame.

309
00:18:51.534 --> 00:18:53.434
At any rate, I've gotta get out of here quick.

310
00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:58.034
Wait. Nobody's seen my face.

311
00:18:58.034 --> 00:18:59.734
So long as I change clothes...

312
00:19:10.134 --> 00:19:13.134
I thought I'll get away fine

313
00:19:13.134 --> 00:19:15.834
by switching places with this guy.

314
00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:21.334
Was I knocked out one after the other by two robbers then?

315
00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:23.334
There weren't two robbers

316
00:19:23.334 --> 00:19:25.734
but two people did break in.

317
00:19:25.734 --> 00:19:28.334
Inspector, so that means that he...

318
00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:33.534
I didn't commit any robbery

319
00:19:33.534 --> 00:19:36.434
but I thought I had to flee and committed one crime after the other.

320
00:19:36.434 --> 00:19:37.934
How terrible.

321
00:19:43.034 --> 00:19:46.034
Mr. Torimaru, wasn't it this voice?

322
00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:49.534
That you heard at Ujihara Finance yesterday?

323
00:19:49.534 --> 00:19:52.834
What shall I do?

324
00:19:54.734 --> 00:19:57.934
Are you telling me to commit a robbery?

325
00:19:57.934 --> 00:19:59.534
Right, it's him!

326
00:19:59.534 --> 00:20:01.634
He was being threatened by Ujihara yesterday!

327
00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:02.634
Me?

328
00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:04.134
-What? -What?

329
00:20:04.134 --> 00:20:06.534
It's just as you deduced, Conan.

330
00:20:06.534 --> 00:20:11.534
Because if this man called Ujihara didn't provoke him,

331
00:20:11.534 --> 00:20:13.834
he wouldn't have been so flustered.

332
00:20:15.634 --> 00:20:17.134
Which means...

333
00:20:17.134 --> 00:20:20.834
In other words, he snuck in to rob the house,

334
00:20:20.834 --> 00:20:22.634
knocked Mrs. Koda out

335
00:20:22.634 --> 00:20:24.834
While he was ransacking the house,

336
00:20:24.834 --> 00:20:28.534
Mr. Torimaru sneaked in and he fled.

337
00:20:28.534 --> 00:20:33.834
That man, who fled, sprained his leg and was crouching

338
00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:36.334
when Mr. Torimaru came running in.

339
00:20:36.334 --> 00:20:38.134
So, that's the story!

340
00:20:38.134 --> 00:20:40.734
Finally. It explained everything.

341
00:20:41.934 --> 00:20:47.534
All we've got left to do now is charge Ujihara with instigating this man.

342
00:20:47.534 --> 00:20:50.234
Then this case is closed.

343
00:20:51.934 --> 00:20:55.234
I was a robber after all.

344
00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:59.634
I think Gonta was threatened to do it and had no choice.

345
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:03.034
What? My name's Gonta?

346
00:21:03.034 --> 00:21:06.034
No. We named you that on our own.

347
00:21:06.034 --> 00:21:08.134
Right! That's right!

348
00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:09.834
My name's Gonta.

349
00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:11.234
Taro Gonno.

350
00:21:11.234 --> 00:21:13.434
-Taro Gonno? -Taro Gonno?

351
00:21:13.434 --> 00:21:16.134
That's what I was always called as a child.

352
00:21:16.134 --> 00:21:17.634
Gonta.

353
00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:23.334
I remember everything now.

354
00:21:23.334 --> 00:21:27.234
The company I worked for went bankrupt and I was depressed.

355
00:21:27.234 --> 00:21:28.934
But yesterday...

356
00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:32.534
"Ujihara Finance" -Are you telling me to commit a robbery?

357
00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:35.334
I was surprised but...

358
00:21:37.034 --> 00:21:41.034
Robbery is exciting.

359
00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.334
That's why I snuck in.

360
00:21:44.334 --> 00:21:46.034
I was burning with passion

361
00:21:46.034 --> 00:21:47.334
after finally finding something I could live for.

362
00:21:54.834 --> 00:21:57.234
He's worse than me.

363
00:21:57.234 --> 00:21:59.634
Take these two away immediately.

364
00:21:59.634 --> 00:22:00.734
Yes, sir!

365
00:23:23.634 --> 00:23:25.134
Come to think of it.

366
00:23:25.134 --> 00:23:28.634
Why were you walking in a place like this?

367
00:23:28.634 --> 00:23:31.934
Right, we didn't ask you that yet!

368
00:23:31.934 --> 00:23:35.234
It was because...

369
00:23:35.234 --> 00:23:37.334
I can't remember.

370
00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:38.934
Don't tell us that you forgot, Genta?

371
00:23:38.934 --> 00:23:41.834
You were knocked down and hit your head so...

372
00:23:43.034 --> 00:23:45.034
It can't be.

373
00:23:45.034 --> 00:23:47.034
I can't remember.

374
00:23:47.034 --> 00:23:48.934
I wonder what it was?

375
00:23:48.934 --> 00:23:52.034
"Japan's Best Eel Bowl, this way" -Are you asking us that question?

376
00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:56.434
"Next Episode"

377
00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:59.234
Watch closely now.

378
00:23:59.234 --> 00:24:00.334
What was that about?

379
00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:10.734
Hey, Conan!

380
00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:15.034
That's the shop I just went to.

381
00:24:18.934 --> 00:24:24.334
Next Conan, "Fitting Room Blind Spot (Part 1)"

382
00:24:24.877 --> 00:24:27.377
Next Conan's Hint:

383
00:24:27.377 --> 00:24:29.177
"Swimsuits"

384
00:24:29.177 --> 00:24:30.477
So, I solved the case after all?

385
00:24:30.477 --> 00:24:32.177
-He still has amnesia. -How disappointing.

386
00:24:32.177 --> 00:24:33.577
Just as would be expected of Genta.
