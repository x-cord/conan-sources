1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.440
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.240
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.340
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.940
Mystery of Trick Ridge is coming to an end.

5
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.240
Heiji and I solve the mystery perfectly.

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.540
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:57.873
Hattori and Kazuha are called out to the Takeda home

10
00:01:57.873 --> 00:01:59.673
on Trick Ridge in Tottori Prefecture.

11
00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:01.473
The two get lost

12
00:02:01.473 --> 00:02:04.773
and meet up with a foreigner by the name of Robert Taylor.

13
00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:08.573
We were also called out to the Takeda home

14
00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:11.473
and accidentally meet up with them on the way there.

15
00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.873
We were called to solve the mystery of the curse

16
00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:16.173
of the "Spider Mansion of Trick Ridge".

17
00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:20.373
On the night of our arrival,

18
00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.773
the oldest son of the Takeda family, Nobukazu

19
00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:25.873
commits suicide on the 2nd floor of the storehouse.

20
00:02:25.873 --> 00:02:29.573
In addition, Kazuha is attacked

21
00:02:29.573 --> 00:02:34.473
and found tangled in strings in the same storehouse.

22
00:02:34.473 --> 00:02:36.073
This is...

23
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.073
Ka...

24
00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:40.273
Kazuha!

25
00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:42.973
Name card?

26
00:02:42.973 --> 00:02:44.573
Here, this is it.

27
00:02:50.473 --> 00:02:52.773
I got it out somehow.

28
00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.373
-Hey, this is... -No way...

29
00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.073
You're kidding.

30
00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:58.473
Isn't it a stun gun?

31
00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:00.173
She didn't see the murderer,

32
00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:03.073
but she said she found a strange ball in front of the storehouse.

33
00:03:03.073 --> 00:03:04.473
Ball?

34
00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:07.973
She said that it was a ball about this small.

35
00:03:07.973 --> 00:03:09.573
BB shot!

36
00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.073
-That's it! -There was that method!

37
00:03:13.073 --> 00:03:14.873
If that's so...

38
00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:18.073
I found it! Hattori, it's here!

39
00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:20.073
I've found it too.

40
00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:23.773
Strange string with loops on the beam ends.

41
00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:30.373
There's no mistake. That person is the murderer!

42
00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:40.473
"Mystery Of The Spider Mansion Of Tottori (Part 3)"

43
00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:47.273
What? He knows who the murderer is?

44
00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:51.473
Did Mr. Mouri really say that?

45
00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:52.573
That's right.

46
00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:56.373
He said for everyone to gather on the 2nd floor of the storehouse.

47
00:03:56.373 --> 00:04:02.373
Oh, yes. He also said to bring that big doll in the workshop too.

48
00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:06.373
Also, it would help if there is some spare gasoline.

49
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:12.773
Hey, what's that kid from Osaka up to?

50
00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:15.673
Bringing the corpse down without permission.

51
00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:18.673
Did he really say to wait there?

52
00:04:18.673 --> 00:04:20.573
That's right.

53
00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:40.073
Oh, you're all here.

54
00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:43.773
Well, let me start to tell you about the many incidents

55
00:04:43.773 --> 00:04:45.673
that have happened here at the Takeda home.

56
00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:48.473
Mr. Mouri, please wait.

57
00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:50.573
When we found brother,

58
00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:54.773
the door was locked from the inside.

59
00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:57.473
There's only that one small window

60
00:04:57.473 --> 00:05:00.773
barely large enough for a child to get through.

61
00:05:00.773 --> 00:05:03.473
I don't think it's a curse.

62
00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:07.173
But if you say there's a murderer, will you explain to us first?

63
00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.873
How the murderer escaped from this room?

64
00:05:09.873 --> 00:05:13.073
If there's a way like that...

65
00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:15.373
I'm the one who'd like to know how it was done.

66
00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:17.373
Hah?

67
00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:19.573
Right.

68
00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:23.773
The criminal had no need to escape from here.

69
00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:26.373
That's because, when he murdered Nobukazu,

70
00:05:26.373 --> 00:05:29.873
the murderer wasn't in this room.

71
00:05:30.573 --> 00:05:32.673
Impossible.

72
00:05:32.673 --> 00:05:34.673
Then, how did he do it?

73
00:05:34.673 --> 00:05:39.173
The strings used for the puppets.

74
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:44.773
The murderer used puppet strings, ropes, and thumbtacks

75
00:05:44.773 --> 00:05:47.773
to commit this crime in a sealed room.

76
00:05:47.773 --> 00:05:49.673
The set-up is simple.

77
00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:51.673
First, the rope is set-up

78
00:05:51.673 --> 00:05:53.473
so that the loop closes when it is pulled

79
00:05:53.473 --> 00:05:55.973
and it is tied to the beam.

80
00:05:55.973 --> 00:05:59.873
Then, with stalls loops made on both ends of the string,

81
00:05:59.873 --> 00:06:01.973
the loop of the rope is pulled to four corners,

82
00:06:01.973 --> 00:06:05.873
and fixed to the small window with thumbtacks.

83
00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:09.073
Another long string is attached

84
00:06:09.073 --> 00:06:11.673
to the base of the loop of that rope.

85
00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:15.273
It is put over the beam in the center of the room

86
00:06:15.273 --> 00:06:17.373
and lends out the small window

87
00:06:17.373 --> 00:06:19.973
and the set-up is completed.

88
00:06:19.973 --> 00:06:21.273
Look.

89
00:06:21.273 --> 00:06:23.173
Like this.

90
00:06:23.973 --> 00:06:26.473
Little boy.

91
00:06:26.473 --> 00:06:29.673
All that's left to do is call Nobukazu out here,

92
00:06:29.673 --> 00:06:32.173
make him look out of the window,

93
00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:33.773
and pull the string.

94
00:06:33.773 --> 00:06:35.573
The loop of the rope closes

95
00:06:35.573 --> 00:06:39.473
and he is able to murder Nobukazu.

96
00:06:39.473 --> 00:06:44.173
But, why did brother lock the door?

97
00:06:44.173 --> 00:06:45.573
And...

98
00:06:45.573 --> 00:06:47.573
anyone would think it strange

99
00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:50.373
if he was told by the person he was waiting for

100
00:06:50.373 --> 00:06:53.073
to look out the window.

101
00:06:53.073 --> 00:06:56.273
He locked the door because it was something important

102
00:06:56.273 --> 00:06:58.673
and he didn't want anyone to see him.

103
00:06:58.673 --> 00:07:00.873
He looked out the window

104
00:07:00.873 --> 00:07:03.073
because he probably heard a sound.

105
00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:05.573
-A sound? -Yes.

106
00:07:05.573 --> 00:07:09.673
The criminal fired BB shots at the window with an air gun,

107
00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:15.073
so that Nobukazu would look out the window.

108
00:07:15.073 --> 00:07:16.673
It was to avenge Misa

109
00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:21.473
who committed suicide in this storehouse three years ago!

110
00:07:23.073 --> 00:07:25.373
Mi... Misa's revenge?

111
00:07:25.373 --> 00:07:27.973
Yes. The criminal probably thought that

112
00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:30.873
Nobukazu having found out that Misa wasn't his real daughter

113
00:07:30.873 --> 00:07:33.373
went hard on her

114
00:07:33.373 --> 00:07:36.573
and forced her into committing suicide.

115
00:07:36.573 --> 00:07:38.873
Not his real daughter?

116
00:07:38.873 --> 00:07:41.273
What does it mean?

117
00:07:41.273 --> 00:07:44.273
Isn't that right, Ryuji?

118
00:07:46.473 --> 00:07:48.773
Dear?

119
00:07:48.773 --> 00:07:51.173
I'm sorry, Yuko.

120
00:07:51.173 --> 00:07:55.373
I know I had to tell you about it, sooner or later but...

121
00:07:55.373 --> 00:07:57.973
Misa, that child

122
00:07:57.973 --> 00:08:03.473
is the daughter made between brother's wife Kinuyo and I...

123
00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:06.773
You're joking, aren't you?

124
00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:08.273
Dear.

125
00:08:09.373 --> 00:08:10.773
It's true.

126
00:08:11.773 --> 00:08:15.273
It was before I met you.

127
00:08:15.273 --> 00:08:17.273
Kinuyo was told at the hospital

128
00:08:17.273 --> 00:08:19.673
that brother could not have children

129
00:08:19.673 --> 00:08:22.773
and she pleaded me with tears.

130
00:08:22.773 --> 00:08:27.973
He wants a child. "Please make his dream come true", she said.

131
00:08:27.973 --> 00:08:29.773
That was the first and last time.

132
00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:31.973
Brother and I have the same blood type,

133
00:08:31.973 --> 00:08:34.973
so he wouldn't have found out.

134
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:36.173
Until three years ago

135
00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:40.073
when the doctor at the hospital slipped his mouth...

136
00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.473
Misa ended up committing suicide

137
00:08:46.473 --> 00:08:51.473
and Kinuyo, feeling responsible, followed her.

138
00:08:51.473 --> 00:08:55.973
It's all because I listened to her plead.

139
00:08:55.973 --> 00:08:57.873
Dear.

140
00:08:57.873 --> 00:09:01.773
But how did you know I was Misa's father?

141
00:09:01.773 --> 00:09:05.073
Kinuyo and I didn't tell anyone.

142
00:09:05.073 --> 00:09:06.973
Her name.

143
00:09:06.973 --> 00:09:10.373
Misa and the daughters of you and Yoko,

144
00:09:10.373 --> 00:09:13.173
their names resemble each other

145
00:09:13.173 --> 00:09:15.473
"Misa, Sae, Emi" -and form a circle.

146
00:09:15.473 --> 00:09:18.273
I recognized that and knew.

147
00:09:18.273 --> 00:09:21.473
You secretly made the names of your daughters'

148
00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:23.373
have relation to one another.

149
00:09:23.373 --> 00:09:27.173
It's also seems like you were unusually upset

150
00:09:27.173 --> 00:09:29.873
at Misa and Kinuyo's funerals.

151
00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:32.373
But, mother named all the daughters...

152
00:09:32.373 --> 00:09:35.173
I knew.

153
00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:40.573
I named the three to form a circle for you.

154
00:09:42.173 --> 00:09:45.673
Don't take an old person for fool.

155
00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:49.073
When Kinuyo came home from the hospital with the baby,

156
00:09:49.073 --> 00:09:54.273
I knew right away from the way you two acted.

157
00:09:57.873 --> 00:10:01.173
But, I didn't think you'd take revenge

158
00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:03.073
for the daughter whose suicide,

159
00:10:03.073 --> 00:10:06.973
and your older brother, Nobukazu, was responsible for.

160
00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:10.173
Making it look like the curse of the Spider Empress.

161
00:10:10.173 --> 00:10:12.173
You're disgusting.

162
00:10:12.173 --> 00:10:15.773
Mother, you're wrong. I didn't kill brother.

163
00:10:15.773 --> 00:10:18.773
Ryuji isn't the murderer.

164
00:10:20.273 --> 00:10:22.173
I said, didn't I?

165
00:10:22.173 --> 00:10:24.773
That the murderer fired an air gun at the window

166
00:10:24.773 --> 00:10:26.973
and when Nobukazu looked out the window,

167
00:10:26.973 --> 00:10:30.873
the string was pulled and he was killed.

168
00:10:30.873 --> 00:10:33.373
Even if the room was sealed,

169
00:10:33.373 --> 00:10:37.273
if someone made movements in front of the storehouse like that,

170
00:10:37.273 --> 00:10:39.373
he'd immediately be suspicions.

171
00:10:39.373 --> 00:10:41.973
The way this set-up was made,

172
00:10:41.973 --> 00:10:44.573
there would have to be more than human strength used

173
00:10:44.573 --> 00:10:48.073
or the rate of failure would be very high.

174
00:10:48.073 --> 00:10:49.973
To make it successful,

175
00:10:49.973 --> 00:10:52.273
you would need the strength to pull the thumbtacks,

176
00:10:52.273 --> 00:10:55.773
on all four corners, off at once.

177
00:10:55.773 --> 00:10:58.273
Without being noticed by anyone,

178
00:10:58.273 --> 00:11:01.273
there's only one person who could have done that.

179
00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:03.873
You're the only one!

180
00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:14.262
Without being noticed by anyone,

181
00:11:14.262 --> 00:11:17.262
there's only one person who could have done that.

182
00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:20.262
You're the only one!

183
00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:23.362
You used the car to visit the grave with the girls.

184
00:11:23.362 --> 00:11:24.862
Robert.

185
00:11:26.462 --> 00:11:28.762
You're the only one who could've done it.

186
00:11:33.862 --> 00:11:37.362
After dinner, when you were going out to visit the grave,

187
00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:39.362
you parked the car in front of the storehouse.

188
00:11:39.362 --> 00:11:40.662
You waited for the girls to come running over

189
00:11:40.662 --> 00:11:43.062
to the car that was waiting.

190
00:11:43.062 --> 00:11:48.062
You could have shot at the storehouse window from the driver's seat.

191
00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:51.562
And, beforehand you could have leads the strings out the window.

192
00:11:51.562 --> 00:11:54.162
If you tied it to the car before dinner,

193
00:11:54.162 --> 00:11:56.062
all you would have to do is drive the car,

194
00:11:56.062 --> 00:11:59.262
you'd be able to pull with great strength.

195
00:11:59.262 --> 00:12:03.262
The string that was left on the car was retrieved in the mountains

196
00:12:03.262 --> 00:12:06.262
when you stopped to look at the scenery

197
00:12:06.262 --> 00:12:10.862
and was thrown away somewhere along with the air gun.

198
00:12:10.862 --> 00:12:12.962
Please wait a minute.

199
00:12:12.962 --> 00:12:16.162
Yes, I'm definitely the one who moved the car but...

200
00:12:16.162 --> 00:12:20.362
It could have been someone else that tied the string to the car.

201
00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:22.462
And, I hadn't been here for 3 years.

202
00:12:22.462 --> 00:12:25.062
I just arrived today, didn't I?

203
00:12:25.062 --> 00:12:28.462
I forgot where the house was and even got lost.

204
00:12:28.462 --> 00:12:30.762
From the time I arrived here to the time we went to visit the grave,

205
00:12:30.762 --> 00:12:33.062
I was with you almost all that time.

206
00:12:33.062 --> 00:12:35.762
I wouldn't have the time to rigged a setup like this.

207
00:12:35.762 --> 00:12:37.462
No.

208
00:12:37.462 --> 00:12:40.762
It haven't been three years since you visited here.

209
00:12:40.762 --> 00:12:42.462
It's several days ago.

210
00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:43.562
Right.

211
00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:48.562
You murdered Mr. Negishi and rigged this set-up on that day.

212
00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:52.362
What's that?

213
00:12:52.362 --> 00:12:56.862
That's why only Mr. Negishi was killed in the barn.

214
00:12:56.862 --> 00:13:00.462
He avoided this room that was rigged with the set-up.

215
00:13:00.462 --> 00:13:02.362
The high school detective from Osaka

216
00:13:02.362 --> 00:13:04.462
was called out with a strange request.

217
00:13:04.462 --> 00:13:06.562
He made the meeting on the road look accidental

218
00:13:06.562 --> 00:13:10.062
to make it look like who hadn't been here for three years.

219
00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:14.162
No one would suspect a person, who was lost

220
00:13:14.162 --> 00:13:17.062
and picked up by an Osaka detective on the road,

221
00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:23.562
to have something like this set up beforehand.

222
00:13:23.562 --> 00:13:26.462
But, why kill Mr. Negishi?

223
00:13:26.462 --> 00:13:30.162
Well, I don't know that yet, but...

224
00:13:30.162 --> 00:13:34.162
I know for sure that Robert found out about Misa's suicide

225
00:13:34.162 --> 00:13:37.262
and the narcotics at that time.

226
00:13:37.262 --> 00:13:39.162
Narcotics?

227
00:13:39.162 --> 00:13:42.862
Yes. Nobukazu worked with Mr. Negishi

228
00:13:42.862 --> 00:13:45.062
stuffing the dolls with narcotics

229
00:13:45.062 --> 00:13:48.462
and selling them at a high price.

230
00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:50.062
Brother dealing narcotics?

231
00:13:50.062 --> 00:13:52.162
That can't be true.

232
00:13:52.162 --> 00:13:57.762
If you don't believe me, check out the dolls in the workshop later.

233
00:13:57.762 --> 00:14:02.762
The dolls are filled with narcotics.

234
00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:06.062
And, after killing Mr. Negishi,

235
00:14:06.062 --> 00:14:09.062
Robert stole one of the dolls that Mr. Negishi

236
00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:10.962
was planning to take with him.

237
00:14:10.962 --> 00:14:11.962
The next day,

238
00:14:11.962 --> 00:14:16.462
he made the plans to call Nobikazu out to this room.

239
00:14:16.462 --> 00:14:18.062
"If you're interested in narcotics,

240
00:14:18.062 --> 00:14:21.862
I've got some good drugs want to make a deal...

241
00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.862
is probably what he said on the phone,

242
00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:28.562
Nobikazu suspected someone in the family of killing Mr. Negishi

243
00:14:28.562 --> 00:14:31.062
and stealing the narcotics

244
00:14:31.062 --> 00:14:33.562
and he jumped at the phone call.

245
00:14:33.562 --> 00:14:37.962
He was called out to this room where the trap was set up

246
00:14:37.962 --> 00:14:42.262
and was murdered.

247
00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:44.462
Am I wrong?

248
00:14:44.462 --> 00:14:45.962
Stop.

249
00:14:45.962 --> 00:14:48.262
You don't have proof and you're making false accusations.

250
00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:52.262
And, you're forgetting something important.

251
00:14:52.262 --> 00:14:58.462
Explain the mystery why Nobukazu was tangled in the strings.

252
00:15:01.862 --> 00:15:04.362
Was he really...

253
00:15:12.762 --> 00:15:16.662
Hey, old man! I'm ready!

254
00:15:16.662 --> 00:15:18.262
Right, right.

255
00:15:18.262 --> 00:15:21.962
I completely forgot about it until you mentioned it.

256
00:15:21.962 --> 00:15:25.362
That thing about Nobukazu being tangled in the strings.

257
00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:28.162
That set-up has been taken care of too,

258
00:15:28.162 --> 00:15:29.462
hasn't it, Conan?

259
00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:33.762
Look. It was dark and you probably didn't see it, but...

260
00:15:33.762 --> 00:15:40.862
Strings are attached to the rope that's tied to the beam!

261
00:15:42.062 --> 00:15:45.562
Proof rather than discussion, let's actually try it.

262
00:15:45.562 --> 00:15:46.962
Then, Yuzo...

263
00:15:46.962 --> 00:15:50.462
stick the head of the doll, you have, out the window.

264
00:15:50.462 --> 00:15:51.862
Sure.

265
00:15:54.062 --> 00:15:59.062
That's it. Just like how Nobukazu looked out the window.

266
00:15:59.062 --> 00:16:03.562
Robert confirmed the situation

267
00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:06.362
and then moved the car off.

268
00:16:07.462 --> 00:16:10.962
The string tied to the car is pulled.

269
00:16:10.962 --> 00:16:16.462
The thumbtacks come loose as the rope choked Nobukazu,

270
00:16:16.462 --> 00:16:18.662
it pulled in the opposite direction

271
00:16:18.662 --> 00:16:22.462
and the back of Nobukazu's head bangs into the beam.

272
00:16:22.462 --> 00:16:25.062
The string is pulled more and it snaps.

273
00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:29.662
Nobukazu's body dives into a sea of strings

274
00:16:29.662 --> 00:16:36.062
and dangles from the ceiling as if tangled in a spider's threads.

275
00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:40.262
The question is... Robert.

276
00:16:40.262 --> 00:16:41.762
How did you know that

277
00:16:41.762 --> 00:16:46.562
Nobukazu's body was tangled in strings?

278
00:16:48.162 --> 00:16:51.362
The only ones among you who knew about it

279
00:16:51.362 --> 00:16:52.262
were the four who came to the scene of the crime,

280
00:16:52.262 --> 00:16:57.462
Ryuji, Yuzo, Chie and Miyuki.

281
00:16:57.462 --> 00:16:59.362
Of course, these four

282
00:16:59.362 --> 00:17:04.162
were told not to tell anyone about the scene of the crime.

283
00:17:04.162 --> 00:17:07.062
And, one more person.

284
00:17:07.062 --> 00:17:08.962
In other words, that's...

285
00:17:08.962 --> 00:17:15.462
the murderer who rigged the set-up to kill Nobukazu!

286
00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:25.462
Robert.

287
00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.762
How...

288
00:17:26.762 --> 00:17:28.962
How did you know?

289
00:17:28.962 --> 00:17:31.162
It sounds funny.

290
00:17:31.162 --> 00:17:32.862
You kept everyone from talking

291
00:17:32.862 --> 00:17:35.662
and waited for me to make the slip.

292
00:17:35.662 --> 00:17:37.862
The number of fish.

293
00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:39.962
The fish for dinner.

294
00:17:39.962 --> 00:17:41.162
The unexpected guests

295
00:17:41.162 --> 00:17:44.962
were suppose to be me, Kazuha, and you, three people

296
00:17:44.962 --> 00:17:47.962
but she was short only two fishes.

297
00:17:47.962 --> 00:17:50.462
That means you were an expected guest

298
00:17:50.462 --> 00:17:53.062
that somebody had already invited from the very beginning.

299
00:17:53.062 --> 00:17:55.962
At first, I thought you and Yuko, who bought the fish,

300
00:17:55.962 --> 00:17:57.362
were suspicious

301
00:17:57.362 --> 00:18:00.762
but hearing that, Nobukazu handled all the money,

302
00:18:00.762 --> 00:18:02.962
the only suspicious one left was you.

303
00:18:02.962 --> 00:18:06.062
I sensed something was going to happen.

304
00:18:06.062 --> 00:18:08.362
Nothing had happened yet,

305
00:18:08.362 --> 00:18:11.862
so I let Kazuha go to visit the grave with you

306
00:18:11.862 --> 00:18:15.162
but Nobukazu was murdered and I panicked.

307
00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:17.062
If you were the murderer,

308
00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:20.862
you might have run off with Kazuha and Ran.

309
00:18:21.362 --> 00:18:25.062
You dangled Kazuha in the strings on the 1st floor of the storehouse

310
00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:26.962
but didn't kill her to make it look like a curse

311
00:18:26.962 --> 00:18:30.662
and to create an illusion to make us think that

312
00:18:30.662 --> 00:18:36.262
there may be a way to escape from this room.

313
00:18:36.262 --> 00:18:41.962
Of course, there's also the reason that Kazuha found the BB shots.

314
00:18:44.262 --> 00:18:47.562
But, why? Why even Mr. Negishi?

315
00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:53.662
Several days ago, when I came by here, he said this.

316
00:18:54.462 --> 00:18:58.262
If it's Misa, she committed suicide after you left.

317
00:18:58.262 --> 00:19:01.162
Nobukazu was picking on her anyway.

318
00:19:01.162 --> 00:19:06.262
Well, it can't be helped, she wasn't his real daughter.

319
00:19:06.262 --> 00:19:10.562
A girl like that, nobody would marry her anyway.

320
00:19:10.562 --> 00:19:14.862
There'd be nothing good even if she were living.

321
00:19:16.462 --> 00:19:18.662
With eyes that were high on drugs,

322
00:19:18.662 --> 00:19:22.562
he laughed and told me that.

323
00:19:22.562 --> 00:19:25.762
I desperately learned to read and write Japanese

324
00:19:25.762 --> 00:19:28.562
because she wasn't good at English.

325
00:19:28.562 --> 00:19:30.962
I finally was able to come and meet her.

326
00:19:32.862 --> 00:19:38.562
I looked forward to seeing her smiling face...

327
00:19:38.562 --> 00:19:43.862
But, wasn't it overdoing it to put Kazuha in that situation?

328
00:19:43.862 --> 00:19:46.362
I didn't care who got hurt, or who was suspicious of me!

329
00:19:46.362 --> 00:19:49.262
I didn't care what happened anymore!

330
00:19:49.262 --> 00:19:53.062
To everyone in his household who let her die!

331
00:19:53.762 --> 00:19:56.362
Hey, I thought of not telling you,

332
00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.162
but I'll tell you something.

333
00:19:58.162 --> 00:20:01.562
When Misa was in an unstable state of mind,

334
00:20:01.562 --> 00:20:05.262
when she was conversing with you in Roman-Japanese...

335
00:20:05.262 --> 00:20:07.162
Stop! Hattori!

336
00:20:07.162 --> 00:20:09.462
The real reason why she committed suicide was...

337
00:20:09.462 --> 00:20:12.962
Maybe... just maybe...

338
00:20:15.662 --> 00:20:17.562
Shine?

339
00:20:17.562 --> 00:20:19.262
That's right.

340
00:20:19.262 --> 00:20:23.062
"S.h.i.n.e" is shine.

341
00:20:23.062 --> 00:20:25.162
It means to be bright.

342
00:20:25.162 --> 00:20:30.262
Maybe for Robert, Misa was a bright light.

343
00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:31.662
Light?

344
00:20:31.662 --> 00:20:33.762
Come to think of it, Robert said

345
00:20:33.762 --> 00:20:36.462
he wanted a bride that was like a light.

346
00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:39.062
We've got to apologize to Robert.

347
00:20:40.662 --> 00:20:42.262
Apologize?

348
00:20:42.262 --> 00:20:45.062
But it was the same as the letters from Uncle Negishi's name,

349
00:20:45.062 --> 00:20:47.562
so we thought Robert wrote a terrible thing

350
00:20:47.562 --> 00:20:49.762
and gave it to Misa.

351
00:20:49.762 --> 00:20:51.662
We thought he wrote "Die".

352
00:21:10.662 --> 00:21:11.862
Morning came

353
00:21:11.862 --> 00:21:15.562
and Robert was taken off by the Tottori Prefectural police.

354
00:21:15.562 --> 00:21:17.162
In the patrol car,

355
00:21:17.162 --> 00:21:22.362
Robert repeated the same words over and over again.

356
00:21:23.362 --> 00:21:27.462
Why wasn't he Japanese?

357
00:21:27.462 --> 00:21:31.462
Why isn't she American?

358
00:21:31.462 --> 00:21:38.962
Like a broken puppet, he repeated over and over again.

359
00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:13.062
Why did Robert go off with the police?

360
00:23:13.062 --> 00:23:14.862
Why? Why?

361
00:23:14.862 --> 00:23:17.562
But, the murderer is the Spider Empress.

362
00:23:17.562 --> 00:23:20.262
We saw it. Before we went to take a bath,

363
00:23:20.262 --> 00:23:22.362
we saw that long spider's thread coming out

364
00:23:22.362 --> 00:23:23.862
from the storehouse window.

365
00:23:23.862 --> 00:23:26.262
If it's that, it's probably...

366
00:23:26.262 --> 00:23:27.762
Never mind.

367
00:23:29.162 --> 00:23:32.162
It's the doing of the Spider Empress.

368
00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:35.062
Robert jus went back to his country.

369
00:23:35.062 --> 00:23:37.862
You don't have to worry about it.

370
00:23:37.862 --> 00:23:40.162
-You're right. -You're right.

371
00:23:40.162 --> 00:23:43.662
Grandmother, tell us a story again.

372
00:23:43.662 --> 00:23:47.662
Then how about "The White Rabbit of Inaba"?

373
00:23:47.662 --> 00:23:50.262
We've heard that out before.

374
00:23:54.362 --> 00:23:56.762
It's grandma, after all.

375
00:24:00.262 --> 00:24:01.662
How beautiful.

376
00:24:06.162 --> 00:24:07.662
What's that?

377
00:24:09.262 --> 00:24:10.562
Drowning?

378
00:24:11.462 --> 00:24:14.062
In other words, due to some sort of accident,

379
00:24:14.062 --> 00:24:17.762
she wasn't able to escape from the shell.

380
00:24:17.762 --> 00:24:20.362
No. This isn't an accident.

381
00:24:20.362 --> 00:24:22.362
It's a planned murder.

382
00:24:23.262 --> 00:24:24.562
Next Conan,

383
00:24:24.562 --> 00:24:28.383
"The Kiss of Venus"

384
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.580
Next Conan's Hint:

385
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.580
"Cosmetics"

386
00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.480
-The next episode... -is a beautiful and frightening...

387
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.980
case.
