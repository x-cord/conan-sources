1
00:00:03,853 --> 00:00:05,503
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:08,633
High school student Shinichi was
forced to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,433
If the organization learned that
Shinichi and Conan are the same person

4
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:13,393
everyone close to
me would be in danger!

5
00:00:13,393 --> 00:00:15,603
Only Professor Agasa
knows the truth!

6
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:18,523
With my identity hidden,
there's always only one truth!

7
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,940
The Computer Murder Case.

8
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,380
That was a good movie, huh, Conan-kun?

9
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:06,870
Yeah!

10
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,170
I'm hungry, Dad.

11
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,460
Oh, is it this late already?

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,340
Let's eat somewhere.

13
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,590
Then let's eat there!

14
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,870
Are you insane?!

15
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,120
It'd cost an arm and
a leg to eat sushi in Ginza!

16
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,640
Thank you! Come again!

17
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,080
Tonight's the night for drinking!

18
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,250
Please take your medicine, sir.

19
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,820
Your heart might
act up again if you don't.

20
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,330
I know, I know!
You sound like my wife!

21
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,170
It looks like he's the
president of a company...

22
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,960
Yeah, I've seen him
before in some magazines...

23
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,670
Oh, yeah! He's Mr. Okida,
president of Bigwood!

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,140
Bigwood? The software company?

25
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,810
Today's contract sure was big!

26
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,770
And it's all thanks to the software
you gave me a year ago!

27
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,600
I really must thank you!

28
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,270
Wait!

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,210
You dropped this!

30
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,980
Thanks, little boy!

31
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,870
Tokito! Why the hell
weren't you paying attention?!

32
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,210
Sorry! I apologize, sir!

33
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,830
I have to thank you in some way.
What would you like, little boy?

34
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,580
Pardon my rudeness,
but aren't you Mr. Okida of Bigwood?

35
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,430
This is who I am!

36
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,140
Private investigator Mori Kogoro...

37
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,540
Yes! We don't need anything in return;

38
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,150
just let me know if you
ever need my services!

39
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,290
Certainly!

40
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,320
Well, I must be going now.

41
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,030
Take care!

42
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,500
A private investigator, huh?

43
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm going to
drink like a fish tonight!

44
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,300
Okida

45
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,590
Mori Detective Agency.

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,040
Oh, Inspector Megure!
Good morning!

47
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
Mr. Okida's dead?!

48
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,370
So Inspector Megure
saw your business card

49
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,310
in Mr. Okida's suit pocket and--

50
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,780
Yeah, and then
he called just to be safe.

51
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,420
Say, if the Inspector is there,

52
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,240
does that mean someone killed him?

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,920
Sometimes the police
investigate unnatural deaths too.

54
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,160
Mr. Okida was an
important person, after all.

55
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,680
Wait, you were
with Mr. Okida last night...

56
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,050
I'm Miura, his secretary!

57
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,640
Sir!

58
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,770
It opened by itself!

59
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,520
How did you do that?
That was amazing!

60
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,730
The computer checked my
fingerprints and then opened the door.

61
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,440
Computer?

62
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,970
This is an ultramodern house;

63
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,260
nearly everything inside
it is controlled by computer.

64
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,050
It's cool in here!

65
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,130
The air conditioning is
programmed to always keep the place

66
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,220
at the most pleasant
temperature 24 hours a day.

67
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,520
Oh, Mori-kun! Thanks for coming!

68
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,090
No problem!

69
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,340
What's this?

70
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,730
Sorry. I told them to stay home, but...

71
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,690
We saw Okida-san last night too!

72
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,090
Inspector Megure.
This is his secretary, Miura-san.

73
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,660
Thank you for coming.

74
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,420
Mr. Tokito here discovered the body.

75
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,340
He came to pick
up Mr. Okida at 8:00,

76
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,720
but he never came out, so he
grew suspicious and came inside,

77
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,710
only to find him cold in his bed,
with his pajamas still on.

78
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,800
What was the cause of death?

79
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,420
We can't say for sure
without a proper autopsy,

80
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,720
but it was probably a sudden
death due to a heart attack.

81
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,180
A sudden death?!

82
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,300
According to his doctor,
he's always had heart problems...

83
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,400
On top of that, I'm told he
drank a lot of alcohol last night.

84
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,840
Yesterday was special, as he
had gotten an important contract.

85
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,880
His wife said no alcohol, but...

86
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,120
Where is his wife, anyway?

87
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,710
She left with their daughter
on an overseas trip yesterday evening.

88
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,880
Last night, he went to
a number of buyers' clubs,

89
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,010
and when he came home,
he was so drunk he couldn't walk.

90
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,390
So I took him to his
bedroom and put him to bed.

91
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,590
The estimated time of death
was around 2:00 a.m.

92
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,230
I'm asking just to be sure,
but where were you then?

93
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,920
I returned to my apartment after 1:00.

94
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,340
At around 2:00 I bought dinner
at a nearby convenience store.

95
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,200
I dropped an egg at the register,
so I'm sure the cashier can vouch for me.

96
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,800
How cute! It's a Himalayan!

97
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,300
That's Aslan.
It's the daughter's cat.

98
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,010
He seems hungry.
I'll go feed him.

99
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,630
Inspector. I'd like to
see the body for myself.

100
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,360
That's fine, but you two can't come in.

101
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,820
I'd pass even if
you told me to look!

102
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,490
I see...

103
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,300
No exterior injuries,
and no sign of drugs?

104
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,950
But why was he sweating so much?

105
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,630
Look how damp he is.

106
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,170
The sheet too!

107
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,590
For someone who died while
sweating, there's too much here!

108
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,340
When did you get in here?!

109
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,010
The AC in this house
is computer-controlled

110
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,420
so that the temperature
is always nice, right?

111
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,560
So then why?

112
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,560
You were told to stay out!

113
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,310
Get out!

114
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,760
Huh?

115
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,180
The flowers are wilted.

116
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,320
The flower store receipt...

117
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,750
It's from yesterday.

118
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,050
His wife probably bought
them before leaving...

119
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,270
It's been less than a day.
Why are they so wilted?

120
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,330
The chocolate melted into a lump...

121
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,750
Do you like cats, little boy?

122
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,360
Yeah!

123
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,530
Say, Mr. Okida
liked Tokito-san, didn't he?

124
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,450
He made him his driver
even though he's young.

125
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,540
No, he's actually a programmer.

126
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,450
He was originally
a programmer for our company.

127
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,570
He and a friend started a
software company two years ago,

128
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,420
but it didn't go so well...

129
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,570
As expected, he went
bankrupt a year later.

130
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,490
Six months ago,
he apologized to Mr. Okida

131
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,350
and begged for another job--
even if he was just a driver.

132
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,810
So then Mr. Okida
made him his chauffeur?

133
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,280
Yes. He was a
kindhearted person, after all.

134
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,370
Oh! I shouldn't be here!

135
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,740
I need to inform
the company directors!

136
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,820
No. Mr. Okida didn't
hire Tokito-san as a driver

137
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,030
because he was kindhearted!

138
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,750
He was making an example
to the other employees!

139
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,660
If he really was
a warm-hearted soul...

140
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,410
Tokito! Why the hell
weren't you paying attention?!

141
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,300
...he wouldn't have yelled
at him like that in public!

142
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,450
Oh, Conan-kun!

143
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,030
Say, what did you
and Tokito-san talk about?

144
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,850
You seemed to be
having a good time!

145
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,370
About Aslan.

146
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,910
He said that long hair cats
don't handle heat well,

147
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,320
so they need air-conditioned
rooms to live!

148
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,700
That must be tough!

149
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,240
So if it was hot enough
in here to melt the chocolate,

150
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,330
that cat should've been affected.

151
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,780
But from what I saw,
it doesn't seem weakened at all!

152
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,460
I'm gonna go
talk to Tokito-san too!

153
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,130
I hear you're actually
a programmer?

154
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,660
I heard you set out
on your own two years ago

155
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,490
and started a software
company with your friend.

156
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,100
When I grow up, I wanna
make computer games too!

157
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,320
Is that so?

158
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,070
But I make business software,
not games.

159
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,660
Running a company must be hard.

160
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,530
You went bankrupt in
just a year, right?

161
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,990
Everything went great at first,

162
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,490
but then a certain
man got in the way...

163
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,460
And then he drove
my friend to suicide!

164
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,170
Would that certain man
happen to be Mr. Okida?

165
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,370
There are all kinds
of things in the adult world.

166
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,430
Forget what I just said.

167
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,450
There's no question that Tokito-san
hated Mr. Okida enough to kill him.

168
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,770
He might've begged
for another job to get revenge.

169
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,990
If Mr. Okida's heart attack was
intentionally caused by someone,

170
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,910
Tokito-san would
be the prime suspect.

171
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,180
But how exactly
could he have done it?!

172
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,468
Computer intrusion?

173
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:26,118
Yeah.

174
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:30,028
It's possible for a home computer
connected to a phone line

175
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:32,778
to infiltrate another
home's computer system

176
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,528
and change its air
conditioning program, right?

177
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,028
It's possible.

178
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,448
For someone well-versed
in that field, that is.

179
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:52,128
Tokito-san is a first-rate programmer,
so he's definitely well-versed.

180
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:56,588
But simply raising the
temperature couldn't kill him...

181
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,448
What is this?!

182
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:03,338
Oh, I was eating ice cream
earlier. I must've spilled some.

183
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:08,118
What a slob!
Now I have to change my socks!

184
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:13,838
Say, isn't it a little hot in here?

185
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:15,308
Crank up the AC!

186
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:17,998
No, this is just right!

187
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,488
You're young so
it might not affect you,

188
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:23,988
but it's best not to make it
too much cooler than it is outside.

189
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,988
I once read an article about
how someone had a heart attack

190
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:31,368
when they entered a coffee
shop with the AC on too high.

191
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:33,328
A heart attack?!

192
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:37,798
Probably because of the
sudden drop in temperature.

193
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:39,828
That's it!

194
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,988
Tokito-san warmed the room up

195
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:45,218
and then suddenly cooled
it down to cause a heart attack!

196
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,268
But it'll be hard to find proof.

197
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:52,478
Maybe if the program
was at that man's home,

198
00:14:52,478 --> 00:14:55,188
but I doubt he would
actually hold on to it.

199
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:59,228
Yeah, I'll go check for myself!

200
00:14:59,228 --> 00:15:02,978
There's something
I'd like you to make for me...

201
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:04,158
Have an idea, do you?

202
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:08,238
Here's some juice.

203
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:09,888
Thanks!

204
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:11,558
What a surprise!

205
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:14,428
Nobody's ever asked
to come see my computer before!

206
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:15,418
Can I see it?

207
00:15:16,038 --> 00:15:18,628
Huh? What's this?

208
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:22,588
What's this flake thing?

209
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:24,298
Is something wrong?

210
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,768
No, it's nothing.

211
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:30,638
This computer's so cool!
I wish I had one!

212
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:34,138
It might be too early
for you to have one...

213
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:37,558
Since you're here, want
to play some computer games?

214
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:44,348
Isn't that your car?

215
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:48,058
It's the company's,
but its alarm is going off!

216
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:49,368
I'll be right back!

217
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,588
Open up! No?

218
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:11,148
Who put this here?!

219
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,098
Was it that kid?!

220
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:24,028
No good! It's not here!

221
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,148
I was playing poker
with the computer!

222
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:42,998
I won with only one pair!

223
00:16:43,488 --> 00:16:45,308
Good job, Conan-kun!

224
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:48,348
I'm overanalyzing things!

225
00:16:48,348 --> 00:16:50,428
That was just someone's prank!

226
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,578
Oh! How did it go, Shinichi?

227
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:58,688
From your expression, I take it
you didn't find the program?

228
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,548
Nope.

229
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:04,948
The only thing I learned was how
to play poker against a computer.

230
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,218
I dunno what to do now...

231
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,038
This is a cat hair.

232
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,728
Oh yeah, I probably got it from Aslan
this morning at Mr. Okida's house.

233
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:19,248
I had forgotten about him.

234
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:24,418
Aslan is a long-haired cat, so he'd
be affected if a room got too hot.

235
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:28,338
I can't lay out a theory
unless I solve this puzzle.

236
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:33,488
Wait! I changed my socks earlier!

237
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:37,948
Which means this hair
came from Tokito-san's apartment...

238
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,438
Now I see!

239
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,808
Which means that flake was--

240
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,348
Megure here.

241
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:47,328
Good to hear you
again, Inspector.

242
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:48,548
This is Kudo Shinichi.

243
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:50,398
Oh! Kudo-kun!

244
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:53,238
There's something I'd like you
to investigate immediately

245
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,118
about Mr. Okida's sudden death.

246
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,038
Mr. Tokito, the driver?
Understood.

247
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:04,888
Take Conan-kun and Ran with you.

248
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:07,508
I'm sure they'll come in handy.

249
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:08,758
Bye.

250
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:15,288
Why do I have to use
this to fake my own voice?

251
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:16,718
Talk about pathetic...

252
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:23,178
Good morning!
Sorry for the early intrusion!

253
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:24,728
May we come in?

254
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:26,728
Of course.

255
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:29,138
Computer infiltration?

256
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:32,198
This Kudo kid sure
has a good imagination!

257
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,158
But I didn't kill him.

258
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:38,998
I'd like to ask you about the day
before yesterday one more time...

259
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:46,308
Two nights ago, you put Mr. Okida
to bed and then immediately left, correct?

260
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:47,478
That's right.

261
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:51,168
Are you sure you didn't do
anything out of the ordinary?

262
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:53,308
Anything out of the ordinary?

263
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:55,138
No, nothing...

264
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:57,268
That's odd.

265
00:18:57,268 --> 00:19:01,098
I'm almost certain you
took his cat two days ago.

266
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,258
I believe his name was...

267
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:05,348
...Aslan!

268
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:07,178
Yes, Aslan.

269
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:12,318
And then yesterday you took
Aslan back to the Okida home.

270
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,528
When Conan-kun came here yesterday,
some cat hair got stuck to his feet!

271
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:20,848
I must've picked it up when
I held Aslan at Mr. Okida's house

272
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:22,498
and then it fell off here!

273
00:19:22,848 --> 00:19:26,458
But Tokito-san!
There's cat litter here!

274
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:31,838
These are used in litter boxes,
right, Ran-neechan?

275
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:37,478
Yeah, they stick to long
hair cats especially easily,

276
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,308
and they fall all over the
place when they walk around.

277
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:44,138
Look! Here's another one!

278
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:46,228
You don't have a cat, do you?

279
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:49,688
There's no question
that you took Aslan, is there?

280
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,318
Why did you take Aslan?!

281
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,278
Uhh--

282
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,518
You did it because you knew
something was going to happen

283
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:01,058
at the Okida house that night!

284
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:03,178
The entire house would
become unusually warm

285
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:05,288
and then suddenly cool down.

286
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,928
You love animals,
so you took Aslan with you

287
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:12,248
because he would be
affected and possibly even die!

288
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:13,948
Am I right?!

289
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:24,348
You're actually a
nice person, aren't you?

290
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,268
But what you did was wrong!

291
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:32,598
Computers were created
to enrich people's lives

292
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,648
and make them happy, right?

293
00:20:35,928 --> 00:20:39,118
Yet you used
one to kill somebody!

294
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:42,078
That computer's your friend, isn't it?!

295
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:45,868
That means you've
betrayed your own friend!

296
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,928
You're right, Conan-kun.

297
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:55,928
I almost lost a dear friend

298
00:20:55,928 --> 00:20:58,798
and my pride as a programmer.

299
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:11,598
My program's on this disk.

300
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:15,348
To be honest, I didn't
think this would kill him.

301
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:17,778
I was going to think up
something else if it failed.

302
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,238
Why did you keep
something that incriminating?!

303
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:25,598
Every program I write
is like a child to me.

304
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:28,208
I couldn't bear to get rid of it...

305
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:36,878
Conan-kun. Could you tell this
Shinichi something for me?

306
00:21:37,308 --> 00:21:43,228
I don't know in how many years it'll be,
but when I start my next software company

307
00:21:43,228 --> 00:21:45,848
I'd love to have him work for me!

308
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:46,888
You too, of course.

309
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,378
Right! I'll tell him!

310
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:27,598
Shinichi really beat me this time!

311
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:30,208
For my student,
he sure is meddling!

312
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,168
Since when am I your student?

313
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:34,978
Hey, Conan-kun.

314
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:39,308
Didn't you say you saw Shinichi
at Professor Agasa's place yesterday?

315
00:23:39,308 --> 00:23:44,308
Yeah! And when I told him about Mr. Okida
he instantly knew that it was a murder!

316
00:23:44,308 --> 00:23:47,018
Shinichi sure is smart!

317
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,898
That's not what I'm asking about!

318
00:23:50,478 --> 00:23:53,348
Why didn't you tell me right away?!

319
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:57,018
You know I'm worried about him!

320
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,198
Well, uh--

321
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:01,978
Where is he now?
You know, don't you?!

322
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:03,578
No, I--

323
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:05,908
Fess up!

324
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:11,138
Get back here, Conan-kun!

325
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:15,708
Oh yes, the phone rang then...

326
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:19,318
Yeah! Conan-kun answered it!

327
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:23,318
Yeah! They said,
"I'm Tatsumi's wife, of course!"

328
00:24:23,318 --> 00:24:26,678
Which means she was
still alive at that time?

329
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:30,988
Tatsumi-sensei was with me;
his alibi is airtight.

330
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:34,598
And besides, the hotel
is ten kilometers from his home.

331
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,878
On the next Conan--

332
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:41,808
"The Alibi Testimony Murder Case."

333
00:24:58,318 --> 00:25:00,498
Next Conan's Hint:

334
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,448
Cassette tape.
