1
00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:04.973
Encounters are mysterious!
But cases are even more so!

2
00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:07.053
I'm so glad I'm with you!

3
00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:09.043
Today's stage is a
regular apartment building!

4
00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:10.803
All the players
are set in front of Conan!

5
00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:12.343
He sees the single truth for what it is,

6
00:00:12.343 --> 00:00:14.343
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

7
00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:16.763
His name? Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:59.526
"The Historical Drama Actor
Murder Case (Part 1)."

9
00:02:03.406 --> 00:02:08.166
Eh?! Hijikata Kozaburo-san,
the historical drama actor?!

10
00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:11.636
Yep! He should be
here soon to see me!

11
00:02:12.036 --> 00:02:15.866
Apparently, he's going
to play a detective on TV next,

12
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:19.996
so he wants to hear what this
great detective thinks about things!

13
00:02:19.996 --> 00:02:21.646
That's amazing!

14
00:02:21.646 --> 00:02:23.056
Yeah.

15
00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:28.026
Huh? But I thought he only
did historical dramas...

16
00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:32.286
Don't look at me.
He seems to be on the decline lately.

17
00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:36.326
Maybe he has no other choice?

18
00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:38.656
Hijikata Kozaburo (51) Actor
So sorry I'm on the decline.

19
00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:39.996
Hijikata Kozaburo (51) Actor

20
00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:42.036
H-Hijikata Kozabur--!

21
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:45.836
Not so loud, Miss!

22
00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:50.996
The press has ears everywhere!

23
00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:51.996
Press?

24
00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:55.756
Oh, because of the fuss about
your divorce with your wife?

25
00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:57.466
Divorce?

26
00:02:57.466 --> 00:03:00.926
No, no, it's completely unfounded!
It's a bunch of baloney.

27
00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:04.036
Even my wife Isami is troubled by it!

28
00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:06.696
Just some small talk with a dapper man

29
00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:08.946
has everyone exclaiming,
"Affair!" and, "Breakup!"

30
00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:14.906
It can't be helped. You did choose
a beautiful actress as your wife!

31
00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:22.996
Well, in any case, let's finish
up here and head to my place.

32
00:03:23.946 --> 00:03:25.496
Okay, Mori-sensei?

33
00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:27.056
Sensei?

34
00:03:36.076 --> 00:03:37.786
Right this way, Sensei.

35
00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:40.306
Please stop it; I'm no "Sensei"...

36
00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:45.786
I'm hoping you can educate me
in the finer points of detective work.

37
00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:47.656
So "Sensei" definitely fits!

38
00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:50.566
Yeah, I guess when you put it like that!

39
00:03:54.696 --> 00:03:58.366
Hey. Why do we
hafta sneak in from the back?

40
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:02.366
The front entrance is
often swarming with reporters.

41
00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:09.286
Just a moment.

42
00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:14.466
Oh! Looks like there's no one today!

43
00:04:15.286 --> 00:04:17.696
If they happened to
see me with a detective

44
00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:20.966
while all this divorce
nonsense is going on,

45
00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:24.496
who knows what they would write next!

46
00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:25.996
That's true!

47
00:04:30.616 --> 00:04:35.076
Oh?! Aren't you
Okita Hajime-san, the actor?!

48
00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:35.986
Yeah...

49
00:04:36.446 --> 00:04:38.816
He's my next-door neighbor.

50
00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:41.656
Headed out?

51
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:43.536
Yeah. To the convenience store.

52
00:04:44.036 --> 00:04:48.906
Don't worry. I'll be waiting for you in my place
Okita Hajime (29) Actor

53
00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:50.616
just like we agreed.

54
00:04:52.366 --> 00:04:53.376
"Agreed"?

55
00:04:54.696 --> 00:04:58.006
I thought I'd talk to
him about you-know-what.

56
00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:01.466
What's "you-know-what"?

57
00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:08.826
Rumor is he's the guy Hijikata-san's
wife is having an affair with.

58
00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:09.596
No way!

59
00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:11.976
Well, get in!

60
00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:13.896
Right!

61
00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:20.246
Oh, come to think of it,
I haven't given you my card yet!

62
00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:21.776
Thanks.

63
00:05:21.776 --> 00:05:23.736
And one for you, little boy!

64
00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:27.576
Oh? You certainly seem
to own many apartments!

65
00:05:27.576 --> 00:05:29.706
All the ones on the 6th floor, even!

66
00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:35.496
Yes. I used to use them as
offices and rent them to people,

67
00:05:35.496 --> 00:05:38.036
but they're empty now.

68
00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:43.136
But we're headed to
the 5th floor now, where I live.

69
00:05:43.496 --> 00:05:45.466
Oh! And here we are!

70
00:05:51.696 --> 00:05:52.856
This way!

71
00:05:55.436 --> 00:05:57.366
Hijikata

72
00:05:57.366 --> 00:05:58.366
Yes?
Hijikata

73
00:05:58.366 --> 00:05:58.946
It's me.
Hijikata

74
00:05:58.946 --> 00:05:59.396
It's me.

75
00:06:00.496 --> 00:06:02.866
Oh, welcome, Mr. Detective!

76
00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:04.526
Hello!

77
00:06:04.526 --> 00:06:06.996
Wow! Nagakura Isami!

78
00:06:07.246 --> 00:06:08.406
Nagakura Isami (38) Current Family Name: Hijikata,
Hijikata Kozaburo's wife
Thank you for coming

79
00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:10.366
all this way today for my husband!
Nagakura Isami (38) Current Family Name: Hijikata,
Hijikata Kozaburo's wife

80
00:06:10.366 --> 00:06:12.456
Please teach him well!
Nagakura Isami (38) Current Family Name: Hijikata,
Hijikata Kozaburo's wife

81
00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.946
After all, he only knows
how to swing swords around!

82
00:06:16.946 --> 00:06:18.216
Well, excuse me!

83
00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:23.176
You get along well! Where did
this marital strife rumor ever start?

84
00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:28.196
Honestly! We should invite the
person who wrote that article over!

85
00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:31.326
The newspapers just find it amusing!

86
00:06:31.326 --> 00:06:34.576
Well, right this way! Come on in!

87
00:06:39.576 --> 00:06:41.656
Start by relaxing in the living room!

88
00:06:41.656 --> 00:06:43.346
Thanks!

89
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:51.406
Brilliant acting, just what
I'd expect from a former actress.

90
00:06:51.406 --> 00:06:53.406
You hardly seem like a wicked woman

91
00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:56.996
trying to swipe a big sum of
compensation money from her husband.

92
00:06:56.996 --> 00:07:00.966
Oh, but it was your flirtatious
tendencies that started it.

93
00:07:01.446 --> 00:07:03.286
So, once you cut loose from me,

94
00:07:03.286 --> 00:07:06.216
are you planning to
hook up with that lowlife Okita?

95
00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:08.716
I don't know. I haven't
planned that far.

96
00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:13.946
Could you wait in here a bit, Mori-sensei?

97
00:07:13.946 --> 00:07:15.766
Yes, don't worry about us!

98
00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:27.406
Anyways, what are you doing,
bringing a detective here?

99
00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:32.116
I thought you, me, and Okita-kun
were going to talk this evening?

100
00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:35.076
I don't know what you want
to talk about at this point, though.

101
00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:40.046
Now, don't be like that.
I have my own circumstances.

102
00:07:40.656 --> 00:07:43.246
You've been a bit strange lately.

103
00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:46.006
Suddenly redecorating
and cleaning the place...

104
00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:50.116
It's not my fault. I have nothing
to do now that I've lost my livelihood.

105
00:07:50.116 --> 00:07:53.576
Anyways, I leave that detective to you!

106
00:07:53.576 --> 00:07:56.016
I'll be waiting in the office!
Hurry it up!

107
00:07:56.786 --> 00:07:57.706
Yeah.

108
00:07:58.826 --> 00:08:00.686
I was planning to.

109
00:08:03.116 --> 00:08:05.786
What's taking Hijikata-san so long?

110
00:08:05.786 --> 00:08:08.746
It's been half an hour now!

111
00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:10.656
Yeah, what could he be doing?

112
00:08:12.786 --> 00:08:15.166
Huh? It won't light.

113
00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:19.866
Maybe it's time you give up smoking?

114
00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:24.156
Oh, here we go!

115
00:08:24.156 --> 00:08:25.716
What is that?! A gun?!

116
00:08:26.446 --> 00:08:28.946
Don't be dumb! This is a lighter!

117
00:08:28.946 --> 00:08:32.136
You pull the trigger like so and
the flame comes out of the barrel!

118
00:08:33.786 --> 00:08:35.936
Come on! Darn you!

119
00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:43.146
T-The trigger broke!

120
00:08:47.286 --> 00:08:49.996
Sorry for the wait!

121
00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:54.786
My wife usually takes care of this,
so it took me a while!

122
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:59.116
Oh? Did Isami-san leave?

123
00:08:59.116 --> 00:09:02.246
Yeah. Said she was
going to a friend's house.

124
00:09:02.786 --> 00:09:08.216
Oh, yes! I bought something
I was hoping you'd teach me about!

125
00:09:08.696 --> 00:09:13.136
Oh? That's strange.
I'm certain I left it here...

126
00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:15.156
L-Left what?

127
00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:18.096
A model gun.
It was quite pricey, too.

128
00:09:18.576 --> 00:09:21.616
The detective I'm
going to play is a flashy one

129
00:09:21.616 --> 00:09:25.246
who wears disguises
and shoots guns, you see!

130
00:09:25.246 --> 00:09:28.616
I was hoping you could
show me how to hold a gun!

131
00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:30.996
You don't need anything like that!

132
00:09:30.996 --> 00:09:34.826
Besides, TV detectives
these days don't carry guns!

133
00:09:35.656 --> 00:09:37.476
You should strive for realism!

134
00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:41.536
But that'd be much weaker...

135
00:09:41.536 --> 00:09:44.786
I hear the first scene starts with
a shootout between me and the killer

136
00:09:44.786 --> 00:09:46.616
on this very riverbank...

137
00:09:46.616 --> 00:09:47.416
Riverbank?

138
00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:48.926
Yes.

139
00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:53.786
See? Right there!

140
00:09:53.786 --> 00:09:55.886
Wow! What a lovely view!

141
00:09:56.446 --> 00:09:59.946
This must be quite
a nice view at night, too!

142
00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:01.766
The charm wears off before too long!

143
00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:04.546
It's so nice having a river right there!

144
00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:06.986
A phone.

145
00:10:08.036 --> 00:10:09.946
Huh? It's coming from over there.

146
00:10:09.946 --> 00:10:12.196
It's Okita's phone.

147
00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:14.446
Eh? Then that's Okita's--?

148
00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:19.406
Yeah. That's more reason
why the reporters stir up trouble here.

149
00:10:30.116 --> 00:10:31.696
I-Isami!

150
00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:34.716
Hey! What happened?!
Isami! Say something!

151
00:10:34.716 --> 00:10:36.926
We're on the 5th floor!

152
00:10:36.926 --> 00:10:38.406
Dammit!

153
00:10:39.496 --> 00:10:42.766
That lowlife!
What did he do to my Isami?!

154
00:10:42.766 --> 00:10:45.686
Hey! Okita! Get out here!
Okita

155
00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:48.106
Okita! Okita!

156
00:10:50.996 --> 00:10:51.906
Damn it!

157
00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:52.696
If you'd like,

158
00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:55.286
I can explain things at the front desk

159
00:10:55.286 --> 00:10:56.696
and get a spare key!

160
00:10:57.366 --> 00:11:01.666
Thanks! I'll keep watch here
to make sure he doesn't escape!

161
00:11:02.446 --> 00:11:05.166
Then I'll call for the
police and an ambulance!

162
00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:06.656
Wait!

163
00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:11.116
It'd be faster to go directly
to the nearby police box instead!

164
00:11:11.116 --> 00:11:11.836
Right!

165
00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.796
I'm counting on you!

166
00:11:18.366 --> 00:11:22.136
Eh?! Hijikata-san's wife,
in Okita-san's room?!

167
00:11:22.136 --> 00:11:23.786
D-Does that mean--?

168
00:11:23.786 --> 00:11:25.786
We need the spare key!

169
00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:28.196
Dad! I brought a policeman!

170
00:11:28.196 --> 00:11:31.396
You have a spare key,
don't you?! Come with us!

171
00:11:36.036 --> 00:11:38.786
Damn! It's not coming down!

172
00:11:39.366 --> 00:11:42.946
Is this elevator out of order?!

173
00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:44.496
No, it shouldn't be...

174
00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:49.826
No other choice!
Let's use the stairs! Come on!

175
00:11:49.826 --> 00:11:51.406
R-Right!

176
00:11:53.036 --> 00:11:54.576
Come on! Let's go, Conan-kun!

177
00:11:54.576 --> 00:11:55.256
Okay.

178
00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:56.506
This is the floor!

179
00:11:57.616 --> 00:11:59.446
Oh! I've been waiting!

180
00:12:00.496 --> 00:12:02.496
Did anything happen?

181
00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:04.616
I've been pounding on the door,

182
00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:06.346
but there hasn't
been so much as a peep.

183
00:12:06.866 --> 00:12:07.876
The key, please!

184
00:12:07.876 --> 00:12:08.926
R-Right!

185
00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:13.066
What's all the noise in front of my door?

186
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.146
Move!

187
00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:15.566
Wait!

188
00:12:18.616 --> 00:12:20.576
I-Isami!

189
00:12:21.036 --> 00:12:22.326
What?!

190
00:12:22.786 --> 00:12:25.746
Hey! Say something! Isami! Isami!

191
00:12:26.576 --> 00:12:28.406
Isami! Isami!

192
00:12:29.446 --> 00:12:31.706
It's no use. She's gone.

193
00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:33.796
O-Oh no...

194
00:12:34.196 --> 00:12:37.366
It appears she was strangled
to death with a wire of some sort.

195
00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:41.326
Something like fishing line, most likely.

196
00:12:41.326 --> 00:12:43.906
It seems she died
less than thirty minutes ago...

197
00:12:43.906 --> 00:12:47.646
B-But what is she doing on my veranda?

198
00:12:47.646 --> 00:12:49.246
Don't play dumb!

199
00:12:49.246 --> 00:12:53.786
We saw her collapse on
the veranda from your room!

200
00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:56.286
Who else could've done it?!

201
00:12:56.286 --> 00:12:58.066
I had nothing to do with it!

202
00:12:58.696 --> 00:13:03.036
The old guy's right.
It definitely looks like he killed her.

203
00:13:05.286 --> 00:13:08.916
We just need to find the fishing line,
expose his motive, and...

204
00:13:15.286 --> 00:13:16.326
Hijikata-san.

205
00:13:16.326 --> 00:13:20.086
I know it must be hard, but leave
her as-is until the examiners arrive.

206
00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:22.556
Wait a minute!

207
00:13:23.906 --> 00:13:26.286
Could this incident be--?!

208
00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:39.841
The deceased is
Hijikata Isami-san, age 38.

209
00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:42.431
Cause of death, suffocation.

210
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:44.971
We can probably assume
she was strangled to death

211
00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:46.801
with thin rope or something.

212
00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:52.181
So, is it true you saw her
when she was murdered?

213
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:53.391
Yes.

214
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:56.481
I can't say if it was right
after she was murdered or not,

215
00:13:56.971 --> 00:14:02.851
but Ran, Conan, her husband
Kozaburo-san, and I all saw her.

216
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:04.951
We just happened to be on the veranda.

217
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:10.471
We heard a phone ring
from Okita-san's apartment,

218
00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:12.681
and when we glanced
in that direction...

219
00:14:13.801 --> 00:14:18.511
...Isami-san collapsed onto
this veranda from inside the room.

220
00:14:18.511 --> 00:14:20.381
Probably as a corpse.

221
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:22.141
And then what happened?

222
00:14:22.141 --> 00:14:25.471
We rushed here
immediately, of course.

223
00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:28.141
But the door was locked,

224
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:31.851
and there was no sound from inside,
no matter how hard we knocked.

225
00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:35.011
We left Hijikata-san in
front of the door to keep watch,

226
00:14:35.011 --> 00:14:38.811
and I went to the front desk
downstairs to get a spare key.

227
00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:42.181
And, just as expected,
when we went inside,

228
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.781
the body was here, on the veranda.

229
00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:48.511
Come on! I've had enough of this!

230
00:14:48.511 --> 00:14:52.891
I'm the one who's shocked to
see Isami-san lying on my veranda!

231
00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:55.701
Nor do I remember
anyone knocking on the door!

232
00:14:56.221 --> 00:14:59.711
Besides, why would
I kill Isami-san anyway?!

233
00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:00.631
You dumbass!

234
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:05.181
Are you still trying to play innocent?!

235
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:09.351
I watched the door hard
enough to bore a hole in it!

236
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:12.471
Who else could've done it but you?!

237
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:14.811
Now, now, now, Hijikata-san.

238
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:16.261
In that case, Okita-san,

239
00:15:16.261 --> 00:15:21.601
could you tell us what you
were doing between 4:00 and 4:30,

240
00:15:21.601 --> 00:15:23.231
when the murder took place?

241
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:27.301
I was here at home, listening to music.

242
00:15:27.301 --> 00:15:31.071
Because Hijikata-san told
me to let him visit this evening.

243
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:33.141
Hijikata-san?

244
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:37.141
Yes, I asked him to make some free time

245
00:15:37.141 --> 00:15:40.471
so I could see if the rumors
about him and Isami were true.

246
00:15:41.471 --> 00:15:46.351
I guess the rumors might've been true.

247
00:15:46.351 --> 00:15:49.141
Isami-san came
here before Hijikata-san

248
00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:52.891
so she and Okita-san could
get their story straight,

249
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:56.391
but it turned into an argument,
and he killed her without thinking.

250
00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:59.301
I'm telling you, she never came here!

251
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:02.901
There's something else fishy about you.

252
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:03.861
What?!

253
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:05.851
As you know,

254
00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:12.661
Hijikata-san always plays
famous warriors and swordsmen.

255
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:19.181
But you're stuck playing villains
like thieves, spies, and love rivals.

256
00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:20.831
What's that have to do with anything?

257
00:16:21.301 --> 00:16:24.221
It's too much to be mere coincidence.

258
00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:30.301
I'd say the same thing about
how you always happen upon murders.

259
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:34.011
Inspector! I found something
like fishing line on the floor!

260
00:16:34.011 --> 00:16:34.851
Really?

261
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:38.801
W-Wait! I've never seen that before!

262
00:16:38.801 --> 00:16:39.931
In any case,

263
00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:44.181
we have witnesses who saw the
body fall onto the veranda from here,

264
00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:45.731
and we found the murder weapon.

265
00:16:47.051 --> 00:16:51.281
You can save your explanations
for when we're back at the station.

266
00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:53.291
Hey, now! You can't be serious!

267
00:16:56.101 --> 00:16:57.871
A scrape near her underarm!

268
00:16:58.791 --> 00:17:01.221
How did that get here?!

269
00:17:01.221 --> 00:17:05.211
Come on, Conan-kun!
Don't stay over there! Hurry inside!

270
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:10.391
Say, Ran-neechan. I guess
there really are zombies, huh?

271
00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:11.471
Eh?

272
00:17:11.471 --> 00:17:17.141
After all, when this lady fell,
her legs were still in the room!

273
00:17:17.141 --> 00:17:19.931
But when we came here,
her whole body was on the veranda!

274
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:24.801
Yeah, now that you mention it!

275
00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:27.771
That means she must've moved on her own...

276
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:29.291
Is this true?

277
00:17:29.291 --> 00:17:30.851
Yes!

278
00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:35.801
When we saw her collapse,
only her upper body was on the veranda.

279
00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:38.201
The killer probably just moved it.

280
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:43.931
He probably set the body
against the veranda window.

281
00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:48.211
It fell onto the veranda, which we saw.

282
00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:51.641
Flustered by our
pounding on the front door,

283
00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:56.931
he pulled the body onto
the veranda to avoid trouble.

284
00:17:58.641 --> 00:18:01.471
Am I wrong, Okita-san, the killer?

285
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:02.891
Yes, you are!

286
00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:08.931
If so, then the body was pulled
onto the veranda rather violently.

287
00:18:08.931 --> 00:18:11.821
The body has many scrapes on it.

288
00:18:12.351 --> 00:18:15.801
I see. So you must've been in quite a panic.

289
00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:17.281
H-Hold on!

290
00:18:17.801 --> 00:18:22.851
I just told you, Isami-san
didn't come here! She never had before!

291
00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:26.751
I tidied up because they
said they were coming over today.

292
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:28.681
Isn't that right, old man?!

293
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:33.641
Yes. This is my first
time in this apartment,

294
00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:36.721
but I can't say for sure for Isami...

295
00:18:36.721 --> 00:18:40.141
Oh? Then you're amazing, Mister!

296
00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:45.431
After all, you ran directly to
the veranda where your wife was!

297
00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:49.901
Even though you've never been
here! It's almost like you're psychic!

298
00:18:54.431 --> 00:18:56.431
Yeah, come to think of it!

299
00:18:56.431 --> 00:19:00.451
He ran right past me
and went straight to the veranda!

300
00:19:04.391 --> 00:19:07.431
That's easy, little boy!

301
00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:11.551
All the rooms on the 5th floor
and above have the same design,

302
00:19:11.551 --> 00:19:13.711
aside from the reverse layouts!

303
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.711
You seem quite well-informed.

304
00:19:16.431 --> 00:19:21.681
Yes, I own all the rooms
on the 6th floor, you see.

305
00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:24.801
So it's only natural that you know...

306
00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:31.521
Alright. For now, let's take
Okita-san in as a material witness.

307
00:19:32.011 --> 00:19:33.401
H-Hey!

308
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:36.691
I ask that you two come as well.

309
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:38.971
Eh? Me, too?

310
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:41.661
It's nothing. He just
wants to ask some questions.

311
00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:44.121
It's obvious who the killer is.

312
00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:52.471
It's true that this looks
like an open-and-shut case,

313
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:54.551
but something bugs me!

314
00:19:54.551 --> 00:19:57.631
That creepy smile he had when
he was by Isami-san's dead body!

315
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:02.891
But she did collapse before his very eyes.

316
00:20:03.851 --> 00:20:07.811
He could've set things up
so she'd fall over on her own,

317
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:11.911
but Okita-san says he was
in this apartment the entire time.

318
00:20:13.391 --> 00:20:17.731
I doubt he could sneak into
the apartment with a dead body...

319
00:20:22.261 --> 00:20:24.451
Can I answer it?

320
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:26.791
Wait. I'll get it.

321
00:20:30.101 --> 00:20:31.471
Yes? Hello?

322
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:33.551
Oh, Inspector Megure?! It's Takagi!

323
00:20:33.551 --> 00:20:34.251
Yeah?

324
00:20:34.251 --> 00:20:36.551
I'm at the front desk downstairs!

325
00:20:36.551 --> 00:20:39.211
Huh? What's wrong? What's all that noise?

326
00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:40.671
What's going on?!

327
00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:42.051
Let us in!

328
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:47.931
It's the newspaper reporters!
They caught wind of the incident!

329
00:20:47.931 --> 00:20:48.531
What?!

330
00:20:48.531 --> 00:20:50.931
Just please hurry down here!

331
00:20:50.931 --> 00:20:53.981
We've locked the entrance,
but given how they are...

332
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:57.481
Hey, now! We can't have them
get inside right now! Do something--

333
00:20:58.471 --> 00:21:02.861
Say. Do you have any
other phones in your home?

334
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.321
No. Just that one.

335
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:10.291
What?! They're here, too?!
Where'd they come from?!

336
00:21:10.291 --> 00:21:12.251
How should I know?!

337
00:21:12.801 --> 00:21:16.211
Yeah! Alright!
I'll be right down! Just wait!

338
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:22.381
How did the press find out so quickly?

339
00:21:26.761 --> 00:21:28.681
It's not too surprising.

340
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:33.891
Hijikata-san was being hounded
by reporters about the divorce.

341
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:38.721
Anyways, don't tell the
reporters anything you shouldn't.

342
00:21:38.721 --> 00:21:40.231
You're a decoy.

343
00:21:40.231 --> 00:21:43.551
I'll divert everyone's
attention before a panic happens,

344
00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:45.801
so you can take
Okita down to the station!

345
00:21:45.801 --> 00:21:47.661
I understand the plan!

346
00:21:48.891 --> 00:21:51.971
I'd hold off on
taking him if I were you.

347
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:53.371
W-When did you get in here?!

348
00:21:53.371 --> 00:21:57.681
After all, when we brought
the spare key to the room,

349
00:21:57.681 --> 00:22:00.141
Okita-san opened the door himself.

350
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:05.801
Even if he did hide her on the veranda,
she'd be seen right away!

351
00:22:06.221 --> 00:22:10.301
If I was the killer, I'd hide
her somewhere less obvious

352
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:13.271
or escape the moment
the door was open!

353
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:16.391
You're so dumb! Shut up, kid!

354
00:22:16.391 --> 00:22:17.441
But--!

355
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:20.971
You were on the 5th floor veranda yourself

356
00:22:20.971 --> 00:22:22.861
when you saw her
body come out of the room!

357
00:22:30.931 --> 00:22:33.721
Now I see!

358
00:22:33.721 --> 00:22:35.651
So that's what happened!

359
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:10.481
I found it!

360
00:24:10.941 --> 00:24:16.941
The method Hijikata-san used
to lead us to a deceptive place!

361
00:24:16.941 --> 00:24:20.401
Where are you going? You're the real killer...

362
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:23.361
...Hijikata Kozaburo-san!

363
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:24.491
What?!

364
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:27.831
I told you, show some proof!

365
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:31.251
Certainly. The proof is...

366
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:33.271
On the next Conan--

367
00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:37.001
