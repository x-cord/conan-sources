1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,846
Always keep your pokerface...

2
00:00:03,866 --> 00:00:05,380
Taking my father's teaching to my heart...

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,760
The miracle magician glides amidst the skycraper.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,480
Here I come, Kid the Phantom Thief!

5
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,800
Today's target is the "Plein Soleil de Paris"!

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,300
Now, it's showtime!

7
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,040
The Princess Loves Magic.

8
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,970
Look over here, please, Princess Anne!

9
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,420
And here!

10
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,720
Welcome to Japan, Princess Anne!

11
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,970
You've come to exhibit the Duchy of Sabrina masterpiece painting, as well as your fine jewels.

12
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,920
Is the diamond on your chest the famous "Plein Soleil de Paris"!?

13
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:38,970
Yes.

14
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,130
Will you be exhibiting that as well!?

15
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,720
Yes.

16
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,130
I'd love for as many people in Japan as possible to see it.

17
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,970
Of course, even Kid the Phantom Thief.

18
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,670
Oh!

19
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,220
Hmm!?

20
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,760
Is that a challenge to the Kid?

21
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,590
Yes. But I won't let him steal it.

22
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,630
In commemoration of today,

23
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,920
I will hold an opening party at the exhibition hall.

24
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,670
I would like to invite anyone who will do magic,

25
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,340
from professionals to amateurs.

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,880
Children are welcome as well.

27
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,590
A party!?

28
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,760
I haven't heard about this!

29
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,920
Do you know how hard that is on the police force to do something like that?

30
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,220
Oh! Belmonde!

31
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,720
Someone! Get my Belmonde!

32
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,220
Huh!?

33
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,010
Come over here, little one……

34
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,590
Tsk tsk tsk…

35
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,380
Bad kitty, Belmonde.

36
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,550
What do you think you're doing!

37
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,720
I'll arrest you for that!!

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,630
So you're the Inspector being toyed with by Kid the Phantom Thief?

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,010
What did you say! Who are you!?

40
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,130
The sharpest detective in Europe...

41
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,510
…Delon, that's me.

42
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,800
Detective DL, I've heard of you…

43
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,920
You never miss a chance to use your gun when going after a criminal.

44
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,670
Perfect timing, I wanted to let you know.

45
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,010
At the party, we don't need any Japanese security.

46
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,470
You don't need any of our security!?

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,590
You think we can trust you, when you've let him get away over and over?

48
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,130
We will be fine with our Duchy of Sabrina police force.

49
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,470
This is a message to Kid the Phantom Thief.

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,970
In our country, there is talk of thieves such as Arsene Lupin,

51
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,630
but before me, they are all just petty thieves.

52
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,300
If you want the jewel that glitters on the Princess's chest, then come and get it.

53
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,670
I'll catch you in three seconds flat.

54
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,130
Ha ha ha ha ha!

55
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,340
"Declaration to Arrest Kid the Phantom Thief!"

56
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,050
What did he say?

57
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,800
Kaito Kuroba! Put your phone away in class!

58
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,300
Uh……ha ha…..

59
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,510
You're so stupid.

60
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,840
You're probably just looking at the pretty princess.

61
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Wow, you're right, she's so pretty.

62
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,970
Huh?

63
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,590
Aoko, are you jealous?

64
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,420
N…not at all!

65
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,130
My father...

66
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,720
My father has been feeling down lately…

67
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,220
the princess is so bossy, and she took him off of security,

68
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,720
so he can't catch the Kid…

69
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,590
what if that Detective Delon really were to catch him?

70
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,510
Your dad's such a dopey inspector,

71
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,630
I'm not surprised they took him off of security!

72
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,010
Excuse me?!

73
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,053
I'm seriously worried here!

74
00:05:59,053 --> 00:05:59,920
Kai-troll!

75
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,970
What, Ass-ko?!

76
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,470
How dare you?!

77
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,090
You're the one who called me Kai-troll!

78
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,550
Um, we're in the middle of class……

79
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,800
That Aoko,

80
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,470
What did she call me!?

81
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,970
Inspector!

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,050
Oh, Kaito.

83
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,840
What's wrong? What are you doing here?

84
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,090
Sigh… I just feel ashamed…

85
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,720
when I think that I'm going to have to stand by

86
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,970
and watch Kid the Phantom Thief come and go without doing anything.

87
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,050
I've been pursuing him for so long…

88
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,220
but that Detective Delon's right,

89
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,380
I could never catch him.

90
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,800
I couldn't see it all, his moves, his tricks, everything!

91
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,590
Well, sorry for talking to you about this.

92
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,720
No, it's fine.

93
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,380
Oh yeah, Kaito. Will you show me a magic trick?

94
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,090
A magic trick?

95
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,670
Aoko's always talking about how great your magic tricks are.

96
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,170
Alright. Then, a really simple one.

97
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,010
There are no tricks.

98
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,800
Watch carefully.

99
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,590
It's gone!?

100
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,130
How strange...

101
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,970
Whoaaaaa!?

102
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,010
But it's actually not strange.

103
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,470
I bring your attention to my left hand,

104
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,130
and get the next move ready with my right.

105
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,670
Swiftly, so the audience doesn't notice!

106
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,470
It's a basic rule of magicians.

107
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,420
Wasn't Kid the Phantom Thief also a magician?

108
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,920
Th…that's right!

109
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,720
He's a magician, so he brings attention to one place…

110
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,880
Magic tricks aren't magic.

111
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,340
There are always tricks, Inspector.

112
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,260
Kaito!

113
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Please! Go with me to the Ducy of Sabrina party.

114
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,380
Huh!? Go with you to a party?

115
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,260
Only people who can do magic can go.

116
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,880
They'll let me in if I go with you!

117
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,970
If the Inspector cheers up, then so will Aoko…

118
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,840
but, how can I…

119
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,760
Please, Kaito!!

120
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,590
I have a strong hunch from years of experience!

121
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,260
He's going to show up tonight!!

122
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,010
I was already going to go…

123
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,220
but not with the Inspector.

124
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,050
Why are you here too, Aoko!?

125
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,880
I had to come, I'm worried about dad

126
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,760
More importantly, how do you like my dress?

127
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,920
Did you borrow a dress from the drama department or something?

128
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,470
Whatever!

129
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,420
Look at that line!

130
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,550
……Yeah

131
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,090
Whoa, it's kind of…

132
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,510
How are we supposed to do magic tricks with this much security around?

133
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,170
You can't have this many people here!

134
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,380
This is exactly what the Kid wants!

135
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,470
Oh, wait, dad!

136
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,340
The more people are here, the easier it is for him to play his tricks!

137
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,050
What are you doing here?

138
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,260
Inspector Nakamori.

139
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,130
Aoko, I'm so nervous, I want to go to the bathroom.

140
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:54,380
Huh, right now?

141
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,220
Kaito!

142
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,720
Detective Delon, I'll give you some advice.

143
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,050
Reduce your security, right now!

144
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,670
Ha ha ha ha!

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,470
You're giving me advice!

146
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,510
You don't need this many!!

147
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,590
You're the one we don't need!!

148
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,920
Wait, father!

149
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,970
What is the matter, Detective Delon?

150
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,470
What is all the fuss?

151
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,840
Uh, nothing.

152
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,920
What a beautiful young lady!

153
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,090
Huh!!?

154
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,420
Y…your highness…

155
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,720
How beautiful...

156
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,840
Welcome to the party.

157
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,220
It's Kid the Phantom Thief!

158
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,800
Kid the Phantom Thief's here!!

159
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,340
Shelter the princess! The party's over!

160
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,130
Yes, sir!

161
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,670
Where's the Kid!?

162
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,550
Oh, wait!

163
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,420
Ack!

164
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,800
No!!

165
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,970
W…what?

166
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,720
He took my clothes!

167
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
Where's Kid the Phantom Thief!?

168
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,260
I think he has already infiltrated the party.

169
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,090
So, he's disguised as a cop.

170
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,220
Find him!

171
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,880
Yes!

172
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,220
I'll just borrow your clothes for a little bit

173
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,220
Kid the Phantom Thief is here!

174
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,590
All gather immediately in the party hall!

175
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,590
That's an order from Detective Delon!

176
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,220
Yes!

177
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,340
Bye, bye!

178
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,920
Please go outside!

179
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,550
Over here, please go outside!

180
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,970
And Kaito's still… where's father?

181
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,420
I told you.

182
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,760
With this many police, do you know which one's the Kid!?

183
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,170
You're still here!?

184
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,090
You're not involved, you need to leave!

185
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,970
Are there even more police!?

186
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,170
Hey, where is the princess?

187
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,720
Is she guarded properly?

188
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,470
Yes, she's fine!

189
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,920
The Kid is after the princess' jewels.

190
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,510
Kid the Phantom Thief's also a magician, right?

191
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,590
He's drawn everyone somewhere else, while he's now…

192
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,630
Whoa, there's so many of them…

193
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,880
Right here.

194
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,010
Kid the Phantom Thief is here!

195
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,800
Leave this to me, and go to the first floor, hurry!

196
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,590
Listen, the Kid is disguised as Inspector Nakamori!

197
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,260
Yes!

198
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,010
Who are you? Outsiders aren't allowed!

199
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,220
This guy's the Kid in disguise!?

200
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,670
Noooo!!

201
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,470
I am so bored.

202
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,970
So bored.

203
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,010
The party had just begun…

204
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,510
I might as well be in prison…

205
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,050
Did Kid the Phantom Thief really come?

206
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,630
What do you think, Belmonde?

207
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,920
Who's there?

208
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,420
What, there's nobody here!

209
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,720
Where did all those policemen go?

210
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,340
Oh well...

211
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,340
So it's white……

212
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:40,760
Huh!?

213
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,300
Wh…who are you?

214
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,470
A thief.

215
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,050
Are you…!?

216
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,380
I've come to accept your challenge.

217
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,510
Well!

218
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,880
Why are you all gathered in the same place!?

219
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,630
We have captured the Kid!

220
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,130
What, where!?

221
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,590
Just how much do you want to get in my way?

222
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,720
But you told us upstairs that the Kid was disguised as Inspector Nakamori…

223
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,420
He's fooled you! The Kid's upstairs!!

224
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,800
Oh, welcome, thank you so much for coming!

225
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,340
Huh?

226
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,340
I'm so glad I came to Japan!

227
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,170
I can't believe I'm really meeting Kid the Phantom Thief!

228
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,220
We've heard all about you in The Duchy of Sabrina.

229
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,550
……Um

230
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,970
Oh, what should I do?

231
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:51,260
Oh yes, there's even a fan site!

232
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,300
Would you like to see?

233
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,130
Princess, um...

234
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,010
Oh! Can I take a picture with you?

235
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,220
Princess, what about your challenge?

236
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,420
Oh, who cares about the challenge!

237
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,630
I've been your fan for so long!

238
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,050
Uh… ha ha…

239
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,510
Please, make yourself at home.

240
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,800
Would you like to play a game of chess?

241
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,420
-Oi, oi...
-Would you like to play a game of chess?

242
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,130
Fools! Why are you all getting in together!!

243
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,970
Princess, unfortunately, I don't have time.

244
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,630
Please hand the jewel on your chest to this rough thief.

245
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,010
Really… um, but…

246
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,590
My father gave this to me, it's very special to me.

247
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,050
I cannot give it to you……

248
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,300
I just want to borrow it.

249
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,840
I will return it to you right away.

250
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,340
Huh?

251
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,590
Please believe me… Thieves never lie.

252
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,970
Belmonde.

253
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,590
How strange.

254
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,760
Belmonde doesn't like anybody else but me.

255
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,720
Really……

256
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,300
She's my only friend.

257
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
She's with me everywhere I go.

258
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,550
Oh yes, princess.

259
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,760
Will you help me do a magic trick?

260
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,010
Your magic trick!?

261
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,470
Enough! I'll get the Kid myself!!

262
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,380
Now, princess, just follow the plan.

263
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,220
This is so exciting.

264
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,130
Ahhhhh! It's Kid the Phantom Thief!!

265
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,420
Delon!

266
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,970
Quick! The Kid left through the window!

267
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,590
I won't let him get away!

268
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,800
Look! It's Kid the Phantom Thief!

269
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,630
A balloon?

270
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,050
Damn it!

271
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,010
Uh oh! I better get away fast.

272
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,670
You slipped up, Kid!

273
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,510
That jewel shines in the dark.

274
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,880
I'm fine, princess. I'm invulnerable!

275
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,050
Kid…

276
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:43,470
Hmph.

277
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,090
It must have hit the diamond.

278
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,880
That is how accurate my shot is.

279
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,010
This is the end, Kid.

280
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,840
That's where you are!

281
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,670
No, how can it be!?

282
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,470
Ha ha ha, can you tell which one is real?

283
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,720
Detective Dumb Dumb!

284
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,840
It's Delon!?

285
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,550
Playing a stupid trick.

286
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,010
Kid...

287
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,300
Kid, what are those lights?

288
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,420
They're glow sticks.

289
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,420
They light up when you bend them.

290
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,920
Which light is his...?

291
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,760
Wait, I'm pretty sure that diamond...

292
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,470
Ha ha ha, hey Kid……let me tell you some good, last story…

293
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,670
That diamond…

294
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,420
Shines in the shape of a cross!!

295
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,420
Fool…

296
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,760
Princess, this is the end.

297
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,760
Please hide in here for awhile.

298
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,880
We won't see each other again?

299
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,420
No… please, take care.

300
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,760
Then, to say goodbye...

301
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,840
Somebody!

302
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,970
Princess!

303
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,090
Detective Delon fell out of the window with the Kid!

304
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,550
Ahhhhh!

305
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,420
The Kid came after me!

306
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,420
Princess Anne! Where is he now!?

307
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,720
In my fourth floor room!

308
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,970
Good. The jewel seems to be intact!

309
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,550
Y…yes…

310
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,920
Then, I will hide in a separate wing.

311
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,670
Wait!

312
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,130
Princess Anne, where is your cat?

313
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,590
You love your cat so much,

314
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,840
It's strange for you to ever be without it…

315
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,340
Right……Princess Kid!?

316
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,340
Get him! This is the Kid!!

317
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,670
Ouch! Who stepped on my head!

318
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,986
I've got to hand it to you, Inspector Nakamori!

319
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,980
I didn't know the Princess loved her cat so much!

320
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:31,986
I didn't know the Princess loved her cat so much!
I do know though, that her cat's really special to her.

321
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:35,220
I do know though, that her cat's really special to her.

322
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,670
I can't do my work when you're hanging around!

323
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,220
I need you taken off my scent!

324
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,050
See ya!

325
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,510
Nooooo! Not again!

326
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,470
Huh?

327
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,090
You got it back! Good job, Inspector!

328
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,840
You're amazing!

329
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,510
Father!

330
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,840
Aoko!

331
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,010
You did it, father!

332
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,470
Hey!

333
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,010
Aoko, where are you?

334
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,720
Kaito! Over here!

335
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,800
Aoko's cheered up.

336
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,420
Mission accomplished I guess.

337
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,050
What…

338
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,010
Hey, look at this.

339
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,550
It says Inspector Nakamori has "instincts that come from experience."

340
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,670
Dad's looking all cool

341
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,380
You know that actually I...

342
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,260
I……

343
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,970
What about you?

344
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,970
I am Kaito Kuroba!!

345
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,720
Are you stupid or something?

346
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,050
Kid...

347
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Thank you for the wonderful magic...

348
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,120
Ladies and gentlemen!

349
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:51,160
Next week is the long awaited arrival of Kid the Phantom Thief!

350
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,450
There's a new girl in class, and to my surprise,

351
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,780
she's a witch with a really pretty face.

352
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,120
Mirror, mirror, on the wall…come on now,

353
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,870
is she serious!?

354
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,370
Well, witch or not,

355
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,320
a gentleman never lets a girl cry!

356
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,713
Next on "Magic Kaito,
"Witches Don't Cry"!

357
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,370
I'll see you under the moonlight.

358
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,070
Next Kid's magic,

359
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
"Chocolate"
