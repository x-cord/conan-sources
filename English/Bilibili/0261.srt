1
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:03,624
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:05,524
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:07,124
Snow falls silently at night.

4
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:09,224
A frightening suit of armor looms up from the darkness.

5
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:10,724
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:12,624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,624 --> 00:00:14,524
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,437 --> 00:02:00,137
In the warring era,

9
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:02,737
military commander Hidetomo Okikatsu advised

10
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:05,937
his lord Genbu Ohara, who was a tyrant,

11
00:02:05,937 --> 00:02:10,537
to stop oppressing the people.

12
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:13,737
But this angered Genbu

13
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:17,337
and he ordered the Okikatsu clan to be disbanded.

14
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,437
Filled with despair,

15
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:21,837
Hidetomo put on his suit of armor

16
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,637
and killed Genbu,

17
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,837
then he committed suicide by stabbing himself in the throat.

18
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:37,037
Hidetomo's ghost still wanders about

19
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:41,837
and it is said that whoever sees it will die an untimely death.

20
00:02:41,837 --> 00:02:43,837
This Okikatsu Festival is held

21
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:47,837
to appease the spirit of Hidetomo Okikatsu

22
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:50,137
For your information, the rainwear of straw worn in the dance

23
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,237
symbolizes the suit of armor worn by Hidetomo

24
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:55,937
when he killed himself.

25
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:59,737
Good grief.

26
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,937
The hot springs just ever that mountain,

27
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:04,937
why do we have to sit through this boring festival?

28
00:03:04,937 --> 00:03:07,637
But this is so surreal.

29
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:11,037
Good grief.

30
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:15,537
This is the 500th anniversary of Hidetomo's death.

31
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:18,937
Please relax and enjoy the evening.

32
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,737
Thanks.

33
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:23,837
Are you satisfied now, Ran?

34
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,837
We'd better start heading for the hot spring already.

35
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:27,537
Excuse me.

36
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,637
I just heard that the road to the hot springs

37
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:32,837
have been closed due to heavy snow.

38
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,337
Are you sure?

39
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:36,137
What're we going to do, dad?

40
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:37,737
Don't ask me.

41
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:38,837
I guess we'll just have to find some place

42
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,037
around here to spend the night.

43
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,837
But I didn't see any inns around here.

44
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,237
Excuse me. Maybe I can help,

45
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,237
there's a house up ahead owned by the Daimon family.

46
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,337
I'm heading there now.

47
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:52,237
You can come with me if you want.

48
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:53,937
Thanks.

49
00:03:55,737 --> 00:04:01,337
"Frightening Legend On A Snowy Night (Part 1)"

50
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:04,337
Are you sure it'll be all right for us to go along?

51
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:07,337
Yes. In fact, I'd prefer you come with me.

52
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:08,437
Huh?

53
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:11,537
The head of the Daimon family

54
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:14,837
is the president of Daimon Industries.

55
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,637
That company's well known.

56
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:20,237
The president is a man who'd do anything for money.

57
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:21,537
He's even a tyrant in his own home, he and his oldest son,

58
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:24,337
who is next in line to be president, are always arguing.

59
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:27,437
And that son's wife prefers partying to helping in the home.

60
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:30,037
I've heard rumors that a divorce is imminent.

61
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,637
You sure know a lot.

62
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:36,337
I'm the second son. My name's Yoshiro Daimon.

63
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:38,837
I haven't been home for quite awhile now.

64
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,337
This is quite a mansion.

65
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,337
They must get a lot taken.

66
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:52,537
-Huh? -In taxes.

67
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,937
Kazuki, I'm home.

68
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:01,737
You're looking good.

69
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:05,137
Yoshiro. Why'd you come back now after all this time?

70
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,737
Is that any way to greet your younger brother?

71
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:09,637
We haven't seen each other for five years.

72
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:13,637
Young master, please come inside.

73
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:16,437
Hatsuho, you keep out of this.

74
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:21,637
Yoshiro, who are these people?

75
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,637
I met them at the Hidetomo Festival.

76
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:27,237
It was snowing heavily and they didn't have a place to stay.

77
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:29,137
You come back out of the blue

78
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,237
and you bring strangers with you on top of that!

79
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:33,037
Forgive me.

80
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,137
I forgot to introduce myself. I'm from Tokyo and I...

81
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,237
What's all the commotion?

82
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,437
Father.

83
00:05:40,437 --> 00:05:43,837
Yoshiro, you've finally come home, I'm so happy.

84
00:05:43,837 --> 00:05:45,837
Good evening, father.

85
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,137
You over there,

86
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:49,837
aren't you the famous private detective, Kogoro Mouri?

87
00:05:49,837 --> 00:05:51,937
That's right.

88
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,737
Private detective?

89
00:05:53,737 --> 00:05:55,837
Kogoro Mouri...

90
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:58,437
I'm one of your greatest fans.

91
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:02,337
This must be destiny. Please do spend the night.

92
00:06:02,337 --> 00:06:03,337
Hatsuho.

93
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:07,437
Prepare the guest rooms for Mr. Mouri's party and Yoshiro.

94
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:08,737
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,137
Please follow me.

96
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:23,637
Mr. Mouri, you and your party can stay in this room.

97
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:26,337
Master Yoshiro, your room will be down the hall.

98
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:29,337
You can enter the garden through this back door.

99
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:32,337
It is very pretty. Everything is white with snow.

100
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:33,937
Please walk through it.

101
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,337
Thank you. We will.

102
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:38,437
Please forgive my brother and his wife.

103
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:41,837
They behaved terribly back there.

104
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,437
You don't have to apologize.

105
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:46,337
We're the ones who barged in unexpectedly.

106
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:51,037
Excuse me, madam. Where's the toilet?

107
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:54,737
It's right down the hall, there, at the far end.

108
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:58,337
The light switch is hard to find, so I'll go with you.

109
00:06:58,337 --> 00:07:00,337
Thank you, I'd appreciate that.

110
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,837
I'll prepare some tea so please relax.

111
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,937
You needn't bother.

112
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,837
But I'd sure appreciate some.

113
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:12,537
I'll join you later.

114
00:07:12,537 --> 00:07:13,737
This.

115
00:07:15,437 --> 00:07:17,237
Thanks.

116
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,137
For goodness sakes, dad.

117
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,437
Here it is, the toilet.

118
00:07:21,437 --> 00:07:23,837
Thank you. This sure is a huge house.

119
00:07:23,837 --> 00:07:25,437
It certainly is.

120
00:07:25,437 --> 00:07:28,637
What's down that way?

121
00:07:28,637 --> 00:07:30,237
Everyone else's rooms.

122
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:34,537
Master Kazuki's audio room is down the hall

123
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,437
and the kitchen is in front of it.

124
00:07:36,437 --> 00:07:37,737
Next to the kitchen,

125
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,637
we have a door that leads into the garden.

126
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,837
You can go in now.

127
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:45,537
We wouldn't want you to have an accident.

128
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:46,737
Right!

129
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,337
This is a very impressive home you have.

130
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:58,037
I am honored to be staying in a place like this.

131
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:00,637
No, this is just an old place.

132
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:02,837
We're always having to repair things.

133
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:07,137
Sir, madam says she isn't feeling well.

134
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:09,137
She's resting.

135
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:13,137
What, again! And just when Mr. Mouri is visiting.

136
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:15,437
Please don't get upset on my account.

137
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:19,437
I don't think mother can be bothered with dinner either tonight.

138
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:21,337
Kayoko!

139
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:23,937
Don't be like that. I think it'd be better if they knew.

140
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,137
Every year on the anniversary of Hidetomo's death,

141
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,237
at 12 midnight, my mother-in-law sits

142
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:30,437
in front of the altar in her room praying.

143
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:33,337
Supposedly, that's the time he killed himself.

144
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:36,837
I heard her once and it sounded so eerie.

145
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,837
Ever since then, whenever this day comes,

146
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,737
I climb into bed and cover my head with the blanket.

147
00:08:40,737 --> 00:08:42,937
Mother really is quite frail.

148
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:44,437
I wish you'd be more considerate.

149
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,337
Kazuki!

150
00:08:46,337 --> 00:08:48,537
You needn't worry about your mother.

151
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:49,837
Rather than spending your time worrying about her,

152
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:52,437
you should worry about your job!

153
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:59,137
Is the food to your liking?

154
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:02,137
It's delicious. The rice is good, too.

155
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,237
It is customary in this household

156
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:06,437
to cook the rice over a "kamado".

157
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:09,837
Really? I've never had kamado cooked rice before.

158
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:12,637
The burnt part was delicious!

159
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,237
By the way, father.

160
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:16,637
About the appointment of the next president...

161
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,337
We're in the middle of dinner.

162
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,037
We'll discuss that later.

163
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:23,437
Yoshiro, what are you doing now?

164
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,237
I'm a guitarist.

165
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:27,437
What? Such foolishness, quit that immediately

166
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:28,837
and come back home.

167
00:09:28,837 --> 00:09:31,037
I think it's about time you started

168
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,137
considering helping my business.

169
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,637
Yoshiro.

170
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:42,537
What kind of music do you play?

171
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:43,837
Flamenco.

172
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,637
Really? I'd like to hear you play.

173
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:48,637
Mr. Mouri. Excuse me.

174
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:50,337
May I have your autograph?

175
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:53,037
The truth is, I'm a big fan of yours too.

176
00:09:53,037 --> 00:09:56,237
You are, are you? It'd be my pleasure then!

177
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:59,037
-I'm so thrilled! -Yippee!

178
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:01,737
What a happy go lucky pair.

179
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,537
It seems the atmosphere in this house

180
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,937
has also brightened up thanks to Hatsuho.

181
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,037
Oh, it's just that I don't let things upset me.

182
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,537
Hatsuho, how long have you been working here?

183
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,437
Just over a year.

184
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:13,837
Your family's a very old family

185
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:16,337
and there's so much to remember, I'm having a hard time.

186
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:18,537
Oh, I see you have another one.

187
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:21,037
Yes, this is for Master Yoshiro.

188
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,937
Huh? You want my autograph too?

189
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,037
Of course. After all,

190
00:10:24,037 --> 00:10:26,937
you're going to be a very famous guitarist someday!

191
00:10:26,937 --> 00:10:28,937
I hope so.

192
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:29,937
If you become famous,

193
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:31,737
signing autographs will be the least of your worries,

194
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:34,337
Look at me!

195
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:35,637
I'll remember that.

196
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:37,837
Huh? You're left handed.

197
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,137
-Yes. -What are these figures?

198
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:42,737
I gave you the benefit of the doubt

199
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:43,737
and waited until the very last minute

200
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:45,837
but I guess it was a waste of time.

201
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:49,737
I can't relinquish my position to you at this rate!

202
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:52,637
Well, dad, your methods are rather high handed themselves.

203
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:54,937
I didn't ask you for your opinion!

204
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,737
Then, who are you going to name as president instead of me?

205
00:10:58,737 --> 00:11:01,837
You're both two of a kind.

206
00:11:05,137 --> 00:11:07,437
I came back here today

207
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:10,837
because I wanted to settle things with my dad once and for all.

208
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,637
Settle things?

209
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:17,837
Dad wants me to become one of the company's executives.

210
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:19,637
But everything is money, money, money.

211
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,637
He doesn't even try to understand how other people feel.

212
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:26,837
I left five years ago because I hated how pushy he was.

213
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:30,137
Well, he does look very overbearing.

214
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:32,737
The truth is, I'm going to Spain next month.

215
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:33,837
I don't intend on coming back to Japan

216
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:36,437
until I've become a first rate guitarist,

217
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,437
I may never see my father again.

218
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:42,337
That's why I thought I'd better come back

219
00:11:42,337 --> 00:11:44,937
and try to make him accept the way I choose to live my life.

220
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:49,437
That's what you'd like us to believe. Isn't it, Yoshiro?

221
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,537
But the truth is you came back

222
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,837
to seize control of the company, didn't you?

223
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,537
You're out of your mind!

224
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:57,637
I'd never have left in the first place if I intended to do that!

225
00:11:57,637 --> 00:11:58,837
I wonder about that.

226
00:11:58,837 --> 00:12:00,137
Madam.

227
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:03,837
What's all the fuss?

228
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:06,337
Gosh, everybody makes me so mad!

229
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:07,937
I'm going back to my place!

230
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,237
I almost forgot. Mr. Mouri.

231
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:14,137
I'd like to show you something interesting. It'll lift your spirits.

232
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,537
That's where I live.

233
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:25,937
I see. This is very nice!

234
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:35,137
It's always so noisy at the main house

235
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,837
so I spend most of my time here relaxing.

236
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,537
Look at that.

237
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:44,437
That suit of armor looks so imposing.

238
00:12:44,437 --> 00:12:46,337
You're right.

239
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,637
What do you think? Impressive, isn't it?

240
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:49,637
That's my pride and joy.

241
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,837
It's Hidetomo Okikatsu's suit of armor.

242
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:52,937
What?

243
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:58,237
So this belongs to the festival's hero.

244
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:00,737
So it's in your possession.

245
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:03,437
That suit of armor is cursed.

246
00:13:05,037 --> 00:13:06,437
Tatsuko!

247
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:08,737
What are you doing here?

248
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:13,237
Hidetomo's spirit still roams this earth.

249
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:17,637
Those who see it are said to die untimely deaths.

250
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:21,037
These are so Hidetomo's feet don't get cold.

251
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:23,737
Please use these socks.

252
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,537
Stop that! I don't approve!

253
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:29,137
How dare you say that to me?

254
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:32,937
I pray to Hidetomo on the anniversary of his death every year

255
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,837
and give offerings in penance of the horrible way you do business!

256
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:38,937
So don't you ever say anything like that to me again!

257
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:42,537
Tonight is the 500th anniversary of Hidetomo's death.

258
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:45,537
Something might happen tonight.

259
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:47,637
Here in this very house.

260
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:04,245
Mr. Mouri.

261
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:07,745
I've decided to postpone talking to my father until tomorrow.

262
00:14:07,745 --> 00:14:09,445
I see.

263
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:11,145
Why don't we drink more of that local sake

264
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:13,545
since we have the time?

265
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:16,545
Sounds good to me!

266
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:17,945
Yoshiro!

267
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:20,945
Mother. I thought you were asleep.

268
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:25,445
Yoshiro, Hidetomo must have brought you here tonight.

269
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:28,145
You're the only one who can protect this family.

270
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:31,245
Take this.

271
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:41,445
My mother was keeping articles like these.

272
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,945
Allow me.

273
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:47,645
December 10th 1996, Kenichi Saegusa,

274
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:52,045
president of Saegusa Industries commits suicide.

275
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:54,245
Daimon Industries used dirty methods

276
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:57,045
to deliberately drive the company into bankruptcy.

277
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,345
This was behind the suicide!

278
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:02,745
That's the way father always does business.

279
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:05,845
But you don't know for sure that this article was completely right.

280
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:11,045
I understand you saw the suit of armor in father's room.

281
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:12,545
Yes.

282
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:15,145
The man who committed suicide...

283
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:17,845
He was the original owner.

284
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:26,645
The day that man committed suicide, December 10th, that's today.

285
00:15:27,345 --> 00:15:30,745
His factory was left untouched, it's falling apart.

286
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:33,445
Some people have seen his ghost there.

287
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:35,045
Spooky, isn't it?

288
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:38,845
Hidetomo Okikatsu and the owner of his suit of armor,

289
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:42,245
the anniversary of both their death is December 10th, unbelievable.

290
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,945
Could it be the curse of the suit of armor?

291
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,945
It's mere coincidence. That's all!

292
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:51,845
Besides, time's a wasting.

293
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:54,145
Let's enjoy our drinks and take in the beautiful snowy scenery.

294
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:57,145
It's stopped snowing.

295
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,445
It's so beautiful.

296
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:10,445
If only the snow could fall in our hearts

297
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,745
and cover everything up like this, it would be so nice.

298
00:16:15,545 --> 00:16:16,845
I nearly forgot.

299
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,645
Your beddings been laid out so you can turn in.

300
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,445
Thank you, Hatsuho.

301
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:23,845
Come on, dad. You must be tired after all that driving.

302
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:24,945
You'd better get some rest.

303
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:26,245
Hey!

304
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:29,945
-I'm going to go get a drink. -What?

305
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,745
I meant water.

306
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:36,745
You'll get the inheritance money if your father dies, won't you?

307
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:41,045
But I don't think he's going to die very soon.

308
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:42,945
You're right.

309
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:45,445
What I don't understand is

310
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:47,945
why did that Yoshiro come back so suddenly.

311
00:16:47,945 --> 00:16:50,345
He's not leaving Japan, that's a lie!

312
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:53,545
I'll bet he's going to try and make good with your father.

313
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,345
There wouldn't be any trouble

314
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:58,245
if only you could automatically become president.

315
00:16:58,245 --> 00:17:01,945
And what about you? You married me for the money, didn't you?

316
00:17:01,945 --> 00:17:03,945
How dare you!

317
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:06,145
If you get a hangover and we have to spend another night here,

318
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,745
-I'll be very angry! -Hey, Conan!

319
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:10,245
Ran here's in a real bad mood,

320
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:11,445
we'd better get to bed and fast!

321
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:12,945
Dad, you're talking too loud!

322
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:15,445
Pops, let's go to bed!

323
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:17,345
Are you sleeping in the audio room again tonight?

324
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:20,445
You love music more than me.

325
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,645
Hatsuho. I'd like a cup of my usual coffee.

326
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,645
Could you bring it to the audio room?

327
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:30,645
Yes, sir.

328
00:18:18,745 --> 00:18:21,145
Nanmandabu...

329
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:31,145
Master Daimon is...

330
00:18:31,145 --> 00:18:32,545
What on earth's the matter?

331
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,745
Master Daimon is dead in his room!

332
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,245
Are you sure?

333
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:41,545
You kids, stay here!

334
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,645
Conan!

335
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,445
Is something wrong?

336
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:46,545
Master Yoshiro.

337
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:48,645
Your father, in his room...

338
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,245
Father?

339
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:57,445
Father!

340
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:59,445
Don't go inside!

341
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,445
It looks like he was stabbed once

342
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:07,045
in the chest with a sharp object.

343
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,645
He died instantaneously.

344
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:11,545
Pops, look!

345
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:17,145
The suit of armor is gone!

346
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:19,045
And so is the sword.

347
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,045
It appears Mr. Daimon was killed

348
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,545
while he was having a glass of brandy.

349
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:34,945
Who did this?

350
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,545
Even the socks...

351
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:46,045
This is the only entrance to this place

352
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:49,545
and on top of that, there were no footprints leading here.

353
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:56,845
What's that?

354
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:01,145
I get it.

355
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:04,445
That door hid the footprints.

356
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,345
And on the way here,

357
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:08,445
the man made hill and hedges cast a shadow over the footprints,

358
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:10,045
that's why we didn't see them.

359
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,345
Sheet?

360
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,545
Gosh!

361
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:23,945
Why are you always wandering around like this?

362
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:26,145
There's a huge footprint over there!

363
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:28,045
It doesn't look like a human one.

364
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:30,345
What in the world is this?

365
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:31,845
I told you.

366
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:34,245
What huge footprints.

367
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:36,945
Hidetomo.

368
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:40,245
It's Hidetomo! I saw him!

369
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:43,345
I saw him walking around in his suit of armor last night.

370
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:45,245
But the curse didn't fall on me although I saw him,

371
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,045
it fell on Genichiro instead.

372
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:50,145
At any rate,

373
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:54,045
these footprints seem to lead to the back door of the main house.

374
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:56,045
We'll go back to the main house the way we came

375
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,145
but make sure you don't erase any of those footprints,

376
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:01,445
let's see where those footprints lead.

377
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:27,345
The killer came this way?

378
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:28,845
Kazuki!

379
00:21:28,845 --> 00:21:30,745
He said he was coming here to listen to music

380
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:32,845
-but he never returned. -What?

381
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:40,445
Kazuki...

382
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,245
There another way in?

383
00:21:42,245 --> 00:21:44,245
No, there isn't.

384
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:47,245
Gosh! I guess we'll have to break it down!

385
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:04,845
Mr. Mouri...

386
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:09,245
Kazuki...

387
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,545
Don't go in there!

388
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:14,145
Hidetomo was angry after all.

389
00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:21,945
I don't believe it.

390
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:23,245
Kazuki!

391
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:28,945
It's Hidetomo's curse. The curse!

392
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:32,745
No, this is not curse.

393
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:36,445
But who in the world did this and how?

394
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,745
"Next Episode" -This room was completely locked,

395
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:09,345
so how was this possible?

396
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:13,245
It's true. It's Hidetomo's curse, after all.

397
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:19,045
That suit of armor summoned Hidetomo's spirit

398
00:24:19,045 --> 00:24:21,545
to punish my husband for all his dishonest dealings.

399
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:25,545
and Kazuki in the main house, too.

400
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,145
I see. I've got it!

401
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:35,245
Next Conan, "Frightening Legend On A Snowy Night (Part 2)"

402
