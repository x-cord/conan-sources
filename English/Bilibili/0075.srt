1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,480
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,510
Conan's logic works fast on
hearts tired by modern society!

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,060
Today's case is an impossible crime!
Money comes and goes!

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,690
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,560
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,020
His name?

7
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:38,709
The Finance Company President Murder Case.

8
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:43,119
Mahjong

9
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,449
Should I lose the ryan-pin?
(ryan-pin = two)

10
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:49,499
A sha-bo would make the wait pointless...
(sha-bo = double-pair)

11
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:52,999
Wha...?! Are you messing
with my pieces again?!

12
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:59,009
Oh, come on. You're doing
well tonight. Consider it a handicap!

13
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,409
Ron! (winning move)

14
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,849
Menchin, ipeiko, dora, dora...

15
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,409
That's a baiman! (baiman = double)

16
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:09,839
I lose!

17
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,809
You're leaving, Okano?

18
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:15,909
Yeah, I have no luck tonight.
I'll be off now.

19
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,999
Now we need another player...

20
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:20,609
Let's ask Hida-san.

21
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:21,949
Hida-san?

22
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:27,419
He runs that finance company.
He loves Mahjong.

23
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:30,249
President's Office

24
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:32,739
Hida Mitsuhiro (53)

25
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:37,129
10 million. I'm all smiles tonight!
Hida Mitsuhiro (53)

26
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:42,089
Hello, this is Hida Financial.

27
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,559
Ah, Hida-san! You're still there!

28
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:47,239
Oh, it's you, Hasegawa-san.

29
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,069
Do you hear this?

30
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:54,519
We need another player,
so I thought I'd ask...

31
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,979
I'll be right there once
I'm done counting this money!

32
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,989
Is something the matter?

33
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,909
I'll be there in half an hour!
Play without me until then!

34
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,539
Says it'll be thirty minutes
and to keep playing until then.

35
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,079
Great, then I'll play until then!

36
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:14,109
Thanks, kid!

37
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:14,919
Oh, no, you won't!

38
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:19,739
I was wondering where you were!

39
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,419
You brought him here,
didn't you, Dad?!

40
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,129
Alright, let's go!

41
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,409
Hey, now!

42
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:28,969
Say, would you wanna play
for half an hour or so?

43
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:32,939
I hate that stupid,
gloomy grownup game!

44
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,729
Ron!

45
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,239
A dai-san-gen, su-an-ko,
and tsui-i-so!

46
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,149
A triple yakuman!
A triple yakuman!

47
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,199
I won again!

48
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,119
Yeah...

49
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:48,929
Where is Hida-san, anyway?

50
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,909
I'll give him a call.

51
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:59,069
Weird, he's not answering.
But his lights are still on.

52
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,339
Maybe something happened?

53
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:04,489
Hey, yeah, he was strangely
flustered when I called him earlier.

54
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,799
Don't tell me he was robbed?!

55
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:08,139
Let's check it out.

56
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,809
Hey! Hida-san!

57
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,269
Are you in there, Hida-san? Hida-san!

58
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,159
Minamisawa Hisayoshi (34)

59
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:20,729
What are you all doing here?
Minamisawa Hisayoshi (34)

60
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:26,069
Your boss never showed up,
so we came to get him.

61
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,449
He's still here?

62
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,819
Incidentally, what are you doing here?

63
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:36,499
I left my cell phone here.

64
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,659
Ah. Here it is.

65
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,659
This is it.

66
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,619
So, where's your boss?

67
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:45,579
His office, I'd assume.

68
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,609
Sir! Sir!

69
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:54,889
Is there a master key?

70
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,349
He'd never make a master key;
the vault's in there.

71
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,239
Then we'll just have to bust it down!

72
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:06,109
Sir!

73
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:14,539
No good. He's gone.

74
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:20,949
The deceased is
Hida Mitsuhiro-san, 53.

75
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:23,459
The cause was potassium
cyanide-induced suffocation.

76
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,379
He died some time
between 7:00 and 7:30 p.m.

77
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:29,709
Inspector.

78
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,089
What is it, Takagi-kun?

79
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,559
The key on the desk opens this door.

80
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,279
And the fact that the windows
were locked from the inside

81
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,979
means this was an impossible
crime and a locked-room murder!

82
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:52,739
The security tape has
you leaving at 7:04 p.m.

83
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:58,369
Then he locks the door and returns
to his office to balance accounts.

84
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,329
Two hours later...

85
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:04,999
...you folks show up.

86
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:08,569
Who were the two people
with you when you left?

87
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,469
Oh, that was--

88
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,179
--us.

89
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:13,929
Why'd you page me?!

90
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,659
Fujii Takako (29)
Why'd you page me?!

91
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,109
I was having fun
doing karaoke with friends!
Fujii Takako (29)

92
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:19,859
I was having fun
doing karaoke with friends!

93
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,309
What exactly is going on?
Iino Hiroshi (31)

94
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:27,239
Someone murdered your boss!

95
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:33,909
Hmph. So the cretin finally
got what he deserved.

96
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,489
Geez...

97
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,869
There sure is a lot
of money strewn about!

98
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,489
He's biting his nails.
Is it a habit of his?

99
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,539
Habit?

100
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,709
Say, did your boss have any habits?

101
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,659
Habits?

102
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,469
Like when he counts
money or something...

103
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,159
Now that you mention it,
he always spread the bills like a fan

104
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,419
and then licked
his right thumb like so.

105
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,129
Who gave these bills to him?!

106
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,489
I did...

107
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,569
Then it's simple.

108
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:12,529
The killer was you, lino-san!

109
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,439
You laced the bills with poison in advance!

110
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,279
That's crazy!

111
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,659
Well?

112
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:24,109
As Detective Mori said, poison was
found on the victim's right thumb

113
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,709
and several of the bills.

114
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,919
What'd I tell ya!

115
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,859
However, the poison on the
bills was shaped like his thumbprint,

116
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:35,889
so it was likely his
thumb that put it there...

117
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:38,469
You're sure about that?!

118
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:39,599
Yes!

119
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,319
Coffee...

120
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,109
That's the coffee I gave him
just before I left for the day.

121
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,279
Then you're the killer!

122
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,319
You probably smeared poison
all over the cup handle!

123
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,909
No, no poison was found
on the cup or in the coffee.

124
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,279
I see.

125
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:03,949
We only found poison on the
victim's thumb, several bills,

126
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:05,249
and two other places--

127
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:10,749
the inside door knob
and the lock above it.

128
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:11,919
What?!

129
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,409
But just like on the bills, the poison
was in the shape of his thumbprint,

130
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,389
so it seems he touched them
with the poison on his thumb.

131
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:24,569
Come to think of it, he said the
victim was flustered on the phone.

132
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:29,399
What if he left the room halfway
through counting the money,

133
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,989
touched something with poison on it,
returned to this room,

134
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:35,909
and locked the door?

135
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:40,329
But how'd they get him
to touch whatever it was?!

136
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:44,159
I hope you haven't touched
anything since you arrived!

137
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,079
All I've touched
was this cell phone.

138
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,199
May I hold on to that?

139
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,909
Sure.

140
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,469
Where's that woman?

141
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:57,199
I'm in here.

142
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,969
Hey, now! What are you doing?!

143
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,929
Isn't it obvious? I'm making tea.

144
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:08,149
You fool! Don't touch anything!

145
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:10,279
Okay, okay.

146
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:16,069
You haven't touched
anything else, have you?!

147
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:18,819
I used the restroom
when I got here.

148
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:22,359
And I used it after her...

149
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,789
Anything else?!

150
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,749
I used the computer
a little bit...

151
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:31,459
You! No dropping ashes here!

152
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,409
Happy now, Mr. Detective?

153
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:45,739
Why, you...

154
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:46,769
Now, now!

155
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,689
Huh? Is something wrong?

156
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,149
You're all suspects! No wandering around!
You're all suspects! No wandering around!

157
00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:06,199
Oops, I turned it on...

158
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,869
Think it's OK to shut it off?

159
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:10,829
Dunno...

160
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,039
Don't touch that!

161
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:16,509
I'll shut it off!
Just don't touch anything!

162
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:21,469
Yeah, one wrong key press
and they'll find your data...

163
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:26,429
The records of you
embezzling company money.

164
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:27,839
Embezzling?

165
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,949
No! I haven't done anything!

166
00:10:29,949 --> 00:10:33,409
Don't tell me you killed him
because he found out!

167
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:34,649
That's absurd!

168
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:39,489
You wanted to kill him too,
Minamisawa-san.

169
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:43,659
You were in tears
when he blamed you

170
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:46,949
for a client defaulting on a big loan!

171
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:54,039
You were always wishing
how he'd die already!

172
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,909
Yeah, that's right.

173
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:00,009
But if a borrower isn't gonna repay,
he shouldn't borrow at all.

174
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:04,929
You found no poison
anywhere in the office?!

175
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:07,689
Not even the restroom or break room?!

176
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:08,389
No.

177
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,449
It was potassium cyanide
the victim touched.

178
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,309
It can't be wiped cleanly away
on such short notice.

179
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,689
Which means it's
on one of you three!

180
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:24,989
I'll have to ask each of you
to empty your pockets.

181
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:26,659
You first, Minamisawa-san.

182
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:27,739
Let's see.

183
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:32,579
A wallet, watch, house key, notebook,
train pass, and handkerchief.

184
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:36,509
The handkerchief is a little damp.

185
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:38,859
Because I just used the restroom.

186
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:40,049
Next is Fujii-san.

187
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,509
Oh? Your handkerchief is damp, too.

188
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:47,239
Obviously. I also used the restroom.

189
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,669
You're next, lino-san.

190
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:49,469
Right.

191
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,389
And another damp handkerchief.

192
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:56,439
Oh, but yours is sopping wet.

193
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,439
I tend to sweat a lot...

194
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:05,449
None of their things came out positive?!
None of their things came out positive?!

195
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:08,989
No. Absolutely no poison was found.

196
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:13,239
Then I'll be taking my things back.

197
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,999
Fine with you, right?

198
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,669
Yes...

199
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:20,669
Conan-kun. Let's go home.

200
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,199
Wait, I still--

201
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:27,409
Huh? Say, that person's been
like that this whole time...

202
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:29,099
Wait! Could it be?!

203
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,639
Wait, Conan-kun!

204
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,949
Hey, Mister Examiner!

205
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:36,529
You said you checked everything
the victim might've touched, right?

206
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,099
Yeah...

207
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,799
Did you check for fingerprints, too?

208
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,949
Yes, of course.

209
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:42,239
In that case, what if--

210
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,529
Yeah! I thought it
was strange, myself!

211
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,449
Conan-kun!

212
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,449
Come on!

213
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,909
They're gonna get mad
if you poke around there!

214
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,329
Conan-kun!

215
00:12:57,699 --> 00:12:59,789
Found it! Bleach!

216
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,259
The spill-off is fresh!
The killer used this!

217
00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:06,379
That person's actions,

218
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:08,239
the unnatural fingerprints,

219
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:10,239
and the time they
entered the restroom!

220
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:17,309
They manipulated and poisoned
the victim in this otherwise empty office!

221
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:19,729
As if by magic!

222
00:13:24,981 --> 00:13:26,311
Alright, you!

223
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:29,061
Sneaking around again?!

224
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:30,771
Ran! Take him home already!

225
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:32,481
No choice!

226
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:36,911
Dad?!

227
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:39,871
Seriously, Mori-kun?!

228
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,291
You know who did it?!

229
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,791
Yes. The killer's aim
was a locked-room murder.

230
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:50,251
Ran. Return to my office and
get the iodine from the first-aid kit.

231
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,771
Are you hurt?

232
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:56,181
The killer's identity will
emerge once we have it.

233
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:58,051
OK! I'll be right back!

234
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:06,311
The killer got the victim to leave
the room halfway through his counting

235
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:08,861
and got him to touch
something with poison on it.

236
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:14,361
It was after he returned and locked
the door that he was poisoned.

237
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:19,061
The killer used the victim's
habit of licking his right thumb

238
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,241
before counting money.

239
00:14:21,691 --> 00:14:26,191
In which case, the killer was
one of you three employees

240
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:30,861
who knew of his habit
and what he was doing tonight.

241
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:35,981
Hold on! No poison was
found outside this room!

242
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:39,381
Besides, how did the killer
get him to touch it?

243
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:45,351
A certain something would make
10 out of 10 people do the same thing.

244
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:49,981
That's it! The phone!

245
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:52,811
Anyone would pick up
a ringing phone!

246
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:54,561
Minamisawa-san!

247
00:14:54,561 --> 00:15:00,491
I bet you called from outside so he'd
pick up your poison-covered phone!

248
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:02,111
Not so.

249
00:15:03,191 --> 00:15:06,861
Minamisawa-san bites his nails.

250
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:12,961
Yet, when he came to get his phone,
he picked it up with his bare hands.

251
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:18,231
Had there been poison, he'd have
been too afraid to do such a thing

252
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,431
because there'd be no telling
where it had been touched.

253
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,101
The computer, then!

254
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:29,691
Iino-san! You had him turn it on
to check some data, didn't you?!

255
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:30,811
What?!

256
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:32,861
I'm afraid not.

257
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:36,281
There'd be no guarantee
he'd turn it on with his thumb.

258
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:39,191
Then what was the poison on?

259
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:44,111
There was a way to make him
touch something with his right thumb

260
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:46,201
whether he wanted to or not.

261
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,651
There it is now!

262
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:56,341
The demonic call the killer
used to lead him to his death!

263
00:16:00,311 --> 00:16:01,741
What's going on?!

264
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,261
It's the teapot!

265
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:07,451
The teapot?!

266
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:12,521
Aha! That's it!

267
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:17,441
The killer put poison
on the knob here!

268
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:19,581
Is that right, Mori-kun?!

269
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:20,401
Yes.

270
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:24,361
Gas stoves on the market are
usually for right-handers.

271
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:31,291
Poison left on the left side of the
knob would be touched by a thumb.

272
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:38,771
As proof, only this door's
inside knob had poison on it.

273
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:43,111
Which means he rushed out
without closing the door,

274
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:46,901
touched the poison
in his flustered state,

275
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:50,351
then closed it when he returned.

276
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:55,561
So who used that trick
to poison the president?!

277
00:16:56,021 --> 00:16:59,021
The only one who got
near the stove afterwards...

278
00:16:59,021 --> 00:17:02,491
...you, Fujii Takako-san!

279
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:08,311
Yes. Just before you left,
you put the teapot on the stove

280
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:13,961
so the whistle would sound
while he was counting the money.

281
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:18,521
You planned to wipe
the poison away tomorrow,

282
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:22,881
but his body was found earlier
than expected and the police showed up.

283
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:29,151
Afraid the poison on the
stove knob would be discovered,

284
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:33,901
you entered the break room and
wiped it off with your handkerchief.

285
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:40,361
How's that? You said yourself it
couldn't be wiped away so soon.

286
00:17:40,361 --> 00:17:44,611
Yes, it is impossible. Assuming
it was an ordinary handkerchief.

287
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,781
I brought the iodine, Dad!

288
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:50,241
Iodine?

289
00:17:50,241 --> 00:17:56,441
Now, then, Inspector. Please put
some iodine on her damp handkerchief.

290
00:17:56,441 --> 00:18:00,461
A single drop will shed
light on everything!

291
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:09,871
It's just going to
make a brown stain...

292
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,191
The color disappeared!

293
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:23,611
Yes. Soaked into her handkerchief
is neither water nor sweat!

294
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:25,651
It's sodium thiosulfate!

295
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,861
Sodium thiosulfate?

296
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:32,621
A bleach used to remove color
from disinfectants like iodine.

297
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:38,331
It's also an antidote that neutralizes
the effects of potassium chloride!

298
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:41,191
There's still some
in the restroom cabinet!

299
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:46,691
Bleach with a special chemical
that reacts at room temperature, that is.

300
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:48,011
Takagi-kun! Check it out!

301
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:48,871
Yes, sir!

302
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:55,271
After the police found out,
Fujii-san likely went straight to the restroom

303
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:58,941
and soaked her
handkerchief in the bleach.

304
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:06,651
I can't believe I was
found out so quickly.

305
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,361
Fujii-san!

306
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:09,861
So you did do it?!

307
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:15,831
That's right. I killed
that devious money-fiend.

308
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:18,861
But, why?!

309
00:19:18,861 --> 00:19:21,561
Easy. My man borrowed money from him

310
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,981
then hung himself
when he couldn't pay it back.

311
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:26,551
It's that simple.

312
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:31,011
But you were always saying
how borrowing money is wrong!

313
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:34,231
Yeah. I wouldn't have
bothered with revenge

314
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:39,561
had he borrowed money for a car,
a house, or gambling,

315
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:42,441
but it was for my sake,
so I had no choice.

316
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:44,231
Your sake?

317
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:47,231
I've always had a weak heart,

318
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:50,401
and I was in the hospital between my
college graduation and three years ago.

319
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:54,941
My parents died early on and I had
no friends because of my attitude,

320
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:57,651
so only he ever visited me.

321
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:00,371
He said he'd pay the
hospital bills somehow.

322
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:04,361
When I finally got better
and went to his apartment,

323
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:09,801
I found him dead with a
Hida Financial loan form at his feet.

324
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,021
So you joined the
company to get revenge?!

325
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:15,761
Yep. I waited for my
chance this whole time.

326
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:20,231
But, Detective.
How did you know I did it?

327
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:27,111
That'd be because of the left hand
you kept in your coat the entire time.

328
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:32,771
You always used your right hand
to take out cigarettes or use a lighter.

329
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:36,981
You used your left hand
only once to turn the stove knob.

330
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:41,901
You're a heavy smoker.
You touch your lips when you smoke.

331
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:47,291
Afraid of that, you purposely
turned the knob with your left hand.

332
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:51,191
Naturally, you kept your
left hand in your pocket

333
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:56,221
so you wouldn't accidentally
smear the poison on anything.

334
00:20:57,361 --> 00:21:01,611
And to think my man
got me to stop smoking...

335
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:03,941
He must be laughing
in the next world...

336
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:34,231
Arcade

337
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:35,531
Hey, Kogoro-chan!
Arcade

338
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:39,231
I don't see you here too often!

339
00:22:39,231 --> 00:22:40,981
Can't be helped.

340
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:45,501
Nobody'll play with me 'cuz it
reminds them of what happened.

341
00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:49,231
So you bring a kid with you
to play Strip Mahjong?

342
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:50,961
Yes! Perfect!

343
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:54,361
OK! Now chi-so-ki for a dama-ten!

344
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:57,011
Moron! Go for the sha-ki!

345
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:58,631
Just what are you doing?

346
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:01,731
Uh, well, you see--

347
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:06,481
You need to lose the pa-so and use
the dora-so-machi to get a soku-ri!
