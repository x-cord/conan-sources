1
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.270
On the campus of Haido High School,

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.570
Magazine editor, Mr. Kyogo Nakatsu was found dead lying face down

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.370
"Kyogo Nakatsu (42), Magazine Editor" -and pressed into the concrete.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.070
"Yusuke Kuchiki (38), Unemployed" -The suspect is Yusuke Kuchiki,

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.470
who was found face up in the concrete next to Mr. Nakatsu.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.970
However, it seems that Mr. Kuchiki

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.470
testified that an alien who came down on a UFO

8
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.170
killed Mr. Nakatsu in midair,

9
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.070
went back inside the UFO and flew off.

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.870
See! So aliens exist after all!

11
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.170
Yeah.

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
No, it's not an alien.

13
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.570
This is a murder committed by a human!

14
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.370
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

15
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.670
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

16
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.770
A queer case involving a UFO.

17
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.970
An officer on diet closes in on the mystery.

18
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.670
He sees through the one and only truth.

19
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.970
His name is Detective Conan!

21
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:53.811
"Chiba's Difficult UFO Case (Part 2)"

22
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.011
Hey, Officer Chiba, what's going on?

23
00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.111
What do you mean?

24
00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.811
About the concrete murder case

25
00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:03.411
that occurred on October 4th.

26
00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:06.311
A great fuss is going on over it online.

27
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.011
People are saying that an alien committed the murder

28
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.911
and that the police are trying to hide

29
00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:12.611
he existence of the alien from the public.

30
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.111
The article online

31
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.411
has many details that have not been publicized yet,

32
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:18.411
and the one who is providing this information

33
00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:20.711
is a certain famed detective, it says.

34
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.511
That's probably Mr. Mouri.

35
00:03:23.511 --> 00:03:25.911
I happened to run into him at the site the other day, you see.

36
00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:27.811
Then go over to his place right this minute

37
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:29.511
and ask him what's going on!

38
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:30.811
Yes, sir!

39
00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:32.011
My God.

40
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.311
Officer Chiba's changed, hasn't he?

41
00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:36.511
He hasn't changed a bit.

42
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:39.511
He seems to still be absorbed in cartoons and comic books.

43
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.911
No. I mean his physique.

44
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:43.611
You think so?

45
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:46.311
Officer Chiba.

46
00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:48.411
I guess you goofed.

47
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.711
Leaking classified information.

48
00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:53.011
You shouldn't have.

49
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:55.911
You've got to be really careful when you talk to Mr. Mouri.

50
00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:59.911
Officer Sato and you frequently tell him about the cases too.

51
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:02.211
I make sure he doesn't leak the info.

52
00:04:02.211 --> 00:04:05.711
That's nothing to boast about, you know.

53
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.111
Well, there are times I feel like relying on him too.

54
00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:12.711
Because no matter how much I ask around, there's no progress at all.

55
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.111
Come to think of it, Yumi was saying.

56
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:17.211
If you want to know about 3 months ago,

57
00:04:17.211 --> 00:04:20.411
you should've come and asked 3 months ago.

58
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:22.511
Well, I couldn't help it.

59
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.111
Because the man who was at the site

60
00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:26.711
suddenly changed his story.

61
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:31.211
First, he said he was showered with a strong light and passed out.

62
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:34.211
But then, he says the murderer is an alien

63
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:36.611
who came down on a UFO, who got back in and fled.

64
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.311
That's why

65
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:41.711
I had to ask around the vicinity of the site every single day

66
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.211
and I'm pooped.

67
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:46.111
True, you look a bit haggard.

68
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.711
Rather, did you lose weight?

69
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:51.011
Well, about 10 kilograms.

70
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:53.511
The diet methods that I received in the package

71
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:55.411
were really good, you see.

72
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:58.411
I lose small kilograms everyday,

73
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:01.111
so I enjoy weighing myself.

74
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:04.611
Okay, next it's memory diet

75
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:06.411
and the eating order diet.

76
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:09.111
Maybe I'll send him the papers on the 8-hour diet too.

77
00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:10.211
"Mouri Detective Agency"

78
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.611
Sorry.

79
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:15.611
I talked about it to my drinking friends half joking.

80
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.911
Gosh.

81
00:05:16.911 --> 00:05:20.311
Please tell them to delete the blog right away.

82
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:22.111
But is it true

83
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.311
that the man who was at the site

84
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:28.111
recently started saying suddenly that the perp was an alien?

85
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:32.311
Yeah, he says he suddenly recalled this after 3 months.

86
00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:34.811
Of course this is a secret too.

87
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:38.611
But that man also had a blog,

88
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:40.111
so I took a look at it.

89
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:41.911
And it seems he went into somebody's yard

90
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:44.311
because he wanted to take pictures of UFOs

91
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.811
and was arrested by the police for trespassing.

92
00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:50.111
He also wrote that when he went after a UFO on his car,

93
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:53.811
he was caught and given a speeding ticket.

94
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:55.211
He claims that he let the UFO get away

95
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:56.811
because the police got in his way.

96
00:05:56.811 --> 00:05:58.411
He went as far to write that

97
00:05:58.411 --> 00:06:00.711
maybe the police was deliberately getting in his way

98
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.611
because they don't want to publicize information regarding UFOs.

99
00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:06.211
Is that right?

100
00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:08.811
This man's a UFO freak, right?

101
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:11.511
Then I think he'd rather brag on his blog before telling the police

102
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.611
that an alien came down out of a UFO and committed murder.

103
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.011
He doesn't seem bothered writing about things like this.

104
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:20.511
True.

105
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:22.611
If he wants to insist that he's not the perp,

106
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:24.011
he should be writing it.

107
00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:28.511
Rather, weren't there any other eye-witness reports on UFO sightings?

108
00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:31.211
It flew in the direction of Haido Park, right?

109
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:32.411
Yes.

110
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:35.711
Everybody was at the Haido-cho Festival that day,

111
00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:38.411
so the park was virtually empty that day.

112
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:42.711
Then what about during summer vacation when Ran's friend saw the UFO?

113
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:44.111
Since right before summer vacation,

114
00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:46.711
an elementary school teacher was pushed down

115
00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:49.211
from the stairs of Haido Park.

116
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:50.711
Because of this incident,

117
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:54.111
everybody seems to have avoided going to Haido Park from fear.

118
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:58.111
From the end of August when a security camera was set up in Haido Park,

119
00:06:58.111 --> 00:07:01.911
everybody started feeling safe and started coming back to Haido Park.

120
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:06.311
Then why don't we go to that man's place from now?

121
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:08.111
From now?

122
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:12.211
If the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri asks detailed questions,

123
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:14.311
the case will be solved

124
00:07:14.311 --> 00:07:17.711
and maybe you won't get so badly scolded then too, Officer Chiba.

125
00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:24.611
Mr. Kuchiki.

126
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:28.711
Mr. Yusuke Kuchiki?

127
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:32.011
Yes, what is it?

128
00:07:32.011 --> 00:07:34.111
I'm Officer Chiba from MPD,

129
00:07:34.111 --> 00:07:36.111
and I would like to ask you a few questions,

130
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:37.511
so do you mind letting us in?

131
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:39.711
Wait.

132
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:42.411
The place is a mess right now.

133
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:54.111
Okay, please come in.

134
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:56.311
Excuse me.

135
00:07:56.311 --> 00:07:59.711
I can't even serve you tea, you know.

136
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:01.611
Well, don't bother.

137
00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:07.811
You mean he cleaned the place?

138
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:10.711
Please don't touch anything here.

139
00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:13.111
Rather, what's this brat doing here?

140
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:19.011
There are so many photos of UFOs!

141
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:21.211
I mean what the hell are you doing here?

142
00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:23.111
Oh, well.

143
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:26.111
He's staying at my place. He loves UFOs.

144
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:30.011
Hey!

145
00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:31.411
What do you think you're...

146
00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:40.211
You darn brat!

147
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:42.311
I'm so sorry.

148
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:45.611
He's always into mischief, you see.

149
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:50.011
You wait outside!

150
00:08:56.711 --> 00:08:58.311
Conan?

151
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:02.811
You want me to give you Hina's phone number?

152
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:05.911
Yep! I have something I'd like to ask her.

153
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:08.011
Hold on.

154
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:10.711
Hina's right beside me now.

155
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:12.911
What? Why?

156
00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:15.411
Today our school had joint karate practice

157
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:18.111
with Haido High School karate club.

158
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:20.111
We just finished and were getting ready to go home.

159
00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:21.811
I'll put her on.

160
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:24.811
Hina. Phone call from Conan.

161
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:26.411
He wants to talk to you.

162
00:09:26.411 --> 00:09:29.711
Oh, that smart boy?

163
00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:30.811
"Hina Wada (17), Haido High School, Second-Year"

164
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:33.511
What is it? Did you find the alien?

165
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.711
No, not yet.

166
00:09:36.711 --> 00:09:38.211
But I was wondering

167
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:42.011
what color was the cigar type UFO that you saw, Hina.

168
00:09:42.011 --> 00:09:43.311
It was black.

169
00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:46.211
It was a bit shiny and pitch black!

170
00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:47.411
I got it.

171
00:09:47.411 --> 00:09:49.911
Thank you.

172
00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:51.311
Wait.

173
00:09:51.311 --> 00:09:52.911
I see.

174
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:55.011
So, that's the story.

175
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.511
That's why he deliberately

176
00:09:56.511 --> 00:10:01.611
didn't post and upload on his blog that he saw the alien.

177
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:06.611
So that no one would try to verify the Unidentified Flying Object.

178
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:11.311
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Yes.

179
00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:20.211
I'm sorry I'm late.

180
00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:21.811
I thought it was just the right distance,

181
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:24.911
so I jogged all the way here from home.

182
00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:27.711
You are...

183
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.711
May I ask who you are?

184
00:10:29.711 --> 00:10:32.611
I'm Chiba from MPD. Chiba!

185
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:34.611
Please don't forget me.

186
00:10:34.611 --> 00:10:36.811
Officer Chiba, we've been waiting for you.

187
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:39.911
Right. Conan told me to come over.

188
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:43.111
You've figured out the concrete murder case, right?

189
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:44.111
What?

190
00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:47.011
Remember, we made it last night, didn't we?

191
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:50.011
The trick that the perp used.

192
00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:52.311
You mean that slender big bag we made

193
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:54.711
by taping black plastic bags together?

194
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:58.311
So, that wasn't your science homework?

195
00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:01.211
Let's just call everybody over and try out the experiment.

196
00:11:01.211 --> 00:11:02.911
Because today just happens to be

197
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:06.111
a clear day with no clouds.

198
00:11:19.278 --> 00:11:21.978
What on earth?

199
00:11:21.978 --> 00:11:25.878
I talked to you a lot at my room the other day, didn't I?

200
00:11:25.878 --> 00:11:28.578
Then, you're insisting that not you,

201
00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:31.078
but the alien committed the murder?

202
00:11:31.078 --> 00:11:33.378
How else could it have been?

203
00:11:33.378 --> 00:11:36.578
Mr. Nakatsu who was found in the half-dried concrete

204
00:11:36.578 --> 00:11:40.778
was suffocated to death with a bag-type weapon, right?

205
00:11:40.778 --> 00:11:46.278
I may have been lying next to him buried in the concrete,

206
00:11:46.278 --> 00:11:50.578
but I didn't have that bag-type weapon on me.

207
00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:54.478
The footprints on the concrete are no more.

208
00:11:54.478 --> 00:11:57.278
And since that day had no wind,

209
00:11:57.278 --> 00:12:00.778
the bag couldn't have been blown away either.

210
00:12:00.778 --> 00:12:03.378
Couldn't you have walked backward out of the concrete,

211
00:12:03.378 --> 00:12:05.678
while retracing the footprints of when you went in?

212
00:12:05.678 --> 00:12:07.078
Idiot!

213
00:12:07.078 --> 00:12:09.778
Then those footprints would be deeper.

214
00:12:09.778 --> 00:12:12.278
In the first place, you're not even a student here.

215
00:12:12.278 --> 00:12:14.978
What were you doing inside our campus?

216
00:12:14.978 --> 00:12:16.578
Hina!

217
00:12:16.578 --> 00:12:20.278
I saw a UFO around here the day before.

218
00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:25.978
That's why I brought UFO magazine editor, Mr. Nakatsu here with me.

219
00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:27.878
We could get a good view

220
00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:30.378
if we go up to the roof of this school, you see.

221
00:12:30.378 --> 00:12:32.778
Rather, what's with that girl?

222
00:12:32.778 --> 00:12:34.878
She witnessed it too.

223
00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:37.878
Flying over Haido Park during summer vacation,

224
00:12:37.878 --> 00:12:40.378
the cigar-shaped UFO.

225
00:12:40.378 --> 00:12:43.378
See! So UFOs exist after all!

226
00:12:43.378 --> 00:12:46.178
The one I saw was probably the same kind too.

227
00:12:46.178 --> 00:12:49.078
I was blinded by the strong light it emitted when it fled

228
00:12:49.078 --> 00:12:50.978
and passed out.

229
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:53.778
Then, wasn't the color of that UFO...

230
00:12:53.778 --> 00:12:56.278
this color?

231
00:13:00.878 --> 00:13:02.578
No.

232
00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:05.478
The one I saw was sort of more grayish.

233
00:13:05.478 --> 00:13:08.478
But I think you can

234
00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:11.478
fly this in the sky just like a UFO, right?

235
00:13:11.478 --> 00:13:15.978
Of course, you can suffocate a person to death with this too.

236
00:13:15.978 --> 00:13:17.678
What're you talking about?

237
00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:20.178
Even if you pull such a big bag over a person,

238
00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:22.178
you couldn't possibly murder somebody with this.

239
00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:24.978
Then, try covering your head with it.

240
00:13:35.278 --> 00:13:36.578
See?

241
00:13:36.578 --> 00:13:39.578
I can breathe even if I squeeze the bag close.

242
00:13:39.578 --> 00:13:41.078
Okay then, Officer Chiba.

243
00:13:41.078 --> 00:13:44.678
Can you squeeze the bag from behind Pops?

244
00:13:46.378 --> 00:13:47.778
Like this?

245
00:13:47.778 --> 00:13:50.778
I see! Better too big than too little!

246
00:13:50.778 --> 00:13:53.278
-This way you can suffocate somebody! -I can't breathe.

247
00:13:53.278 --> 00:13:55.578
Dad!

248
00:13:57.478 --> 00:14:01.478
But I wasn't holding a big bag like this

249
00:14:01.478 --> 00:14:04.878
in the footage of the security camera, right?

250
00:14:04.878 --> 00:14:06.078
You're right.

251
00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:09.578
I think you hid it in the shrubbery over there or something, right?

252
00:14:09.578 --> 00:14:11.578
Even so, I'm telling you

253
00:14:11.578 --> 00:14:15.578
that a bag this big wasn't found at the crime scene!

254
00:14:15.578 --> 00:14:18.878
That's why you flew it like a UFO, right?

255
00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:21.278
By putting air into the bag.

256
00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:23.178
Air?

257
00:14:23.178 --> 00:14:24.278
How?

258
00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:26.478
If you run around with the mouth of the bag open,

259
00:14:26.478 --> 00:14:28.478
maybe you can get air into it.

260
00:14:28.478 --> 00:14:31.578
But there are no such footprints left on the concrete.

261
00:14:31.578 --> 00:14:33.278
Then open the bag

262
00:14:33.278 --> 00:14:36.978
and try waving the bag sideways like you're writing the number 8 horizontally.

263
00:14:36.978 --> 00:14:39.578
Like so?

264
00:14:43.378 --> 00:14:44.678
Amazing!

265
00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:47.078
-Air is coming in! -It's coming in!

266
00:14:47.078 --> 00:14:48.878
After the bag is filled with quite a lot of air,

267
00:14:48.878 --> 00:14:52.578
tie the bag shut and all set to go.

268
00:14:52.578 --> 00:14:53.878
Okay.

269
00:14:53.878 --> 00:14:56.178
See? This way you don't have to run around

270
00:14:56.178 --> 00:14:58.478
to put air in the bag, right?

271
00:14:58.478 --> 00:15:00.078
Right.

272
00:15:00.078 --> 00:15:04.378
So, if you swing the bag around like you just did,

273
00:15:04.378 --> 00:15:08.278
just those parts should have deep footprints.

274
00:15:08.278 --> 00:15:10.278
You're right.

275
00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:13.578
All the footprints look to be about the same depth.

276
00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:17.078
He's no more than a kid after all.

277
00:15:17.078 --> 00:15:21.978
If a big monster steps on the footprints, you could hide them.

278
00:15:21.978 --> 00:15:24.078
Monster?

279
00:15:24.078 --> 00:15:25.678
I see!

280
00:15:25.678 --> 00:15:28.678
He fell on the deep footprints.

281
00:15:28.678 --> 00:15:31.478
That way he could hide the footprints with his body.

282
00:15:31.478 --> 00:15:33.278
Like I said!

283
00:15:33.278 --> 00:15:37.778
There was no large bag with air inside!

284
00:15:37.778 --> 00:15:41.078
If a strong wind was blowing, it could've been flown away,

285
00:15:41.078 --> 00:15:42.778
but that day had practically no wind.

286
00:15:42.778 --> 00:15:44.078
No problem!

287
00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:45.578
Because in time,

288
00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:48.378
this black bag will turn into a UFO.

289
00:15:48.378 --> 00:15:49.478
What?

290
00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:51.978
It's a bag with only plain air inside it, you know?

291
00:15:51.978 --> 00:15:53.678
No matter how long you wait,

292
00:15:53.678 --> 00:15:54.978
it won't work.

293
00:15:58.778 --> 00:16:00.478
-It floated! -It floated!

294
00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:05.378
-Fantastic! -Right!

295
00:16:05.378 --> 00:16:08.078
The UFO that I saw looked like that!

296
00:16:08.078 --> 00:16:10.578
It's called a solar balloon.

297
00:16:10.578 --> 00:16:14.378
When the air inside the bag is warmed by the sun, it inflates,

298
00:16:14.378 --> 00:16:19.078
and when the density decreases more than the air outside the bag, it floats.

299
00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:23.178
The bag is black so it can easily absorb the heat of the sun.

300
00:16:23.178 --> 00:16:24.978
And the shape is slender and long

301
00:16:24.978 --> 00:16:29.978
making the air inside the bag warm faster to the center.

302
00:16:29.978 --> 00:16:33.078
I saw this on an experiment program on TV.

303
00:16:34.578 --> 00:16:36.178
I see.

304
00:16:36.178 --> 00:16:39.378
In other words, you committed the crime in this manner?

305
00:16:39.378 --> 00:16:41.678
First of all, you knew that this part of Haido High School

306
00:16:41.678 --> 00:16:44.778
would be filled with concrete,

307
00:16:44.778 --> 00:16:47.278
so you called Mr. Nakatsu out here.

308
00:16:47.278 --> 00:16:48.778
Then you used the big long slender plastic bag

309
00:16:48.778 --> 00:16:51.278
that you had hidden in the shrubbery,

310
00:16:51.278 --> 00:16:53.578
and pulled it down over Mr. Nakatsu's head from behind.

311
00:16:53.578 --> 00:16:58.378
Then you went inside the half-dried concrete and suffocated him to death.

312
00:16:58.378 --> 00:17:01.778
You then pushed his corpse onto the concrete, sinking it in deep.

313
00:17:01.778 --> 00:17:04.278
Finally, you filled the bag with air

314
00:17:04.278 --> 00:17:07.578
using the method we just used and tied the bag shut.

315
00:17:07.578 --> 00:17:09.678
You fell on the footprints that were deep

316
00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:11.878
and threw the bag in the air.

317
00:17:11.878 --> 00:17:13.578
Then all you had to do

318
00:17:13.578 --> 00:17:17.178
was wait for the air in the bag to be warmed with the heat from the sun

319
00:17:17.178 --> 00:17:19.578
and float off somewhere.

320
00:17:22.278 --> 00:17:23.878
And just as you planned,

321
00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:27.978
you made the workers who came to check on the concrete discover you.

322
00:17:27.978 --> 00:17:32.478
So the long, slender, large shadow that was recorded on the security camera was...

323
00:17:32.478 --> 00:17:35.978
The shadow of the solar balloon that was used to commit the crime.

324
00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:39.278
What about the UFO that I saw during summer vacation, then?

325
00:17:39.278 --> 00:17:41.678
He was probably experimenting

326
00:17:41.678 --> 00:17:45.478
whether the black bag would really float through the air.

327
00:17:45.478 --> 00:17:48.978
You guys have been carrying on for a while,

328
00:17:48.978 --> 00:17:50.978
but do you have proof, or what?

329
00:17:50.978 --> 00:17:54.778
Proof that I flew that black bag into the sky?

330
00:17:54.778 --> 00:17:56.478
I was holding back till now,

331
00:17:56.478 --> 00:17:58.278
but if you the police are going to be that way,

332
00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:00.578
I'll post it all over the internet

333
00:18:00.578 --> 00:18:02.078
that the perp is an alien

334
00:18:02.078 --> 00:18:04.878
but the police want to hide the fact.

335
00:18:04.878 --> 00:18:09.178
As to the evidence, I think it's stuck on a tree in Haido Park.

336
00:18:09.178 --> 00:18:10.178
What?

337
00:18:10.178 --> 00:18:13.678
It seems you were able to retrieve the bag that you flew when you experimented,

338
00:18:13.678 --> 00:18:15.278
but at the end of summer vacation,

339
00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:18.578
the security camera was set up in the park.

340
00:18:18.578 --> 00:18:19.778
I see.

341
00:18:19.778 --> 00:18:23.478
Initially your plan was to retrieve the bag that you used for the trick

342
00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.578
and then insist that the perp was an alien.

343
00:18:26.578 --> 00:18:29.778
But because of the security camera, you couldn't retrieve the bag,

344
00:18:29.778 --> 00:18:32.478
so you couldn't say anything even if you wanted to.

345
00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:34.178
If you mentioned anything,

346
00:18:34.178 --> 00:18:37.978
eye-witness reports of the black bag flying through the air would be gathered

347
00:18:37.978 --> 00:18:40.178
and that would increase the risk of the black bag

348
00:18:40.178 --> 00:18:43.078
stuck to the tree in the park being found.

349
00:18:43.078 --> 00:18:47.678
But since there were no such reports even after three months,

350
00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:51.778
you decided to go with the "An alien descended from a UFO and did it"

351
00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:55.078
that you were initially planning to use.

352
00:18:55.078 --> 00:18:56.878
If that bag is found,

353
00:18:56.878 --> 00:19:00.278
Mr. Nakatsu's saliva and the perp's fingerprints should also be found on it.

354
00:19:00.278 --> 00:19:02.578
There could be no better evidence.

355
00:19:02.578 --> 00:19:04.378
But what an idiot.

356
00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:06.078
To go out of his way to get stuck in concrete

357
00:19:06.078 --> 00:19:09.078
in order to make the murder look as if it were committed by an alien.

358
00:19:11.878 --> 00:19:14.678
I did what he wanted me to do.

359
00:19:14.678 --> 00:19:16.078
That Nakatsu

360
00:19:16.078 --> 00:19:18.678
had the nerve to look at the photos of the UFOs I took with all my heart

361
00:19:18.678 --> 00:19:20.478
and say...

362
00:19:20.478 --> 00:19:23.378
No good. They're out of focus.

363
00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:26.178
Besides, it's too small and you can't make out what it is.

364
00:19:27.178 --> 00:19:30.678
Bring me more flashy pictures with impact.

365
00:19:30.678 --> 00:19:33.278
Go and use a trick if you have to.

366
00:19:33.278 --> 00:19:36.878
Because UFOs don't exist anyway.

367
00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:39.578
He edited UFO magazines

368
00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.878
and yet he had the nerve to say something like that!

369
00:19:42.878 --> 00:19:45.078
All you had to do was hold true to your heart

370
00:19:45.078 --> 00:19:50.078
and take better photos of real UFOs and put him to shame.

371
00:19:50.078 --> 00:19:54.778
But instead, you set the alien that you believe in up as the perp

372
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.878
and tried to get away with the crime you committed.

373
00:19:56.878 --> 00:19:59.778
Right now to me, you look more like

374
00:19:59.778 --> 00:20:02.878
an unidentified alien more than anything else.

375
00:20:10.378 --> 00:20:12.078
Yusuke Kuchiki.

376
00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:13.478
Let's go.

377
00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:15.878
Officer Chiba's awesome.

378
00:20:15.878 --> 00:20:20.978
Kyogoku would knock a guy like him over anyday.

379
00:20:20.978 --> 00:20:22.378
I see!

380
00:20:22.378 --> 00:20:26.078
Kyogoku belonged to the Karate Club at Haido High School, right?

381
00:20:26.078 --> 00:20:27.178
That's right.

382
00:20:27.178 --> 00:20:29.778
He's abroad as an exchange student right now,

383
00:20:29.778 --> 00:20:33.778
but it seems some rich girl keeps hanging around him though.

384
00:20:35.978 --> 00:20:39.878
I'm amazed that you figured out this trick.

385
00:20:39.878 --> 00:20:42.978
When I opened the top cabinet of his room,

386
00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:47.478
there were a lot of science books, black plastic bags and tape shoved inside.

387
00:20:47.478 --> 00:20:50.178
But how did you know they were all in there?

388
00:20:50.178 --> 00:20:51.378
His hand!

389
00:20:51.378 --> 00:20:55.778
After he cleaned his room and let us in,

390
00:20:55.778 --> 00:20:58.078
only his right hand was white.

391
00:20:58.078 --> 00:20:59.678
That's how I found out

392
00:20:59.678 --> 00:21:02.478
that he raised his right hand up above his chest

393
00:21:02.478 --> 00:21:05.178
and hid something important.

394
00:21:05.178 --> 00:21:09.578
But you noticed that too, didn't you, Pops?

395
00:21:09.578 --> 00:21:10.878
Yeah.

396
00:21:10.878 --> 00:21:12.178
Of course.

397
00:21:14.278 --> 00:21:16.278
Of course I noticed.

398
00:22:37.478 --> 00:22:40.378
Officer Chiba, I heard.

399
00:22:40.378 --> 00:22:42.378
You nabbed the alien?

400
00:22:42.378 --> 00:22:44.278
Hey, is it true?

401
00:22:44.278 --> 00:22:45.778
No.

402
00:22:45.778 --> 00:22:47.678
I arrested a suspect who tried to make the murder look like

403
00:22:47.678 --> 00:22:49.878
it was committed by an alien.

404
00:22:49.878 --> 00:22:53.678
Well, it was practically all thanks to Conan, though.

405
00:22:53.678 --> 00:22:56.778
Chiba is starting to look a bit awesome.

406
00:22:56.778 --> 00:22:58.578
He's not only a bit awesome!

407
00:22:58.578 --> 00:23:00.378
He's really awesome.

408
00:23:02.178 --> 00:23:05.178
He wasn't giving it his all till now, I guess.

409
00:23:05.178 --> 00:23:06.778
Right, right.

410
00:23:06.778 --> 00:23:09.778
He's like the star of a detective drama.

411
00:23:11.078 --> 00:23:13.278
Maybe I'll launch an attack at him.

412
00:23:13.278 --> 00:23:15.778
No, you don't! Me first!

413
00:23:15.778 --> 00:23:17.378
What?

414
00:23:18.878 --> 00:23:21.178
"Several days later" -Officer Chiba.

415
00:23:21.178 --> 00:23:24.978
You gained your weight back.

416
00:23:24.978 --> 00:23:27.578
You think so?

417
00:23:27.578 --> 00:23:32.678
A load of early handmade Valentine Day chocolates was delivered.

418
00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:34.678
I tasted one and it was so delicious,

419
00:23:34.678 --> 00:23:36.278
so I kept on eating.

420
00:23:36.278 --> 00:23:38.378
Overeating is not good.

421
00:23:38.378 --> 00:23:40.678
Detectives need to keep in shape, you know.

422
00:23:40.678 --> 00:23:42.578
That's mutual for both of us.

423
00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:43.978
True.

424
00:23:43.978 --> 00:23:47.178
A complete rebound.

425
00:23:47.178 --> 00:23:49.478
Officer Chiba's not for me, after all.

426
00:23:49.478 --> 00:23:51.478
You can say that again.

427
00:23:51.478 --> 00:23:53.278
All right!

428
00:23:54.478 --> 00:23:57.878
"Next Episode" -It's already gone!

429
00:23:57.878 --> 00:24:01.978
Was anything written on the envelope?

430
00:24:01.978 --> 00:24:04.778
You mean that envelope with the marriage registration inside it.

431
00:24:06.478 --> 00:24:09.178
So, you've finally come, Chacha.

432
00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:12.378
"Marriage Registration" -Did you look inside the envelope?

433
00:24:12.378 --> 00:24:13.778
After getting hold of the Seven Crowns,

434
00:24:13.778 --> 00:24:16.878
I will await Yumi's answer totally ready for her.

435
00:24:18.978 --> 00:24:20.578
Next Conan,

436
00:24:20.578 --> 00:24:24.378
"Marriage Registration Password (Part 1)"

437
00:24:25.121 --> 00:24:27.021
Next Conan's Hint:

438
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:29.421
"Air conditioner"

439
00:24:29.421 --> 00:24:30.521
Kazunobu is the star of this episode.

440
00:24:30.521 --> 00:24:31.721
In the next episode, it'll be Chukichi.

441
00:24:31.721 --> 00:24:33.121
-Things are tough. -Things are tough.

442
00:24:33.121 --> 00:24:34.621
You mean for your partners.
