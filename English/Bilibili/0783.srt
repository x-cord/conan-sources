1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
"Kudo"

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.440
You can disguise the face and use a voice changer for the voice.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.140
Voice changer?

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.540
Open the roof.

5
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.040
What?

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040
Akai, what?

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.440
-Five seconds. -What?

8
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.340
When you get there, hold the steering wheel steady

9
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.540
drive at fixed speed for five seconds.

10
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.640
I'll put an end to this ridiculous chase.

11
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.940
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

12
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.340
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

13
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.040
A sink or swim gamble.

14
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.140
Who'll be the first to get to the truth?

15
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.740
He sees through the one and only truth.

16
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

17
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.740
His name is Detective Conan!

18
00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:31.394
"The Scarlet Truth"

19
00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:45.394
That boy...

20
00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.194
You mean Conan?

21
00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:48.294
Yeah.

22
00:02:48.294 --> 00:02:51.594
In order for them to secure me with the least resistance

23
00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:54.394
they would most likely try to capture either one of you

24
00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:56.194
who has a deep connection with me.

25
00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:58.594
To carry it out in secret,

26
00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:02.394
they came while you were out driving and isolated from other FBI agents.

27
00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:06.994
Knowing that you were suspicious of whether I was dead or not,

28
00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:08.894
he assumed that you'd be coming to Raiha Pass,

29
00:03:08.894 --> 00:03:11.094
and he was definitely right about it.

30
00:03:11.094 --> 00:03:12.794
Camel.

31
00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:16.394
After you past the next right curve, it's a straight road for 200 m.

32
00:03:16.394 --> 00:03:17.494
Roger!

33
00:03:17.494 --> 00:03:19.594
After passing the right curve, I'll keep the steering wheel

34
00:03:19.594 --> 00:03:21.294
and speed steady for five seconds!

35
00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:22.294
Too reckless!

36
00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:24.894
The tire's flat and the car's swerving, you know?

37
00:03:24.894 --> 00:03:27.194
So you can't possibly aim the gun.

38
00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:30.894
No problem.

39
00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:33.694
As long as the movements are regular,

40
00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:35.694
they can be calculated.

41
00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:37.294
Shu.

42
00:03:37.294 --> 00:03:38.594
Right curve!

43
00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:41.594
I'm counting on you, Camel.

44
00:03:45.394 --> 00:03:47.294
Straight!

45
00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:48.694
Copy.

46
00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:49.894
One.

47
00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:52.494
Two.

48
00:03:54.394 --> 00:03:55.494
Three.

49
00:03:56.894 --> 00:03:57.994
Four.

50
00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:19.494
They don't seem to be coming after us.

51
00:04:19.494 --> 00:04:21.694
Which means we shook them off.

52
00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.394
Just as expected of you, Mr. Akai!

53
00:04:23.394 --> 00:04:24.994
Camel.

54
00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.194
Go back.

55
00:04:26.194 --> 00:04:27.994
-What? -Yes, sir!

56
00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:30.294
Wait! You're kidding, right?

57
00:04:31.894 --> 00:04:34.994
What? Akai fired a gun?

58
00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:36.894
And what about the chase?

59
00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:40.394
About that... Our cars kept stopping.

60
00:04:40.394 --> 00:04:41.694
Who cares?

61
00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:44.294
If there's a car that can move, go after them!

62
00:04:44.294 --> 00:04:45.494
If we lose him now,

63
00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.794
we don't know where he'll go next time.

64
00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:51.294
Could you keep the noise down a bit?

65
00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:55.394
The owner of this house has just been awarded a great prize

66
00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:58.094
and is about to make a speech right now.

67
00:04:58.094 --> 00:05:00.594
I've never met him though.

68
00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:03.094
Thank you.

69
00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:07.594
I'm Yusaku Kudo, who he just introduced.

70
00:05:07.594 --> 00:05:12.394
I was able to receive this award thanks to everyone

71
00:05:12.394 --> 00:05:16.594
who turned a new scriptwriter's screenplay into a superb movie.

72
00:05:16.594 --> 00:05:21.694
Thank you to the director, staff, actors and actresses.

73
00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:29.594
And what I'd like to remind you of is the model of "The Scarlet Agent".

74
00:05:29.594 --> 00:05:31.994
You mean there's a model?

75
00:05:31.994 --> 00:05:37.194
Yes. The trouble is my wife is head over heels over him right now.

76
00:05:37.194 --> 00:05:40.994
"He's good looking, polite, cool and dandy."

77
00:05:40.994 --> 00:05:45.794
"He could probably do a lot more if he weren't an FBI agent."

78
00:05:47.294 --> 00:05:50.394
Is what my wife has been saying.

79
00:05:52.094 --> 00:05:55.694
Shinichi's dad is sort of cute.

80
00:05:56.994 --> 00:06:00.894
But we have no means of going after them in this situation.

81
00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:09.894
Are you okay?

82
00:06:09.894 --> 00:06:11.394
Akai...

83
00:06:11.394 --> 00:06:13.694
Akai? Hey?

84
00:06:13.694 --> 00:06:16.094
Is Akai there? Hey?

85
00:06:16.094 --> 00:06:18.294
No offense.

86
00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.994
After all, you're the guys that came after us.

87
00:06:20.994 --> 00:06:25.994
I didn't want anyone to get hurt, so I had to do it.

88
00:06:25.994 --> 00:06:27.794
I've got a proposal to make.

89
00:06:27.794 --> 00:06:30.994
Won't you exchange your cell phone

90
00:06:30.994 --> 00:06:37.594
for the gun that I fired just a while ago?

91
00:06:37.594 --> 00:06:38.794
Hey, what's going on?

92
00:06:38.794 --> 00:06:41.494
Explain the circumstances! Answer me!

93
00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:44.094
Long time no see, Bourbon.

94
00:06:44.094 --> 00:06:49.294
No. Was it Mr. Amuro?

95
00:06:49.294 --> 00:06:51.994
Shuichi Akai...

96
00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.894
As a token of my apology of having destroyed the cars of your comrades,

97
00:06:54.894 --> 00:06:57.694
I gave them a little souvenir.

98
00:06:57.694 --> 00:07:01.294
The gun that Rikumichi Kusuda used to kill himself.

99
00:07:01.294 --> 00:07:02.794
If you search where the gun came from,

100
00:07:02.794 --> 00:07:04.794
you may come up with something.

101
00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:06.294
This is Japan.

102
00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:07.494
So as to things like this,

103
00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:11.194
rather than the FBI you guys are more adept, no?

104
00:07:11.194 --> 00:07:14.194
Don't tell me you know my identity?

105
00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:17.194
I always had doubts about you from when we were at the Organization.

106
00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:21.594
But letting it slip to that boy that your nickname is Zero was a mistake.

107
00:07:21.594 --> 00:07:24.594
Rei Furuya.

108
00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:27.694
The nickname Zero is not common.

109
00:07:27.694 --> 00:07:29.794
So it was easy to do the search.

110
00:07:29.794 --> 00:07:33.094
You probably meant to turn me over to them,

111
00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:38.294
raise your prestige and get closer to the heart of the Organization.

112
00:07:38.294 --> 00:07:40.094
But let me tell you this.

113
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:44.894
Don't get distracted by what's in front of you

114
00:07:44.894 --> 00:07:47.494
and pursue the wrong prey.

115
00:07:47.494 --> 00:07:51.994
I'd rather not make an enemy out of you.

116
00:07:51.994 --> 00:07:54.094
And...

117
00:07:54.094 --> 00:07:58.794
I still feel bad about what happened to him.

118
00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:01.194
Okay, Camel start the car.

119
00:08:06.794 --> 00:08:08.694
What shall we do, Mr. Furuya?

120
00:08:08.694 --> 00:08:09.694
Shall we go after then?

121
00:08:09.694 --> 00:08:10.694
No.

122
00:08:10.694 --> 00:08:13.394
Now that they know who we are,

123
00:08:13.394 --> 00:08:16.194
pursuing them any farther is dangerous.

124
00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:23.894
I still feel bad about what happened to him.

125
00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:26.594
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:29.094
I seemed to have made a mistake.

127
00:08:29.094 --> 00:08:30.294
I'm leaving.

128
00:08:30.294 --> 00:08:31.394
Okay.

129
00:08:32.994 --> 00:08:35.794
Before I go may I ask you one thing?

130
00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:37.394
What is it?

131
00:08:37.394 --> 00:08:42.194
Why did you let a suspicious person like me into your house?

132
00:08:43.394 --> 00:08:48.394
You looked quite desperate wanting to talk, so I guess.

133
00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:53.594
I did think you were quite a talkative deliveryman, though.

134
00:08:54.694 --> 00:08:56.194
Is that so?

135
00:08:57.894 --> 00:09:00.794
Who were they anyway?

136
00:09:00.794 --> 00:09:04.194
I can't make anything out at all.

137
00:09:04.194 --> 00:09:06.394
Although they work for someone else,

138
00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:08.694
they're after the same thing.

139
00:09:08.694 --> 00:09:12.194
They're wolves trying to get their teeth into those guys.

140
00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:26.394
No bugs inside the house.

141
00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:30.194
Hey. You can come out now!

142
00:09:35.794 --> 00:09:37.994
I'm tired.

143
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:41.194
I mean, I wish you'd do as we planned.

144
00:09:41.194 --> 00:09:43.194
It worked out fine, didn't it?

145
00:09:44.594 --> 00:09:48.794
Basically, I talk with the voice changer that is embedded in this mask.

146
00:09:48.794 --> 00:09:50.794
And in case I'm told to remove my mask

147
00:09:50.794 --> 00:09:53.394
or asked a question that's difficult to answer

148
00:09:53.394 --> 00:09:55.594
after clearing my throat twice,

149
00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:58.394
you talk through the speaker with the built in voice changer

150
00:09:58.394 --> 00:10:00.994
and answer him.

151
00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:03.594
Then if I want to start talking,

152
00:10:03.594 --> 00:10:06.094
I clear my voice once.

153
00:10:06.094 --> 00:10:09.594
So that the difference in voice is unnoticeable.

154
00:10:12.494 --> 00:10:14.794
Great job, don't you think?

155
00:10:14.794 --> 00:10:17.794
I'd like to be awarded best supporting actor!

156
00:10:17.794 --> 00:10:19.494
Yes...

157
00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:23.594
Well, the one I'd like to give this award the most is to her.

158
00:10:23.594 --> 00:10:28.394
The person who is still doing a great job on the monitor.

159
00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:32.594
Then, Mr. Kudo, any plans for your next piece?

160
00:10:32.594 --> 00:10:35.194
Well... when the time comes.

161
00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:38.494
I'm afraid that I'll sprain my ankle because of the secret boots

162
00:10:38.494 --> 00:10:40.794
and my neck is ticklish thanks to the voice changer.

163
00:10:40.794 --> 00:10:42.894
I can't take it anymore!

164
00:10:42.894 --> 00:10:45.194
You'd better be grateful to Mom.

165
00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:47.694
After she helped me disguise myself,

166
00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:51.194
she headed for the Macademy Awards by plane immediately

167
00:10:51.194 --> 00:10:53.694
to take my place.

168
00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:57.194
Yeah. She's really good at disguising members of her own family.

169
00:10:57.194 --> 00:11:01.794
She was also pretty good when she help me disguise myself as Haibara.

170
00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:03.694
And?

171
00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:07.894
Is that FBI agent that I went out of my way to take the place of,

172
00:11:07.894 --> 00:11:10.394
coming back here again?

173
00:11:10.394 --> 00:11:12.994
Yeah.

174
00:11:12.994 --> 00:11:16.594
Because there's somebody he need to protect.

175
00:11:25.886 --> 00:11:28.686
My, how perfect.

176
00:11:28.686 --> 00:11:30.886
You're very nicely disguised!

177
00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:33.086
Thank you.

178
00:11:33.086 --> 00:11:36.886
Now I won't have to come every week to check on you anymore!

179
00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:38.686
Thank you very much for everything.

180
00:11:38.686 --> 00:11:42.186
Personally, it's sad that I won't have an excuse

181
00:11:42.186 --> 00:11:44.186
to come visit you anymore though.

182
00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:45.286
Hey.

183
00:11:46.586 --> 00:11:48.186
Shu?

184
00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:50.586
Are you really Mr. Akai?

185
00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:53.786
Yeah. My voice is the same as before, isn't it?

186
00:11:53.786 --> 00:11:56.886
But, aside from that, you're a totally different person.

187
00:11:56.886 --> 00:12:02.286
But if I use this choker type voice changer around my neck...

188
00:12:02.286 --> 00:12:04.986
I become Subaru Okiya.

189
00:12:04.986 --> 00:12:07.186
His voice changed.

190
00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:11.586
I owe this all to Dr. Agasa who made me this voice changer.

191
00:12:11.586 --> 00:12:15.586
And the wife of the owner of this house,

192
00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:17.886
Yukiko's splendid talent to disguise people.

193
00:12:17.886 --> 00:12:24.186
Also to the boy who planned all this, Conan Edogawa.

194
00:12:24.186 --> 00:12:27.186
But what is their connection to you?

195
00:12:27.186 --> 00:12:29.386
The thing is...

196
00:12:29.386 --> 00:12:31.386
They're distant relatives of mine!

197
00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:35.486
Mr. Akai said that he'd live in a modest apartment,

198
00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:38.286
but that apartment happened to catch fire.

199
00:12:38.286 --> 00:12:42.486
So I told him how about living in Aunty Yukiko's house...

200
00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:46.086
I mean, Ms. Kudo, where nobody lives now.

201
00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:49.286
But what if their son Shinichi Kudo comes home

202
00:12:49.286 --> 00:12:51.686
and sees a stranger living in his house?

203
00:12:51.686 --> 00:12:53.386
Wouldn't he be surprised?

204
00:12:53.386 --> 00:12:56.986
Well... I've told my son about it already.

205
00:12:56.986 --> 00:12:59.286
Right, Shin...

206
00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:00.986
Conan!

207
00:13:00.986 --> 00:13:02.386
Yep!

208
00:13:02.386 --> 00:13:04.286
By the way, Yukiko...

209
00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:05.986
Is it all right?

210
00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:08.586
It's about time for your plane ride back home.

211
00:13:08.586 --> 00:13:12.186
What! It's already this late?

212
00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:14.886
See you, Shin... Conan!

213
00:13:17.586 --> 00:13:19.186
Shin Conan?

214
00:13:22.486 --> 00:13:24.986
But, what a surprise.

215
00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:28.386
I didn't think James also knew about this.

216
00:13:28.386 --> 00:13:31.886
I didn't plan on telling him about it either but...

217
00:13:31.886 --> 00:13:34.786
Was that Rena Mizunashi you were talking to on the phone?

218
00:13:34.786 --> 00:13:36.086
Yes, sir.

219
00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:39.486
She asked me if I could see her from now.

220
00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:42.786
Let's call Jodie

221
00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:45.086
and tell her how we intend to cope with the situation.

222
00:13:48.386 --> 00:13:51.086
What's wrong?

223
00:13:53.986 --> 00:13:57.486
They noticed the coating on my fingertips, you see.

224
00:13:57.486 --> 00:14:01.386
Then, why didn't you tell us too?

225
00:14:01.386 --> 00:14:03.086
Didn't I tell you before?

226
00:14:03.086 --> 00:14:05.986
In order to deceive the enemy, we've gotta start first with friends.

227
00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:10.886
They tried to get information out of you too, didn't they?

228
00:14:10.886 --> 00:14:12.886
If I had told you that I was alive,

229
00:14:12.886 --> 00:14:15.286
they would've found out back then too.

230
00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:17.786
Maybe but...

231
00:14:17.786 --> 00:14:22.886
Well, we needed that guy to understand our situation.

232
00:14:22.886 --> 00:14:27.186
So, although it was risky we decided to take the risk.

233
00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:31.286
By that guy, do you mean Bourbon, Tohru Amuro?

234
00:14:31.286 --> 00:14:32.686
Yeah.

235
00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:36.586
I assumed that he'd come alone to see me

236
00:14:36.586 --> 00:14:39.086
but I didn't think that

237
00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:43.086
he'd come with everybody else just like the boy said.

238
00:14:43.086 --> 00:14:49.386
The grudge he has against me is much deeper seated than I thought.

239
00:14:49.386 --> 00:14:52.186
Does that grudge by chance...

240
00:14:52.186 --> 00:14:55.986
is what you mentioned to Bourbon over the phone?

241
00:15:00.486 --> 00:15:02.286
You guys.

242
00:15:02.286 --> 00:15:03.586
Conan!

243
00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:05.986
How come you're here?

244
00:15:05.986 --> 00:15:08.186
Oh, well. I sort of...

245
00:15:08.186 --> 00:15:10.386
Why are you guys here?

246
00:15:10.386 --> 00:15:13.486
We came to have Subaru solve a riddle for us!

247
00:15:13.486 --> 00:15:14.586
A riddle?

248
00:15:14.586 --> 00:15:17.286
Conan, we shouldn't talk in the hallway.

249
00:15:17.286 --> 00:15:19.586
Why don't you ask them to come inside?

250
00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:20.986
I guess so.

251
00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.186
All right!

252
00:15:22.186 --> 00:15:24.486
Excuse the intrusion!

253
00:15:25.886 --> 00:15:27.986
Do you still have the curry that we ate the other day?

254
00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:29.486
Yes, just a bit.

255
00:15:29.486 --> 00:15:31.686
All right!

256
00:15:31.686 --> 00:15:33.886
Did you do any cooking, Shu?

257
00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:36.086
Yukiko taught me.

258
00:15:36.086 --> 00:15:40.486
I can save on food expenses and it's a good diversion too.

259
00:15:40.486 --> 00:15:42.086
Really?

260
00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:48.586
First, Dr. Agasa brings warm black tea in four stainless mug cups.

261
00:15:48.586 --> 00:15:55.286
Out of the four coasters, on three of them a black skull mark was drawn.

262
00:15:55.286 --> 00:15:57.886
And the coasters were turned right side down,

263
00:15:57.886 --> 00:16:00.186
then in the coaster which had no skull mark on it,

264
00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:02.586
tea with lemon was filled.

265
00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.586
On the remaining three coasters,

266
00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:06.786
we place the tea with vinegar in it on them!

267
00:16:06.786 --> 00:16:08.086
Vinegar?

268
00:16:08.086 --> 00:16:11.986
Then, Dr. Agasa says, "I have psychic powers."

269
00:16:11.986 --> 00:16:16.786
I shall pick out the tea without the vinegar, without even smelling it!

270
00:16:16.786 --> 00:16:20.486
Then he picks up a cup and starts drinking from it like it tastes good!

271
00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:23.786
And when we looked at the coaster that the cup was on,

272
00:16:23.786 --> 00:16:27.386
there was no skull mark drawn on it!

273
00:16:27.386 --> 00:16:30.286
Of course you changed the position of cups, right?

274
00:16:30.286 --> 00:16:34.586
Yes! We moved the coaster and all when Dr. Agasa had his back turned.

275
00:16:34.586 --> 00:16:37.286
You really put vinegar in it?

276
00:16:37.286 --> 00:16:39.586
Yep! Because when we drank the tea that was left...

277
00:16:39.586 --> 00:16:42.486
It tasted really bad and I almost threw up.

278
00:16:42.486 --> 00:16:45.786
Was that ball pen is the erasable kind?

279
00:16:45.786 --> 00:16:50.286
-Yes. -But, he didn't do anything after the mark was drawn.

280
00:16:51.586 --> 00:16:56.086
Then shall we have the people that the United States take pride in,

281
00:16:56.086 --> 00:16:58.286
solve that riddle?

282
00:16:58.286 --> 00:16:59.786
-What? -What?

283
00:17:02.386 --> 00:17:04.286
That's why I told you,

284
00:17:04.286 --> 00:17:06.486
that Akai would never be alive.

285
00:17:06.486 --> 00:17:09.986
Yes. I was being overreacting.

286
00:17:09.986 --> 00:17:12.686
No more of something like this, okay?

287
00:17:12.686 --> 00:17:17.086
Yes. But if something comes up again, please help me out.

288
00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:24.086
Because after all I'm among the few who know about your secret.

289
00:17:24.086 --> 00:17:27.586
I'm sure the Organization's members will be surprised if they find out.

290
00:17:27.586 --> 00:17:30.486
That you're Boss'...

291
00:17:30.486 --> 00:17:32.086
If you keep talking about it,

292
00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:35.286
I'll bust you brains out onto the windshield!

293
00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:37.086
I don't think you'd better,

294
00:17:37.086 --> 00:17:39.186
because cleaning up will be horrors.

295
00:17:39.186 --> 00:17:40.586
No problem.

296
00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:42.886
Besides, this isn't my car.

297
00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:44.986
I'm not talking about my brains.

298
00:17:44.986 --> 00:17:47.486
I said before, didn't I?

299
00:17:47.486 --> 00:17:49.886
If my whereabouts ever become unknown,

300
00:17:49.886 --> 00:17:51.886
arrangements have been made

301
00:17:51.886 --> 00:17:55.186
so that your secret will be leaked throughout the Organization.

302
00:17:55.186 --> 00:17:57.686
That's right.

303
00:17:57.686 --> 00:17:59.286
Rest assured.

304
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:02.886
Since your secret is tightly sealed.

305
00:18:02.886 --> 00:18:04.886
No need to worry.

306
00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:06.586
No need to worry?

307
00:18:06.586 --> 00:18:11.986
Didn't the FBI find you suspicious after you picked a fight with them?

308
00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:13.786
No matter how much they suspect me,

309
00:18:13.786 --> 00:18:16.986
without proof they can't lay a hand on me.

310
00:18:16.986 --> 00:18:20.086
That's all within calculation.

311
00:18:20.086 --> 00:18:23.886
The only thing I wasn't ready for back then was...

312
00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:26.586
Amuro,

313
00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:29.586
you're enemies, right?

314
00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:31.486
With the bad guys?

315
00:18:34.186 --> 00:18:36.386
Well, from now on,

316
00:18:36.386 --> 00:18:39.686
it's better you avoid going off on your own.

317
00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:45.186
Gin was making a big deal about spies sneaking into the Organization.

318
00:18:45.186 --> 00:18:49.086
The guy called Hondo, FBI agent called Akai

319
00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.286
and that other guy make three.

320
00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:54.086
Remember. The one from the security police

321
00:18:54.086 --> 00:18:56.586
who snuck in and was killed even before we got his name.

322
00:18:56.586 --> 00:18:58.686
I think his code name was...

323
00:18:58.686 --> 00:18:59.986
Scotch.

324
00:19:01.786 --> 00:19:04.086
I think it was.

325
00:19:04.086 --> 00:19:07.386
There's no Scotch.

326
00:19:07.386 --> 00:19:09.186
You used to be a whiskey drinker

327
00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:12.586
and liked Scotch as much as you liked Bourbon...

328
00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:15.386
I've been drinking only Bourbon recently.

329
00:19:15.386 --> 00:19:17.086
Talking of Bourbon,

330
00:19:17.086 --> 00:19:21.486
I wonder if he really meant to hand you over to the Organization?

331
00:19:21.486 --> 00:19:24.986
If Shu tells them about how he was caught...

332
00:19:24.986 --> 00:19:27.586
With you taken hostage,

333
00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:30.486
he figured I wouldn't say a word.

334
00:19:30.486 --> 00:19:32.586
More than that, did you solve the riddle?

335
00:19:32.586 --> 00:19:35.086
Dr. Agasa's psychic powers trick.

336
00:19:35.086 --> 00:19:36.486
Oh, no.

337
00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:39.786
I've been thinking for a while now but...

338
00:19:39.786 --> 00:19:43.186
I can't come up with what seems right.

339
00:19:43.186 --> 00:19:46.586
The key to that riddle is the ball pen.

340
00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:49.186
Ball pen?

341
00:19:49.186 --> 00:19:52.286
Yeah. Dr. Agasa used the erasable ball pen

342
00:19:52.286 --> 00:19:54.486
to draw the skull, right?

343
00:19:54.486 --> 00:19:58.486
The fact is it erases using heat from friction

344
00:19:58.486 --> 00:20:00.686
when rubbing the rubber on the tail end of the ball pen.

345
00:20:00.686 --> 00:20:05.786
In other words, that ball pen uses ink that is erased when heat is added!

346
00:20:05.786 --> 00:20:09.486
So, no matter which cup Dr. Agasa picks up,

347
00:20:09.486 --> 00:20:11.586
the skull mark of all three cups would've disappeared

348
00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:14.486
from the temperature of the tea!

349
00:20:14.486 --> 00:20:19.486
But all the three cups of tea that remained tasted strange.

350
00:20:19.486 --> 00:20:23.186
Vinegar was inside of all of the teacups to begin with!

351
00:20:23.186 --> 00:20:26.386
He drank it making believe that the tea tasted good.

352
00:20:26.386 --> 00:20:28.086
-What was that about? -What was that about?

353
00:20:28.086 --> 00:20:30.686
But, that means...

354
00:20:30.686 --> 00:20:32.186
He cheated?

355
00:20:32.186 --> 00:20:35.686
All tricks turn out that way once the secret's out.

356
00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:37.686
True, but...

357
00:20:37.686 --> 00:20:39.686
And?

358
00:20:39.686 --> 00:20:42.586
Why did you confirm time and again

359
00:20:42.586 --> 00:20:45.086
whether people were tailing us and called us here?

360
00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:46.586
I don't think you wanted to show us how good you've become

361
00:20:46.586 --> 00:20:49.186
in disguising yourself, did you?

362
00:20:49.186 --> 00:20:50.286
No.

363
00:20:51.586 --> 00:20:55.686
This morning, I got mail from Kir, Rena Mizunashi.

364
00:20:55.686 --> 00:20:56.686
What?

365
00:20:56.686 --> 00:21:01.586
Then it seems that those guys still don't know that you're alive?

366
00:21:01.586 --> 00:21:03.386
No, probably not.

367
00:21:03.386 --> 00:21:05.086
I received text mail

368
00:21:05.086 --> 00:21:07.186
but it consisted only of three letters of the alphabet.

369
00:21:07.186 --> 00:21:08.986
Three letters of the alphabet?

370
00:21:08.986 --> 00:21:10.986
An abbreviation of something?

371
00:21:10.986 --> 00:21:15.686
No. It's the name of a liquor that both of you know very well of.

372
00:21:15.686 --> 00:21:17.286
R. U. M.

373
00:21:17.286 --> 00:21:20.486
RUM. Their code name.

374
00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:23.286
RUM?

375
00:21:23.286 --> 00:21:27.686
When I was at the Organization, I heard that name a few times.

376
00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:30.486
It seems to be the name of a close aide to the boss.

377
00:21:30.486 --> 00:21:31.986
Aide?

378
00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:34.786
But I got no such info.

379
00:21:34.786 --> 00:21:37.686
Judging from the looks of it,

380
00:21:37.686 --> 00:21:41.186
because only the letters were sent over,

381
00:21:41.186 --> 00:21:44.486
it may have been so urgent that she had no time to text you anything.

382
00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:49.786
Go and tell James that the big shot's going to start making a move.

383
00:21:49.786 --> 00:21:52.186
Somebody greater than Gin.

384
00:23:13.586 --> 00:23:17.086
"Mouri Detective Agency"

385
00:23:17.086 --> 00:23:21.586
"Cafe Poirot"

386
00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:24.986
Hello there.

387
00:23:36.686 --> 00:23:37.986
Liar.

388
00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:42.286
Look who's talking.

389
00:23:50.886 --> 00:23:54.986
"Next Episode"

390
00:23:54.986 --> 00:23:57.186
We can't be waiting for the police.

391
00:23:57.186 --> 00:23:59.986
I'll nab the perp and save this person

392
00:23:59.986 --> 00:24:02.686
"Today at sundown, TB will die!" -with initials, "TB"!

393
00:24:02.686 --> 00:24:05.786
Eimi, who's Romeo?

394
00:24:06.886 --> 00:24:10.686
Scram, 'cos you get on my nerves.

395
00:24:10.686 --> 00:24:13.586
The person was the perp, after all!

396
00:24:13.586 --> 00:24:15.286
Wait, Sonoko!

397
00:24:15.286 --> 00:24:20.886
Next Conan, "Welcome to The Weaver's Club"

398
00:24:36.386 --> 00:24:38.686
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:38.686 --> 00:24:40.886
"Initial"

400
00:24:40.886 --> 00:24:43.086
-Shinichi owes me one. -Same here.

401
00:24:43.086 --> 00:24:44.386
It's been a long time since I last saw you,

402
00:24:44.386 --> 00:24:45.786
and yet, how can you be so mean?
