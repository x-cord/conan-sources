1
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.440
Today, everyone encounters a real pinch.

2
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.940
The tent is mistaken for another.

3
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.740
And Ran encounters an unexpected pinch!

4
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.140
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:03.725
"We're going driving, driving."

8
00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:06.125
It's hard to believe it was raining so hard yesterday!

9
00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.525
True, not even a cloud is in sight.

10
00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.625
I guess this is what you call a passing typhoon.

11
00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.325
Did you finish reading it?

12
00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:28.025
It was so interesting I stayed up all night reading it.

13
00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:30.025
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

14
00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.225
"Sleeping Princess in a Pinch"?

15
00:02:32.225 --> 00:02:35.825
Yes. It's a story about many men trying to wake a princess

16
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.625
who has been asleep for many years.

17
00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.625
The one who succeeds in waking her up gets to marry her.

18
00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.625
How romantic.

19
00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:49.125
Well, but she wouldn't be alive if she were sleeping for so many years.

20
00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:52.325
If she gets nutrition through intravenous drip, she'll be fine.

21
00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:55.125
I'll bet she just pretended to be asleep all the while, right?

22
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.625
Because no man of her choice happen to come by.

23
00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.025
Conan, did you read the book?

24
00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:02.925
You're spoiling my dream.

25
00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:12.525
"Time Limit is 15:00"

26
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:24.025
Let's take the best place.

27
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:31.325
Under the tree has been taken.

28
00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:35.325
That's the only place with a shade.

29
00:03:35.325 --> 00:03:37.425
All set.

30
00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:40.525
"Shoji Horikoshi (20)" -Misa, can you get that peg over there for me?

31
00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:42.525
"Misa Tsuneyama (19)" -Huh? Peg...

32
00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:43.525
What?

33
00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:46.025
That little stick to poke into the ground.

34
00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:47.525
That one.

35
00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:51.225
Why don't you say so in the first place?

36
00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:53.325
After all, this is the first time I've come camping.

37
00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:55.125
Sorry, sorry.

38
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.125
Never mind, I'll get it myself.

39
00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:00.025
By the way, why do we have to stay in such a cheap tent.

40
00:04:00.025 --> 00:04:02.625
Couldn't you get something like that? You see, like that!

41
00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.925
There are no such rental tents.

42
00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:08.625
That's why I'm asking you why our tent is a rented one?

43
00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:11.025
Why didn't you go out and buy one?

44
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:14.925
If you're going to bring me to camp, isn't that plain common sense?

45
00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:17.525
Go and buy one right this minute.

46
00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:20.725
She's super unreal, that lady.

47
00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:22.825
You know I can't do that.

48
00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:24.925
Let's go to a pension then!

49
00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:27.325
I don't like this tent.

50
00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:31.225
What? I brought you to camp because I wanted to show you

51
00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:32.525
how enjoyable it would be!

52
00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:34.225
Seems like we've got guests already.

53
00:04:34.225 --> 00:04:36.325
We've got no choice,

54
00:04:36.325 --> 00:04:38.525
so why don't we set it up somewhere around here.

55
00:04:38.525 --> 00:04:41.425
Okay, hurry! Let's go get the rental tents!

56
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.325
All done!

57
00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:56.025
Okay, let's set up the tent for the girls on that side next.

58
00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:58.525
Hey, wait up!

59
00:04:58.525 --> 00:05:00.725
No! I can't take this anymore.

60
00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.625
Don't be like that, Misa.

61
00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.325
I'm really going home.

62
00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:06.325
Misa!

63
00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:11.725
All right, it seems that they're leaving.

64
00:05:11.725 --> 00:05:13.925
How lucky! Hurry, let's go, Conan!

65
00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:16.925
Slave driver.

66
00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:19.825
You really set it up fast this time.

67
00:05:19.825 --> 00:05:23.025
Yes. The second time around is easy.

68
00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:30.225
Don't push yourself. Maybe you should sleep for a while?

69
00:05:30.225 --> 00:05:31.825
I'm fine.

70
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:34.825
I'll stick it out until I finish making the curry,

71
00:05:34.825 --> 00:05:37.425
because I'll bet you're all hungry, right?

72
00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:44.025
Hey, what's going on here?

73
00:05:44.025 --> 00:05:46.325
How come there's a tent standing in our place?

74
00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:48.625
This is our place.

75
00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:54.225
You said you were leaving, didn't you?

76
00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:55.425
Miss.

77
00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:57.925
You did say so, didn't you?

78
00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:00.725
Well, I guess I did.

79
00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:02.125
You changed your mind.

80
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:07.025
Hey, what's this? No joke.

81
00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:08.925
This is our place!

82
00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:11.525
But we already put up our tent.

83
00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:13.825
I just went to exchange the tent

84
00:06:13.825 --> 00:06:15.925
because there was a hole in the one I just got.

85
00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.525
Get on with it and move your tents out of the way!

86
00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:22.125
Okay, let's clear the tent out of the way.

87
00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:27.525
Well, it is a fact that they were here first.

88
00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.925
Okay, so hurry on and get it out of the way.

89
00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:39.725
You can leave it as is.

90
00:06:39.725 --> 00:06:41.725
Huh? What do you think you're saying, Misa?

91
00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:44.825
They're saying they're going to move, you know.

92
00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:46.925
We can set the tent up somewhere around there.

93
00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:49.725
This is the best place there is,

94
00:06:49.725 --> 00:06:51.525
right under this tree!

95
00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:55.225
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:02.625
Darn it!

97
00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:14.225
You should cut it into smaller pieces.

98
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.525
Huh?

99
00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:17.225
When you make curry at home,

100
00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:19.325
you can spend a long time boiling the contents.

101
00:07:19.325 --> 00:07:21.325
But you can't do that here, right?

102
00:07:21.325 --> 00:07:22.925
You seem used to this.

103
00:07:22.925 --> 00:07:24.625
Here let me do it.

104
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.725
I may not look it, but I'm pretty much a homemaker, too.

105
00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.925
Amazing!

106
00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:37.625
What happened to your boyfriend?

107
00:07:38.725 --> 00:07:40.325
Who cares?

108
00:07:40.325 --> 00:07:41.825
Huh?

109
00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:43.025
It's over with us.

110
00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:50.525
Women can sense things like this.

111
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.025
I guess this is it.

112
00:07:56.025 --> 00:07:57.825
Just great.

113
00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:00.325
They sure have everything here.

114
00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:02.625
These recent camping grounds.

115
00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:04.025
Yes.

116
00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:29.525
Oh, I wonder if she already woke up?

117
00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:39.325
Somebody!

118
00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:41.525
Somebody, come quick!

119
00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:46.625
-What seems to be the matter? -Ran was kidnapped!

120
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.025
My God!

121
00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:53.825
-Ran! -Ran!

122
00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.725
Darn it, where did that guy go?

123
00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:59.225
They're not over here!

124
00:08:59.225 --> 00:09:01.425
Darn it! Why'd he take Ran?

125
00:09:12.825 --> 00:09:13.825
Ran!

126
00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:16.825
Conan!

127
00:09:31.725 --> 00:09:34.725
I wonder who he is?

128
00:09:38.025 --> 00:09:40.425
There is a smell of a drug inside.

129
00:09:40.425 --> 00:09:43.125
It seems she was put to sleep with a drug.

130
00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:47.125
The car that fled was reported to be a stolen car,

131
00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:49.525
so I'm sure we'll be able to find it right away.

132
00:09:49.525 --> 00:09:51.725
I sure hope so.

133
00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:55.725
The point is why the culprit kidnapped Ran.

134
00:09:55.725 --> 00:09:59.425
There are so many other people on this camping ground, and yet...

135
00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:01.825
What a thing to say! How irresponsible!

136
00:10:01.825 --> 00:10:04.425
You're the one who said you wanted to stay over at a pension,

137
00:10:04.425 --> 00:10:05.725
so let's hurry up and head over.

138
00:10:05.725 --> 00:10:08.225
A friend of the people we got to know on the camping ground was kidnapped!

139
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:09.525
I can't just leave.

140
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:11.825
Misa, this has nothing to do with us.

141
00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:13.125
Yes, it does.

142
00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.325
He's still breathing!

143
00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:31.925
Is this the sneaker that the man who kidnapped Ran was wearing?

144
00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:33.225
No doubt about it.

145
00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:35.225
It's the same as the one the man was wearing.

146
00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:37.525
Which means that you caught the kidnapper?

147
00:10:37.525 --> 00:10:41.125
A car fell over a cliff near here.

148
00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:44.325
This is the shoe that the driver of the car was wearing.

149
00:10:44.325 --> 00:10:46.825
His unconscious and in the hospital now.

150
00:10:46.825 --> 00:10:48.925
Then, Ran...

151
00:10:48.925 --> 00:10:50.425
Doc, what about Ran?

152
00:10:50.425 --> 00:10:52.725
I don't know about Ran.

153
00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:56.725
The car was a regular sedan and Ran was nowhere in sight.

154
00:10:56.725 --> 00:10:58.725
We found from his driver's license

155
00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.325
that he is Masayuki Takada, age 25.

156
00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:04.325
There seems to have been a half-written mail that hasn't been sent out,

157
00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:07.125
hinting that he had committed the crime left on his cell phone.

158
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.725
The police seem to have concluded that the accident was caused

159
00:11:09.725 --> 00:11:12.825
probably because he was keying in mail while driving.

160
00:11:12.825 --> 00:11:14.525
And, what about that mail?

161
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.425
He seems to have an accomplice.

162
00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:22.225
I guess Takada was the one who carried out the crime for somebody else.

163
00:11:22.225 --> 00:11:25.325
There seems to be another file.

164
00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:27.025
Doc, will you lend it to me?

165
00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:32.325
Sneaker.

166
00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:36.425
This is rubber boots used when fishing.

167
00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:38.525
Why's this thing here?

168
00:11:38.525 --> 00:11:41.625
Ran? No, it's not.

169
00:11:57.325 --> 00:12:00.025
I see! The tent.

170
00:12:00.025 --> 00:12:02.225
It's the tent!

171
00:12:06.547 --> 00:12:08.447
If you insist on going home just like that,

172
00:12:08.447 --> 00:12:10.547
I swear I'll despise you forever.

173
00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:12.847
Go ahead and suit yourself.

174
00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:16.647
I don't intend to stick around with a stuck up like you for life.

175
00:12:17.847 --> 00:12:20.547
I'm nothing more to you than some slave to humor you,

176
00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:22.247
so I'm done with you.

177
00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:27.647
Why didn't you answer the call?

178
00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:29.247
I've tried calling you many times.

179
00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:31.347
You kidnapped the wrong woman.

180
00:12:36.947 --> 00:12:40.247
Masayuki Takada is hospitalized now because of the car accident.

181
00:12:40.247 --> 00:12:43.047
The police called from his cell phone.

182
00:12:43.047 --> 00:12:45.547
Hey! Where's Ran?

183
00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:48.347
I don't know. I don't know.

184
00:12:52.247 --> 00:12:57.647
I asked Takada to get the woman who was in the tent under that tree.

185
00:12:57.647 --> 00:12:59.547
But thanks to a small mistake,

186
00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:02.147
the place was taken by someone else.

187
00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:03.947
I tried to contact him about it,

188
00:13:03.947 --> 00:13:06.347
but Takada had his cell phone turned off.

189
00:13:06.347 --> 00:13:09.047
This picture is pretty blurred.

190
00:13:09.047 --> 00:13:12.247
Depending on how you look at it, it sort of looks like Ran.

191
00:13:12.247 --> 00:13:14.947
What's your connection with Takada?

192
00:13:14.947 --> 00:13:17.447
One morning at a certain station,

193
00:13:17.447 --> 00:13:21.047
I saw the man called Takada, kick a man onto the railroad.

194
00:13:22.447 --> 00:13:25.347
I reflexively followed Takada

195
00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.547
and made sure that I could contact him.

196
00:13:30.247 --> 00:13:33.547
Several days later, when I asked him to kill Misa,

197
00:13:33.547 --> 00:13:35.847
he didn't refuse

198
00:13:35.847 --> 00:13:38.147
because I told him I'd pay him 1,000,000 yen.

199
00:13:38.147 --> 00:13:40.447
Why'd you want to do such a thing to Misa?

200
00:13:40.447 --> 00:13:42.147
She was in the way.

201
00:13:42.147 --> 00:13:45.847
I couldn't live my own way.

202
00:13:45.847 --> 00:13:50.247
She's selfish, extravagant and to top it off, a busy-body.

203
00:13:50.247 --> 00:13:52.747
I just couldn't call it off with her.

204
00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:56.647
I wasn't going waste my life just for her.

205
00:13:56.647 --> 00:13:58.947
That's for Misa to say.

206
00:13:58.947 --> 00:14:01.347
You're the pits.

207
00:14:01.347 --> 00:14:03.647
I don't mind you holding a grudge against me.

208
00:14:03.647 --> 00:14:06.647
But I won't ever forgive you for endanger the life of someone

209
00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:08.047
that has nothing to do with us.

210
00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:09.847
Where is she?

211
00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:12.647
Beats me. She may already be dead.

212
00:14:16.847 --> 00:14:19.647
I know that Ran's alive.

213
00:14:19.647 --> 00:14:21.247
Conan.

214
00:14:22.247 --> 00:14:23.847
At least until 15:00.

215
00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:26.647
Written on the mail that wasn't sent out,

216
00:14:26.647 --> 00:14:29.747
it said, the woman dies at 15:00.

217
00:14:29.747 --> 00:14:31.347
Let's go look for her.

218
00:14:31.347 --> 00:14:33.347
We've only got 30 minutes!

219
00:14:33.347 --> 00:14:34.947
Let's hurry!

220
00:14:37.447 --> 00:14:39.247
Shall we go then?

221
00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:41.147
We'll hear you out at the station.

222
00:14:43.647 --> 00:14:45.647
Why are we looking by the river?

223
00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:47.147
The executor of the crime, Takada,

224
00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:50.247
had long rubber boots used for fishing.

225
00:14:50.247 --> 00:14:52.747
It was approximately 40 minutes from the time

226
00:14:52.747 --> 00:14:54.147
when he kidnapped Ran to when he had the accident.

227
00:14:54.147 --> 00:14:55.947
They couldn't have gone far.

228
00:14:55.947 --> 00:14:57.047
Right.

229
00:14:57.047 --> 00:14:58.947
In the mean time, he changed cars

230
00:14:58.947 --> 00:15:02.047
and wear long rubber boots that went up to his chest.

231
00:15:02.047 --> 00:15:03.347
It has to be somewhere around here.

232
00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.747
20 minutes to go.

233
00:15:07.747 --> 00:15:12.047
If Takada changed cars, Ran is probably left as is.

234
00:15:12.047 --> 00:15:14.747
Let's look for the 4WD!

235
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.347
Okay...

236
00:15:16.347 --> 00:15:17.947
Don't do anything reckless.

237
00:15:17.947 --> 00:15:20.447
Let me know when you find her!

238
00:15:34.347 --> 00:15:37.147
Where on earth are you, Ran?

239
00:15:41.947 --> 00:15:43.847
A dam?

240
00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:45.547
The reservoir lake of the dam.

241
00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.347
Doc, the dam!

242
00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:48.547
Let's search the reservoir of the dam.

243
00:15:49.947 --> 00:15:51.247
All right.

244
00:15:51.247 --> 00:15:53.847
But there isn't enough time so I'll go.

245
00:16:10.647 --> 00:16:13.547
"Drainage Alert"

246
00:16:14.747 --> 00:16:16.847
The water's going to be discharge!

247
00:16:24.247 --> 00:16:27.947
So this was what 15:00 that was written in Takada's mail meant.

248
00:16:27.947 --> 00:16:29.447
I got it.

249
00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.347
It's where the water will be released and the car will sink!

250
00:16:33.747 --> 00:16:36.047
Doc! Doc!

251
00:16:36.047 --> 00:16:37.947
No good, I can't get through.

252
00:16:37.947 --> 00:16:39.647
Look at that!

253
00:16:39.647 --> 00:16:41.847
There's moss on it.

254
00:16:41.847 --> 00:16:44.847
Which means that water level will come to that point.

255
00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:46.847
Even cars will sink.

256
00:16:53.547 --> 00:16:55.047
There it is!

257
00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.647
No joke!

258
00:16:56.647 --> 00:16:57.947
Conan!

259
00:17:00.147 --> 00:17:01.947
You guys stay here!

260
00:17:01.947 --> 00:17:03.447
Stay right there.

261
00:17:16.147 --> 00:17:17.647
Ran. Thank goodness.

262
00:17:20.647 --> 00:17:22.947
No good, it's locked.

263
00:17:25.347 --> 00:17:26.947
Let's try cracking the glass with this.

264
00:17:30.247 --> 00:17:31.747
It's so hard.

265
00:17:39.447 --> 00:17:41.347
Execute periodic water discharge!

266
00:17:41.347 --> 00:17:42.347
Roger!

267
00:17:48.247 --> 00:17:50.447
What's with this siren?

268
00:17:50.447 --> 00:17:52.247
No, don't tell me that...

269
00:18:08.147 --> 00:18:09.547
All right!

270
00:18:10.747 --> 00:18:13.947
Ran, wake up! Get up!

271
00:18:19.247 --> 00:18:20.547
The alarm...

272
00:18:20.547 --> 00:18:22.247
Stopped.

273
00:18:38.847 --> 00:18:40.447
Looks bad, Conan!

274
00:18:40.447 --> 00:18:43.647
It seems like the water level is rising!

275
00:18:43.647 --> 00:18:45.347
Both of you go back.

276
00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:47.047
-But... -Never mind.

277
00:18:47.047 --> 00:18:48.847
Just leave everything to me and go.

278
00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:02.047
Hey, wait up!

279
00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:10.547
Just what do you think you're doing?

280
00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:12.347
This is an authorized personnel only zone!

281
00:19:12.347 --> 00:19:14.547
I'm fully aware of that.

282
00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:18.947
The riverbank. The children are at the riverbank.

283
00:19:18.947 --> 00:19:21.347
Stop the water!

284
00:19:21.347 --> 00:19:22.847
What?

285
00:19:26.347 --> 00:19:27.547
Conan!

286
00:19:32.647 --> 00:19:35.747
I've got only one chance to try and make an escape.

287
00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:53.347
Conan's really in trouble.

288
00:19:53.347 --> 00:19:56.647
It's dangerous here, too. Let's go up the bank!

289
00:20:03.847 --> 00:20:06.947
-Conan! -Conan!

290
00:20:11.447 --> 00:20:12.647
Now!

291
00:20:21.747 --> 00:20:23.847
Genta, catch this!

292
00:20:25.947 --> 00:20:28.147
Okay, leave it to me!

293
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.247
Okay, everybody. Pull!

294
00:20:50.247 --> 00:20:52.047
Okay! Leave it to me.

295
00:20:52.047 --> 00:20:53.047
-Okay! -Okay!

296
00:21:04.347 --> 00:21:07.747
Are all of you all right?

297
00:21:09.747 --> 00:21:11.347
Conan.

298
00:21:11.347 --> 00:21:12.847
-Conan. -Conan.

299
00:21:22.147 --> 00:21:24.247
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:24.247 --> 00:21:26.047
It's all because of me.

301
00:23:16.847 --> 00:23:19.247
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:19.247 --> 00:23:21.547
I guess I really overslept.

303
00:23:21.547 --> 00:23:24.047
I'd like some curry, too.

304
00:23:25.247 --> 00:23:27.147
What's wrong everybody?

305
00:23:27.147 --> 00:23:30.547
Nothing. We're just tired.

306
00:23:30.547 --> 00:23:33.247
Where is Conan?

307
00:23:33.247 --> 00:23:36.347
He's exhausted and asleep in the boy's tent.

308
00:23:36.347 --> 00:23:40.147
He's always like that.

309
00:23:40.147 --> 00:23:42.647
He doesn't think of what happens

310
00:23:42.647 --> 00:23:45.847
after he exhausts himself playing and sacks out.

311
00:23:45.847 --> 00:23:47.947
Oh, well...

312
00:23:47.947 --> 00:23:51.747
Why am I wearing pajamas?

313
00:23:51.747 --> 00:23:54.247
How come? How embarrassing.

314
00:23:57.447 --> 00:23:58.547
Hey.

315
00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:03.147
"Next Episode" -The view has been kept as it was in the Edo period.

316
00:24:08.247 --> 00:24:10.647
You guys are like Momotaro.

317
00:24:11.847 --> 00:24:14.347
This is just like the Momotaro legend!

318
00:24:14.347 --> 00:24:16.447
Let's do it! Let's do it!

319
00:24:16.447 --> 00:24:17.447
Hey, hey.

320
00:24:17.447 --> 00:24:19.047
A peach?

321
00:24:19.047 --> 00:24:20.847
It's a Momotaro's peach!

322
00:24:20.847 --> 00:24:21.947
It can't be!

323
00:24:23.547 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "Peach Boy Mystery Solving Tour (Part 1)"

324
00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.674
Next Conan's Hint:

325
00:24:32.674 --> 00:24:34.674
"Mirrored image"

326
00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:37.074
-In the next episode... -I'll tell only you about it, Conan.

327
00:24:37.074 --> 00:24:38.774
The fact is I...

328
00:24:38.774 --> 00:24:39.478
Huh?
