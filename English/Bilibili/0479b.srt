1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,738
I don't think there's such a contraption in that annex.

2
00:00:00,738 --> 00:00:02,538
You just don't know of it.

3
00:00:02,538 --> 00:00:05,438
I hear that the annex was built 50 years ago.

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,938
Even so,

5
00:00:06,938 --> 00:00:10,038
three days ago the police, and tonight you people,

6
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:11,738
who were called by me, after coming here

7
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:15,738
investigated every nook and cranny, of all four rooms, didn't you?

8
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:16,738
Back then,

9
00:00:16,738 --> 00:00:20,138
no blood nor corpse was found in any of the rooms, right?

10
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:21,938
Yeah, that's right.

11
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,338
Besides,

12
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:26,938
if such an amusement park like building existed 50 years ago,

13
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:32,538
it would've become a famous site around here. Dumb-dumb!

14
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:34,138
Then...

15
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:38,838
There was no dead body so it was just your illusion!

16
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,738
No, there was blood as well as the corpse.

17
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:46,538
Although they were hidden and out of sight.

18
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:50,038
Hidden... where on earth?

19
00:00:50,038 --> 00:00:51,138
Ouch.

20
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:52,838
Conan!

21
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,338
Are you all right?

22
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:00,738
I slipped when I tried to pick up the badge I dropped.

23
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:02,638
You've gotta be careful.

24
00:01:02,638 --> 00:01:04,838
It seems to be quite muddy around here yet

25
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:06,738
from the rain this morning.

26
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:08,638
By the way, do you see my detective badge

27
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,238
somewhere around here?

28
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,838
No, I don't see it.

29
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:15,738
Here's your glasses.

30
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:17,338
Thank you!

31
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,938
There's your badge.

32
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:20,038
Oh, yeah.

33
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,838
But, how strange... it wasn't there a while ago.

34
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:25,238
That's true.

35
00:01:25,238 --> 00:01:29,238
Maybe it's because of the leaf that's stuck on this glasses.

36
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:32,938
See, you can see the badge if it's like this

37
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:35,638
but, if you put the glasses with the leaf on it like this,

38
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,738
you can't see it anymore.

39
00:01:38,738 --> 00:01:41,738
Really. It's mixed up with the leaves on the ground.

40
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:44,238
And it looks like there's no badge there.

41
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:49,438
Hey, maybe the same sort of trick was used?

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:50,638
Could be.

43
00:01:50,638 --> 00:01:52,438
A trick?

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:55,138
Yeah, if this trick is used,

45
00:01:55,138 --> 00:01:57,238
maybe even blood can be hidden.

46
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:59,638
Under the case of the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings

47
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:02,538
that were in the corner of the rooms of the annex.

48
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:05,338
There was nothing below the cases.

49
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:07,338
The tatami below was in view under the case

50
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,038
when I moved the statue too.

51
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,238
So if you cut the tatami

52
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:13,238
and paste the front side of the tatami onto the back of the glass case

53
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:16,838
and if it were placed on top of the tatami where the blood stain is...

54
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:19,238
The blood would be completely covered

55
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:20,738
and it would look as if you're looking at the tatami below

56
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,738
through the glass case, wouldn't it?

57
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:24,338
True.

58
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:27,438
But, the trick would give itself away

59
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,238
as soon as somebody lifts the case up, right?

60
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:30,738
No way.

61
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:33,638
If you lift the glass case with the statue inside it,

62
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:37,638
it may fall and crack the glass,

63
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:38,838
besides if you move the statue that's inside,

64
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:41,738
it looks as if the tatami below is in view through the glass.

65
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,238
Nobody would think of going out of the way

66
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:45,238
to move the case after doing so!

67
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:48,538
I didn't move the case myself either.

68
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:53,438
But, who for what reason would've set up a trick like that?

69
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:58,338
Would the killer do something like that to hide the blood?

70
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:00,638
The ones who set up this trick

71
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,138
were probably the two monks who left this temple two months ago,

72
00:03:04,138 --> 00:03:05,638
in order to hide the liquor stains

73
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:07,338
and burnt remains from their cigarettes.

74
00:03:07,338 --> 00:03:09,238
They probably went out to look for tatami

75
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:11,738
that was very close in color to the one in the annex

76
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:15,238
and pasted it on to the bottom of the glass case of the statue,

77
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:18,938
to hide the stain and remains of burns.

78
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:22,738
Those two were in charge of cleaning the annex,

79
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:24,938
and besides they told you that they succeeded

80
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,538
in pulling the trick, right?

81
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:28,038
Yes.

82
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:29,938
When we checked the annex at sundown,

83
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:32,238
we found nothing like that and yet,

84
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:34,138
when you came and told us you found the corpse

85
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,138
and we went to check,

86
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:38,738
it suddenly appeared, that's the proof.

87
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:40,038
Then, you mean

88
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:43,238
the two monks who left snuck back in here

89
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:46,638
and killed a woman from somewhere?

90
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:50,138
No. The two just set up the trick.

91
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:51,738
The one who used it

92
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:53,138
is the one who saw through their trick

93
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:55,938
and bawled the two out.

94
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:58,138
That is, no one else could've done it

95
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,438
besides head monk Shakuren, right?

96
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:02,138
You mean that Osho did it?

97
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:05,038
You mean he killed the woman?

98
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,438
No.

99
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:09,738
If he killed somebody, he wouldn't have returned to the temple

100
00:04:09,738 --> 00:04:11,238
and sleep like nothing happened

101
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:13,838
till Denkyu found the corpse three days ago.

102
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,438
That woman most probably committed suicide.

103
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:20,238
Osho, who heard from Denkyu that a woman was dead in the annex,

104
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,738
probably came up with the idea on the spur of the moment.

105
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,738
He decided to say that it was Denkyu's illusion

106
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:27,938
and that there was no dead body to begin with!

107
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:29,438
Oh, no...

108
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:33,238
Since the blood of the woman that was smeared on the tatami

109
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:34,938
was in just about the same place

110
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:36,738
as the stains of the liquor and cigarette,

111
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:39,838
he probably used the trick of the case to hide them,

112
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,138
and moved the tatami,

113
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:42,838
which after he place the case over it!

114
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,938
Then, where's that dead body?

115
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:49,038
Probably hidden under the porch of the annex or something,

116
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,838
until the police left.

117
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:53,238
So, the woman I saw tonight

118
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,938
-is the woman from three days ago... -No.

119
00:04:54,938 --> 00:04:57,938
I think that the corpse you saw tonight was probably

120
00:04:57,938 --> 00:05:02,238
Osho dressed in a woman's outfit lying on the floor.

121
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:03,938
Osho?

122
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:08,238
Yeah, using the wig that the other two monks used to wear.

123
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:10,638
He probably used ketchup or something

124
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:13,638
and made it look as if he was stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

125
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:17,638
He did so to make us as well as Denkyu

126
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:22,238
believe that the dead body of the woman was just an illusion.

127
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,038
But, isn't it strange?

128
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:27,138
The statues in the annex were all placed

129
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:29,038
in the corner of the four rooms

130
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,138
on the upper right and lower left corner.

131
00:05:32,138 --> 00:05:34,938
The two monks that set up the trick

132
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:38,738
hid the cigarette burn and liquor stain, that's two places.

133
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,638
Even if the blood from the corpse three days

134
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:42,738
just happened to conveniently be in that position,

135
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:45,538
the corpse that Denkyu saw tonight, covered with blood

136
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:48,138
was lying in the middle of the room.

137
00:05:48,138 --> 00:05:51,438
Which adds up to four blood-stained places.

138
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,038
With only two cases, I don't think

139
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,038
he could've hidden the blood stain that was smeared on today.

140
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:00,038
No, it's not two. There're four cases.

141
00:06:00,138 --> 00:06:02,638
Osho probably copied the two other monks

142
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:05,538
and rigged the remaining two cases in the same way.

143
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:08,038
Therefore, he had four places he could use to hide the stains.

144
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:10,338
So, today he put ketchup that looked to be blood

145
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,638
on a total of four mats-the two mats

146
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,938
that originally had blood stains on them

147
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,238
and two other brand new ones that he acquired,

148
00:06:15,238 --> 00:06:18,638
dressed in a woman's outfit and lay down on the middle of the room.

149
00:06:18,638 --> 00:06:20,938
He waited for Denkyu to come lock the doors.

150
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:22,638
He knew that Denkyu would panic and come get us,

151
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:25,138
so within that time Osho replaced the blood stained tatamis back

152
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:26,638
in the four corners.

153
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:29,238
He then appeared looking as if nothing happened from behind us,

154
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:31,538
who arrived at the annex!

155
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,138
Like I've been trying to say,

156
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,138
if Osho was lying in the middle of the room

157
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:40,138
pretending to be the corpse,

158
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:43,238
the blood-like stain wouldn't be on the corner of the tatami,

159
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:44,938
but elsewhere, right?

160
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,938
If so, wouldn't it be difficult to hide everything right

161
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,938
even if there were to be four cases?

162
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:51,038
Really? Can you really be sure?

163
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:53,738
Oh, I see!

164
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:55,338
All he had to do was switch the tatami

165
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:58,938
so that the blood stained part comes at the corner of the tatami!

166
00:07:00,738 --> 00:07:02,338
But this way, the location of the blood,

167
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,038
although the upper right and lower left is the same,

168
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,238
the remaining two would be to the upper left and lower right.

169
00:07:08,238 --> 00:07:09,438
So, it won't do.

170
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:12,838
Oh, maybe it's this way?

171
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:15,638
This way, the two on the upper right are okay,

172
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:19,238
but two are on the upper left.

173
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:24,538
So, he couldn't have just put the Buddhist statues

174
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:28,538
in the four corners of the rooms to hide the blood stains, could he?

175
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,738
Are you sure those other the only ways you can line them up?

176
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:33,938
Take a look at this.

177
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,138
Huh?

178
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:38,638
It's just like a pinwheel, don't you think?

179
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:44,138
Oh, I see. If you line the tatami up this way...

180
00:07:44,138 --> 00:07:47,638
The blood stains will all come to the upper right.

181
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:50,938
So, the position of the tatamis were changed after all

182
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,838
when I found the corpse tonight!

183
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,338
But, why did Osho go out this far

184
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:58,238
to hide the corpse?

185
00:07:58,238 --> 00:08:01,538
Why did he carry things out as he did when he didn't even kill the woman?

186
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:05,238
Well, why don't we go and ask Osho himself?

187
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:25,203
However, just as I figured,

188
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:27,303
she couldn't tell which monk was her son,

189
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:30,103
and she finally breaks out in tears.

190
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,803
She didn't even realize that

191
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:35,703
the one who brought the album to her was her own son.

192
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:38,203
After I told Denkyu to leave the room,

193
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,303
I couldn't stop myself from scolding her quite firmly.

194
00:09:41,303 --> 00:09:43,303
I told her to spend the night at annex that night and calm herself down.

195
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:44,403
To think of sadness that her son

196
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,103
had experienced for the past 18 years,

197
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:49,603
and to feel the same sadness all the way in her bones.

198
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:53,603
Then, at the break of dawn, that's how she was found.

199
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:57,803
I thought it too ruthless to let Denkyu know of this,

200
00:09:57,803 --> 00:10:01,303
so I carried out what I did.

201
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,903
Shall we go then?

202
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:07,403
You'll take me to the police, won't you?

203
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:08,803
Oh, yes.

204
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:16,603
I know I'm in no position to say something like this.

205
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:19,503
If you still plan on continuing your job as a detective

206
00:10:19,503 --> 00:10:21,103
who corners people with words,

207
00:10:21,103 --> 00:10:23,303
there is something I'd like you to always keep in mind.

208
00:10:24,403 --> 00:10:26,003
Words can be as sharp as blades,

209
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:27,503
if used wrongly,

210
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:30,603
they can turn into lethal weapons.

211
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,303
They must be used with great care taking into the consideration

212
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:35,803
how the listener is feeling.

213
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:39,803
No matter what kind of person your listener may be.

214
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:50,703
Why did Osho hide the corpse?

215
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:53,803
Yeah, hurry and stop keeping us in suspense and tell us!

216
00:10:53,803 --> 00:10:56,003
Heiji! Hey, Heiji...

217
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,203
Shut up!

218
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:59,403
I'm saying I don't want to talk about it, stupid!

219
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:03,703
I have a feeling that in his case,

220
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:07,703
he really doesn't know how to say what he wants to say.

221
00:11:24,203 --> 00:11:28,203
"Mouri Detective Agency"

222
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:40,603
Shoots! I slept for 10 hours!

223
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:42,703
Oh, well, a lot of things happened last night

224
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,203
and we did come home late,

225
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:48,003
and besides today is the Sunday before the start of a holiday.

226
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:51,603
It seems like Heiji and Kazuha went home already too.

227
00:11:51,603 --> 00:11:54,403
I'm going to bed now, because we're leaving early tomorrow.

228
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:58,003
He said so too.

229
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:01,303
But, I wonder if he remembers

230
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,303
my asking him to check on Rena Mizunashi.

231
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,503
Well, I guess I could send him mail later to be sure.

232
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:11,403
Darn, all gone.

233
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:12,803
Here, you can use mine.

234
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:14,103
Oh, thanks.

235
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,203
How come you're still here?

236
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:19,903
I thought you said you were leaving early in the morning?

237
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:21,803
Yeah, I was planning to,

238
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:24,203
but thanks to Pop's snore.

239
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:28,503
I mean it was so loud I couldn't sleep.

240
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:30,403
Thanks to him my schedule's all ruined.

241
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:33,903
Then, shouldn't buy your ticket all over again as soon as possible?

242
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:37,003
No, it's okay, I'm not leaving yet.

243
00:12:37,003 --> 00:12:38,503
Why not?

244
00:12:39,703 --> 00:12:42,203
What? An uninhabited island?

245
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:44,203
You mean, you're going there from now?

246
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:47,303
Yeah, I just happened to be able to view flowers in the meantime.

247
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:49,803
Do you have a case to check out for someone?

248
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:50,903
No.

249
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,803
It's this dopey plan of some TV station.

250
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:55,303
Hey, shut up!

251
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,703
But, is that all right?

252
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,503
Weren't you supposed to leave early in the morning?

253
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:01,803
No, we'll make it in way enough time

254
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:03,803
even if we were to head off there from now.

255
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,803
If so, then why?

256
00:13:05,803 --> 00:13:07,903
I just wanted to go there before everyone else

257
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:10,303
and check out the faces and personalities of the guys

258
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,403
that were invited over there.

259
00:13:12,403 --> 00:13:15,603
That is, what the other high school detectives like me look like.

260
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,503
High school detectives?

261
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,603
Right,

262
00:13:18,603 --> 00:13:21,403
Nichiuri TV's gathering guys from throughout the country

263
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,803
and is going to be deciding who the number one high school detective is.

264
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:29,003
They have a sign that says, "Detective Championship Game."

265
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:03,803
"Blue. Beyond the see" -Detective Championship Game?

266
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:06,803
So, I told him to forget it!

267
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:08,992
Because he'll just end up being called a fool if he goes there.

268
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,176
for people who come along to the uninhabited island?

269
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,176
Oh, well...

270
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:14,476
there's only one old lodge on that island so...

271
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:18,776
the guardians will be spending the night at that hotel,

272
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:20,476
and after the shooting is over,

273
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:23,576
we want all of you to come pick them up.

274
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:26,876
Can I take this kid along with me?

275
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:29,076
He's sort of like my assistant, you see.

276
00:15:29,076 --> 00:15:33,076
Okay, if he's going to be sleeping in your room together.

277
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,276
Gee, what a big ship it is.

278
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,376
How many people is it capable of taking?

279
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,976
Don't tell me that there is one detective

280
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:40,076
from all 47 prefectural and city governments?

281
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:43,576
No, we just called four detectives from the east, west, south and north.

282
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,576
We used this ship only because it stands out

283
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,976
and thought it would make meeting everyone here easier.

284
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,776
-What? -The ship we're boarding is over there.

285
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,076
It's this ship.

286
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:57,376
Come, hurry on board because we're pressed for time.

287
00:15:58,576 --> 00:15:59,976
Hey, Hattori.

288
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:01,076
What?

289
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:04,576
Are you acquainted with that director of Nichiuri TV?

290
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:07,976
No. I met him for the first time today.

291
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:09,876
He told me that he'd be wearing the stadium jumper

292
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:13,076
with the mark of Nichiuri TV so to keep on the look out for him.

293
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:14,576
Heiji!

294
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,076
You're representing the Kansai district

295
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,976
so you're going to get it if you lose!

296
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:21,576
Okay! I'll be sure to leave a message behind

297
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:23,876
that says, "Heiji Hattori was here!"

298
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:28,776
So, after arriving on the island,

299
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,876
please stay in your rooms and don't leave until dinner time.

300
00:16:31,876 --> 00:16:35,776
So, if anything's going to happen, it will be after dinner.

301
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:37,276
But be on your guard,

302
00:16:37,276 --> 00:16:38,876
because the match is already started

303
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:41,776
as soon as you step foot on the island.

304
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:43,076
Okay.

305
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:45,376
Roger.

306
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:47,876
Strange, I figured everyone would be more excited

307
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:51,676
because this is a Detective Championship Game.

308
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:54,976
And why did you bring me along?

309
00:16:54,976 --> 00:16:56,276
Don't tell me that you want me to team with you

310
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,076
so that you can win or something?

311
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:02,576
No, Shinichi Kudo of the east can't come anyway.

312
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:05,676
That's why I figured you should come and join us too.

313
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:09,176
It'll be too boring if I win the game just like that.

314
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:12,076
You're about the only one here that's an equal match for me.

315
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:16,076
But, you even brought Ran and the others over too.

316
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:20,576
I wouldn't come to such a corny game alone myself either.

317
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:29,676
Are you seasick?

318
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:32,576
Oh, no. It's a hang-over.

319
00:17:32,576 --> 00:17:34,476
It took a while to shoot yesterday so...

320
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:37,676
I went out drinking with the staff after we finished, and got wasted.

321
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:42,576
So, you went "overboard".

322
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,976
"Overboard?"

323
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:48,376
Well, the shop was really high priced.

324
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:52,276
Hey, mister, this is in the way, laugh, will you? It's too narrow.

325
00:17:52,276 --> 00:17:54,876
Laugh? A narrow heart.

326
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,676
Oh, you were playing on words using "overboard" and "high."

327
00:18:00,876 --> 00:18:05,476
Those two seem pretty sharp.

328
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:07,576
Detective Championship Game?

329
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:09,376
Nichuri TV?

330
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:13,276
We have no such reservation.

331
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,676
Hey, check it out carefully, will you?

332
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:18,476
Dinner and breakfast are supposed to be included too.

333
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:21,176
-Yes, but... -What?

334
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:22,976
What's going on?

335
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:32,376
Welcome.

336
00:18:32,376 --> 00:18:34,776
I'm the one who will be taking care of you,

337
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,376
my name is Renzo Koya.

338
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:40,276
Nice to meet you all. I'll show you to your lodge.

339
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,676
Hey, director.

340
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:46,076
If the high school detective of the east isn't coming,

341
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:49,476
I'd like to talk something over with you.

342
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:51,476
Huh?

343
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,376
The representative from the east

344
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:56,876
arrived here early this morning and is already at the lodge.

345
00:18:56,876 --> 00:18:59,676
What did you say? Is that true?

346
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:02,676
If I remember correctly, his name was...

347
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:10,376
I see.

348
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:11,376
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -This is indeed

349
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:12,576
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -an isolated island cut off

350
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:15,176
"dinner reservation." -from the outside world.

351
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:20,576
There couldn't be a situation better than this for a mystery.

352
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,976
Saguru Hakuba?

353
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,376
Who is he?
