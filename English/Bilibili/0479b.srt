1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,071
"Orange. Pinwheel Room" -I've figured it out completely!

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,973
"Orange. Pinwheel Room" -You meant that the woman

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,242
that I saw three days ago and the one I saw tonight were...

4
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:11,645
Yeah, not an illusion but genuine dead bodies

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,949
that were ingeniously hidden and made to look as if they disappeared

6
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:17,351
using an unimaginable trick.

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:18,552
Trick?

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,855
What kind of trick was it?

9
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,556
Please tell us, dad!

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:27,661
The hint is this pinwheel! This brought everything to light!

11
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,663
You thought so too, didn't you?

12
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,265
Osaka kid.

13
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:33,767
Yeah.

14
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,969
Why did the corpse disappear

15
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,672
when Denkyu took us to the annex with him and returned?

16
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:41,442
Let's say that this pinwheel is the annex.

17
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,143
There is no railing at the annex

18
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,746
and there are four square 8-mat rooms.

19
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,549
Railing?

20
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,950
Square?

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,853
Oh my, you mean the third-rate detective kid of Osaka

22
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:55,256
can't figure it out yet?

23
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,658
No, I can't make out your deduction.

24
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:03,163
Yes. It rotated 180 degrees, that annex!

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,770
I don't think there's such a contraption in that annex.

26
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,572
You just don't know of it.

27
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,441
I hear that the annex was built 50 years ago.

28
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,943
Even so,

29
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:19,046
three days ago the police, and tonight you people,

30
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,748
who were called by me, after coming here

31
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,752
investigated every nook and cranny, of all four rooms, didn't you?

32
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:25,753
Back then,

33
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,156
no blood nor corpse was found in any of the rooms, right?

34
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,958
Yeah, that's right.

35
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,359
Besides,

36
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,963
if such an amusement park like building existed 50 years ago,

37
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:41,568
it would've become a famous site around here. Dumb-dumb!

38
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,170
Then...

39
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,841
There was no dead body so it was just your illusion!

40
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,744
No, there was blood as well as the corpse.

41
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,549
Although they were hidden and out of sight.

42
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:59,053
Hidden... where on earth?

43
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:00,154
Ouch.

44
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,855
Conan!

45
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,360
Are you all right?

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,763
I slipped when I tried to pick up the badge I dropped.

47
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,665
You've gotta be careful.

48
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:13,867
It seems to be quite muddy around here yet

49
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,769
from the rain this morning.

50
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,671
By the way, do you see my detective badge

51
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,240
somewhere around here?

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,842
No, I don't see it.

53
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,745
Here's your glasses.

54
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,347
Thank you!

55
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:27,948
There's your badge.

56
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,049
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:32,853
But, how strange... it wasn't there a while ago.

58
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,254
That's true.

59
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:38,258
Maybe it's because of the leaf that's stuck on this glasses.

60
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,962
See, you can see the badge if it's like this

61
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,665
but, if you put the glasses with the leaf on it like this,

62
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:47,768
you can't see it anymore.

63
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,771
Really. It's mixed up with the leaves on the ground.

64
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,240
And it looks like there's no badge there.

65
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,445
Hey, maybe the same sort of trick was used?

66
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,646
Could be.

67
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,448
A trick?

68
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:04,151
Yeah, if this trick is used,

69
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:06,253
maybe even blood can be hidden.

70
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:08,655
Under the case of the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings

71
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,558
that were in the corner of the rooms of the annex.

72
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,361
There was nothing below the cases.

73
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,363
The tatami below was in view under the case

74
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,065
when I moved the statue too.

75
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,267
So if you cut the tatami

76
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,269
and paste the front side of the tatami onto the back of the glass case

77
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,873
and if it were placed on top of the tatami where the blood stain is...

78
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,242
The blood would be completely covered

79
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,743
and it would look as if you're looking at the tatami below

80
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,745
through the glass case, wouldn't it?

81
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,347
True.

82
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,450
But, the trick would give itself away

83
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,252
as soon as somebody lifts the case up, right?

84
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,753
No way.

85
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:42,656
If you lift the glass case with the statue inside it,

86
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:46,660
it may fall and crack the glass,

87
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,861
besides if you move the statue that's inside,

88
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,764
it looks as if the tatami below is in view through the glass.

89
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,266
Nobody would think of going out of the way

90
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,268
to move the case after doing so!

91
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:57,571
I didn't move the case myself either.

92
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:02,443
But, who for what reason would've set up a trick like that?

93
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:07,347
Would the killer do something like that to hide the blood?

94
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,650
The ones who set up this trick

95
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,153
were probably the two monks who left this temple two months ago,

96
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,655
in order to hide the liquor stains

97
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,356
and burnt remains from their cigarettes.

98
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,258
They probably went out to look for tatami

99
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,761
that was very close in color to the one in the annex

100
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,264
and pasted it on to the bottom of the glass case of the statue,

101
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,968
to hide the stain and remains of burns.

102
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:31,772
Those two were in charge of cleaning the annex,

103
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,941
and besides they told you that they succeeded

104
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,542
in pulling the trick, right?

105
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:37,044
Yes.

106
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,946
When we checked the annex at sundown,

107
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,248
we found nothing like that and yet,

108
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:43,150
when you came and told us you found the corpse

109
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,152
and we went to check,

110
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,754
it suddenly appeared, that's the proof.

111
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,056
Then, you mean

112
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,259
the two monks who left snuck back in here

113
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,662
and killed a woman from somewhere?

114
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,166
No. The two just set up the trick.

115
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,767
The one who used it

116
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,169
is the one who saw through their trick

117
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,972
and bawled the two out.

118
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,141
That is, no one else could've done it

119
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,443
besides head monk Shakuren, right?

120
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,144
You mean that Osho did it?

121
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,047
You mean he killed the woman?

122
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,449
No.

123
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,752
If he killed somebody, he wouldn't have returned to the temple

124
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,254
and sleep like nothing happened

125
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,856
till Denkyu found the corpse three days ago.

126
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,459
That woman most probably committed suicide.

127
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:29,263
Osho, who heard from Denkyu that a woman was dead in the annex,

128
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:31,765
probably came up with the idea on the spur of the moment.

129
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,767
He decided to say that it was Denkyu's illusion

130
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,970
and that there was no dead body to begin with!

131
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,472
Oh, no...

132
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:42,242
Since the blood of the woman that was smeared on the tatami

133
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,944
was in just about the same place

134
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,746
as the stains of the liquor and cigarette,

135
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,849
he probably used the trick of the case to hide them,

136
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,150
and moved the tatami,

137
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,852
which after he place the case over it!

138
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,955
Then, where's that dead body?

139
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,058
Probably hidden under the porch of the annex or something,

140
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,860
until the police left.

141
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,262
So, the woman I saw tonight

142
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,964
-is the woman from three days ago... -No.

143
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,967
I think that the corpse you saw tonight was probably

144
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:11,271
Osho dressed in a woman's outfit lying on the floor.

145
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,973
Osho?

146
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:17,244
Yeah, using the wig that the other two monks used to wear.

147
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,646
He probably used ketchup or something

148
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,649
and made it look as if he was stabbed in the stomach with a knife.

149
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:26,653
He did so to make us as well as Denkyu

150
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:31,258
believe that the dead body of the woman was just an illusion.

151
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,060
But, isn't it strange?

152
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,163
The statues in the annex were all placed

153
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,065
in the corner of the four rooms

154
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:41,168
on the upper right and lower left corner.

155
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,971
The two monks that set up the trick

156
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,741
hid the cigarette burn and liquor stain, that's two places.

157
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,643
Even if the blood from the corpse three days

158
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,745
just happened to conveniently be in that position,

159
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,548
the corpse that Denkyu saw tonight, covered with blood

160
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:57,150
was lying in the middle of the room.

161
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,454
Which adds up to four blood-stained places.

162
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:02,055
With only two cases, I don't think

163
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:05,058
he could've hidden the blood stain that was smeared on today.

164
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:09,062
No, it's not two. There're four cases.

165
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,665
Osho probably copied the two other monks

166
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,568
and rigged the remaining two cases in the same way.

167
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:17,070
Therefore, he had four places he could use to hide the stains.

168
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,373
So, today he put ketchup that looked to be blood

169
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,642
on a total of four mats-the two mats

170
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,943
that originally had blood stains on them

171
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,244
and two other brand new ones that he acquired,

172
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:27,648
dressed in a woman's outfit and lay down on the middle of the room.

173
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,950
He waited for Denkyu to come lock the doors.

174
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,652
He knew that Denkyu would panic and come get us,

175
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,154
so within that time Osho replaced the blood stained tatamis back

176
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,656
in the four corners.

177
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,258
He then appeared looking as if nothing happened from behind us,

178
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,560
who arrived at the annex!

179
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,165
Like I've been trying to say,

180
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,167
if Osho was lying in the middle of the room

181
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,169
pretending to be the corpse,

182
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,272
the blood-like stain wouldn't be on the corner of the tatami,

183
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,940
but elsewhere, right?

184
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,942
If so, wouldn't it be difficult to hide everything right

185
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,944
even if there were to be four cases?

186
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,047
Really? Can you really be sure?

187
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,749
Oh, I see!

188
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,351
All he had to do was switch the tatami

189
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,954
so that the blood stained part comes at the corner of the tatami!

190
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,358
But this way, the location of the blood,

191
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,061
although the upper right and lower left is the same,

192
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,264
the remaining two would be to the upper left and lower right.

193
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,465
So, it won't do.

194
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,868
Oh, maybe it's this way?

195
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,671
This way, the two on the upper right are okay,

196
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,241
but two are on the upper left.

197
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,547
So, he couldn't have just put the Buddhist statues

198
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:37,551
in the four corners of the rooms to hide the blood stains, could he?

199
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,753
Are you sure those other the only ways you can line them up?

200
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,956
Take a look at this.

201
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,157
Huh?

202
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:47,661
It's just like a pinwheel, don't you think?

203
00:08:49,463 --> 00:08:53,166
Oh, I see. If you line the tatami up this way...

204
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,670
The blood stains will all come to the upper right.

205
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,973
So, the position of the tatamis were changed after all

206
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,843
when I found the corpse tonight!

207
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,345
But, why did Osho go out this far

208
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,247
to hide the corpse?

209
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:10,550
Why did he carry things out as he did when he didn't even kill the woman?

210
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,254
Well, why don't we go and ask Osho himself?

211
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,862
"Black. Monk's confession"

212
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,165
Right, why did Osho do it?

213
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,734
Why did he have to hide the fact

214
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:38,136
despite having to act out the role of the corpse himself?

215
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,537
Because he didn't want the woman

216
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,139
to be identified during investigation?

217
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:43,842
He didn't want anyone to know who or where that woman came from?

218
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:45,544
Who didn't he want to let know?

219
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:03,361
Oh, seeing that you've come back,

220
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,064
I guess I didn't do a complete job at hiding what went on after all.

221
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,365
Of course not!

222
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,733
You could never in a billion years

223
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,836
deceive the eyes of Detective Kogoro Mouri!

224
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:13,338
I'm sorry to say this,

225
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:15,840
but before I explain what went on,

226
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,442
I'd like to have Denkyu leave until I'm done...

227
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:21,146
The monk is already back at the car.

228
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:23,148
We asked him to stay behind with the girls

229
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,650
so they'd feel more assured!

230
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,353
Since you're concerned about that monk,

231
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:30,855
that lady who committed suicide here three days ago is...

232
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:32,958
Yes, it was Denkyu's mother

233
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,362
who put Denkyu into a cardboard box and abandoned him,

234
00:10:37,362 --> 00:10:39,264
leaving him in front of this temple.

235
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,566
Oh, is that so?

236
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:45,937
Yes, she suddenly came here out of the blue

237
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,040
saying that she wanted her son back.

238
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,743
She also added that she had been visiting this temple every year

239
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:54,946
and watched him mature.

240
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,348
Therefore, I thought of

241
00:10:56,348 --> 00:11:01,252
showing her the pictures of all the young monks here at the temple.

242
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:02,354
However, just as I figured,

243
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,456
she couldn't tell which monk was her son,

244
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,258
and she finally breaks out in tears.

245
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,961
She didn't even realize that

246
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,864
the one who brought the album to her was her own son.

247
00:11:12,864 --> 00:11:15,333
After I told Denkyu to leave the room,

248
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,436
I couldn't stop myself from scolding her quite firmly.

249
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:20,438
I told her to spend the night at annex that night and calm herself down.

250
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:21,539
To think of sadness that her son

251
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,241
had experienced for the past 18 years,

252
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:26,745
and to feel the same sadness all the way in her bones.

253
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:30,749
Then, at the break of dawn, that's how she was found.

254
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,953
I thought it too ruthless to let Denkyu know of this,

255
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:38,456
so I carried out what I did.

256
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:42,060
Shall we go then?

257
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,562
You'll take me to the police, won't you?

258
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,964
Oh, yes.

259
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:53,738
I know I'm in no position to say something like this.

260
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:56,641
If you still plan on continuing your job as a detective

261
00:11:56,641 --> 00:11:58,243
who corners people with words,

262
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:00,445
there is something I'd like you to always keep in mind.

263
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,148
Words can be as sharp as blades,

264
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,649
if used wrongly,

265
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,752
they can turn into lethal weapons.

266
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,454
They must be used with great care taking into the consideration

267
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:12,957
how the listener is feeling.

268
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:16,961
No matter what kind of person your listener may be.

269
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:27,839
Why did Osho hide the corpse?

270
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,942
Yeah, hurry and stop keeping us in suspense and tell us!

271
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:33,144
Heiji! Hey, Heiji...

272
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:34,345
Shut up!

273
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:36,548
I'm saying I don't want to talk about it, stupid!

274
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:40,852
I have a feeling that in his case,

275
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:44,856
he really doesn't know how to say what he wants to say.

276
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,343
"Mouri Detective Agency"

277
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:17,756
Shoots! I slept for 10 hours!

278
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,858
Oh, well, a lot of things happened last night

279
00:13:19,858 --> 00:13:22,360
and we did come home late,

280
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,163
and besides today is the Sunday before the start of a holiday.

281
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:28,733
It seems like Heiji and Kazuha went home already too.

282
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:31,536
I'm going to bed now, because we're leaving early tomorrow.

283
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,140
He said so too.

284
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,443
But, I wonder if he remembers

285
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,447
my asking him to check on Rena Mizunashi.

286
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:46,651
Well, I guess I could send him mail later to be sure.

287
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,553
Darn, all gone.

288
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:49,954
Here, you can use mine.

289
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,256
Oh, thanks.

290
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,360
How come you're still here?

291
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,061
I thought you said you were leaving early in the morning?

292
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,963
Yeah, I was planning to,

293
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,366
but thanks to Pop's snore.

294
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,637
I mean it was so loud I couldn't sleep.

295
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,539
Thanks to him my schedule's all ruined.

296
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:11,042
Then, shouldn't buy your ticket all over again as soon as possible?

297
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:14,145
No, it's okay, I'm not leaving yet.

298
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,647
Why not?

299
00:14:16,848 --> 00:14:19,350
What? An uninhabited island?

300
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,352
You mean, you're going there from now?

301
00:14:21,352 --> 00:14:24,455
Yeah, I just happened to be able to view flowers in the meantime.

302
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:26,958
Do you have a case to check out for someone?

303
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,059
No.

304
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:30,962
It's this dopey plan of some TV station.

305
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:32,463
Hey, shut up!

306
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,865
But, is that all right?

307
00:14:33,865 --> 00:14:37,635
Weren't you supposed to leave early in the morning?

308
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,937
No, we'll make it in way enough time

309
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:40,939
even if we were to head off there from now.

310
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,941
If so, then why?

311
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,043
I just wanted to go there before everyone else

312
00:14:45,043 --> 00:14:47,445
and check out the faces and personalities of the guys

313
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,547
that were invited over there.

314
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:52,750
That is, what the other high school detectives like me look like.

315
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,652
High school detectives?

316
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:55,753
Right,

317
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:58,556
Nichiuri TV's gathering guys from throughout the country

318
00:14:58,556 --> 00:15:00,959
and is going to be deciding who the number one high school detective is.

319
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:06,164
They have a sign that says, "Detective Championship Game."

320
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,506
"Blue. Beyond the see" -Detective Championship Game?

321
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:17,509
So, I told him to forget it!

322
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:21,013
Because he'll just end up being called a fool if he goes there.

323
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:24,182
I thought so too, but I couldn't help it!

324
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:26,785
I got a letter asking for me to participate.

325
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:30,789
For Heiji Hattori, to represent the Detective of the West.

326
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:32,691
Huh, the west?

327
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:35,394
Yeah, if I represent the west,

328
00:15:35,394 --> 00:15:37,696
the east would of course be...

329
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,098
Shinichi?

330
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,901
Oh, Ran's crimson red!

331
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:47,306
Well, it's kind of warm today, isn't it? That's why.

332
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:49,808
Don't tell me that detective kid is going to be there.

333
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:51,410
I'm sure he'll be there.

334
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,111
No, he won't.

335
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:56,381
I mean he should know that I'm not, already.

336
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:59,985
How about it? Don't you and Ran also want to come along?

337
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:02,988
They say that there are lodgings for people who come along

338
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:07,893
and that snobbish high school detective Shinichi Kudo

339
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:11,496
just might be there too! Right?

340
00:16:18,503 --> 00:16:20,505
You're late, Hattori.

341
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,107
Be on time, will you?

342
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,610
We're moving along by the minute, you know!

343
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,011
Oh, I'm sorry,

344
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:28,213
I kind of took the wrong road you see.

345
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:30,482
"Hiroo Tsuchio (41)" -Well, let's hurry on to the island!

346
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:33,385
Everyone's already on board the ship too!

347
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:36,388
Is Shinichi already there too?

348
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:40,392
Shinichi Kudo, the high school detective of the east!

349
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:42,494
They couldn't get a hold of him,

350
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:45,297
so they don't know if he's going to be there.

351
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,199
No joke?

352
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,900
Well, I guess so.

353
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,303
I mean, it's only natural...

354
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,105
But, do they really have lodgings

355
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:56,308
for people who come along to the uninhabited island?

356
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:57,309
Oh, well...

357
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,611
there's only one old lodge on that island so...

358
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:03,882
the guardians will be spending the night at that hotel,

359
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:05,584
and after the shooting is over,

360
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:08,687
we want all of you to come pick them up.

361
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,990
Can I take this kid along with me?

362
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,192
He's sort of like my assistant, you see.

363
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:18,196
Okay, if he's going to be sleeping in your room together.

364
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:20,399
Gee, what a big ship it is.

365
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:21,500
How many people is it capable of taking?

366
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,101
Don't tell me that there is one detective

367
00:17:23,101 --> 00:17:25,203
from all 47 prefectural and city governments?

368
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:28,707
No, we just called four detectives from the east, west, south and north.

369
00:17:28,707 --> 00:17:29,708
We used this ship only because it stands out

370
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,110
and thought it would make meeting everyone here easier.

371
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,913
-What? -The ship we're boarding is over there.

372
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,184
It's this ship.

373
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:42,487
Come, hurry on board because we're pressed for time.

374
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,090
Hey, Hattori.

375
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,191
What?

376
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,695
Are you acquainted with that director of Nichiuri TV?

377
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:53,098
No. I met him for the first time today.

378
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:55,000
He told me that he'd be wearing the stadium jumper

379
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,203
with the mark of Nichiuri TV so to keep on the look out for him.

380
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,704
Heiji!

381
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,206
You're representing the Kansai district

382
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,109
so you're going to get it if you lose!

383
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:06,711
Okay! I'll be sure to leave a message behind

384
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,014
that says, "Heiji Hattori was here!"

385
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:13,885
So, after arriving on the island,

386
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,988
please stay in your rooms and don't leave until dinner time.

387
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:20,892
So, if anything's going to happen, it will be after dinner.

388
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,394
But be on your guard,

389
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,995
because the match is already started

390
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:26,898
as soon as you step foot on the island.

391
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,200
Okay.

392
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,502
Roger.

393
00:18:30,502 --> 00:18:33,004
Strange, I figured everyone would be more excited

394
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:36,808
because this is a Detective Championship Game.

395
00:18:36,808 --> 00:18:40,112
And why did you bring me along?

396
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,413
Don't tell me that you want me to team with you

397
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:43,181
so that you can win or something?

398
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:47,686
No, Shinichi Kudo of the east can't come anyway.

399
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,789
That's why I figured you should come and join us too.

400
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:54,292
It'll be too boring if I win the game just like that.

401
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:57,195
You're about the only one here that's an equal match for me.

402
00:18:57,195 --> 00:19:01,199
But, you even brought Ran and the others over too.

403
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:05,704
I wouldn't come to such a corny game alone myself either.

404
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,813
Are you seasick?

405
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:17,682
Oh, no. It's a hang-over.

406
00:19:17,682 --> 00:19:19,584
It took a while to shoot yesterday so...

407
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:22,787
I went out drinking with the staff after we finished, and got wasted.

408
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:27,692
So, you went "overboard".

409
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:29,094
"Overboard?"

410
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:33,498
Well, the shop was really high priced.

411
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:37,402
Hey, mister, this is in the way, laugh, will you? It's too narrow.

412
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:40,005
Laugh? A narrow heart.

413
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:43,809
Oh, you were playing on words using "overboard" and "high."

414
00:19:46,011 --> 00:19:50,582
Those two seem pretty sharp.

415
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:52,684
Detective Championship Game?

416
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:54,486
Nichuri TV?

417
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,390
We have no such reservation.

418
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,792
Hey, check it out carefully, will you?

419
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:03,595
Dinner and breakfast are supposed to be included too.

420
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:06,298
-Yes, but... -What?

421
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,099
What's going on?

422
00:20:16,308 --> 00:20:17,509
Welcome.

423
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,911
I'm the one who will be taking care of you,

424
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,513
my name is Renzo Koya.

425
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:25,383
Nice to meet you all. I'll show you to your lodge.

426
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:27,786
Hey, director.

427
00:20:27,786 --> 00:20:31,189
If the high school detective of the east isn't coming,

428
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,593
I'd like to talk something over with you.

429
00:20:34,593 --> 00:20:36,595
Huh?

430
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:38,496
The representative from the east

431
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:42,000
arrived here early this morning and is already at the lodge.

432
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,803
What did you say? Is that true?

433
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:47,806
If I remember correctly, his name was...

434
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:55,513
I see.

435
00:20:55,513 --> 00:20:56,481
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -This is indeed

436
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:57,682
"Please cancel tomorrow's" -an isolated island cut off

437
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:00,285
"dinner reservation." -from the outside world.

438
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:05,690
There couldn't be a situation better than this for a mystery.

439
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,094
Saguru Hakuba?

440
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:13,498
Who is he?
