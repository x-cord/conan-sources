1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,270
I'm amazed we can see them so clearly.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,470
It was sunny today and the weather's really good.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,570
The humidity's low, so it's a little chilly.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,370
All the conditions for clearly seeing the stars are being met.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,570
Really?

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,270
Conan, you know something about everything.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,070
That's what my teacher told me.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,570
You've got no dreams or sense of romance, kid.

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,570
It's beautiful!

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,570
Watch out, Sonoko!

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,270
So, why are we stargazing?

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,770
The Milky Way refers to the band of stars in the sky,

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,970
but Sonoko thought it was the name of a cafe.

14
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,870
She asked me which of their sweets are best.

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,970
What?

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,970
When she learned it referred to the stars, she said,

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,970
"I'm so embarrassed! We're going stargazing tonight!"

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,670
and dug out her binoculars.

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,670
It seems like she's already bored though.

20
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,170
She's not looking at the sky.

21
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,470
What?

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,170
What is that?

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,670
What's wrong?

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,170
I saw a hand!

25
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,470
Someone's hand was in the flowerbed!

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,370
When the countdown reaches zero,

27
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,770
use your detective skills to produce an answer!

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,270
She coincidentally saw a pale hand and ring.

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,370
High school girl detective Sonoko is fired up.

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,670
His name is Detective Conan!

33
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:45,869
"High School Girl Detective Sonoko Suzuki"

34
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:56,269
I don't see anything.

35
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,369
Calm down.

36
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:59,569
What happened?

37
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,969
Another hand grabbed an arm.

38
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,869
When they let go, it flopped down.

39
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:08,469
That was definitely the hand of a corpse.

40
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:11,669
Which way were you pointing the binoculars?

41
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,869
North.

42
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,069
I found the North Star

43
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:16,269
and was looking directly beneath it.

44
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,469
I'm sure of it.

45
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:21,669
Let's go, high school girl detectives!

46
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,969
Sonoko, that's south.

47
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,369
-That way! -High school girl detectives?

48
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,169
This way is north of the park.

49
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:49,369
This is the place I saw.

50
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,669
They hid the body here.

51
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,869
There's no sign of any body.

52
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:01,069
I'm sure of it. These are the same flowers.

53
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,569
They must've buried it behind the flowerbed.

54
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,069
Who buried what?

55
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:08,269
A body...

56
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:11,669
Who are you?

57
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,069
"Hiroto Sasaki (40), Sasaki Studio Director" -I work here.

58
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,269
Who are you?

59
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,569
I see.

60
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,269
You build mannequins here.

61
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:24,469
Yes. Here, have some coffee.

62
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:26,269
"Rika Minakami (25), Assistant" -Thank you.

63
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:28,469
Sorry for interrupting your work.

64
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:29,469
It's fine.

65
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:33,669
Sorry.

66
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,169
Does this look like the arm you saw?

67
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,469
You must've gotten confused.

68
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,069
That's impossible!

69
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:42,369
But, Sonoko,

70
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:43,769
were you able to tell at a glance

71
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:46,869
if it was a human hand or a doll's?

72
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:54,469
And could you have seen that flowerbed from the top of the slide?

73
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,969
What do you mean?

74
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:02,469
What...

75
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,769
What?

76
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,069
You're right.

77
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,269
I can only see the clock.

78
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,969
Since you can't see it from here,

79
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:13,569
you couldn't see here from there.

80
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:16,369
But I know I saw something.

81
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:19,869
You can see the slide from the roof.

82
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:22,269
Hold on. A flowerbed, right?

83
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:24,269
Is there one on the roof?

84
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:25,969
Not here,

85
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,969
but the same flowerbeds are on the roof

86
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,669
of the Yoshimura building behind ours.

87
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,069
Right, Rika?

88
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:32,769
What? Yes.

89
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:35,669
This property used to be long and narrow,

90
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:38,669
but I split it with my friend, Yoshimura.

91
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,569
The fastest way to his building is to cut through mine.

92
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,669
I'm going to finish that rush order.

93
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,869
Thank you. Sorry for interrupting you in the middle of shopping.

94
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:56,469
We get some willful clients sometimes. It's a hassle.

95
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:59,069
They suddenly called to modify their order.

96
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:01,269
I just had her come back.

97
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,669
His building is three stories, too.

98
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,069
His work means he's good at designing flowerbeds,

99
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:22,069
so I had Yoshimura handle mine, too.

100
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,369
"Yoshimura Reforestation Research Institute" -The same flowerbeds

101
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,569
"Main Entrance" -are on the roof here.

102
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:28,769
Maybe Nanae's not home.

103
00:07:28,769 --> 00:07:31,169
Is this Yoshimura person not here?

104
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:34,969
He's in Hakodate for business.

105
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:39,269
He's repairing the front of this building in the meantime.

106
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:42,069
She's Yoshimura's wife.

107
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,069
The three of us attended college together.

108
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:48,969
She always keeps her phone on her when she goes out.

109
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,669
That's odd.

110
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:52,469
I'm worried.

111
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:53,769
About what?

112
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,169
If what I saw was on the roof,

113
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,469
then the body's buried up there.

114
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,069
That's impossible.

115
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:01,769
The flowerbeds have the same design,

116
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:04,269
but since they're on the roof, the dirt's too shallow.

117
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,269
But I know I saw something!

118
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:11,269
Did you really see the body being buried?

119
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:16,069
No, but that hand definitely didn't belong to a living person.

120
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,069
Excuse me.

121
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,569
Yoshimura?

122
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:19,869
Good timing.

123
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:22,769
There's something I wanted to ask you.

124
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:29,469
Yeah. I tried calling, too.

125
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:30,469
I see.

126
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,769
Got it. I'm going inside.

127
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,469
We have spare keys to each other's buildings.

128
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,869
Yoshimura was worried about his wife.

129
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:43,169
She was supposed to call him now.

130
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:45,569
Does that mean she should be home?

131
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:47,969
Then maybe she really was...

132
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:50,869
You're jinxing it. Cut it out.

133
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:51,869
Right.

134
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:54,469
Nanae.

135
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:04,769
Her car's here.

136
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:16,669
Oh, I forgot.

137
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:19,969
The water pipe under the street out front broke.

138
00:09:19,969 --> 00:09:22,669
Then she can't move her car.

139
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,969
What time did it break?

140
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:28,669
Nanae complained about it over the phone.

141
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,669
Since it was after Rika went shopping,

142
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:34,069
it must've been after 6:30 pm.

143
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,969
She was all right until then.

144
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:41,069
Nanae.

145
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:43,969
Are you home?

146
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:48,969
This is Yoshimura's private living space.

147
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,469
What's this?

148
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:58,869
That's Nanae's phone.

149
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:00,169
The flowerbed's out here.

150
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,669
I can see the slide.

151
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:10,869
This must be the roof I saw.

152
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:18,369
There aren't any signs anyone buried a body.

153
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,369
But there's a spade over there.

154
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:25,369
Someone must've dug up the dirt to bury a body.

155
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,869
It's too shallow to bury a body.

156
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:36,769
Does that mean the culprit took the body somewhere?

157
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,769
You're still going on about that?

158
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,669
They'd transport it using a car.

159
00:10:40,669 --> 00:10:41,969
It's the obvious choice.

160
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:43,769
They couldn't have done that.

161
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,169
The car's blocked in.

162
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:47,269
You're right.

163
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,269
By the time Sonoko looked through her binoculars,

164
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,869
the road was already under construction.

165
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:58,869
Sonoko, what's wrong?

166
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,069
I've got it!

167
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,169
Got what?

168
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:06,569
The body of Yoshimura's wife is still inside the building!

169
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,569
What?

170
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:17,169
The wife was murdered after the director called her.

171
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:19,569
But the killer couldn't use the road.

172
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:23,069
When they failed to bury the body in the flowerbed,

173
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:26,369
how did they dispose of the body?

174
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:29,969
There's one logical conclusion.

175
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,569
The culprit couldn't dispose of it.

176
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:34,069
Seriously?

177
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,669
In other words,

178
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:38,969
the body should still be hidden in this building!

179
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,569
Listen, miss.

180
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:45,869
Was the wife's body hidden there?

181
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:49,369
-What? -Or over there?

182
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:51,769
Hold on, Sonoko.

183
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,369
Or over there?

184
00:11:55,969 --> 00:11:57,969
Anyway, Ran.

185
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:58,969
Yes?

186
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,269
Let's find the body!

187
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:04,869
High school girl detectives, go!

188
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:06,769
Is she okay?

189
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:18,069
You can't hide a person in there, Sonoko.

190
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,169
We didn't find anything.

191
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:30,769
We found something.

192
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:31,869
What?

193
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:33,269
The sleeping bag.

194
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:36,069
We found a man's, but not a woman's.

195
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,069
They put the body in there and hid it.

196
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:39,869
That's enough!

197
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:42,369
We searched everywhere but didn't find anything.

198
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:44,469
She must've left on some urgent business.

199
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:47,569
I don't have anymore time for you.

200
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:50,069
This alleyway will take you out to the street.

201
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,169
Just leave.

202
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:54,469
We're sorry.

203
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,436
I know I saw something...

204
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:17,536
through these.

205
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:20,936
But we didn't find a body anywhere.

206
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:24,736
Besides, even if there was a body, who killed them?

207
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:28,936
Well...

208
00:13:28,936 --> 00:13:31,136
He's suspicious.

209
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:34,236
It's weird how he got so angry and denied that there was a body.

210
00:13:34,236 --> 00:13:36,036
Really weird.

211
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:37,836
You mean Sasaki?

212
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,936
Conan, what do you think?

213
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,136
Conan?

214
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,436
But, Sonoko,

215
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:54,036
did Sasaki have any time to go to the neighboring building?

216
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:57,136
He was alone in his office.

217
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,736
He must've snuck over.

218
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:03,736
If Minakami came down while Sasaki was gone,

219
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:05,636
he would've been discovered immediately.

220
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:09,036
Besides, he knew the dirt on the roof was too shallow.

221
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:10,736
Oh, come on.

222
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:13,436
Then it could be Minakami.

223
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,736
What does that mean?

224
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:19,436
What if on her way back from shopping,

225
00:14:19,436 --> 00:14:23,336
she stopped at the neighboring building and quickly took care of it?

226
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,836
But she was asked to return to the studio by Sasaki.

227
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:30,136
I'm not sure she could do it that quickly.

228
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,036
Then she could've gone back later.

229
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:34,836
Sorry, but no.

230
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:38,136
She was working on the third floor after that.

231
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:41,636
Sasaki would've found her if she came downstairs.

232
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:43,636
I knew it didn't make sense.

233
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:49,736
Maybe the hand you saw belonged to a mannequin and not a person.

234
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,736
I'm starting to think you're right.

235
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:58,836
-Good night. -Good night.

236
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:13,436
The ring...

237
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:20,236
Mannequins don't wear rings.

238
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:23,636
That must've been a human hand.

239
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:29,636
But where did they hide the body?

240
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:33,836
Where?

241
00:15:40,636 --> 00:15:42,136
I'm sorry!

242
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:47,536
What is this?

243
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:51,436
Oh, the sign's backwards.

244
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:52,836
Sorry.

245
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:57,736
Here. Now it's flipped back outside...

246
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:58,836
Backwards?

247
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:00,536
The back!

248
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:03,736
I never searched the back!

249
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,136
Conan?

250
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:15,136
Are you thinking about Sonoko?

251
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:22,036
But like I said, we didn't find a body.

252
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:25,936
Even if Sonoko saw a real body,

253
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:30,736
neither Sasaki nor Minakami could've hidden it.

254
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:33,536
It'd be different story if there were a bridge

255
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:37,436
connecting the two buildings though.

256
00:16:37,436 --> 00:16:38,636
A bridge?

257
00:16:39,736 --> 00:16:43,036
Yeah. I tried calling, too.

258
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,236
I see. Got it.

259
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,736
I know what happened there

260
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,836
and who did it.

261
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:58,836
You'll be in big trouble if the director finds you again.

262
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,036
I'm glad I found you, Minakami.

263
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:05,336
I'm sure I saw a corpse and not a mannequin.

264
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:06,736
What?

265
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:09,436
Ran, remember what you said earlier?

266
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:11,836
It's a different story if there's a bridge.

267
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:14,036
Yeah, but...

268
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:19,036
I saw the shadow of the bridge connecting the two buildings.

269
00:17:21,036 --> 00:17:23,536
The culprit was able to return to the flowerbed

270
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:25,536
and dispose of the body.

271
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:32,136
I took this key without the director's permission,

272
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:33,436
so be quiet.

273
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,336
Thank you, Minakami.

274
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:36,736
You'd better hurry.

275
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:38,036
I will!

276
00:17:38,036 --> 00:17:42,436
After killing the victim Nanae,

277
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,536
the culprit had to return to the Sasaki building.

278
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:51,136
So they built a bridge between the two buildings

279
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,536
so they could return quickly

280
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:57,536
using the scaffolding for the Yoshimura building repairs.

281
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,236
But I didn't see a bridge.

282
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,636
They returned it to the roof

283
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:04,736
of the Yoshimura building when they were finished with it

284
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,136
using some rope.

285
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,436
Then who did it?

286
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:14,736
The culprit is the person who was suddenly asked

287
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:16,636
to return to the Sasaki building.

288
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:19,336
The person who was able to hide the body

289
00:18:19,336 --> 00:18:21,536
by the time we got to the roof of the Yoshimura building,

290
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:25,136
and remove the bridge connecting their roofs.

291
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:27,936
You mean...

292
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:29,236
That's right.

293
00:18:29,236 --> 00:18:33,336
The culprit is Sasaki's assistant,

294
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:35,136
Rika Minakami!

295
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:39,136
The culprit must've been troubled

296
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,136
since they couldn't transport the body by car

297
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:44,936
like they planned because of the water pipe construction.

298
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:47,736
Yes, it was troubling.

299
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:49,536
In their desperation,

300
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:52,636
they remembered the flowerbed on the roof,

301
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:55,336
but the dirt was too shallow.

302
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:56,636
Yes.

303
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:05,236
But why did the culprit grab the body's hand?

304
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:07,236
To remove the ring.

305
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:10,236
It looked really expensive,

306
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:12,436
so they must've wanted it.

307
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:16,236
If the culprit still has the ring on them,

308
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,636
that would be an important piece of evidence.

309
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:23,536
More importantly, where's the body?

310
00:19:23,536 --> 00:19:27,036
A place we forgot to search.

311
00:19:27,036 --> 00:19:30,836
Behind the scaffolding used for repairs.

312
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,836
We can get to the roof through there.

313
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:45,136
Sonoko and Minakami are on the roof.

314
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:46,236
What?

315
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:50,136
The body would be found by morning if they hid it here.

316
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:53,536
No. If the street repairs are finished during the night,

317
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:55,936
they can take the car early tomorrow morning.

318
00:19:55,936 --> 00:19:57,736
I see.

319
00:19:57,736 --> 00:20:00,436
You certainly are a prodigy.

320
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,936
Seems that way.

321
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,836
Prodigiously stupid.

322
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:10,936
I'm not that astute.

323
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:13,536
So was Nanae.

324
00:20:13,536 --> 00:20:16,536
Nanae? Yoshimura's wife?

325
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:17,836
Yes.

326
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:21,436
She didn't realize I'd stolen her husband.

327
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:26,936
Nanae paid to establish her husband's company.

328
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:30,636
Naturally she assumed her husband obeyed her whims.

329
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:34,336
Right? Don't you think she's stupid?

330
00:20:39,036 --> 00:20:40,536
The pipes are in the way.

331
00:20:40,536 --> 00:20:42,136
If only they'd come out a little farther.

332
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:45,736
And then there's Yoshimura.

333
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:48,836
His promises to leave Nanae were all talk.

334
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:52,636
Don't move.

335
00:20:52,636 --> 00:20:55,936
If I miss, it'll hurt even more.

336
00:20:55,936 --> 00:21:00,136
Help me, Ran.

337
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:19,736
Now!

338
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,436
Sonoko, hang in there!

339
00:21:31,436 --> 00:21:32,836
Ran!

340
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:38,336
I don't want to be a detective anymore!

341
00:23:02,436 --> 00:23:04,836
I was negligent.

342
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:07,036
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:10,436
The culprit was unconscious when she was arrested.

344
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:12,436
You can relax now, Sonoko.

345
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:15,636
Here.

346
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:22,536
Anyway, I'm impressed that you figured out who did it.

347
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:27,836
You must be a genius to have figured out that trick.

348
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:37,736
Someday I'd like to build a mannequin of you striking a jaunty pose.

349
00:23:37,736 --> 00:23:42,636
When you do, please name your mannequin

350
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:46,136
"The High School Girl Detective"!

351
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:49,036
We'll be hearing about this for a long time.

352
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,236
Yeah.

353
00:23:50,236 --> 00:23:51,236
Of course.

354
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:58,536
"Next Episode"

355
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,436
"Okita"

356
00:24:07,436 --> 00:24:09,736
What?

357
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:12,336
It's like they were breaking in a new sword.

358
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:13,936
Furthermore,

359
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:17,236
this looks like the work of a rather skilled swordsman.

360
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:19,236
Who are you?

361
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:20,636
Next Conan,

362
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:24,336
"Kendo Tournament of Love and Mystery (Part 1)"

363
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,579
Next Conan's Hint:

364
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,179
"Box cutter"

365
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:30,379
Impressive as always, Sonoko.

366
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,379
Believing what you see is the first step to becoming a detective.

367
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:34,379
Yes.
