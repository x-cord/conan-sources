1
00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:03.324
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03.324 --> 00:00:05.224
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:06.824
A fantastic deduction that astonishes

4
00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.124
monster police officer, younger brother of Yokomizo.

5
00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:09.624
The Youth Detective Squad is all out to get!

6
00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:10.924
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:12.624
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:14.924
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:03.462
We came clam digging along with Dr. Agasa.

10
00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:06.862
We coincidentally run into university students of the Clam Devotees Club

11
00:02:06.862 --> 00:02:09.462
who have come to dig clams and get acquainted.

12
00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:15.062
However, one of them, Mr. Tsuguo Ushigome

13
00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:18.062
dies of cyanide poisoning!

14
00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:20.162
From the circumstances at the scene,

15
00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:23.162
the possibility of suicide is most likely, however...

16
00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:27.262
But, isn't that strange?

17
00:02:27.262 --> 00:02:30.262
There's blood on the rim of the bottle where you drink from

18
00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:32.462
but there's nothing on the cap.

19
00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:35.862
Ushigome hurt his finger.

20
00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:37.162
Hurt?

21
00:02:37.162 --> 00:02:39.662
If so, maybe he cut his finger with a cracked shell or something

22
00:02:39.662 --> 00:02:41.962
when he was digging clams.

23
00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:45.562
I think he was digging clams with thinking of something, so...

24
00:02:46.762 --> 00:02:48.462
I see.

25
00:02:49.262 --> 00:02:52.462
It's true that he has a cut on the index finger of his right hand.

26
00:02:52.462 --> 00:02:55.462
Although the blood looks dry.

27
00:02:55.462 --> 00:02:58.262
In other words, when he first opened the cap,

28
00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:01.962
his wound wasn't closed up yet and the cap was stained with blood.

29
00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:05.362
But, when he brought the bottle here and opened it again,

30
00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:07.362
he noticed the blood on it

31
00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:11.162
so he wiped off the blood first and then opened it again.

32
00:03:19.162 --> 00:03:24.962
"Clam Digging-Sigh (Part 2)"

33
00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:37.462
Genta, please don't eat candy here!

34
00:03:37.462 --> 00:03:38.662
Want a bite?

35
00:03:39.862 --> 00:03:41.262
He opened them all!

36
00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.662
I mean how long are you going to make us wait,

37
00:03:43.662 --> 00:03:45.162
younger brother of Yokomizo?

38
00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:50.462
Yes, Yokomizo.

39
00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:53.562
Oh, hello, and how did the results come out?

40
00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:55.662
I guess they got the results.

41
00:03:57.462 --> 00:03:59.662
-Let's go see! -Okay!

42
00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:02.862
Hey, wait!

43
00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:05.362
Let's see...

44
00:04:05.362 --> 00:04:07.962
Which one...

45
00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:10.462
What should I do?

46
00:04:13.762 --> 00:04:16.462
According to the report by the forensic officer,

47
00:04:16.462 --> 00:04:19.862
the poison that was inside the green tea was cyanide.

48
00:04:19.862 --> 00:04:23.462
Poison was also detected on the cap of the bottle.

49
00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:25.462
Taking into consideration that the contents of the glass bottle

50
00:04:25.462 --> 00:04:28.662
that was found in the car was also cyanide...

51
00:04:28.662 --> 00:04:32.362
it's probably safe to conclude that Mr. Ushigome committed suicide.

52
00:04:32.362 --> 00:04:34.562
Is that so?

53
00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:36.762
By the way, whose car is this?

54
00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:39.062
A rental car that Ushigome rented.

55
00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:43.462
He always drives when we come clam digging.

56
00:04:43.462 --> 00:04:46.062
Which means you come to this beach frequently?

57
00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:48.362
No, this is our first time here.

58
00:04:48.362 --> 00:04:51.662
We were actually planning to come here last week but...

59
00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:53.162
But?

60
00:04:53.162 --> 00:04:55.162
It became inconvenient for us

61
00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:56.662
so we postponed it to this week!

62
00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:59.762
Well, we'll get to the details at the station.

63
00:04:59.762 --> 00:05:04.862
Was blood found on the cap of the bottle?

64
00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:07.962
Yes, although just slightly, there seems to have blood on it,

65
00:05:07.962 --> 00:05:10.462
together with Mr. Ushigome's fingerprints.

66
00:05:10.462 --> 00:05:12.062
Just slightly?

67
00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.862
When he first opened the bottle,

68
00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:18.962
his wound probably didn't touch his wound much.

69
00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:23.962
So! Now that you know, go on home, kids!

70
00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:25.762
Suicide.

71
00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:27.762
Is it really suicide?

72
00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:31.462
It's true that since Mr. Ushigome opened the cap of the bottle of green tea

73
00:05:31.462 --> 00:05:36.662
and started drinking it, nobody touched it.

74
00:05:36.662 --> 00:05:41.662
Mr. Ushigome himself brought the PET bottle here.

75
00:05:41.662 --> 00:05:45.862
So, there was no chance for anyone to put poison in his drink.

76
00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:49.462
But, something bothers me. That person's remark.

77
00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:51.362
Why did that person say that back then?

78
00:05:51.362 --> 00:05:54.662
What's with you? You look funny.

79
00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:58.862
It can't be helped! Both my hands were tied!

80
00:05:58.862 --> 00:06:01.462
Then, why don't you wrapped the chocolate in the foil

81
00:06:01.462 --> 00:06:04.362
and put the snacks together into the bag?

82
00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:08.962
I hate to let go of food that I got a hold of once!

83
00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:18.162
You all had a trash bag, didn't you?

84
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.262
Yeah.

85
00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:21.862
Yes.

86
00:06:21.862 --> 00:06:24.262
You gotta go to the police from here, right?

87
00:06:24.262 --> 00:06:26.362
Would you like me to throw the trash away for you?

88
00:06:26.362 --> 00:06:27.662
Okay.

89
00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:30.662
But there are food and drinks that we ate and drank in the car too,

90
00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:32.762
so there's quite a lot of trash.

91
00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:35.762
These are for recycling PET bottles.

92
00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.562
This is for combustible trash.

93
00:06:37.562 --> 00:06:40.462
And, this is for non-combustible trash.

94
00:06:42.162 --> 00:06:43.162
Thanks, then!

95
00:06:43.162 --> 00:06:45.762
-Yep! -Oh, Conan!

96
00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:49.562
What's all that?

97
00:06:50.662 --> 00:06:54.262
Just what's on your mind, bringing all this trash along with you?

98
00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:00.062
Hey!

99
00:07:05.362 --> 00:07:07.362
They were all separated nicely and yet...

100
00:07:07.362 --> 00:07:08.962
Are you going to make something?

101
00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:12.162
What are you going to make with the PET bottle?

102
00:07:17.162 --> 00:07:20.062
I see. So, that's the story.

103
00:07:20.062 --> 00:07:22.562
My, that grinning triumphant look of yours,

104
00:07:22.562 --> 00:07:24.662
means that you've figured something out, doesn't it?

105
00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:27.862
Yeah. It wasn't suicide!

106
00:07:27.862 --> 00:07:29.062
Really?

107
00:07:29.062 --> 00:07:30.762
Then, who's the culprit?

108
00:07:30.762 --> 00:07:32.262
Before I tell you,

109
00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:35.762
I'd like you guys to help me out with something.

110
00:07:36.262 --> 00:07:38.062
What is it?

111
00:07:38.062 --> 00:07:40.462
A bit of clam digging!

112
00:07:41.262 --> 00:07:44.162
Conan, if you already figured out who the culprit is,

113
00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:47.062
why do we have to dig clams?

114
00:07:47.062 --> 00:07:50.662
Besides, since we're so far away from the edge of the water,

115
00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:53.562
I don't think there are any clams here.

116
00:07:53.562 --> 00:07:58.962
This is the place where the students had their mats out.

117
00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:02.862
Yes. The trash has all been cleared away, much less the clams,

118
00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:04.862
and there's nothing left.

119
00:08:04.862 --> 00:08:08.662
So, what we're looking for are not clams but PET bottle...

120
00:08:13.362 --> 00:08:16.762
I found one! I found the cap of a PET bottle!

121
00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:18.562
Don't touch it, Ayumi!

122
00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:19.762
Okay!

123
00:08:19.762 --> 00:08:22.462
Green tea is written on it, isn't it?

124
00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:24.562
If I remember correctly, the drink that the man named Ushigome

125
00:08:24.562 --> 00:08:27.062
was drinking was green tea, right?

126
00:08:27.062 --> 00:08:30.362
What's more, isn't that blood on the cap?

127
00:08:31.062 --> 00:08:32.262
See.

128
00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:36.462
Although it's blackish, that's probably blood.

129
00:08:36.462 --> 00:08:38.862
Then, don't tell me that the cap is...

130
00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:42.462
Yeah. This will clear everything.

131
00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:49.162
That Mr. Ushigome didn't commit suicide, but was killed.

132
00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:52.862
As well as by who!

133
00:08:52.862 --> 00:08:55.062
Okay, we'll question them at the station

134
00:08:55.062 --> 00:08:57.062
so take the three by police car and...

135
00:08:57.062 --> 00:08:58.762
Hey!

136
00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:01.262
Younger brother!

137
00:09:01.262 --> 00:09:03.262
Please wait!

138
00:09:04.462 --> 00:09:05.862
Wait.

139
00:09:05.862 --> 00:09:09.862
Will you hear me out before you take those three with you?

140
00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:11.162
Hear you out?

141
00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:12.762
We've figured it out.

142
00:09:12.762 --> 00:09:15.062
Figured what out?

143
00:09:15.062 --> 00:09:19.262
The one who killed Mr. Ushigome!

144
00:09:20.562 --> 00:09:25.162
And, that killer is among the three people

145
00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:27.662
who came clam digging with Mr. Ushigome too!

146
00:09:27.662 --> 00:09:29.162
What?

147
00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:45.671
Hey, hey, just what are you getting at?

148
00:09:45.671 --> 00:09:48.571
This is suicide, suicide!

149
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:53.571
Mr. Ushigome came back alone to this car that was parked here.

150
00:09:53.571 --> 00:09:57.871
And, when the three here returned from the beach after cleaning up,

151
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:59.771
he was dead, you know.

152
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:02.671
Moreover, the green tea bottle with the cyanide that poisoned him

153
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:04.771
was found on the ground beside him,

154
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:08.571
and at his feet, the glass bottle that had cyanide inside it was found.

155
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:10.971
Taking into consideration that

156
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:14.571
Mr. Ushigome was drinking the tea without problem,

157
00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:17.271
the only thing thinkable is that

158
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:21.071
he came back here poured the poison into his drink and drank it, right?

159
00:10:21.071 --> 00:10:23.771
But, Mr. Ushigome is not the one

160
00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:26.171
who went to buy the bottle of green tea, right?

161
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:28.171
No.

162
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:31.371
These went to buy it.

163
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:36.071
Ms. Yashima handed the bottle of green tea to him.

164
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:39.471
Mr. Mitsuse threw the rice balls to him.

165
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:41.871
And Ms. Hisatsu just opened the package of snacks

166
00:10:41.871 --> 00:10:44.171
and put it beside him...

167
00:10:44.171 --> 00:10:47.271
After Mr. Ushigome opened the cap of his bottle of green tea,

168
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:50.471
none of the three touched it.

169
00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:52.071
And even after that

170
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:55.971
Mr. Ushigome held the bottle himself right through, isn't that right?

171
00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:59.871
Just when and how could somebody have inserted the poison?

172
00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:02.371
Haven't you forgotten something?

173
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:03.371
Forgotten something?

174
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:08.371
Well, "something" always comes with the PET bottle, doesn't it?

175
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:11.671
Things that come with PET bottles are...

176
00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:17.371
The labels with the product names on them.

177
00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:21.271
Just what are you talking about, younger brother?

178
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:23.371
The cap, the cap of the bottle!

179
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:27.971
If poison is smeared onto the inside of the cap...

180
00:11:27.971 --> 00:11:30.171
All you have to do is switch the cap to one with poison on it,

181
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:33.471
and you don't even have to touch the bottle...

182
00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:35.671
To simply mix the poison into the drink!

183
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:38.071
I see, great deduction...

184
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:40.471
is what I'd like to say.

185
00:11:40.471 --> 00:11:42.671
But, that's not possible, brats.

186
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:47.971
If the bottle was filled to the top with green tea, then, maybe...

187
00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:52.971
But, Mr. Ushigome seems to have removed the cap and gulped tea down!

188
00:11:52.971 --> 00:11:57.271
If so, even if the cap were changed to one with poison on it,

189
00:11:57.271 --> 00:12:01.171
the poison on the closed cap wouldn't have reached the green tea at all.

190
00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:05.871
However, suppose that you apply it on the spiral part inside the cap?

191
00:12:05.871 --> 00:12:09.971
I see! Then the poison will go on to the mouth of the bottle

192
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:11.871
when he puts the cap back on.

193
00:12:11.871 --> 00:12:14.271
Yeah, if so then it's most likely that when he drinks tea,

194
00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:16.271
his mouth would touch that part,

195
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:18.071
but the cyanide in question,

196
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:22.771
fatal enough to kill was detected inside the PET bottle of green tea.

197
00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:25.871
If only the mouth of the bottle had poison on it,

198
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:29.571
then there wouldn't be much poison found in the drink itself!

199
00:12:29.571 --> 00:12:31.771
True.

200
00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:35.371
Well, in order to mix the poison that is on the cap into the drink,

201
00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:37.871
you'd have to turn the bottle upside down

202
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:40.671
and shake it vigorously to mix the poison with the tea.

203
00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:43.771
Did Mr. Ushigome have a habit of doing something like that?

204
00:12:43.771 --> 00:12:46.171
-No. -He did shake the container

205
00:12:46.171 --> 00:12:47.671
if it was tomato juice or something.

206
00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:49.471
Maybe he placed it sideways?

207
00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:51.071
Sideways?

208
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:52.871
If I remember correctly, Mr. Ushigome

209
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:56.071
returned to the car holding two buckets, right?

210
00:12:56.071 --> 00:12:58.771
Yeah, that's right.

211
00:12:58.771 --> 00:13:00.571
-Hey. -Why did Mr. Ushigome

212
00:13:00.571 --> 00:13:02.071
have to take the buckets to the car

213
00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:04.471
all by himself without anybody helping him?

214
00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:08.471
Ushigome was most knowledgeable about clams.

215
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:10.971
He was always in charge of digging clams

216
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:13.671
and making them spit out sand.

217
00:13:13.671 --> 00:13:16.471
We were the ones who did the cooking, though.

218
00:13:16.471 --> 00:13:19.671
-Hey. -Did you always have just two buckets?

219
00:13:19.671 --> 00:13:22.671
Yes, just about always.

220
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:25.171
Who cares about the number of buckets?

221
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.871
Figure out why the bottle was placed sideways!

222
00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:31.171
Well, Mr. Ushigome was holding two buckets

223
00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:34.071
and both his hands were full.

224
00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:35.071
So?

225
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:37.871
If so, he'd either put the bottle in the bucket

226
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:39.371
or hold it under his arm,

227
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:42.971
or have no other choice than to put the bottle sideways...

228
00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:47.571
into the pocket of the parkas that you're all wearing, right?

229
00:13:47.571 --> 00:13:48.771
Now that you mentioned it,

230
00:13:48.771 --> 00:13:53.971
Mr. Ushigome had the bottle placed sideways as you just said.

231
00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:57.571
I see. If he places it sideways,

232
00:13:57.571 --> 00:14:00.171
then when he walks the green tea inside would be shaken

233
00:14:00.171 --> 00:14:02.171
and by the time he gets to the parking lot,

234
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:04.871
the poison that is smeared onto the inside of the cap of the bottle

235
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:07.671
would be sufficiently mixed!

236
00:14:07.671 --> 00:14:09.671
Yeah, that's exactly right.

237
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:11.871
But this worked out

238
00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:16.371
because he just happened to be wearing a parka with a pocket.

239
00:14:16.371 --> 00:14:19.671
I don't think it was a coincident!

240
00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:21.871
The parkas that they are wearing

241
00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:25.671
are parkas that were made exclusively for the Clam Devotees Club.

242
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:27.571
Moreover, it seems to have been made just recently.

243
00:14:27.571 --> 00:14:30.871
So, if everyone decides to wear it when coming to dig for clams today,

244
00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:33.271
I'm sure Mr. Ushigome would have worn it too, don't you?

245
00:14:33.271 --> 00:14:36.871
And if Mr. Ushigome always carried two buckets

246
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:39.571
and returned to the car alone...

247
00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:41.971
It is more or less predictable that

248
00:14:41.971 --> 00:14:45.971
he would put the bottle sideways in the pocket of his parka.

249
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:49.871
It's true that the poison would most likely be mixed if so, but...

250
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:50.871
The question is,

251
00:14:50.871 --> 00:14:54.371
who switched the cap to the one with poison on it, and how.

252
00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:56.271
When you remove the cap,

253
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.871
you usually place it near yourself, don't you?

254
00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:01.771
True.

255
00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:04.871
I think that Mr. Ushigome also put it

256
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:07.671
somewhere on the mat he was sitting on.

257
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:08.671
Which means that

258
00:15:08.671 --> 00:15:15.471
Ms. Yashima only handed the bottle over to him by hand.

259
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:19.071
She couldn't have switched the cap.

260
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:22.871
That means that Mr. Mitsuse couldn't have done it either

261
00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:26.371
because all he did was throw the rice balls to him.

262
00:15:26.671 --> 00:15:30.271
If he were to stretch over and try to switch the cap of the bottle,

263
00:15:30.271 --> 00:15:32.271
it would be obvious...

264
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:36.171
Which means the only one remaining would be the one

265
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.871
who placed the bag of potato chips near Mr. Ushigome.

266
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:40.871
Ms. Hisatsu, it seems that you could've switched the caps

267
00:15:40.871 --> 00:15:43.271
that were on the mat that you were sitting on.

268
00:15:43.271 --> 00:15:45.371
Oh, no.

269
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.871
Hey, just what do you think you're saying?

270
00:15:48.871 --> 00:15:51.371
How could she if all she did was to put down a bag of chips?

271
00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:55.271
The bag of potato chips would've served as a great blinder.

272
00:15:58.571 --> 00:16:03.971
Ms. Hisatsu put the bag of potato chips right beside Mr. Ushigome.

273
00:16:03.971 --> 00:16:07.071
She had the poisoned cap pinched between her fingers beforehand.

274
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:08.871
She hides it with the bag of potato chips and switches the cap.

275
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:11.671
Then, Mr. Ushigome would think that the cap beside him

276
00:16:11.671 --> 00:16:13.471
is the one he put there.

277
00:16:13.471 --> 00:16:18.271
There was blood on the mouth of the PET bottle but none on the cap

278
00:16:18.271 --> 00:16:20.971
because he touched the poisoned cap only after it had been switched

279
00:16:20.971 --> 00:16:23.171
and the cut of his finger had dried up.

280
00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:26.771
Well, even if his cut were to be dried,

281
00:16:26.771 --> 00:16:29.371
blood was also detected from the poisoned cap

282
00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:33.371
because his finger touched the cap each time he opened and closed the cap.

283
00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:35.971
That's what you're getting at, right, kid?

284
00:16:35.971 --> 00:16:37.071
Yep!

285
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:38.871
Right, Doc?

286
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:40.971
Yeah.

287
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:46.171
Which means the cap with Ushigome's blood on it should be somewhere.

288
00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.571
If I remember correctly, you all had trash bags, didn't you?

289
00:16:48.571 --> 00:16:52.071
Oh, well... we handed the bags over to the kid wearing glasses.

290
00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:55.771
Hey, hey, don't tell me you checked the cap?

291
00:16:55.771 --> 00:17:01.971
Yep! Although there were six PET bottles, there were only five caps!

292
00:17:01.971 --> 00:17:05.671
Only the cap for the empty green tea bottle was gone!

293
00:17:05.671 --> 00:17:08.071
So, in other words,

294
00:17:08.071 --> 00:17:10.971
the culprit had a bottle of green tea beforehand,

295
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:13.171
and made Mr. Ushigome drink all the tea in it,

296
00:17:13.171 --> 00:17:15.571
after which she kept the cap.

297
00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:17.671
She inserted poison in the bottle somewhere,

298
00:17:17.671 --> 00:17:21.371
and switched the cap of that bottle to the one with poison on it.

299
00:17:21.371 --> 00:17:23.071
After a while, taking time into consideration,

300
00:17:23.071 --> 00:17:24.971
if she urges everyone to head home,

301
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:29.671
Mr. Ushigome who returns to the car drinks the poisoned green tea.

302
00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:32.871
If the glass bottle that was left on the floor of the car beforehand

303
00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:34.771
is found later by the police,

304
00:17:34.771 --> 00:17:37.371
it would look as if he committed suicide!

305
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:40.971
That glass bottle was most likely one that the killer

306
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:45.571
got hold of from Mr. Ushigome and used, to set the scene for suicide.

307
00:17:45.571 --> 00:17:49.871
But when the cap was switched, her calculations went wrong.

308
00:17:53.171 --> 00:17:56.371
Mr. Ushigome's blood was on the cap.

309
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:59.671
That's why you didn't put it in the trash bag, right?

310
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:00.971
Because if the cap is found,

311
00:18:00.971 --> 00:18:04.871
the fact that you switched the caps would be disclosed.

312
00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:08.371
Well, you probably disposed of the cap somewhere.

313
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:10.271
But, if we check the beach around the area where you were...

314
00:18:10.271 --> 00:18:12.671
We thought so too and searched for it.

315
00:18:13.671 --> 00:18:15.271
See!

316
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:17.471
The blood stained cap of the green tea bottle!

317
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:19.071
Kid!

318
00:18:30.771 --> 00:18:33.271
But is that going to serve as proof?

319
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:34.971
Her fingerprints would already be on the cap

320
00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:37.571
when she bought it at the convenience store!

321
00:18:37.571 --> 00:18:39.771
No... not the fingerprints.

322
00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:43.771
If she touched the cap,

323
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:46.471
it should be detected from Ms. Hisatsu's finger too.

324
00:18:46.471 --> 00:18:49.771
The luminol reaction, that is also the evidence

325
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:52.271
that she touched Mr. Ushigome's blood.

326
00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:53.371
Hey, Shoko!

327
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:55.671
Are you going to stand for him talking about you like that?

328
00:18:55.671 --> 00:18:57.371
Tell him he's wrong!

329
00:18:57.371 --> 00:18:59.671
Tell him to go ahead and investigate if he wants to!

330
00:19:01.071 --> 00:19:03.071
He's not wrong.

331
00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:07.571
What the officer is saying is all true.

332
00:19:07.571 --> 00:19:10.171
-Huh? -Hey, don't tell me that it's about that accident...

333
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:11.371
Accident?

334
00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:14.871
Hey, what accident are you talking about?

335
00:19:14.871 --> 00:19:17.271
Remember, the other day?

336
00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:19.971
There was a hit-and-run accident near here.

337
00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:22.171
Maybe it has something to do with that?

338
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:25.871
They all looked tense when that accident was mentioned.

339
00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:27.571
A hit-and-run accident?

340
00:19:28.671 --> 00:19:31.171
You mean the accident where a drunkard was run over...

341
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.971
Don't tell me that you guys are involved?

342
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:36.171
We didn't know about it until we read the papers the following day!

343
00:19:36.171 --> 00:19:37.971
-Besides... -Hey!

344
00:19:37.971 --> 00:19:40.071
Besides, what?

345
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:45.871
Besides, Ushigome said it felt like he hit somebody

346
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:48.271
so we stopped the car right away and all went to check,

347
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.671
but there was no one there.

348
00:19:49.671 --> 00:19:51.671
-There was. -Huh?

349
00:19:52.671 --> 00:19:54.771
There was someone there, back then.

350
00:19:56.471 --> 00:19:59.271
In the grassy area that I checked.

351
00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:02.171
There was a blood smeared man lying on the ground.

352
00:20:02.171 --> 00:20:04.371
Why didn't you tell us about it?

353
00:20:04.371 --> 00:20:05.571
I couldn't say anything!

354
00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:10.171
Because the man was already dead and Ushigome was drinking too.

355
00:20:10.171 --> 00:20:12.271
If this came out to the light, the job that I finally got

356
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:13.971
would go down the drain too.

357
00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:17.771
Right, as long as Ushigome kept his mouth shut.

358
00:20:17.771 --> 00:20:20.871
If he only didn't say, "I'm going to turn myself in."

359
00:20:22.271 --> 00:20:24.771
Just like clams.

360
00:20:24.771 --> 00:20:27.071
No matter how well you think something is hidden,

361
00:20:27.071 --> 00:20:30.671
the traces of it is somewhere for sure.

362
00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:32.971
The more you try to hide something, the more obvious it becomes,

363
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:35.471
quite difficult to handle.

364
00:20:35.471 --> 00:20:37.171
Even if Mr. Ushigome didn't confess,

365
00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:39.871
we the police would've got to him eventually.

366
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:44.771
We would've found that rotten hole in your heart either way!

367
00:22:25.771 --> 00:22:27.571
We've finally finished cleaning up.

368
00:22:27.571 --> 00:22:30.771
We couldn't leave just like that so...

369
00:22:30.771 --> 00:22:33.571
But, to think that you figured out who the killer was

370
00:22:33.571 --> 00:22:36.871
just by seeing her put the bag of potato chips near the victim.

371
00:22:36.871 --> 00:22:39.471
That's not all!

372
00:22:39.471 --> 00:22:42.871
When blood was found on the mouth of the PET bottle,

373
00:22:42.871 --> 00:22:48.071
she mentioned Mr. Ushigome hurting his finger.

374
00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:50.371
How does that connect?

375
00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:53.871
I knew that Mr. Ushigome had an injured finger.

376
00:22:53.871 --> 00:22:56.971
But if blood is found on the mouth of the bottle,

377
00:22:56.971 --> 00:22:59.271
most people would think that

378
00:22:59.271 --> 00:23:02.471
the person cut his lips or inside his mouth, right?

379
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:07.171
No blood was found on the cap that was on the floor near Mr. Ushigome.

380
00:23:07.171 --> 00:23:09.271
That's how I figured it out!

381
00:23:09.271 --> 00:23:10.971
I thought that Ms. Hisatsu said that

382
00:23:10.971 --> 00:23:15.871
because she saw the blood smeared cap when she switched caps.

383
00:23:19.471 --> 00:23:21.371
Isn't it just like you said, Doc?

384
00:23:21.371 --> 00:23:22.371
Huh?

385
00:23:22.371 --> 00:23:24.871
Yeah, that's right.

386
00:23:24.871 --> 00:23:26.371
Oh, right,

387
00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:29.071
I'll have you come to the station later too,

388
00:23:29.071 --> 00:23:31.471
so bring the brats and...

389
00:23:31.471 --> 00:23:33.771
Where are the others?

390
00:23:33.771 --> 00:23:35.871
Huh? True.

391
00:23:35.871 --> 00:23:40.571
They all went rushing back to the beach a while ago,

392
00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:43.071
saying they lost something important.

393
00:23:44.971 --> 00:23:49.471
It was a Yaiba doll that I've never seen before.

394
00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:52.871
Don't you remember where you dropped it?

395
00:23:52.871 --> 00:23:55.771
If I remember, I'd find it right away!

396
00:23:55.771 --> 00:23:58.271
It was a super rare doll.

397
00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:01.471
We gotta buy whole lot to get a hold of it again, you know.

398
00:24:02.671 --> 00:24:05.971
You guys really like clam digging, don't you?

399
00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:08.571
A code?

400
00:24:09.871 --> 00:24:12.071
In the first part of Speckled (tri-colored) Cat Holmes,

401
00:24:12.071 --> 00:24:14.571
the cat was on someone's shoulder!

402
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:16.471
Which means if a Russian Blue is trained,

403
00:24:16.471 --> 00:24:19.071
it can ride on a shoulder too, right?

404
00:24:24.971 --> 00:24:26.371
See you later, Goro.

405
00:24:26.371 --> 00:24:28.271
Take care of Pops, okay?

406
00:24:30.971 --> 00:24:32.271
Next Conan,

407
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:36.471
"Secret of the Russian Blue"

408
00:24:52.171 --> 00:24:54.371
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:54.371 --> 00:24:56.671
"Girlish writing"

410
00:24:56.671 --> 00:24:59.771
There are no girlish girls on Detective Conan's cast.
