1
00:00:01.658 --> 00:00:05.358
The Black Organization that shrunk my body.

2
00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:07.158
After repeated attempts to grasp a chance

3
00:00:07.158 --> 00:00:09.658
to disclose their identity,

4
00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:12.758
the FBI ends up on my side pursuing the same goal.

5
00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:16.358
"Gin, Shuichi Akai" -Behind the suffocating sink or swim ploys,

6
00:00:16.358 --> 00:00:20.258
"Vermouth" -lies hidden yet another plan.

7
00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:21.858
Rena Mizunashi agrees to go back to the Organization

8
00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:24.758
after getting the FBI to agree to apply the Witness Protection Program

9
00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.958
to her younger brother, Eisuke.

10
00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:32.458
Several days later, we encounter the homicide case

11
00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:35.058
of a president of a foreign talent production office

12
00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:38.058
at the hotel we go to eat a buffet lunch.

13
00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:41.158
But, to our surprise, one of the suspects of this murder

14
00:00:41.158 --> 00:00:43.658
turns out to be FBI agent, Camel.

15
00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:48.058
"James Black, Jodie Starling" -Okay Conan, I'll be right over.

16
00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:50.858
Oh, Jodie.

17
00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:53.458
Huh?

18
00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:54.658
Be careful.

19
00:00:56.558 --> 00:01:00.258
Something just doesn't feel right today.

20
00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:16.758
Sizzling hot suspense.

21
00:01:16.758 --> 00:01:19.258
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

22
00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:21.158
Rena Mizunashi who sneaks back into the Organization

23
00:01:21.158 --> 00:01:23.058
is ordered to get rid of Akai.

24
00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:24.558
He sees through the one and only truth.

25
00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:26.258
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

26
00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:28.258
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

27
00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:06.355
"Red and Black Crash: Innocent"

28
00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:09.455
"Sunouchi Foreign Talent Production"

29
00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:12.455
What the... FBI?

30
00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:15.655
Are you serious?

31
00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:18.955
This man who has the looks of villain is an agent, you say?

32
00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:22.555
"Camel Andre, age 27" -Yes, there's no need to go through a face check

33
00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:25.355
"Camel Andre, age 27" -in order to become a FBI agent, you see.

34
00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:27.755
But, what brings him to Japan?

35
00:03:27.755 --> 00:03:30.855
You know that I'm here in Japan

36
00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.655
because of a mistake I made as an agent of the FBI,

37
00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:33.655
and is quite depressed, don't you?

38
00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:34.855
Yes.

39
00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:37.455
That's why he came to check on me,

40
00:03:37.455 --> 00:03:39.855
because I didn't return for quite some time.

41
00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:45.855
Andre Camel here is actually my boyfriend, you see.

42
00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:47.955
What...

43
00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:50.555
Right, darling?

44
00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:53.555
Right? Darling.

45
00:03:53.555 --> 00:03:55.555
Oh, yes...

46
00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:00.355
Not bad.

47
00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:03.055
And why are you still here in Japan?

48
00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:04.155
Huh?

49
00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:07.855
And, I think your Japanese has gotten better.

50
00:04:07.855 --> 00:04:11.155
Just some time ago you spoke with American accent.

51
00:04:12.655 --> 00:04:16.655
So Andre who's good in Japanese gave me special lessons

52
00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.255
and I improved really fast.

53
00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:21.955
Now, we're both hesitant to leave Japan.

54
00:04:21.955 --> 00:04:23.755
Right, darling?

55
00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:27.355
Yes, absolutely right.

56
00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:29.855
They somehow look quite awkward.

57
00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:31.855
Well, even if he's with the FBI,

58
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.055
the fact that he's a suspect doesn't change.

59
00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:36.955
You'll have to stay here until all doubts are cleared.

60
00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:38.255
Is that understood?

61
00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:40.155
Yes, of course!

62
00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:45.455
Thank you, Conan, for letting me know.

63
00:04:45.455 --> 00:04:47.055
Hey, Jodie.

64
00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:49.555
Before the FBI agents all leave the hospital,

65
00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:52.155
I'd like to go see them one more time.

66
00:04:52.155 --> 00:04:54.555
Okay. Later.

67
00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:55.655
Inspector!

68
00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:57.055
This paper bag was found inside the equipment closet

69
00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:59.055
of the restroom of the top floor restaurant arcade.

70
00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:00.155
What?

71
00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:05.355
The contents include a raincoat, gloves and a gun.

72
00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:07.755
All things that may have been used to commit the murder.

73
00:05:07.755 --> 00:05:11.555
I see, that means even if we check the clothing of the three suspects,

74
00:05:11.555 --> 00:05:13.455
there'll be no gun powder reaction.

75
00:05:13.455 --> 00:05:17.055
Yes, and if the killer disposed of the clothes used during the murder,

76
00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:19.855
he could even get on a crowded elevator if he really wanted to.

77
00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:23.155
Nope, no way.

78
00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:25.055
After committing the murder,

79
00:05:25.055 --> 00:05:29.455
the killer used the stairs to go up to the top floor,

80
00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:31.955
then, put the gloves, clothes and gun into the paper bag

81
00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:34.755
and hid the paper bag into the equipment closet, right?

82
00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:38.355
If so, it would've taken him at least five minutes

83
00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:39.755
to get everything done.

84
00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:43.055
Rushing to do something like that would make him look suspicious.

85
00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:44.855
And I think the killer didn't expect the officers

86
00:05:44.855 --> 00:05:47.855
to arrive here so soon.

87
00:05:47.855 --> 00:05:49.355
True.

88
00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:53.955
Oh, and I checked the images on the surveillance camera of the elevator,

89
00:05:53.955 --> 00:05:55.555
but, there were no foreigners riding the elevator.

90
00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:57.855
What about foreigners of Asian descent?

91
00:05:57.855 --> 00:05:59.555
You can't tell just by outward appearance, can you?

92
00:05:59.555 --> 00:06:01.855
Oh, no, I didn't check that closely.

93
00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:03.455
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -I don't think the president

94
00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:05.855
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -would hire any Asian people.

95
00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:08.055
"Irina Palmer, age 24" -Because he always used to say,

96
00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:10.455
it's only interesting

97
00:06:10.455 --> 00:06:13.555
when somebody who doesn't look like they can speak Japanese speak it.

98
00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:16.055
So, the suspicious ones...

99
00:06:16.055 --> 00:06:19.855
are those two and him, don't you think?

100
00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:22.955
Then, the most suspicious would be the one

101
00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:24.155
who was hiding in the restroom,

102
00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:25.855
"Hal Buckner, age 28" -you, Hal.

103
00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:30.655
I... I just told you that I wasn't hiding.

104
00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:32.455
Besides...

105
00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:34.855
if I hid something like that in the restroom,

106
00:06:34.855 --> 00:06:37.655
I wouldn't stick around so long in there.

107
00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:38.955
That's true too.

108
00:06:38.955 --> 00:06:41.255
But maybe you saw all the officers

109
00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.355
and decided to go back and hide.

110
00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:44.955
That's possible too, isn't it?

111
00:06:44.955 --> 00:06:46.255
Oh, by the way,

112
00:06:46.255 --> 00:06:49.255
the coat was a men's coat for someone of slim physique

113
00:06:49.255 --> 00:06:52.355
and the length would be just right for Toby over there.

114
00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:53.655
"Toby Keynes, age 27" -Hey...

115
00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:55.055
if it's that size,

116
00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:57.255
I'm sure that guy who says he's a FBI agent can wear it too

117
00:06:57.255 --> 00:06:59.555
if he forces it on, right?

118
00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:03.055
Moreover, it's not like it has to be limited to us, men.

119
00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.955
Even the secretary over there can wear it.

120
00:07:04.955 --> 00:07:06.655
What?

121
00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:10.755
Like they say, the greater embraces the less.

122
00:07:10.755 --> 00:07:14.755
It's true that if all her testimony up to now were all lies

123
00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:16.355
to cover up her own crime.

124
00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:18.655
Yes, it's probable.

125
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:20.855
In order to make it look like a crime committed by a man,

126
00:07:20.855 --> 00:07:24.255
she could've deliberately worn a man's coat.

127
00:07:24.255 --> 00:07:26.555
Oh no! I would never do that!

128
00:07:28.055 --> 00:07:31.255
At any rate, it's pretty obvious

129
00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:35.155
that one of you four here fired repeated shots at the president.

130
00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:38.755
Maybe the president was actually eating something.

131
00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:40.055
Huh?

132
00:07:40.055 --> 00:07:42.855
Because look at the president's right hand.

133
00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:47.055
Doesn't it look like he was picking something up?

134
00:07:48.855 --> 00:07:50.855
Now that you mentioned it, yeah.

135
00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:54.155
But there's no food on the desk.

136
00:07:54.155 --> 00:07:58.955
Maybe he wasn't eating but holding something.

137
00:07:58.955 --> 00:08:01.655
Right. For example...

138
00:08:03.055 --> 00:08:04.755
A pen or something that was on the desk.

139
00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:08.655
Although very slight, there were blood stains

140
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.755
detected on the tip of the pen and the memo pad.

141
00:08:10.755 --> 00:08:12.555
And on the memo pad, there were very light traces

142
00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:15.155
of something having been written.

143
00:08:15.155 --> 00:08:16.255
Don't tell me that...

144
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:18.355
the president wrote something just before he died.

145
00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:22.955
And the killer...

146
00:08:22.955 --> 00:08:25.055
If so, please get on with the blood test,

147
00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:26.755
and figure out what was written on the memo pad.

148
00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:28.355
Oh, yes.

149
00:08:28.355 --> 00:08:29.455
Of course, at the same time,

150
00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:31.055
analyze whether it was the president's handwriting.

151
00:08:31.055 --> 00:08:32.855
Yes, okay.

152
00:08:32.855 --> 00:08:36.455
I mean, if it were us, we would check for sure.

153
00:08:36.455 --> 00:08:37.655
Right, darling?

154
00:08:44.355 --> 00:08:46.655
So, the blood that was found on the memo pad

155
00:08:46.655 --> 00:08:48.555
was Mr. Sunouchi's blood after all.

156
00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:52.655
Yes, the handwriting was confirmed to be his writing too.

157
00:08:52.655 --> 00:08:54.755
And, what was written on the memo?

158
00:08:54.755 --> 00:08:59.255
Well... it was written in English.

159
00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:00.555
As to the meaning of what was written,

160
00:09:00.555 --> 00:09:02.355
it couldn't have been a dying message.

161
00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:04.155
Bring my tux.

162
00:09:05.455 --> 00:09:07.555
Bring...

163
00:09:07.555 --> 00:09:11.055
Bring my tux.

164
00:09:11.055 --> 00:09:13.455
Please bring...

165
00:09:13.455 --> 00:09:15.555
my tuxedo?

166
00:09:25.855 --> 00:09:27.655
Yes.

167
00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:31.755
Continuing this job is too nerve racking.

168
00:09:31.755 --> 00:09:33.955
Yes, it's too painful,

169
00:09:33.955 --> 00:09:36.355
and I can't go on, so I'd like out.

170
00:09:36.355 --> 00:09:39.955
Yes, I'm very sorry.

171
00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:41.555
Goodbye.

172
00:09:51.455 --> 00:09:53.155
Gin.

173
00:09:56.255 --> 00:09:58.055
Kir.

174
00:09:58.055 --> 00:09:59.855
Who were you talking to?

175
00:09:59.855 --> 00:10:01.555
On the other end of the line.

176
00:10:02.655 --> 00:10:04.055
Come on.

177
00:10:04.055 --> 00:10:06.355
To the personnel at the TV station.

178
00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:07.855
I told them straight

179
00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:10.855
that I can't go on as an announcer anymore,

180
00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.555
so that I'd like to quit.

181
00:10:12.555 --> 00:10:15.655
I didn't want them coming to look for me either.

182
00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:19.155
Besides I know that the Organization knows what I was talking about

183
00:10:19.155 --> 00:10:21.455
because everything leaks out.

184
00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:25.055
I've got a lot of wiretaps and communicators attached to me

185
00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:29.055
with two or three people constantly monitoring me.

186
00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:35.755
So do you have something you want

187
00:10:35.755 --> 00:10:37.955
with this poor can't roam free girl

188
00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:40.055
who is still being suspected by that person.

189
00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:43.655
I've come to relay a message

190
00:10:43.655 --> 00:10:45.355
from that person who highly suspects you.

191
00:10:57.855 --> 00:11:00.255
Kill a person for me

192
00:11:00.255 --> 00:11:03.655
and let me believe that you're innocent.

193
00:11:03.655 --> 00:11:05.255
It says?

194
00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:07.855
Kill?

195
00:11:07.855 --> 00:11:10.455
Who?

196
00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:14.455
FBI agent, Shuichi Akai.

197
00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:22.255
Shuichi Akai.

198
00:11:41.408 --> 00:11:44.808
FBI agent, Akai.

199
00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:49.808
I am too, but that person has his doubts too.

200
00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:53.808
That we so easily got you back from the hands of the FBI.

201
00:11:56.908 --> 00:12:01.508
I am to relay to you that if you want to prove your innocence,

202
00:12:01.508 --> 00:12:04.008
send the trump of the FBI, Shuichi Akai to the world beyond

203
00:12:04.008 --> 00:12:06.708
with your own hands.

204
00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:08.608
What's up, Kir?

205
00:12:08.608 --> 00:12:12.108
Don't tell me that you can't do it for some reason?

206
00:12:13.708 --> 00:12:15.408
There's no reason or anything.

207
00:12:15.408 --> 00:12:19.208
Gin, even you're having it tough with Akai,

208
00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:21.208
just how do you propose I do it?

209
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:24.108
If I go out there near the FBI,

210
00:12:24.108 --> 00:12:25.808
I'll get caught again, you know.

211
00:12:27.308 --> 00:12:29.308
You're not going near them.

212
00:12:29.308 --> 00:12:32.408
You're going to lure him into our shooting range.

213
00:12:34.908 --> 00:12:37.108
Give him a sob story like you went back to the Organization,

214
00:12:37.108 --> 00:12:38.208
but you're being treated badly

215
00:12:38.208 --> 00:12:41.608
because you goofed and got caught by the FBI.

216
00:12:41.608 --> 00:12:44.208
You feel out of place at the Organization so you want out

217
00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:47.108
and you want him to help you get away and go abroad.

218
00:12:47.108 --> 00:12:49.508
That'll probably be good enough.

219
00:12:49.508 --> 00:12:52.508
Of course you're asking him to come alone.

220
00:12:52.508 --> 00:12:55.708
He'll come for sure if you tell him

221
00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:58.208
that you'll give him info.

222
00:12:58.208 --> 00:12:59.308
I see.

223
00:12:59.308 --> 00:13:01.908
And when he comes along,

224
00:13:01.908 --> 00:13:03.208
you're all going to shoot bullets

225
00:13:03.208 --> 00:13:05.008
and make a beehive out of him?

226
00:13:05.008 --> 00:13:08.208
No, you're sending him off alone.

227
00:13:08.208 --> 00:13:09.808
Huh?

228
00:13:09.808 --> 00:13:12.908
He has a sharp nose that is second to none.

229
00:13:12.908 --> 00:13:15.808
If he senses our presence,

230
00:13:15.808 --> 00:13:18.908
he'll figure that it's a trap and turn right around.

231
00:13:18.908 --> 00:13:21.608
We're going to be watching everything

232
00:13:21.608 --> 00:13:24.408
from a place where his bullets can't reach us.

233
00:13:24.408 --> 00:13:26.708
With the wiretap and camera

234
00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:29.708
that will be set onto you.

235
00:13:29.708 --> 00:13:31.208
Okay.

236
00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:32.608
I'll do as you say,

237
00:13:32.608 --> 00:13:34.208
so give me a little time, okay?

238
00:13:34.208 --> 00:13:35.408
No.

239
00:13:35.408 --> 00:13:38.408
Now, call him out here right now.

240
00:13:41.408 --> 00:13:42.808
If you can't do it,

241
00:13:42.808 --> 00:13:45.208
all I'll do is call Death to come get you.

242
00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:49.308
Wait, I hope you don't think that

243
00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:53.108
the FBI really talked me into siding with them?

244
00:13:53.108 --> 00:13:54.708
A little of that too,

245
00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:56.908
but according to info that we got from one of our men,

246
00:13:56.908 --> 00:13:59.508
those guys are still at the hospital you were at.

247
00:13:59.508 --> 00:14:01.108
And for some reason,

248
00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:03.908
one of the agents got messed up in an incident,

249
00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:06.808
and the eyes of the FBI are turned in that direction.

250
00:14:06.808 --> 00:14:10.008
We couldn't possibly let this chance slip right by us.

251
00:14:10.008 --> 00:14:11.108
What incident?

252
00:14:11.108 --> 00:14:15.808
Yeah, a president of a company

253
00:14:15.808 --> 00:14:18.008
somewhere got his body ventilated with air holes.

254
00:14:18.008 --> 00:14:19.008
Just an ordinary murder case.

255
00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:28.908
Bring my tuxedo to me, please?

256
00:14:28.908 --> 00:14:30.608
You mean that's what was written

257
00:14:30.608 --> 00:14:32.608
on the memo that president wrote?

258
00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:34.108
Yes.

259
00:14:34.108 --> 00:14:35.908
Bring my tux.

260
00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:40.908
Bring tux is short for tuxedo.

261
00:14:40.908 --> 00:14:43.308
How baffling.

262
00:14:43.308 --> 00:14:46.608
There are blood stains on the pen and memo paper.

263
00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:48.408
The handwriting is the president's.

264
00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:51.308
Moreover, the memo itself is torn off.

265
00:14:51.308 --> 00:14:52.608
Which means...

266
00:14:52.608 --> 00:14:54.608
The president who was shot wrote this down

267
00:14:54.608 --> 00:14:56.308
just before he died.

268
00:14:56.308 --> 00:14:57.908
The killer who notice it,

269
00:14:57.908 --> 00:14:59.208
tore it off and took it away with him.

270
00:15:02.608 --> 00:15:05.108
I can see it to be none other than a dying message though.

271
00:15:05.108 --> 00:15:06.508
No...

272
00:15:06.508 --> 00:15:08.208
Dying message...

273
00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:12.908
Oh right, you're both English teachers, aren't you?

274
00:15:12.908 --> 00:15:17.208
It's true that I'm teaching English at a prep school,

275
00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:20.508
but aren't these people FBI agents?

276
00:15:20.508 --> 00:15:22.908
Oh, right, I had my reasons,

277
00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:26.208
and was working as a teacher for a little while.

278
00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:28.008
Right, darling?

279
00:15:28.008 --> 00:15:30.608
Yes, that's right.

280
00:15:30.608 --> 00:15:32.908
By the way, Irina,

281
00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:35.408
do you have any idea

282
00:15:35.408 --> 00:15:36.908
as to what this bring me my tuxedo please means?

283
00:15:36.908 --> 00:15:39.008
Oh, yes.

284
00:15:39.008 --> 00:15:44.108
I'm pretty sure that the president addressed that message to me.

285
00:15:44.108 --> 00:15:45.908
There's going to be a party tonight,

286
00:15:45.908 --> 00:15:49.808
so I think he wanted me to get his tuxedo ready for him by then.

287
00:15:49.808 --> 00:15:50.808
What?

288
00:15:50.808 --> 00:15:53.908
Then, you're saying that this was just a plain message,

289
00:15:53.908 --> 00:15:55.508
not connected with the incident at all?

290
00:15:55.508 --> 00:15:57.508
Yes.

291
00:15:57.508 --> 00:15:59.308
Because the president said that he was going to have a meal together

292
00:15:59.308 --> 00:16:03.008
with a new talent this afternoon.

293
00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:05.008
He left the message so that I would know about it

294
00:16:05.008 --> 00:16:06.408
when I returned from outside.

295
00:16:06.408 --> 00:16:09.608
Which means that you're the one who tore this memo off

296
00:16:09.608 --> 00:16:10.708
and took it with you?

297
00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:12.508
No!

298
00:16:12.508 --> 00:16:16.208
I found the president dead, so I called 110.

299
00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:19.908
I didn't touch anything until the police got here!

300
00:16:19.908 --> 00:16:22.708
But, I knew about the tuxedo,

301
00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:25.008
so I left a message in the voice mail.

302
00:16:25.008 --> 00:16:26.808
Voice mail?

303
00:16:26.808 --> 00:16:29.908
So, this is it?

304
00:16:31.308 --> 00:16:32.608
This is Palmer.

305
00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:35.208
President, have you gone out already?

306
00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:37.708
I found the file that you asked me to look for,

307
00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:39.308
so I'll take it over to you.

308
00:16:39.308 --> 00:16:41.708
Oh, and as to the tuxedo you're wearing to tonight's party,

309
00:16:41.708 --> 00:16:42.808
I'll get to it later.

310
00:16:44.108 --> 00:16:47.708
It is 1.27pm, Friday.

311
00:16:47.708 --> 00:16:48.908
True.

312
00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:53.708
Maybe the killer heard this and rushed out of here.

313
00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:56.608
Or, in order to make it look that way,

314
00:16:56.608 --> 00:16:58.008
maybe she switched the phone to voice mail deliberately

315
00:16:58.008 --> 00:16:59.408
after committing the murder.

316
00:16:59.408 --> 00:17:01.708
What? Oh, no!

317
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:03.408
It's a possibility.

318
00:17:03.408 --> 00:17:07.408
If there's a hidden meaning to bring my tux...

319
00:17:08.308 --> 00:17:09.708
In order to deceive us,

320
00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:12.308
maybe you deliberately recorded your message mentioning the tuxedo.

321
00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:14.808
Oh, how cruel.

322
00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:15.808
But...

323
00:17:15.808 --> 00:17:19.008
When you say tuxedo, it seems connected with...

324
00:17:19.008 --> 00:17:22.608
that man who is working as a model, right?

325
00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.808
Huh? Hey, wait up.

326
00:17:25.808 --> 00:17:27.908
It's true that the job of a model

327
00:17:27.908 --> 00:17:30.608
is to wear all kinds of clothes in a cool way.

328
00:17:30.608 --> 00:17:32.408
But we don't just wear tuxedos, you know.

329
00:17:32.408 --> 00:17:35.808
The president was trying to wear it too.

330
00:17:36.808 --> 00:17:39.808
Well... we'll do the investigating,

331
00:17:39.808 --> 00:17:41.408
so please wait in a different room, everyone.

332
00:17:45.408 --> 00:17:48.208
Shinichi, did you figure out something from that memo?

333
00:17:50.608 --> 00:17:54.708
Maybe he added something on to the memo that was already there

334
00:17:54.708 --> 00:17:56.708
and turned it into a dying message?

335
00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:59.108
If so, the forensic officers would've noticed

336
00:17:59.108 --> 00:18:02.108
the words that were added on.

337
00:18:02.108 --> 00:18:04.908
Adding or subtracting something to this English statement

338
00:18:04.908 --> 00:18:07.008
doesn't look as if it would indicate something

339
00:18:07.008 --> 00:18:09.808
other than it already looks to be.

340
00:18:09.808 --> 00:18:13.408
I wonder if it's appropriate to ask at a time like this,

341
00:18:13.408 --> 00:18:16.508
but what happened two years ago?

342
00:18:16.508 --> 00:18:19.108
You mentioned just the other day too,

343
00:18:19.108 --> 00:18:22.708
that you came to Japan two years ago.

344
00:18:22.708 --> 00:18:25.808
Two years ago is when Shuichi was still at the Organization

345
00:18:25.808 --> 00:18:27.908
doing undercover investigation, right?

346
00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:32.208
Then, I'm sure you've heard about the agent who goofed,

347
00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:34.508
and that resulted failure to capture an executive member of theirs.

348
00:18:34.508 --> 00:18:38.808
The agent who goofed back then was me.

349
00:18:38.808 --> 00:18:42.108
Yes, it was two years ago.

350
00:18:42.108 --> 00:18:44.908
We staked out at the warehouse

351
00:18:44.908 --> 00:18:46.808
where Mr. Akai had made an appointment.

352
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:54.808
An elderly man appeared and sat down on the spot.

353
00:18:54.808 --> 00:18:57.208
Mr. Akai ignored the man,

354
00:18:57.208 --> 00:19:00.808
but I carelessly called out to him

355
00:19:00.808 --> 00:19:04.608
and said it's dangerous here so leave.

356
00:19:04.608 --> 00:19:06.008
I see,

357
00:19:06.008 --> 00:19:07.808
so that old man was also a member of the Organization

358
00:19:07.808 --> 00:19:10.908
that was supposed to be there?

359
00:19:10.908 --> 00:19:11.908
Yes.

360
00:19:11.908 --> 00:19:14.408
On top of that the executive never showed up

361
00:19:14.408 --> 00:19:17.308
and the fact that Mr. Akai was a FBI agent was also disclosed.

362
00:19:21.408 --> 00:19:23.808
Oh, I remember.

363
00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:25.608
There was a person with his head drooping low

364
00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:28.108
among the members who came back to headquarters

365
00:19:28.108 --> 00:19:30.308
after sneaking into the Organization failed.

366
00:19:30.308 --> 00:19:32.708
That's why when Mr. Akai requested someone cut out

367
00:19:32.708 --> 00:19:35.208
for the next strategy...

368
00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:38.708
I can handle the driving job!

369
00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:40.908
I'll come to Japan right away!

370
00:19:40.908 --> 00:19:43.708
I was told that I maybe killed.

371
00:19:43.708 --> 00:19:49.908
But, my mistake was what caused the death of Mr. Akai's girlfriend.

372
00:19:49.908 --> 00:19:55.008
Mr. Akai told me not to worry about it,

373
00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:57.408
because his girlfriend was also ready for what was to come.

374
00:20:02.608 --> 00:20:05.508
A FBI agent?

375
00:20:05.508 --> 00:20:06.908
You, Dai?

376
00:20:06.908 --> 00:20:10.308
Yeah. I'll be leaving to settle things tomorrow.

377
00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:14.008
Don't be ridiculous.

378
00:20:14.008 --> 00:20:16.108
If you're trying to fool me,

379
00:20:16.108 --> 00:20:18.308
can't you think of a better lie?

380
00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:24.808
That's not surprising at all!

381
00:20:26.608 --> 00:20:29.308
You knew, didn't you?

382
00:20:29.308 --> 00:20:31.608
If you knew, why didn't you stay away from me?

383
00:20:31.608 --> 00:20:33.908
I was using you, you know!

384
00:20:33.908 --> 00:20:37.908
Do I have to tell you how I feel, for you to understand?

385
00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:46.008
Akai...

386
00:20:46.008 --> 00:20:48.208
Your phone's been ringing for sometime now.

387
00:20:48.208 --> 00:20:49.708
Oh, I'm sorry.

388
00:20:53.008 --> 00:20:56.608
-Yes. -It's me.

389
00:20:56.608 --> 00:21:00.808
It's me, Rena Mizunashi.

390
00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:04.408
Is it okay now? Is there anyone around you?

391
00:21:04.408 --> 00:21:06.508
What...

392
00:21:06.508 --> 00:21:08.908
Yeah, I'm alone.

393
00:21:08.908 --> 00:21:11.908
I'll bet you're surprised getting a call from me so soon

394
00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:14.208
after returning to the Organization.

395
00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:16.108
Sort of...

396
00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.308
Explain what you mean.

397
00:21:18.308 --> 00:21:22.208
Well, the thing is I don't feel comfortable here.

398
00:21:22.208 --> 00:21:25.508
I want to get out of here, so I want you to help me.

399
00:21:25.508 --> 00:21:29.008
Of course I'll give you the information that the FBI wants.

400
00:21:29.008 --> 00:21:32.008
Would it be possible to see you now?

401
00:21:32.008 --> 00:21:34.808
Yeah, if you're alone too,

402
00:21:34.808 --> 00:21:36.108
it's okay with me.

403
00:21:36.108 --> 00:21:39.608
I'll send you the time and place later by email, then.

404
00:21:39.608 --> 00:21:42.008
Yeah.

405
00:21:42.008 --> 00:21:43.308
Satisfied?

406
00:21:44.308 --> 00:21:47.108
Today is Friday the 13th.

407
00:21:47.108 --> 00:21:49.608
I don't believe in things like that to begin with...

408
00:21:53.508 --> 00:21:57.208
But there couldn't be a better day for him to die.

409
00:21:57.208 --> 00:22:01.108
Akai, was that Rena Mizunashi?

410
00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:04.908
Yes, she asked me to come meet her now, just the two of us.

411
00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:07.608
Just the two of you. It could be a trap.

412
00:22:07.608 --> 00:22:10.008
I'd advise you not to go.

413
00:22:10.008 --> 00:22:13.808
Yes, but if it's a trap,

414
00:22:13.808 --> 00:22:15.008
if I don't go,

415
00:22:15.008 --> 00:22:17.508
there's a ten to one chance that she'll be killed.

416
00:22:17.508 --> 00:22:19.808
That...

417
00:22:19.808 --> 00:22:21.308
I'll be fine.

418
00:22:21.308 --> 00:22:25.008
I pride myself for having pretty sharp hunches.

419
00:22:25.008 --> 00:22:27.108
She herself is an agent of the CIA,

420
00:22:27.108 --> 00:22:29.608
I'm sure she's thought up something to make it through this too.

421
00:22:29.608 --> 00:22:32.108
At any rate, let's call Jodie

422
00:22:32.108 --> 00:22:35.008
and think of what we as FBI agents can do.

423
00:22:35.008 --> 00:22:37.908
Akai?

424
00:22:37.908 --> 00:22:40.308
What is it?

425
00:24:10.308 --> 00:24:13.008
"Next episode" -Message left behind.

426
00:24:13.008 --> 00:24:14.908
The ringtone.

427
00:24:14.908 --> 00:24:16.508
What does it mean?

428
00:24:16.508 --> 00:24:19.108
A trap or a scream?

429
00:24:19.108 --> 00:24:20.408
Who's taking the risk,

430
00:24:20.408 --> 00:24:23.708
the one who set the trap or the one who takes the dive?

431
00:24:23.708 --> 00:24:26.108
Behind the scene, there lurks,

432
00:24:26.108 --> 00:24:30.108
a surprising truth and malicious eyes.

433
00:24:31.808 --> 00:24:34.708
Next on Detective Conan,

434
00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:40.408
