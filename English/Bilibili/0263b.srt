1
00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:04.489
The question is,

2
00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:08.089
who the killer is and how Mr. Tarumi was moved.

3
00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:10.789
We know how.

4
00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.389
One of my men just questioned some of the kids

5
00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.789
that were hanging around the entrance to the annex

6
00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.989
and it seems they saw the killer.

7
00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:17.589
A suspicious character came out of here

8
00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.689
wearing a mask and protective gear carrying a gear bag.

9
00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.889
A mask, protective gear and a gear bag?

10
00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:29.689
I see! The killer put Mr. Tarumi inside the gear bag

11
00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.989
and wore a mask to cover his face

12
00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.489
so no one would recognize him when he walked out.

13
00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.289
When did that guy wearing the mask come out?

14
00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.589
It seems it was after the three

15
00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.089
left the annex after finding the body.

16
00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.389
So it means that the person who moved the body

17
00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:47.589
was not one of the three who found it.

18
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.589
That's right.

19
00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.089
The killer was probably hiding in the storage room

20
00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.089
when the three came in and found Mr. Tarumi's body.

21
00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.589
He didn't think the body would be found so soon,

22
00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.589
so he moved it here.

23
00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.489
Excuse me, Inspector Otaki.

24
00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.789
Did Heiji come here?

25
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.589
Yes, he was here for awhile

26
00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.089
but he rushed off for someplace.

27
00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.789
It's no use.

28
00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:20.989
No matter what you do,

29
00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:22.489
you can't make it look like Mr. Tarumi

30
00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:25.989
was killed in this storage room.

31
00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:27.889
Mr. Kotegawa.

32
00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.589
That's right. This isn't where Mr. Tarumi was killed.

33
00:01:34.589 --> 00:01:37.089
He was killed in the locker room beside the pool.

34
00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:39.289
After you fellows found Mr. Tarumi's body,

35
00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.089
Mr. Omotani and Mr. Doguchi left.

36
00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:44.189
You alone came back

37
00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.589
and told him to go to the locker room,

38
00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:48.589
that's where you killed him.

39
00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:50.989
Isn't that right?

40
00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:52.189
How stupid.

41
00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.189
It was pure coincidence that they left the storage room.

42
00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:56.589
If someone had stayed behind,

43
00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:57.589
I wouldn't have been able to come back

44
00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:59.089
and do what you claim I did, now would I?

45
00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.289
No, it was no coincidence.

46
00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.789
All you had to do was tell Mr. Omotani to go get the police

47
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.389
to guarantee no one would be left.

48
00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:08.889
You knew Mr. Doguchi's personality.

49
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.089
Whenever something happened,

50
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:11.789
he always reported it to Mr. Hakamata.

51
00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:13.389
Besides, he can't stand the sight of blood.

52
00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:14.589
You knew he wouldn't touch the body,

53
00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.289
that he'd immediately go to find Mr. Hakamata.

54
00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.789
You gave Mr. Tarumi liquor laced with sleep inducers

55
00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:26.189
then you put red paint on him to make him appear dead,

56
00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.489
so no one would think he was alive.

57
00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:31.689
This storage room is dark,

58
00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.989
so the red paint would look like real blood.

59
00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.789
There were a lot of people in front of the annex.

60
00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.689
If somebody covered with red paint came out of here,

61
00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.089
don't you think someone was bound to notice?

62
00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.889
Yes, they did.

63
00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.289
They saw a suspicious character wearing a mask

64
00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.089
and protective gear come out of the annex carrying a gear bag.

65
00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.489
Come on, I hope you're not saying that that was Tarumi?

66
00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.389
What makes you think he'd dress himself up like that

67
00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.989
to go to the locker room just because I told him to?

68
00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.789
It wasn't just what you said.

69
00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.489
If you were shown something like this while you were groggy,

70
00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.489
you could be talked into doing anything.

71
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:16.589
He said "I'm going to kill you"?

72
00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.489
Mr. Tarumi was always saying that?

73
00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.089
Yes. It seems he had a grudge against Mr. Hakamata,

74
00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.089
the other team members told me that.

75
00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.889
So that means there's a possibility

76
00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.289
Mr. Hakamata killed Mr. Tarumi instead.

77
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.489
No, that's wrong.

78
00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.389
The killer probably took advantage of Mr. Tarumi's anger.

79
00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.789
That's right. When you came back here alone,

80
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:46.189
you put the Japanese sword in Mr. Tarumi's hand.

81
00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:47.589
Woke him up and showed him

82
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.789
the doll you'd hidden inside the vaulting horse beforehand.

83
00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:51.789
Then you probably said this to him.

84
00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:54.789
"What in the world have you done?"

85
00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.289
Mr. Tarumi hated Mr. Hakamata

86
00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.089
and he was still in a groggy state of mind.

87
00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.889
So he didn't notice that it was just the doll

88
00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.789
used to teach life saving techniques

89
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:08.589
wearing Mr. Hakamata's uniform.

90
00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.789
That's why he thought the red paint on his chest guard

91
00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:13.589
was Mr. Hakamata's blood

92
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.389
and that he'd killed him while he was drunk.

93
00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.489
That's when you probably told him

94
00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.489
that you'd let him get away

95
00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.289
before the police arrived so he should put the mask on

96
00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.989
and sneak into the locker room beside the pool and hide there.

97
00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:31.389
And you also suggested he change out of his bloody clothes,

98
00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.689
put on the protective gear

99
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.589
and put the sword into the bag for the bamboo sword.

100
00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:37.089
Then told him to take them with him, didn't you?

101
00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.089
You put the extra clothes and protective gear in the gear bag

102
00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:43.889
and had it hidden it in the storage room.

103
00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.089
That's so it would appear like someone else besides you

104
00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:50.389
carried the body out of the storage room wearing a mask.

105
00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.489
Then you took a shortcut to the locker room

106
00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:56.989
and waited for Mr. Tarumi to arrive

107
00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:59.089
and then you killed him for real.

108
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:04.389
After that, you washed the paint off of his body in the shower,

109
00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.789
put the mask and protective gear in the gear bag.

110
00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.589
And after you hid them somewhere,

111
00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:12.989
you went to the police box where you'd sent Mr. Omotani.

112
00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:14.289
That's when you did it, right?

113
00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.989
That's when you got Mr. Tarumi's blood

114
00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:18.489
on the towel you're holding now.

115
00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:21.389
When you went to get the doll from inside the vaulting horse,

116
00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.589
you decided to smear his blood on it

117
00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:27.989
so that it'd look like he really was killed here, right?

118
00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.789
That bloody towel in your hand

119
00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.089
proves that you killed him!

120
00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.189
If you know so much,

121
00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:44.189
then you probably know why I did it.

122
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.989
Yes. I called the college you go to and checked up on you.

123
00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:49.989
I found out that last year,

124
00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:52.489
one of the new members of your kendo team

125
00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:56.789
lost consciousness during practice and died.

126
00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.089
The college claimed it was an accident,

127
00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:02.389
but the truth is...

128
00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:06.489
That's right. We were initiating the new members,

129
00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:09.889
Tarumi didn't know his own strength, he overdid it.

130
00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.289
Hakamata was officiator, but he was absent that day.

131
00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.089
This is what Tarumi said.

132
00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:17.689
"Sure I'm the one who did it

133
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.189
but everyone present here today and the manager is just as guilty.

134
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:23.489
If anyone talks, I'm taking everybody down with me."

135
00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:25.889
So you decided to shut him up

136
00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.489
so he couldn't ruin it for all of you

137
00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:31.489
since you've got your new career.

138
00:06:31.489 --> 00:06:33.789
I guess you know everything,

139
00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.089
but seeing as you aren't armed,

140
00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:38.389
you didn't know about this, did you?

141
00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.689
The fast draw demonstrator had a partner.

142
00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.489
Naturally, when I went into

143
00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:47.589
the demonstrator's dressing room to steal the sword,

144
00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:49.089
I'd already...

145
00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.289
taken a few practice swings with it!

146
00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:55.989
Huh?

147
00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:59.589
A strange man called and told you come to the locker room?

148
00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.089
Really?

149
00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:03.189
Yes. When they all arrived,

150
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.689
they found Mr. Tarumi had been moved here.

151
00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.989
The reason the killer called to give Mr. Tarumi's location was

152
00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:13.789
he didn't want the storage room to be searched.

153
00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.689
Which means, there's something he doesn't want found still inside.

154
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.789
Hey. Where is the storage room?

155
00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:23.589
It's in the annex next to the gym. Why?

156
00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.689
-Show me! -Wait, slow down!

157
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:28.289
Conan, where are you going?

158
00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:32.489
Don't be a fool!

159
00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:34.189
You won't be able to get away with it this time

160
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:35.989
if you kill me here!

161
00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:37.889
I'm not worried.

162
00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:40.489
The police will assume it's the same killer

163
00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:41.889
and since they've already decided

164
00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:44.589
I couldn't have moved Tarumi's body,

165
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.389
they won't even suspect me.

166
00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:50.289
I've already figured everything out!

167
00:08:00.989 --> 00:08:02.889
You picked the wrong guy to fight with.

168
00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:04.089
What the?

169
00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:07.489
Hattori?

170
00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:09.089
Don't tell me...

171
00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:10.989
you're that high school kid that shocked everybody

172
00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:13.489
by beating the entire Osaka Police Department's team,

173
00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:15.689
and they're all well trained.

174
00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:18.989
That's right, but you realized it too late.

175
00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:21.689
Yuranosuke!

176
00:08:27.989 --> 00:08:29.689
Yo! Good to see you!

177
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:31.589
Heiji?

178
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:40.689
Well, Otaki, I'll let you take it from here.

179
00:08:40.689 --> 00:08:43.589
You can count on me. Best of luck to you too, Heiji.

180
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:46.189
I almost forgot! The match!

181
00:08:46.189 --> 00:08:48.189
We can't waste our time standing around here!

182
00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:49.989
Are you okay?

183
00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:56.089
Oh, no. I think it's already over.

184
00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:57.389
Well, it couldn't be helped.

185
00:08:57.389 --> 00:09:00.589
We lost the championship but solved the case.

186
00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:01.989
Right?

187
00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:03.289
Huh?

188
00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:07.589
When's Heiji's turn?

189
00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:20.189
This is delicious!

190
00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:22.189
It's the best!

191
00:09:22.189 --> 00:09:23.689
Of course it is.

192
00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:26.389
No one makes better "tetchiri" than my mom.

193
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:30.989
Look at her. She fell asleep without taking a single bite.

194
00:09:30.989 --> 00:09:32.589
It's all your fault!

195
00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:35.989
She was running all over the place looking for you!

196
00:09:35.989 --> 00:09:37.489
Well, it couldn't be helped.

197
00:09:37.489 --> 00:09:39.989
I had to solve that murder, didn't I?

198
00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:42.889
You can tell he's the son of the Chief of Police.

199
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:45.989
He solved the case in no time.

200
00:09:45.989 --> 00:09:47.289
Thank you.

201
00:09:47.289 --> 00:09:50.189
This kid solves cases purely on intuition.

202
00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.089
He's just playing detective.

203
00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:53.589
He doesn't even come close

204
00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:55.589
to being a real detective like you, Mr. Mouri.

205
00:09:55.589 --> 00:09:57.389
So what's that supposed to mean?

206
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:59.689
That Kudo's better than me too?

207
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:04.689
But Heizo, he's just like how you used to be

208
00:10:04.689 --> 00:10:06.089
when you where his age.

209
00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:08.189
I hate to see what he'll be like when he's older.

210
00:10:09.089 --> 00:10:11.489
Hey, Toyama. Lay off the liquor.

211
00:10:11.489 --> 00:10:13.289
You're driving, aren't you?

212
00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:17.689
Don't worry. I'm going to let you drive me home.

213
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:23.689
What did you want to talk about?

214
00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:26.989
Isn't that why you wanted me to drive you home?

215
00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:28.289
Yeah.

216
00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:30.789
It's about Heiji and my daughter Kazuha.

217
00:10:30.789 --> 00:10:33.189
What do you think about their relationship?

218
00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:35.789
Kazuha's already 17.

219
00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:37.089
She'll be leaving for college soon.

220
00:10:37.089 --> 00:10:38.589
And when she comes back, she'll be 20.

221
00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:42.989
Some good for nothing's going to take her away from me one day anyway

222
00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:45.089
so I figured it might as well be that no account son of yours.

223
00:10:45.089 --> 00:10:48.489
Toyama, get to the point.

224
00:10:50.289 --> 00:10:53.789
You still can't take a joke, can you?

225
00:10:53.789 --> 00:10:56.889
So you were just kidding?

226
00:10:56.889 --> 00:11:00.789
Do you remember what happened at Osaka Castle 13 years ago?

227
00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:05.189
You mean the unidentified burnt body found in the inner moat?

228
00:11:05.189 --> 00:11:07.989
This piece of pottery the victim had

229
00:11:07.989 --> 00:11:10.389
hidden in his pocket.

230
00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:13.589
That piece of pottery used to be

231
00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:16.589
the main topic of our conversation back then.

232
00:11:16.589 --> 00:11:18.889
We made up a lot of stories.

233
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:22.089
Well, turns out maybe they weren't just stories.

234
00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:25.589
We found another piece.

235
00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:28.589
It was on the burnt body we found in the east moat not too long ago.

236
00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:31.389
It looks just like this one.

237
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:33.789
The lab is checking it out

238
00:11:33.789 --> 00:11:37.689
but they're almost certain it was made in the same period.

239
00:11:37.689 --> 00:11:40.189
Another thing. On the piece we just found,

240
00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:44.189
you can make out the word "848" on it.

241
00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:50.489
Things could turn out like we figured 13 years ago.

242
00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.189
It could still be lying around somewhere.

243
00:11:54.189 --> 00:11:59.389
Yeah. The huge fortune that great man left.

244
00:12:09.368 --> 00:12:11.968
That round one's Osaka Hall.

245
00:12:11.968 --> 00:12:14.968
And Osaka Business Park's over there

246
00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:16.968
where all those buildings are.

247
00:12:16.968 --> 00:12:21.468
And you can't see it from here because it's behind the building

248
00:12:21.468 --> 00:12:25.168
but Osaka's most exciting television station is behind it!

249
00:12:26.168 --> 00:12:28.968
And there's the city's symbol, Osaka Castle.

250
00:12:30.168 --> 00:12:32.668
So? Now you know how great Osaka is!

251
00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:33.868
That's the same thing you said

252
00:12:33.868 --> 00:12:36.668
that last time we took them around.

253
00:12:36.668 --> 00:12:39.568
-What? -Besides, we showed them

254
00:12:39.568 --> 00:12:42.968
the view of the city from up high from Tsutenkaku last time.

255
00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:44.968
I shouldn't have let you be tour guide.

256
00:12:44.968 --> 00:12:47.968
I know, but the Tenjin Festival and the Gion Festival

257
00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.268
and even the Danjiri Festival in Kishiwada are all over,

258
00:12:50.268 --> 00:12:52.368
only Osaka Castle was left.

259
00:12:52.368 --> 00:12:56.668
So if it was up to you, where'd you take us?

260
00:12:56.668 --> 00:12:59.868
Let's see. If it was me,

261
00:12:59.868 --> 00:13:02.268
it's right in front of this castle.

262
00:13:02.268 --> 00:13:06.668
I'd give you the grand tour of Osaka's police headquarters.

263
00:13:06.668 --> 00:13:09.168
And I'd take you inside the new building

264
00:13:09.168 --> 00:13:11.168
which is almost finished.

265
00:13:12.868 --> 00:13:13.868
That is so stupid.

266
00:13:13.868 --> 00:13:17.668
You're the only one who'd enjoy something like that.

267
00:13:17.668 --> 00:13:19.968
That sounds like fun.

268
00:13:19.968 --> 00:13:21.568
Osaka Castle is much prettier

269
00:13:21.568 --> 00:13:24.668
than when you see it on television or in pictures.

270
00:13:24.668 --> 00:13:26.968
You noticed? They've just finished repairing it,

271
00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:28.568
so it's been cleaned up nice.

272
00:13:28.568 --> 00:13:31.968
They hadn't done any work on it

273
00:13:31.968 --> 00:13:34.468
since they restored the tower about 60 years ago.

274
00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:36.468
It was 70 years ago.

275
00:13:36.468 --> 00:13:37.968
Huh?

276
00:13:37.968 --> 00:13:43.068
Hideyoshi Toyotomi first built it in 1599.

277
00:13:43.068 --> 00:13:46.968
Tokugawa rebuilt it in 1629.

278
00:13:46.968 --> 00:13:51.568
And the people of Osaka restored it 70 years ago, in 1931,

279
00:13:51.568 --> 00:13:55.568
this is the third tower.

280
00:13:56.868 --> 00:13:58.868
You sure know your stuff.

281
00:13:58.868 --> 00:14:03.968
Of course I do. Hideyoshi Toyotomi's my hero.

282
00:14:04.568 --> 00:14:07.368
So you say, but that badge you've got on

283
00:14:07.368 --> 00:14:10.768
looks like the Tokugawa crest, the 3 leafed mallow.

284
00:14:10.768 --> 00:14:12.668
Well, you see it's like this.

285
00:14:12.668 --> 00:14:14.968
Hey, Ieyasu. What're you doing?

286
00:14:14.968 --> 00:14:16.768
The Lord is waiting.

287
00:14:16.768 --> 00:14:19.268
Sorry, Mitsuhide.

288
00:14:19.268 --> 00:14:21.968
-Ieyasu? -Mitsuhide?

289
00:14:21.968 --> 00:14:23.168
Lord?

290
00:14:25.568 --> 00:14:28.768
"8 days research tour of Hideyoshi Toyotomi"?

291
00:14:28.768 --> 00:14:32.268
That's right. That's the name of our tour.

292
00:14:32.268 --> 00:14:34.868
All the tour members are Hideyoshi fans,

293
00:14:34.868 --> 00:14:37.668
we got together through the internet.

294
00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:41.668
We went from Nagoya to Kyoto visiting places he's known for

295
00:14:41.668 --> 00:14:43.768
and now we're in Osaka.

296
00:14:43.768 --> 00:14:47.668
So what about the names you call each other and those badges?

297
00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:50.368
It's sort of like a penalty in a game.

298
00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:51.668
Every day, after breakfast,

299
00:14:51.668 --> 00:14:53.768
we draw lots to decide which roles we'll be playing

300
00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:55.568
and we put the badges on

301
00:14:55.568 --> 00:15:00.468
with the crests of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, Ieyasu and Mitsuhide.

302
00:15:00.468 --> 00:15:02.068
And for the entire day,

303
00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.968
whoever picks Hideyoshi, Ieyasu and Mitsuhide

304
00:15:04.968 --> 00:15:07.368
has to play the role

305
00:15:07.368 --> 00:15:11.468
and cater to whoever Nobunaga is.

306
00:15:11.468 --> 00:15:13.568
For instance, we take souvenir pictures of that person

307
00:15:13.568 --> 00:15:15.568
or go run errands, things like that.

308
00:15:16.468 --> 00:15:18.368
On the other hand...

309
00:15:18.368 --> 00:15:20.568
Nobunaga has to give Hideyoshi and Ieyasu

310
00:15:20.568 --> 00:15:23.368
money for dinner.

311
00:15:23.368 --> 00:15:26.468
-Isn't that right? -Yes, that's right, Nene.

312
00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.668
You mean you have someone playing "Nene", too?

313
00:15:28.668 --> 00:15:32.368
That's right. Whoever picks the blank lot has to be "Nene".

314
00:15:32.368 --> 00:15:33.468
That person has to watch everyone else

315
00:15:33.468 --> 00:15:35.468
and pass things off with a smile.

316
00:15:35.468 --> 00:15:38.568
But I feel sorry for whoever has to be Mitsuhide.

317
00:15:38.568 --> 00:15:39.568
He has to pay for his own dinner

318
00:15:39.568 --> 00:15:41.768
even though he works hard all day, right?

319
00:15:41.768 --> 00:15:44.268
But playing Mitsuhide also has its rewards.

320
00:15:44.268 --> 00:15:46.668
He gets to play Nobunaga for 3 minutes

321
00:15:46.668 --> 00:15:48.668
and he gets to pick the time.

322
00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:51.268
I see. Rather than Lord for 3 days,

323
00:15:51.268 --> 00:15:53.368
it's Lord for 3 minutes.

324
00:15:53.368 --> 00:15:54.768
Sounds stupid.

325
00:15:54.768 --> 00:15:56.568
It sounds like fun.

326
00:15:56.568 --> 00:15:58.268
It is.

327
00:15:58.268 --> 00:16:00.768
So this is where everybody is.

328
00:16:00.768 --> 00:16:03.868
I couldn't find you, so I'd been looking all over the place.

329
00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:06.368
Lord Nobunaga, please forgive us.

330
00:16:06.368 --> 00:16:09.968
Here is the oolong tea you requested.

331
00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:13.568
And this is the post card of Osaka Castle.

332
00:16:13.568 --> 00:16:15.868
Thank you. That was very thoughtful of you.

333
00:16:15.868 --> 00:16:18.868
He's a very humble Nobunaga.

334
00:16:18.868 --> 00:16:20.668
Something's not right though.

335
00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:23.668
The main character Hideyoshi is missing.

336
00:16:23.668 --> 00:16:26.768
That's right. I thought he was with you.

337
00:16:26.768 --> 00:16:29.568
He was with me until just a little while ago,

338
00:16:29.568 --> 00:16:31.668
but then he got a call on his cellular

339
00:16:31.668 --> 00:16:33.968
and he ran off somewhere.

340
00:16:33.968 --> 00:16:36.068
Do you know where he went to?

341
00:16:36.068 --> 00:16:40.668
No. But he did say we were to have lunch without him.

342
00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:43.468
Then he must have gone off to have lunch on his own.

343
00:16:44.068 --> 00:16:45.968
Come on, don't bother with them.

344
00:16:45.968 --> 00:16:47.068
They're kind of strange.

345
00:16:47.068 --> 00:16:49.668
Why don't we go get some lunch too?

346
00:16:56.468 --> 00:17:00.168
Finally! I can finally take a look at it.

347
00:17:00.168 --> 00:17:02.268
I gave up 13 years ago,

348
00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:06.668
but this radiant treasure's finally in my hands.

349
00:17:06.668 --> 00:17:13.068
"Dragon"

350
00:17:17.668 --> 00:17:19.068
How can you be so dumb?

351
00:17:19.068 --> 00:17:21.668
We have to go back to Osaka Castle again.

352
00:17:21.668 --> 00:17:23.868
Besides, how can you lose your wallet

353
00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:25.168
when you put it in your bag?

354
00:17:25.168 --> 00:17:27.568
You kept saying "Hurry up, hurry up"

355
00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:29.768
so I must have left it somewhere.

356
00:17:29.768 --> 00:17:31.868
How much did you have inside?

357
00:17:31.868 --> 00:17:33.268
5,000 yen.

358
00:17:33.268 --> 00:17:35.568
Just forget about it then. Besides, it's getting dark already.

359
00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:38.968
No! I have my favorite amulet inside it!

360
00:17:38.968 --> 00:17:41.268
It's nothing to cry about!

361
00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:43.168
I'm not crying.

362
00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:46.168
It's raining.

363
00:17:46.168 --> 00:17:49.168
It doesn't look like it's going to let up so soon.

364
00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:51.668
Here, I have an umbrella.

365
00:17:55.368 --> 00:17:58.868
-This is the pits. -What'll we do?

366
00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:03.468
Hey, maybe you left your wallet in that store.

367
00:18:03.468 --> 00:18:07.468
Remember? Kazuha, you bought a disposable camera there.

368
00:18:07.468 --> 00:18:09.068
I think you're right.

369
00:18:09.068 --> 00:18:11.968
All right then, we'll go and ask.

370
00:18:13.468 --> 00:18:15.068
Gosh.

371
00:18:15.968 --> 00:18:19.068
I think we should look over there.

372
00:18:19.068 --> 00:18:20.968
We already did.

373
00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:23.168
Is something wrong?

374
00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:27.568
Yes. We can't find our friend who's playing Hideyoshi.

375
00:18:27.568 --> 00:18:29.568
We looked for him at Osaka Castle and the shops around here,

376
00:18:29.568 --> 00:18:31.868
even in the toilets...

377
00:18:31.868 --> 00:18:33.868
He's nowhere to be found.

378
00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:35.868
I wonder where he could've gone.

379
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:39.568
What's that?

380
00:18:39.568 --> 00:18:41.268
Look! What's that?

381
00:18:45.268 --> 00:18:47.268
Somebody's burning!

382
00:19:01.568 --> 00:19:03.368
Mr. Mouri, call for an ambulance!

383
00:19:03.368 --> 00:19:04.968
Okay!

384
00:19:04.968 --> 00:19:07.868
Hey, can you hear me? What happened to you?

385
00:19:11.668 --> 00:19:12.868
Huh?

386
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:23.168
Hey, hang in there! You hear me?

387
00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:32.575
Yes! That's it! This is my wallet!

388
00:19:32.575 --> 00:19:33.975
You're very lucky.

389
00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:36.675
I figured you might be coming back right away

390
00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.675
so I kept it here instead of giving it to the police.

391
00:19:39.675 --> 00:19:41.475
It's a very precious wallet, isn't it?

392
00:19:41.475 --> 00:19:43.375
It was filled with amulets.

393
00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:45.575
It sure is! Thank you so much, madam!

394
00:19:45.575 --> 00:19:48.775
You mean you had more than one amulet in there?

395
00:19:48.775 --> 00:19:51.175
I bought a charm to chase away evil, too.

396
00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:52.875
So that we wouldn't be involved in another case

397
00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:55.775
and have it ruin your visit to Osaka like last time.

398
00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:56.875
How sweet!

399
00:19:56.875 --> 00:20:00.575
What? A burning man fell from the tower?

400
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:01.675
Are you sure about that?

401
00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:05.475
Yeah. The police are there and everything's going crazy!

402
00:20:08.975 --> 00:20:10.575
It didn't work, none of them.

403
00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:11.575
I guess not.

404
00:20:15.575 --> 00:20:18.875
Inspector Otaki, you sure are busy.

405
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:21.475
Two murders two days straight.

406
00:20:21.475 --> 00:20:23.675
Well, it's my job.

407
00:20:23.675 --> 00:20:25.775
It's amazing though.

408
00:20:25.775 --> 00:20:28.975
How did you know the victim's name was Yuji Kato?

409
00:20:28.975 --> 00:20:30.675
I looked on his badge.

410
00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:32.175
His badge?

411
00:20:32.175 --> 00:20:34.475
You mean the crest on his chest?

412
00:20:34.475 --> 00:20:37.275
That's Hideyoshi's crest, the Goshichi paulownia.

413
00:20:37.275 --> 00:20:39.775
As soon as I saw it,

414
00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:42.175
I knew he was the Hideyoshi character from their group

415
00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:43.975
so I had them come and identify the body.

416
00:20:43.975 --> 00:20:46.975
What do you mean about Hideyoshi character?

417
00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:48.875
As part of the tours entertainment,

418
00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:50.375
we have each member act as

419
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:53.175
a famous person from the Warring States period

420
00:20:53.175 --> 00:20:56.075
and also have a penalty game.

421
00:20:56.075 --> 00:21:00.175
For instance, I'm Mitsuhide and Kasuya is Ieyasu.

422
00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:04.075
Wakisaka is Nobunaga and Katagiri is Nene.

423
00:21:04.075 --> 00:21:07.975
And Kato over there was Hideyoshi.

424
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.975
I see. That sure sounds like a lot of fun.

425
00:21:10.975 --> 00:21:13.775
But I don't understand how you could lose track of

426
00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:15.575
one of your tour members and let him end up like this.

427
00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:16.875
Well...

428
00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:18.175
He disappeared so suddenly

429
00:21:18.175 --> 00:21:20.575
and we were looking for him all this time.

430
00:21:20.575 --> 00:21:23.075
He was wearing a flashy fleece outfit

431
00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:25.475
so we figured we could spot him right away.

432
00:21:25.475 --> 00:21:30.675
Who'd have thought he'd fall from there in a ball of fire.

433
00:21:30.675 --> 00:21:33.375
By the way, can you think of a reason

434
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:34.975
why Mr. Kato would commit suicide?

435
00:21:34.975 --> 00:21:36.775
No. I don't have the slightest idea.

436
00:21:36.775 --> 00:21:39.575
How do you know it was suicide?

437
00:21:39.575 --> 00:21:41.675
First off, it's raining so hard.

438
00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:43.775
No one would go out there on the roof.

439
00:21:43.775 --> 00:21:46.275
And then, he was wearing clothes made of fleece,

440
00:21:46.275 --> 00:21:47.775
which is very flammable.

441
00:21:47.775 --> 00:21:49.675
That proves he went out on the roof himself

442
00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:52.075
and set himself on fire.

443
00:21:52.075 --> 00:21:55.275
But you sure do come across a lot of murders, don't you?

444
00:21:55.275 --> 00:21:58.075
Maybe you're cursed or something?

445
00:21:58.075 --> 00:21:59.175
Not really.

446
00:21:59.175 --> 00:22:02.875
The Chief of Police's son comes across them more often.

447
00:22:02.875 --> 00:22:06.575
What? Is Heiji here, too?

448
00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:11.175
Yes. He and Conan went inside the castle just a little while ago.

449
00:22:13.175 --> 00:22:14.175
Hey, Kudo.

450
00:22:14.175 --> 00:22:16.375
Be careful, it's slippery up there because of the rain.

451
00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:19.975
How embarrassing. I feel like a trained monkey.

452
00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:26.975
Did you find something?

453
00:22:26.975 --> 00:22:29.975
There's a lot of teeny tiny pieces of something up here.

454
00:22:33.775 --> 00:22:35.075
It's a lighter.

455
00:22:36.575 --> 00:22:38.675
Could this be the lighter he used?

456
00:22:39.975 --> 00:22:42.375
It doesn't make sense though. Why is it here?

457
00:22:45.175 --> 00:22:47.075
What's this mark?

458
00:22:48.975 --> 00:22:50.675
I just don't believe it.

459
00:22:50.675 --> 00:22:53.075
Why would Kato commit suicide?

460
00:22:53.075 --> 00:22:55.075
I don't believe it either.

461
00:22:55.075 --> 00:22:58.475
He was really looking forward to coming to Osaka.

462
00:22:58.475 --> 00:23:03.175
I guess you never know what people are really thinking about.

463
00:23:03.175 --> 00:23:05.775
Maybe he'd planned all along

464
00:23:05.775 --> 00:23:09.575
to commit suicide here in the land of Hideyoshi Toyotomu.

465
00:23:09.575 --> 00:23:11.775
All we have to do is find what he used to set himself on fire with.

466
00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:13.875
Right. That's all we need to find.

467
00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:16.375
We found it!

468
00:23:16.375 --> 00:23:19.875
It was on the roof of the tower. It's a lighter.

469
00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:23.475
Why isn't that the lighter Kato had?

470
00:23:23.475 --> 00:23:24.575
Yes, I think it is.

471
00:23:24.575 --> 00:23:26.775
That settles it! It was a suicide!

472
00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:28.475
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

473
00:23:28.475 --> 00:23:29.475
What?

474
00:23:29.475 --> 00:23:31.975
The cover on this lighter was closed.

475
00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:33.475
Do you think someone committing suicide

476
00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:35.375
would take the time to close the cover?

477
00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:40.275
But Heiji, maybe the cover closed when he dropped it.

478
00:23:40.275 --> 00:23:41.375
If that were the case,

479
00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:44.475
we should have found it further down the roof.

480
00:23:44.475 --> 00:23:46.575
Besides, it looked like something else was there

481
00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:49.175
before the lighter was put down.

482
00:23:49.175 --> 00:23:51.075
What do you mean, something else?

483
00:23:51.075 --> 00:23:53.175
When we found the lighter,

484
00:23:53.175 --> 00:23:56.375
there was a dry spot in a strange shape under it.

485
00:23:56.375 --> 00:23:58.575
Not a rectangle shape like this lighter,

486
00:23:58.575 --> 00:24:00.575
it was a nice fan shape.

487
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:04.575
I'm pretty sure something round was put there

488
00:24:04.575 --> 00:24:07.075
before it started to rain.

489
00:24:07.075 --> 00:24:08.375
After the rain started,

490
00:24:08.375 --> 00:24:12.075
that round thing was replaced with the lighter.

491
00:24:12.075 --> 00:24:14.175
-Isn't that right, kid? -Yes.

492
00:24:14.175 --> 00:24:18.475
But Heiji, what do you think that round thing was?

493
00:24:18.475 --> 00:24:20.475
Beats me. I haven't figured that out yet.

494
00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:22.475
But I think it has something to do

495
00:24:22.475 --> 00:24:24.775
with the little chips all over the place.

496
00:24:24.775 --> 00:24:26.075
Inspector Otaki.

497
00:24:26.075 --> 00:24:28.775
We've laid out all of the victim's personal belongings out.

498
00:24:31.475 --> 00:24:33.975
Wallet, watch, cellular phone,

499
00:24:33.975 --> 00:24:36.975
keys, cigarettes and a piece of something.

500
00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:39.175
Huh? A scroll.

501
00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:42.675
What is this?

502
00:24:42.675 --> 00:24:45.375
Only the word "dragon" is on this thing.

503
00:24:47.375 --> 00:24:49.375
And what is this from?

504
00:24:49.375 --> 00:24:51.575
It looks like piece of pottery.

505
00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:54.175
Huh? That piece...

506
00:24:54.175 --> 00:24:56.475
Isn't it possible that piece is the same

507
00:24:56.475 --> 00:24:59.475
as the ones they found on the other burned bodies?

508
00:24:59.475 --> 00:25:04.975
My dad and your father were talking about it in the car last night.

509
00:25:04.975 --> 00:25:08.075
One was found in the inner moat 13 years ago

510
00:25:08.075 --> 00:25:10.775
and the other was found just recently in the outer moat.

511
00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:13.075
Both victims had pieces of pottery that looked the same.

512
00:25:13.075 --> 00:25:14.775
And I heard them say that

513
00:25:14.775 --> 00:25:19.275
the one they found recently had "848" written on it.

514
00:25:19.275 --> 00:25:22.375
848? What does that mean?

515
00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:25.475
No one was really sure

516
00:25:25.475 --> 00:25:27.975
but it seems that those pieces are a part of some kind of treasure.

517
00:25:27.975 --> 00:25:29.575
Treasure?

518
00:25:29.575 --> 00:25:30.875
I'm not making it up!

519
00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:33.075
They were whispering like it was a secret!

520
00:25:33.075 --> 00:25:36.675
They said something about huge fortune the great man left behind.

521
00:25:36.675 --> 00:25:38.875
Did you say huge fortune?

522
00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:42.275
Are you sure you're not making all of this up?

523
00:25:42.275 --> 00:25:44.575
Hey, Hattori.

524
00:25:44.575 --> 00:25:47.575
Look at this piece of pottery.

525
00:25:47.575 --> 00:25:51.775
There's shiny stuff stuck on the inside of it.

526
00:25:51.775 --> 00:25:53.875
Hey. Isn't that gold?

527
00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:55.775
I think so, but it's not much

528
00:25:55.775 --> 00:25:58.375
so I don't think it's much of a treasure.

529
00:25:58.375 --> 00:26:01.675
Gosh. I just don't understand this case.

530
00:26:01.675 --> 00:26:04.375
It's a mysterious enough that Mr. Kato left the tour

531
00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:07.375
and went up the roof

532
00:26:07.375 --> 00:26:09.975
but it's even harder to explain why he suddenly burst into flames.

533
00:26:09.975 --> 00:26:12.075
And the biggest question...

534
00:26:12.075 --> 00:26:14.675
Why Mr. Kato grabbed the umbrella...

535
00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.575
just before he died.

536
00:26:18.575 --> 00:26:21.775
Umbrella could refer to rain.

537
00:26:21.775 --> 00:26:23.275
And rain makes me think of

538
00:26:23.275 --> 00:26:26.575
the Ryuko rock right here at Osaka Castle.

539
00:26:26.575 --> 00:26:27.875
What's that?

540
00:26:27.875 --> 00:26:29.475
You mean you don't know?

541
00:26:29.475 --> 00:26:31.375
Here at Osaka Castle,

542
00:26:31.375 --> 00:26:34.475
standing on both sides of the Sakura Gate, protecting the tower

543
00:26:34.475 --> 00:26:37.875
we have rocks called Ryuko Rocks.

544
00:26:37.875 --> 00:26:39.075
That's what they've been called since long ago

545
00:26:39.075 --> 00:26:40.975
because it's said that when it rains,

546
00:26:40.975 --> 00:26:43.675
the figures of a dragon and tiger appear on them.

547
00:26:43.675 --> 00:26:45.175
Rain.

548
00:26:46.975 --> 00:26:48.375
Let me borrow that for awhile!

549
00:26:48.975 --> 00:26:51.775
-What's going on? -That's evidence!

550
00:27:01.975 --> 00:27:04.475
Her story might just be true.

551
00:27:04.475 --> 00:27:05.475
Yeah.

552
00:27:05.475 --> 00:27:08.975
There's still a possibility it could be hidden somewhere.

553
00:27:08.975 --> 00:27:12.475
The treasure of Hideyoshi, the man called "Lord of Gold"...

554
00:27:12.475 --> 00:27:15.375
It's somewhere in Osaka Castle.

555
00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:19.875
Which means, Hideyoshi's treasure...

556
00:27:22.775 --> 00:27:24.275
Yeah, it's me.

557
00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:26.575
Don't make a move yet.

558
00:27:26.575 --> 00:27:29.275
It doesn't look like the cops will be leaving soon.

559
00:27:29.275 --> 00:27:30.675
Don't worry about it.

560
00:27:30.675 --> 00:27:32.875
The thing we want is right in front of me.

561
00:27:32.875 --> 00:27:35.075
Make sure you've got everything ready.

562
00:27:50.353 --> 00:27:55.153
What? You know what the treasure Hideyoshi left is?

563
00:27:55.153 --> 00:27:56.753
Are you sure?

564
00:27:56.753 --> 00:27:58.753
Yes, I'm pretty sure about it.

565
00:27:58.753 --> 00:28:03.153
The clue is the piece of pottery Mr. Kato had.

566
00:28:03.153 --> 00:28:04.153
Take a good look at it.

567
00:28:04.153 --> 00:28:06.453
There's just a little bit here and there,

568
00:28:06.453 --> 00:28:08.553
but you can see that there's gold stuck on the inside.

569
00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:09.953
You're right.

570
00:28:09.953 --> 00:28:11.653
But how do you knew there's a lot of treasure

571
00:28:11.653 --> 00:28:13.553
just by looking at this piece?

572
00:28:13.553 --> 00:28:16.653
Now, put it together with this scroll that Mr. Kato had

573
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:17.753
and look again carefully.

574
00:28:17.753 --> 00:28:20.253
But this scroll only has the word, "dragon"

575
00:28:20.253 --> 00:28:23.453
on the upper right hand written on it.

576
00:28:23.453 --> 00:28:25.253
What is this?

577
00:28:25.253 --> 00:28:26.453
Several sheets of paper

578
00:28:26.453 --> 00:28:29.853
were pasted over the word that was written there.

579
00:28:29.853 --> 00:28:32.153
It's just like the Ryuko Rocks at Osaka Castle,

580
00:28:32.153 --> 00:28:35.653
when you wet the paper, the word underneath appears.

581
00:28:35.653 --> 00:28:38.553
But most of the words have been burnt

582
00:28:38.553 --> 00:28:39.753
and you can't read them.

583
00:28:39.753 --> 00:28:42.653
And what about this? What's this drawing on the left?

584
00:28:42.653 --> 00:28:44.653
Isn't that a gourd?

585
00:28:44.653 --> 00:28:47.653
The gourd is the symbol on Hideyoshi's flag. It's his standard.

586
00:28:47.653 --> 00:28:49.753
-What? -So, is that mean

587
00:28:49.753 --> 00:28:53.553
that piece might have come from pottery shaped like a gourd?

588
00:28:53.553 --> 00:28:56.953
And are you saying that it was filled with gold?

589
00:28:56.953 --> 00:28:59.853
But according to this diagram,

590
00:28:59.853 --> 00:29:01.053
it was about one shaku high,

591
00:29:01.053 --> 00:29:04.053
which is only about 30 centimeters.

592
00:29:04.053 --> 00:29:05.553
No matter how much money you stuffed in it,

593
00:29:05.553 --> 00:29:07.953
it's so small, it wouldn't add up to much.

594
00:29:07.953 --> 00:29:10.753
Did you forget?

595
00:29:10.753 --> 00:29:13.853
It's been said that whenever General Hideyoshi won a battle,

596
00:29:13.853 --> 00:29:17.053
he added a small gourd

597
00:29:17.053 --> 00:29:18.853
and that's how his golden standard was created.

598
00:29:19.753 --> 00:29:22.053
The bottle gourds!

599
00:29:22.053 --> 00:29:23.953
Bottle gourds, you mean?

600
00:29:23.953 --> 00:29:25.453
Don't tell me...

601
00:29:25.453 --> 00:29:28.253
That's right. If there were 1,000 of the same thing,

602
00:29:28.253 --> 00:29:30.053
that would be some treasure!

603
00:29:30.053 --> 00:29:31.453
And if you were to consider the history behind it,

604
00:29:31.453 --> 00:29:33.953
it would be priceless.

605
00:29:33.953 --> 00:29:36.853
The burnt body 13 years ago had a piece,

606
00:29:36.853 --> 00:29:38.553
so did the other recent body

607
00:29:38.553 --> 00:29:41.953
and now Mr. Kato, it could mean that

608
00:29:41.953 --> 00:29:45.553
maybe they were after the treasure

609
00:29:45.553 --> 00:29:50.053
but they were killed by someone who wanted it all for themselves.

610
00:29:51.153 --> 00:29:52.953
I don't understand though.

611
00:29:52.953 --> 00:29:56.553
How did the Chief of Police and your father know

612
00:29:56.553 --> 00:29:59.453
that it meant a huge treasure just by looking at the two pieces?

613
00:29:59.453 --> 00:30:02.153
They hadn't seen the scroll yet.

614
00:30:02.153 --> 00:30:05.153
They probably knew by looking at the shape.

615
00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:07.853
The piece my father was looking at in the car

616
00:30:07.853 --> 00:30:10.253
looked like it came from the top of the gourd

617
00:30:10.253 --> 00:30:13.853
and he said the words "848" was written on it.

618
00:30:13.853 --> 00:30:19.753
I get it. 848 is a number between 1 and 1,000.

619
00:30:19.753 --> 00:30:24.153
If both of the pieces had gold stuck to them on the inside,

620
00:30:24.153 --> 00:30:27.153
that theory might be correct.

621
00:30:27.153 --> 00:30:29.953
But that sounds like a fairy tale.

622
00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:32.853
But it isn't entirely impossible.

623
00:30:32.853 --> 00:30:34.453
It's been said that even after Hideyoshi died,

624
00:30:34.453 --> 00:30:36.153
Ieyasu was intimidated by him

625
00:30:36.153 --> 00:30:40.353
because of all the gold and silver he'd stored in Osaka Castle.

626
00:30:40.353 --> 00:30:42.953
There's a legend that when Hideyoshi wanted

627
00:30:42.953 --> 00:30:45.553
to purify the water in the well,

628
00:30:45.553 --> 00:30:47.953
he put a huge amount of gold in the Kinmeisui

629
00:30:47.953 --> 00:30:48.953
directly in front of the tower.

630
00:30:48.953 --> 00:30:50.453
Even if that's true,

631
00:30:50.453 --> 00:30:52.953
what makes you think this is refers to hidden treasure?

632
00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:56.553
For all you know, this scroll could just be a blueprint.

633
00:30:56.553 --> 00:30:58.653
Stupid. Hiding gold in pottery

634
00:30:58.653 --> 00:31:01.553
and layering sheets of paper over the scroll

635
00:31:01.553 --> 00:31:04.653
is the proof someone deliberately wanted to hide something.

636
00:31:04.653 --> 00:31:06.953
That scroll's the dragons chapter.

637
00:31:06.953 --> 00:31:08.653
Which means, it's so obvious...

638
00:31:08.653 --> 00:31:11.253
About the tiger.

639
00:31:11.253 --> 00:31:14.653
If that scroll with the dragon is like the Ryuko Rock

640
00:31:14.653 --> 00:31:17.953
and the drawing of a gourd appeared when it got wet,

641
00:31:17.953 --> 00:31:20.853
then there should be a scroll with a tiger somewhere too.

642
00:31:20.853 --> 00:31:22.253
And what's more,

643
00:31:22.253 --> 00:31:24.353
there's two high possibility that scroll will show us

644
00:31:24.353 --> 00:31:26.053
where the gourds are hidden.

645
00:31:26.053 --> 00:31:28.753
Isn't that right, Heiji?

646
00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.653
Mr. Toyama!

647
00:31:30.653 --> 00:31:32.453
What brings you here?

648
00:31:32.453 --> 00:31:34.253
I gave him a call.

649
00:31:34.253 --> 00:31:36.353
The prefectural police's main headquarters is fight over there.

650
00:31:36.353 --> 00:31:37.353
Huh?

651
00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:40.753
It seemed to be linked to a case dad was involved in before.

652
00:31:40.753 --> 00:31:41.753
Besides, if I didn't do something like this,

653
00:31:41.753 --> 00:31:45.053
you'd never tear yourself away from this place, would you?

654
00:31:45.053 --> 00:31:47.653
She's gone and butted in again.

655
00:31:47.653 --> 00:31:50.953
Kazuha's right. Let us take care of this.

656
00:31:50.953 --> 00:31:52.553
Yes, listen to him.

657
00:31:52.553 --> 00:31:56.553
I know a real nice place in the Shimbashi direction of Osaka Castle.

658
00:31:56.553 --> 00:31:58.453
Let's have dinner there!

659
00:31:58.453 --> 00:32:02.153
Be quiet! Someone died right in front of our eyes!

660
00:32:02.153 --> 00:32:04.153
How can you stuff your face...

661
00:32:04.153 --> 00:32:07.053
I mean, have dinner. It wouldn't feel right, would it?

662
00:32:07.053 --> 00:32:09.353
So, you should just forget about me

663
00:32:09.353 --> 00:32:13.253
and have dinner with Ran. I won't mind, Kazuha.

664
00:32:14.053 --> 00:32:15.753
Forget you, then!

665
00:32:15.753 --> 00:32:18.053
Let's go, Ran! We'll just go without them!

666
00:32:19.453 --> 00:32:21.553
Wait a minute, Kazuha!

667
00:32:32.653 --> 00:32:34.053
Come on, let's go!

668
00:32:34.053 --> 00:32:36.653
It's a super delicious Italian restaurant!

669
00:32:36.653 --> 00:32:41.053
Excuse me, would it be all right if we got something to eat too?

670
00:32:41.053 --> 00:32:44.253
We haven't had anything to eat since lunch.

671
00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:46.853
My clothes got wet from the rain

672
00:32:46.853 --> 00:32:48.653
so I'm going to the hotel first and change.

673
00:32:48.653 --> 00:32:51.253
-Wait! -We'll be right back.

674
00:32:51.253 --> 00:32:53.753
The hotel we're staying in is close by.

675
00:32:54.853 --> 00:32:57.253
All right then, but don't be long!

676
00:33:00.553 --> 00:33:03.453
That voice... Could it be...

677
00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:11.053
-Hey, Otaki. -Yes, sir!

678
00:33:11.053 --> 00:33:12.353
Listen.

679
00:33:14.653 --> 00:33:18.053
Yes, sir. I'll tell my men right away.

680
00:33:18.053 --> 00:33:20.553
-Be careful. -Yes, sir!

681
00:33:26.853 --> 00:33:29.153
Heizo, it's me.

682
00:33:32.453 --> 00:33:33.953
You did it for Heiji, didn't you?

683
00:33:33.953 --> 00:33:36.253
Calling your father like that.

684
00:33:36.253 --> 00:33:39.553
You knew your father was deeply involved in that case

685
00:33:39.553 --> 00:33:42.053
so you figured if you called him in

686
00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:44.453
he'd fill Heiji in with all the information he'd be dying to know.

687
00:33:44.453 --> 00:33:46.653
But you didn't want him to catch on

688
00:33:46.653 --> 00:33:47.953
so you used that tone with him.

689
00:33:47.953 --> 00:33:51.253
So, what if I did? I love seeing it.

690
00:33:51.253 --> 00:33:53.253
I love seeing how his face glows

691
00:33:53.253 --> 00:33:55.753
whenever he solves a case.

692
00:33:55.753 --> 00:33:57.853
I'm such a fool, aren't I?

693
00:33:57.853 --> 00:33:59.753
Yes, a major fool!

694
00:33:59.753 --> 00:34:02.353
A major fool?

695
00:34:02.353 --> 00:34:04.253
And so am I.

696
00:34:07.153 --> 00:34:08.553
It's so frustrating,

697
00:34:08.553 --> 00:34:10.853
but there's something so wonderful about Shinichi

698
00:34:10.853 --> 00:34:12.953
when he gets like that.

699
00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:17.853
But only when he gets like that though.

700
00:34:17.853 --> 00:34:20.453
Isn't that right, Conan? You agree, don't you?

701
00:34:20.453 --> 00:34:24.453
Oh, no! I forgot to bring Conan along!

702
00:34:24.453 --> 00:34:26.153
You're right.

703
00:34:30.953 --> 00:34:32.953
Hey, Hattori.

704
00:34:32.953 --> 00:34:34.053
Take a look at this.

705
00:34:34.053 --> 00:34:36.253
I found something strange in a strange place.

706
00:34:36.253 --> 00:34:37.853
A battery?

707
00:34:37.853 --> 00:34:39.153
Wait a minute.

708
00:34:39.153 --> 00:34:42.353
If that came from when Mr. Kato burned up...

709
00:34:42.353 --> 00:34:45.353
Right. It was no suicide.

710
00:34:45.353 --> 00:34:47.253
It was murder.

711
00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.653
Don't worry about it.

712
00:34:50.653 --> 00:34:54.853
Heiji and your father are with him.

713
00:34:54.853 --> 00:34:58.553
Besides, there are a lot of police around here.

714
00:34:58.553 --> 00:35:00.553
Nothing's going to happen.
