1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.040
Ai looked good.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.540
She said that her fever already came down, too.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.440
I guess she can come to school on Monday.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.940
That's why we didn't have to go out of our way to visit her.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.740
As would be expected of the detective squad.

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.940
Thank you really so much.

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.840
Not at all, no problem.

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.940
No need to thank us.

9
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.240
For the silver detectives,

10
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.940
looking for stolen items is duck soup!

11
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.740
-Right, guys? -Yeah.

12
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.140
-Yes. -Yep.

13
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.440
They found the stolen bike, these elders.

14
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.940
I guess so.

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540
But, silver detectives...

16
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.840
We formed a group to protect the peace and safety of the people.

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.840
The silver detective squad!

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.740
In other words, a group of elderly detectives.

19
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard.

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.040
And move forward full speed without slowing down.

21
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.740
An unexpected rival finally appears

22
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.840
and throws a scare at the boys detective squad

23
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.240
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.540
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:05.236
"The Boy Detectives VS. the Silver Detectives"

27
00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:07.636
I see.

28
00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:11.136
So, you're the famous boys detective squad.

29
00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:13.236
Famous...

30
00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:16.636
I am Mutsuhiko Akasaka.

31
00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:18.436
Mutsuhiko?

32
00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:20.836
You're Mitsuhiko, right?

33
00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:22.736
Our names sound the same

34
00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:23.836
but the fact that we tend to stay conventional

35
00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.836
and refuse to take risks are quite similar, too.

36
00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:28.836
Refuse to take risks?

37
00:03:30.436 --> 00:03:33.136
I'm Ginta Oshima.

38
00:03:33.136 --> 00:03:34.436
Ginta?

39
00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:36.436
Yeah. Just like you,

40
00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:39.536
I'm nothing but a high-spirited big eater.

41
00:03:40.736 --> 00:03:43.436
Who's nothing but a big eater?

42
00:03:43.436 --> 00:03:45.636
I'm Yasuko Emoto.

43
00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:48.636
I'm just like you, Ayumi.

44
00:03:48.636 --> 00:03:51.436
All I do is scream, and am the only woman of the group.

45
00:03:53.136 --> 00:03:55.736
I do more than scream.

46
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:58.436
I'm Eitaro Tokunaga.

47
00:03:58.436 --> 00:04:03.636
Which means, I'm you? Conan?

48
00:04:03.636 --> 00:04:06.136
You don't have to go out of your way to overlay yourselves with us.

49
00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:09.036
So, the members of the silver detective squad!

50
00:04:09.036 --> 00:04:11.736
Let's head out to our safety patrol!

51
00:04:11.736 --> 00:04:13.336
Yeah...

52
00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:19.936
Kiddy detective squad vs. Silver detective squad.

53
00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:27.036
"The following day"

54
00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:29.936
-What is it? -It looks to be a case.

55
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.736
Let's contact Conan.

56
00:04:34.836 --> 00:04:38.836
I appreciate you letting us know about the incident.

57
00:04:38.836 --> 00:04:40.936
But, you people...

58
00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:42.236
What the?

59
00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:45.436
Are these old men the ones who first found the body?

60
00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:48.836
You...

61
00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:52.136
It looks like things are going to get complicated again.

62
00:04:52.136 --> 00:04:55.636
But how'd you find a body

63
00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:57.836
that was in somebody else's house?

64
00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:00.736
Well, just ahead from here,

65
00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:03.736
I saw a punk like man throwing a cigarette on the ground.

66
00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.036
Your cigarette...

67
00:05:06.336 --> 00:05:09.736
I cautioned him, and he fled after knocking me down.

68
00:05:09.736 --> 00:05:13.036
So, I called the members of the detective squad.

69
00:05:13.036 --> 00:05:16.136
We looked for that punk together.

70
00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:19.336
Over there!

71
00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:20.736
There he is!

72
00:05:22.836 --> 00:05:25.736
It seems he ran into that house.

73
00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:27.936
-Okay. -That house, right?

74
00:05:27.936 --> 00:05:29.436
That house.

75
00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:30.636
Yeah.

76
00:05:30.636 --> 00:05:33.736
And we split trying to look for him.

77
00:05:35.236 --> 00:05:36.836
What is it?

78
00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:43.736
This is a murder, no?

79
00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:45.636
Call the police...

80
00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:47.736
If he's still breathing, it's the ambulance.

81
00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:50.036
We've got to confirm.

82
00:05:50.036 --> 00:05:51.336
All right.

83
00:05:55.736 --> 00:05:58.536
-How about it? -Is he alive?

84
00:05:58.536 --> 00:06:00.236
No.

85
00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:01.936
He's dead.

86
00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:04.736
I see.

87
00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:06.936
The victim is the only son of this house,

88
00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:09.936
Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda, age 22.

89
00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.336
He was struck on the head with a statue.

90
00:06:12.336 --> 00:06:13.736
The time of death was

91
00:06:13.736 --> 00:06:16.636
about an hour before the four found him.

92
00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:19.736
And? What were you and the others

93
00:06:19.736 --> 00:06:22.636
scolded about from Inspector Megure?

94
00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:25.836
It was the first time I ever saw a murder site, so...

95
00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:28.936
I'm scared!

96
00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:36.336
He was probably struck with this!

97
00:06:37.536 --> 00:06:40.436
Probably with this corner.

98
00:06:40.436 --> 00:06:42.636
You went and messed up the site

99
00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:46.136
that was supposed to be preserved, the four of you.

100
00:06:46.136 --> 00:06:47.736
-I'm sorry. -Very sorry.

101
00:06:47.736 --> 00:06:49.836
-Sorry. -I'm very sorry.

102
00:06:49.836 --> 00:06:54.636
Hey, and what happened to the punk that you were looking for?

103
00:06:54.636 --> 00:06:55.636
What?

104
00:06:55.636 --> 00:06:58.136
That's right, I completely forgot.

105
00:06:58.136 --> 00:06:59.736
-Yeah. -Yeah.

106
00:06:59.736 --> 00:07:01.536
I guess he got away

107
00:07:01.536 --> 00:07:05.136
while we were being distracted by the murder.

108
00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:08.636
But I wonder why he ran just because he was cautioned

109
00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.936
not to throw his cigarette on the ground?

110
00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:14.536
Maybe he'd done something else, too.

111
00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:17.136
He looked really looked like trouble.

112
00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:19.536
He was wearing flashy sunglasses and an aloha shirt

113
00:07:19.536 --> 00:07:21.136
and his hair was dyed blonde.

114
00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:24.136
He had a scar, over here too.

115
00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:25.636
A scar?

116
00:07:25.636 --> 00:07:28.236
You see, like he was slashed with a knife or something.

117
00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:33.036
Now that you mentioned it. Yeah, he did.

118
00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.436
He was a tall man, wasn't he?

119
00:07:35.436 --> 00:07:38.236
It's true, he was tall.

120
00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:41.936
Yes, he was a tall young man.

121
00:07:45.836 --> 00:07:48.536
About the victim Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda,

122
00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:50.636
his reputation is the pits.

123
00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:53.236
He seemed to be a good-for-nothing that never had a decent job.

124
00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:54.436
Maybe he was sponging somebody for the money

125
00:07:54.436 --> 00:07:56.436
he used for his own pleasure.

126
00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:58.136
The crime could've been committed by the one

127
00:07:58.136 --> 00:08:01.336
was made to supply the cash.

128
00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:04.036
Let's crack the suspect on that line.

129
00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:05.236
Let's go!

130
00:08:05.236 --> 00:08:06.436
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

131
00:08:08.736 --> 00:08:13.636
This car of his was probably bought with the money.

132
00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:18.336
Rather, that's not for me to say, I guess.

133
00:08:18.336 --> 00:08:21.836
-We've got to recover our honor. -Yes.

134
00:08:21.836 --> 00:08:26.836
The perp is probably going to get rid of all inconvenient belongings.

135
00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:30.536
If we can find it, it'll probably lead us to the perp!

136
00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:31.936
Let's go!

137
00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:37.536
You wouldn't be able to find something like that

138
00:08:37.536 --> 00:08:39.336
only at your own convenience, right?

139
00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:41.436
Let's go ask around to see

140
00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:42.936
if there was anybody suspicious, too.

141
00:08:42.936 --> 00:08:44.536
-Let's. -Yeah!

142
00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:47.936
They're in complete rival mode.

143
00:08:51.036 --> 00:08:52.336
If getting rid of anything,

144
00:08:52.336 --> 00:08:55.536
it would be fastest to throw it in a river or something.

145
00:09:03.736 --> 00:09:06.836
This is what that punk was wearing.

146
00:09:06.836 --> 00:09:08.336
What?

147
00:09:09.936 --> 00:09:11.436
This stain...

148
00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:14.636
This must be...

149
00:09:20.236 --> 00:09:22.636
Seems they got nothing.

150
00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:33.136
Hey, did you find it?

151
00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:35.136
Huh? Oh, yeah.

152
00:09:35.136 --> 00:09:37.136
The silver detectives

153
00:09:37.136 --> 00:09:40.636
found sunglasses that had blood stains on it.

154
00:09:40.636 --> 00:09:42.336
We checked and found out that the blood stain

155
00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:45.036
was that of the victim Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda!

156
00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:46.536
What?

157
00:09:46.536 --> 00:09:49.636
In other words, the one who committed this crime

158
00:09:49.636 --> 00:09:53.236
was the punk that we were pursuing.

159
00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:54.336
Yes...

160
00:09:55.236 --> 00:10:00.536
He snuck into that house, killed the victim and fled.

161
00:10:00.536 --> 00:10:02.136
But he realized that

162
00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:05.736
he left something behind at the scene of the crime,

163
00:10:05.736 --> 00:10:08.636
He rushed and came back, got rid of the evidence

164
00:10:08.636 --> 00:10:10.836
and fled once again.

165
00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:16.336
The perp who realized that

166
00:10:16.336 --> 00:10:19.836
the blood of the victim was left behind on the sunglasses

167
00:10:19.836 --> 00:10:23.436
threw it into this dry riverbed to get rid of the evidence.

168
00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.936
At least what he's saying is logical.

169
00:10:25.936 --> 00:10:28.236
True.

170
00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:31.336
And? What are the characteristics of that punk?

171
00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:33.636
He was blonde and wearing an aloha shirt.

172
00:10:33.636 --> 00:10:36.236
He had a scar like this over here.

173
00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:38.336
He was really tall.

174
00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:41.136
And a young man.

175
00:10:41.136 --> 00:10:43.036
Okay! Let's get to it right away!

176
00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:49.636
They've made a great discovery even after finding the stolen bike!

177
00:10:49.636 --> 00:10:52.636
Yes, they beat us to it.

178
00:10:52.636 --> 00:10:55.336
How depressing.

179
00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:57.336
What's the matter, Conan?

180
00:10:57.336 --> 00:11:00.436
Don't you think that the story's too well made?

181
00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:01.436
What?

182
00:11:01.436 --> 00:11:04.136
Well, if you look at it in that light,

183
00:11:04.136 --> 00:11:05.736
maybe the story does sound a bit too well made, but...

184
00:11:05.736 --> 00:11:10.036
Those old people were really lucky, weren't they?

185
00:11:10.036 --> 00:11:12.736
Besides, I wonder why they decided

186
00:11:12.736 --> 00:11:15.336
to form a detective squad to begin with anyway?

187
00:11:18.836 --> 00:11:21.736
Something bothers me.

188
00:11:32.328 --> 00:11:35.628
What? Are you talking about yesterday's bike thief?

189
00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:38.928
Yep. How was he found?

190
00:11:38.928 --> 00:11:47.328
Well, Mr. Tokunaga heard that a red bike had been stolen.

191
00:11:47.328 --> 00:11:50.028
And we all went out to look for it!

192
00:11:50.028 --> 00:11:52.728
Mr. Tokunaga deduced that a thief would probably

193
00:11:52.728 --> 00:11:55.328
disposed of the bike that he stole in a certain specified place.

194
00:11:55.328 --> 00:11:56.828
And he was right!

195
00:11:56.828 --> 00:12:00.228
I see. So Mr. Tokunaga made the deduction.

196
00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:07.328
Nope. I only told the police about my bike being stolen.

197
00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:10.328
And yet they knew it was stolen.

198
00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:12.728
I tell you, detectives are really something.

199
00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:14.328
Thank you.

200
00:12:16.628 --> 00:12:19.528
Let's split up and check.

201
00:12:19.528 --> 00:12:20.928
-Okay! -Okay!

202
00:12:26.928 --> 00:12:29.328
We're all gathered.

203
00:12:29.328 --> 00:12:31.228
Then, let me start.

204
00:12:31.228 --> 00:12:35.828
The silver detective squad was formed about a month ago.

205
00:12:35.828 --> 00:12:39.328
Mr. Tokunaga called out for members on the city newsletter.

206
00:12:39.328 --> 00:12:40.428
This is the one, right?

207
00:12:40.428 --> 00:12:41.628
"Looking for members!"

208
00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:43.428
So, it was him after all.

209
00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:48.028
And as to why he decided to form a detective squad...

210
00:12:49.028 --> 00:12:51.128
I know why!

211
00:12:51.128 --> 00:12:52.328
What?

212
00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:53.628
Just about that time,

213
00:12:53.628 --> 00:12:57.828
the person who was living in the apartment next door passed away.

214
00:12:57.828 --> 00:13:00.628
A granny living alone called Tae Kano

215
00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:03.628
fell from the station stairs and hit her head.

216
00:13:03.628 --> 00:13:05.428
It seems she was on her way back home from the bank

217
00:13:05.428 --> 00:13:08.628
after she had withdrawn 3 million yen,

218
00:13:08.628 --> 00:13:12.128
so she was probably pushed down by somebody who was after her money.

219
00:13:12.128 --> 00:13:14.828
That's why in order to look for that perp,

220
00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:17.928
Mr. Tokunaga formed a detective squad.

221
00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:21.328
Too bad, but that's not possible.

222
00:13:21.328 --> 00:13:22.828
Why not?

223
00:13:22.828 --> 00:13:27.528
That granny called Mrs. Kano died of an accident.

224
00:13:27.528 --> 00:13:29.728
She accidentally fell off the stairs

225
00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:32.728
because she had one broken leg.

226
00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:36.828
What? She wasn't pushed off?

227
00:13:36.828 --> 00:13:40.528
I see. It seems she broke her leg

228
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.128
because she was hit slightly by a car a few days ago.

229
00:13:43.128 --> 00:13:47.928
Maybe Mr. Tokunaga formed the silver detective squad

230
00:13:47.928 --> 00:13:51.528
to go and look for the reckless car driver.

231
00:13:51.528 --> 00:13:54.128
Nope. I think that's not right either.

232
00:13:54.128 --> 00:13:55.528
What?

233
00:13:55.528 --> 00:13:59.628
Because the identity of the driver of that car is known.

234
00:13:59.628 --> 00:14:02.228
It seems to be that person called Kiyomasa Kuroda

235
00:14:02.228 --> 00:14:04.528
who was struck on the head and murdered!

236
00:14:04.528 --> 00:14:06.628
-Huh? -What?

237
00:14:06.628 --> 00:14:10.128
But it seems he really treated her with all his heart,

238
00:14:10.128 --> 00:14:13.528
so it seems she didn't even report the incident to the police.

239
00:14:13.528 --> 00:14:17.228
A few days later, that person passes away.

240
00:14:17.228 --> 00:14:20.228
After withdrawing a large sun of 3 million yen?

241
00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:25.328
Don't tell me that the money was...

242
00:14:25.328 --> 00:14:26.528
Maybe he was sponging somebody for the money

243
00:14:26.528 --> 00:14:28.228
he used for his own pleasure.

244
00:14:28.928 --> 00:14:30.128
A very good attitude,

245
00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:32.828
the exact opposite of the reputation his neighborhood had of him.

246
00:14:34.528 --> 00:14:37.928
This plot was thought out to work this way to begin with.

247
00:14:37.928 --> 00:14:39.328
I see.

248
00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:43.128
Conan?

249
00:14:43.128 --> 00:14:44.928
Did you figure something out?

250
00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:46.428
Tell us!

251
00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:50.228
As to the punk, all except Mr. Tokunaga,

252
00:14:50.228 --> 00:14:53.628
the way the three replied didn't sound too reliable.

253
00:14:53.628 --> 00:14:54.828
Yes.

254
00:14:54.828 --> 00:14:57.528
That's wasn't because of their age,

255
00:14:57.528 --> 00:15:01.228
but it was the "Emperor's Snuff-Box".

256
00:15:01.228 --> 00:15:02.928
What's that?

257
00:15:02.928 --> 00:15:05.428
A thing to put a key and cigarette inside?

258
00:15:05.428 --> 00:15:08.628
The "Emperor's Snuff-Box" is

259
00:15:08.628 --> 00:15:12.428
a mystery novel that was written by John Dickson Carr,

260
00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:14.128
the so-called master of "locked room mysteries",

261
00:15:14.128 --> 00:15:16.028
a detective novels writer.

262
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:24.128
We can't find that punk.

263
00:15:24.128 --> 00:15:25.728
I wonder where he went?

264
00:15:25.728 --> 00:15:27.728
I think it's a waste of time.

265
00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:33.328
No matter how much you look for him, you'll never find him.

266
00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:35.128
What?

267
00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:37.528
What do you say that, Conan?

268
00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:42.128
Was that punk really blonde and wearing an aloha shirt?

269
00:15:42.128 --> 00:15:44.228
Right.

270
00:15:44.228 --> 00:15:47.428
Did he really have a scar here?

271
00:15:47.428 --> 00:15:49.328
Was he tall?

272
00:15:49.328 --> 00:15:51.728
Was he a young man?

273
00:15:51.728 --> 00:15:53.928
Yes, correct...

274
00:15:53.928 --> 00:15:57.028
Then, tell us what kind of aloha shirt it was.

275
00:15:58.028 --> 00:16:00.928
There were palm trees on it.

276
00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:02.528
-It was yellow. -It was bright red.

277
00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:03.728
What?

278
00:16:03.728 --> 00:16:06.928
You're all saying different things.

279
00:16:06.928 --> 00:16:09.128
That's because...

280
00:16:09.128 --> 00:16:12.328
There's a famous mystery novel.

281
00:16:12.328 --> 00:16:14.828
Although you actually didn't see it,

282
00:16:14.828 --> 00:16:17.828
if somebody keeps telling you, you did,

283
00:16:17.828 --> 00:16:20.628
you feel like you actually saw it.

284
00:16:22.928 --> 00:16:25.028
You couldn't have seen him.

285
00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:28.628
Because he doesn't exist to begin with.

286
00:16:28.628 --> 00:16:31.328
Isn't that right, Mr. Tokunaga?

287
00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:36.028
Just what do you mean?

288
00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:39.928
Mr. Tokunaga, you got to know the guy called Mr. Kiyomasa Kuroda

289
00:16:39.928 --> 00:16:41.328
who was killed, didn't you?

290
00:16:41.328 --> 00:16:45.328
After Mrs. Tae Kano was hit by him.

291
00:16:46.428 --> 00:16:49.028
Who's that? Mrs. Tae Kano?

292
00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:51.428
Rather, Mr. Tokunaga...

293
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:54.228
Did you know him? That victim?

294
00:16:58.928 --> 00:17:02.028
Mr. Tokunaga probably couldn't forgive Mr. Kuroda.

295
00:17:03.728 --> 00:17:07.728
Mr. Kuroda deliberately bumped into Mrs. Tae Kano with his car.

296
00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:11.328
Then after faking to be of good character,

297
00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:13.528
he grasps Mrs. Kano's heart.

298
00:17:13.528 --> 00:17:15.528
He deceives her using all of his sweet talking tactics available

299
00:17:15.528 --> 00:17:17.528
to sponge money out of her.

300
00:17:23.628 --> 00:17:27.728
Mrs. Kano went to withdraw the money and died,

301
00:17:27.728 --> 00:17:31.728
so as a result, it's as if she died because of Mr. Kuroda's evil doings.

302
00:17:32.528 --> 00:17:36.528
That's why Mr. Tokunaga decided to take revenge on Mr. Kuroda.

303
00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:37.928
To kill him.

304
00:17:37.928 --> 00:17:39.828
What?

305
00:17:39.828 --> 00:17:41.928
You're just making things up.

306
00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:43.928
I wouldn't do such...

307
00:17:43.928 --> 00:17:46.728
You didn't want anyone to witness you,

308
00:17:46.728 --> 00:17:50.728
so you decided to kill him in this house.

309
00:17:50.728 --> 00:17:52.228
I'd be arrested

310
00:17:52.228 --> 00:17:56.028
because stuff like hair would inevitably be left behind.

311
00:17:56.028 --> 00:18:00.028
That's why you decided to be the first to discover the corpse, no?

312
00:18:00.028 --> 00:18:02.528
In order to make everyone believe that

313
00:18:02.528 --> 00:18:04.428
no matter what you dropped at the site,

314
00:18:04.428 --> 00:18:06.428
you dropped it when you found the corpse.

315
00:18:07.828 --> 00:18:11.928
But the police would most naturally suspect the first discoverer,

316
00:18:11.928 --> 00:18:13.628
so being alone wouldn't do you good.

317
00:18:13.628 --> 00:18:17.028
In order to discover the body, you'd have to go into the premises,

318
00:18:17.028 --> 00:18:19.728
so you'd need a reason to do so, too.

319
00:18:19.728 --> 00:18:23.428
So, you came up with the idea of forming a detective squad.

320
00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:28.828
You waited for an opportunity and today,

321
00:18:28.828 --> 00:18:30.628
when Mr. Kuroda was alone in his house

322
00:18:30.628 --> 00:18:32.928
since his family went on a trip,

323
00:18:32.928 --> 00:18:36.028
you thought of an excuse to visit this house.

324
00:18:36.028 --> 00:18:39.728
And when he was off his guard, you killed him.

325
00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:41.828
You left the crime scene once

326
00:18:41.828 --> 00:18:43.328
and disposed of Mr. Kuroda's sunglasses

327
00:18:43.328 --> 00:18:46.128
with blood stains on it into the dry riverbed

328
00:18:46.128 --> 00:18:49.528
and called the members of the detective squad and instigated them.

329
00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:52.928
It seems he ran into that house.

330
00:18:52.928 --> 00:18:55.128
-Okay. -That house, right?

331
00:18:55.128 --> 00:18:56.228
That house.

332
00:18:56.228 --> 00:18:57.628
Yeah.

333
00:18:57.628 --> 00:18:59.828
Using a non-existing search for a punk,

334
00:18:59.828 --> 00:19:01.828
you got into the grounds of the Kuroda residence,

335
00:19:01.828 --> 00:19:04.728
and became the first discovers of the body together.

336
00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:07.128
You pretended to play detective,

337
00:19:07.128 --> 00:19:09.428
and moreover, tried to erase the fingerprints of the perp

338
00:19:09.428 --> 00:19:11.828
that was never there to begin,

339
00:19:11.828 --> 00:19:15.728
by saying you did so by mistake.

340
00:19:15.728 --> 00:19:16.828
In other words,

341
00:19:16.828 --> 00:19:19.128
the silver detective squad was something you formed

342
00:19:19.128 --> 00:19:21.328
in order to find the corpse together with the members of the group

343
00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:25.828
and to keep yourself from being suspected.

344
00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:28.528
That is, you formed it only as a front to hide your crime, no?

345
00:19:28.528 --> 00:19:30.828
Mr. Tokunaga, you...

346
00:19:30.828 --> 00:19:32.228
Can't be...

347
00:19:32.228 --> 00:19:34.528
Is what this boy is saying...

348
00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:37.128
Conan.

349
00:19:37.128 --> 00:19:40.028
In order to frame a non-existent punk up as the perp,

350
00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:42.728
you needed to find the sunglasses.

351
00:19:42.728 --> 00:19:45.328
But finding something so needed all of a sudden like that

352
00:19:45.328 --> 00:19:47.028
would be too convenient,

353
00:19:47.028 --> 00:19:49.228
so you performed an achievement beforehand.

354
00:19:49.228 --> 00:19:52.028
That is, you stole a bike, then pretended to find it.

355
00:19:52.028 --> 00:19:54.528
You acted out a one-man show.

356
00:19:54.528 --> 00:19:58.828
To begin with, I've never seen that victim before today.

357
00:19:58.828 --> 00:20:03.128
But, you knew, which car was Mr. Kuroda's.

358
00:20:05.428 --> 00:20:09.428
This car of his was probably bought with the money.

359
00:20:10.528 --> 00:20:11.928
It's because you were waiting for an opportunity

360
00:20:11.928 --> 00:20:13.828
to go after him, right?

361
00:20:16.028 --> 00:20:18.328
The police would eventually realize

362
00:20:18.328 --> 00:20:21.828
that the person who first discovered the body and the victim

363
00:20:21.828 --> 00:20:23.928
had a common point of contact.

364
00:20:23.928 --> 00:20:25.328
Once they realize that,

365
00:20:25.328 --> 00:20:27.528
they won't take things as being coincidental.

366
00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:30.328
If they narrow the investigation down to you, Mr. Tokunaga,

367
00:20:30.328 --> 00:20:32.728
an absolute concrete evidence would surely come up.

368
00:20:32.728 --> 00:20:35.128
If that happens, it's too late.

369
00:20:35.128 --> 00:20:37.328
But, if now, you may still make it in time.

370
00:20:37.328 --> 00:20:40.328
If you go to the police before they suspect you,

371
00:20:40.328 --> 00:20:42.328
you'd be turning yourself in, right?

372
00:20:42.328 --> 00:20:44.828
That will make your sentence lighter, wouldn't it?

373
00:20:46.428 --> 00:20:48.528
You're...

374
00:20:48.528 --> 00:20:52.228
We just want you to compensate for what you've done.

375
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:55.728
Mr. Tokunaga.

376
00:20:56.828 --> 00:20:59.528
When Mrs. Kano passed away,

377
00:20:59.528 --> 00:21:02.228
I came here to visit Kuroda.

378
00:21:03.828 --> 00:21:06.928
If only she didn't hurt her leg...

379
00:21:06.928 --> 00:21:11.428
All I want is for you to come offer her incense.

380
00:21:11.428 --> 00:21:13.128
Talk of a useless old hag.

381
00:21:13.128 --> 00:21:17.128
I wish she would've croaked after giving me the money.

382
00:21:17.128 --> 00:21:19.428
That 3 million yen...

383
00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:23.428
All I need to do is hook another prey with my car again.

384
00:21:26.228 --> 00:21:29.628
I found out then, that everything was schemed to begin with.

385
00:21:29.628 --> 00:21:32.528
I couldn't help, feeling sympathetic towards Mrs. Kano.

386
00:21:34.128 --> 00:21:38.228
I'm sorry. That's why I used you people.

387
00:21:38.228 --> 00:21:41.328
That's okay already. More importantly...

388
00:21:41.328 --> 00:21:43.428
Let's go to the police.

389
00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:45.628
We'll go with you.

390
00:21:45.628 --> 00:21:48.028
Before it's too late.

391
00:21:50.428 --> 00:21:52.828
You guys...

392
00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:54.828
Thank you.

393
00:23:22.328 --> 00:23:24.728
Hey! What's up?

394
00:23:24.728 --> 00:23:27.828
They're saying they want to join the boys detective squad.

395
00:23:27.828 --> 00:23:28.828
What?

396
00:23:28.828 --> 00:23:31.028
Please let me join you!

397
00:23:31.028 --> 00:23:33.228
I'll treat you to eels over rice!

398
00:23:33.228 --> 00:23:36.028
I'll try not to scream!

399
00:23:38.228 --> 00:23:41.228
Hey, wait! Please!

400
00:23:43.628 --> 00:23:46.328
Boy, if they can run that fast,

401
00:23:46.328 --> 00:23:48.528
I don't think they need a silver pass.

402
00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:52.328
"Next Episode" -Darn it!

403
00:23:52.328 --> 00:23:54.528
I can't figure it out at all!

404
00:23:54.528 --> 00:23:58.328
Those people... I wonder what they're looking at?

405
00:23:58.328 --> 00:24:01.028
It's probably the spring mirage.

406
00:24:01.028 --> 00:24:03.728
Uozu is known for mirages, you see.

407
00:24:04.928 --> 00:24:06.528
That's it!

408
00:24:15.328 --> 00:24:20.828
Next Conan, "An Angel Vanishes in the Mirage"

409
00:24:36.428 --> 00:24:38.728
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:41.328
"Digital camera"

411
00:24:41.328 --> 00:24:43.628
-Unconventional. -Eating moderately.

412
00:24:43.628 --> 00:24:45.928
-Quite subdued. -Can't do.
