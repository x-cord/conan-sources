1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,970
This is a great location!

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,070
"Kei Nakanishi (26)" -It's the pride of the locals.

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,170
And it's such a nice clear day, too.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,270
Yes.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,170
You really came to visit on such a nice day.

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,370
It would've been a fantastic drive

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,970
if you weren't tagging along, though.

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,770
Ran asked me to come with you, so I had to.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,970
She asked me to keep an eye on you

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,270
so that you wouldn't get all carried away.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,570
All I'm going to do is

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,770
have Ms. Nakanishi show me around here and there.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,070
Really?

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,670
What?

15
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,270
Give that back to me, brat!

16
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,270
How dare you steal it?

17
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,070
I found it on the ground.

18
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,070
What's this passionate conversation about?

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,570
A heart mark's written at the end, too.

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,570
Well... That's... You see...

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,070
That's hilarious.

22
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,270
I'm glad you seem to have gotten over it already.

23
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,970
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Mouri.

24
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,370
This is a rare case in which

25
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,470
you really helped somebody out. Right, Pops?

26
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,970
It's a first.

27
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,370
I mean... Idiot!

28
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,970
Pops, the light's green!

29
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,470
Right!

30
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,470
A canvas stained black with crime.

31
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,970
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,170
I'm the third wheel on a three people drive.

33
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,470
Where will the cheerful conversation lead to?

34
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,070
He sees through the one and only truth.

35
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:26,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

36
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,270
His name is Detective Conan!

37
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:19,827
"Turning Point On A Driving Date"

38
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,127
If I remember correctly, I think it was six months ago, right?

39
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:27,227
Yeah. When I went to Haido Kitacho for work,

40
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:29,027
I coincidentally ran into her.

41
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:32,827
A woman named Remi Kirisaki was found hanging

42
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:36,627
"Remi Kirisaki (30)" -in her room at her apartment.

43
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:39,827
"Kiyomi Fukurai (58)" -She moved here three months ago,

44
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:43,127
but since then she's been saying that she wanted to die,

45
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:45,927
over and over.

46
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:49,027
I used to live next to her and she always say that to me, too.

47
00:03:49,027 --> 00:03:52,627
Through the landlady and Ms. Kei Nakanishi's testimonies,

48
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:54,427
as well as the suicide note that was found,

49
00:03:54,427 --> 00:03:56,927
it was apparent she had committed suicide.

50
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:58,327
And on top of that,

51
00:03:58,327 --> 00:03:59,627
her handwriting on the rental agreement

52
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:01,927
matched the writing of the suicide note.

53
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:05,827
Kei blames herself for the death of her neighbor.

54
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,427
It's my fault.

55
00:04:08,427 --> 00:04:12,427
Because I couldn't convince her to not commit suicide.

56
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:15,027
Stop blaming yourself.

57
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,227
But...

58
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:19,727
She's the one who made the final decision to commit suicide.

59
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,727
You're not responsible.

60
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:27,427
You don't know how much what you said meant to me.

61
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,627
That's why I sent you the thank you letter.

62
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,227
I'm currently in my hometown

63
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:35,727
helping out at the resort inn my Uncle and Aunt have opened.

64
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:38,327
It's a nice place with mountains and beaches.

65
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:41,427
Please do stop by if you're in the area.

66
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,827
So that's why you shamelessly came over.

67
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,527
Shamelessly?

68
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:49,827
Oh, my.

69
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:52,927
What's going on? It was smooth riding all the way here.

70
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:58,527
But why did the suicide of Ms. Kirisaki bother you so much, Kei?

71
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,727
She just happened to be your neighbor, right?

72
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,127
That's right.

73
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:05,727
They were really good friends.

74
00:05:05,727 --> 00:05:07,827
How did you know?

75
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:12,827
About a week later, I went to that apartment again.

76
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:14,727
To check on how you were doing.

77
00:05:14,727 --> 00:05:17,627
But you had already moved.

78
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:19,927
I had plans to move from before.

79
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,627
Yes, the landlady told me.

80
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:25,727
That's when I heard about the small fire incident, too.

81
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,127
That's why.

82
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,627
Small fire incident?

83
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,427
There seems to have been a small fire incident

84
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,027
right near the apartment.

85
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:35,227
Fire! Fire!

86
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,627
Fire!

87
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:40,227
Where's the fire?

88
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:41,527
What?

89
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,727
She told me she was surprised

90
00:05:44,727 --> 00:05:46,027
because you came out of Ms. Kirisaki's room.

91
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:48,727
I went to visit her at her room

92
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:51,127
but she said she forgot something and went out.

93
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:54,927
And so, you ended up watching the room for her.

94
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:58,727
Well, I guess you two were close enough to come and go to each other's.

95
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,127
It's understandable that you were shocked

96
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,827
when Ms. Kirisaki committed suicide then, Kei.

97
00:06:06,127 --> 00:06:07,627
Watch out, you idiot!

98
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:11,827
What's with that look?

99
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:13,627
Here you go!

100
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:16,627
Hey, hey. Even kids don't do that nowadays.

101
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:22,227
But why did the person called Ms. Remi Kirisaki

102
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:25,627
contemplate committing suicide in the first place?

103
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:28,527
I asked her that, too.

104
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:31,327
The day after the article of her committing suicide made the papers,

105
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:33,127
it seems that a man came over.

106
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,927
Are you sure it's her?

107
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:37,227
Yes.

108
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:39,727
"Eiji Kamatari (32)" -That debt making non-paying woman

109
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,827
fled in here this time?

110
00:06:42,827 --> 00:06:46,127
In other words, she got tired of running from debt collectors

111
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:47,727
and committed suicide.

112
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:49,227
So that was it.

113
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:52,327
Thanks to you, I finally understand.

114
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,527
No, no. He's just conveying the landlady's story.

115
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:57,927
I know even more.

116
00:06:57,927 --> 00:06:59,727
It seems that she's been using aliases

117
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:02,927
since two years ago and fleeing around.

118
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:07,227
Mayuko Hayashi, Miyuki Wada, Kaori Inuyama.

119
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,827
She's been changing names one after the other!

120
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:12,727
And even though that brassy woman wouldn't pay off her debts,

121
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:14,727
she played Pachinko all the time!

122
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,927
She used aliases since two years ago?

123
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:21,927
Then I wonder why she rented that apartment under her real name?

124
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:23,727
I have no idea.

125
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,627
Besides, Pops.

126
00:07:25,627 --> 00:07:28,027
Calling her a brassy woman,

127
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:30,527
somehow it doesn't sound like a description of the same person

128
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,427
that Kei and the landlady are talking about.

129
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:36,427
There's no mistake that it's Remi Kirisaki herself.

130
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:37,927
The relatives who were called

131
00:07:37,927 --> 00:07:41,027
came to confirm her corpse and take her with them.

132
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:44,427
Then it couldn't have been a stand-in.

133
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:45,927
Interesting boy, aren't you?

134
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,227
He's just a cheeky brat.

135
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:52,327
What's this? A police checkpoint?

136
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:56,827
We're sorry to bother you

137
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:59,527
"Tan Yamazumi (35)" -but there was a robbery in the city.

138
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:04,027
The perp has a mustache, is well-built,

139
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:06,127
and is fleeing on a white sedan!

140
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,727
He matches the description perfectly.

141
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,527
-What? -You'll get out of the car without resisting, will you?

142
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:13,427
No, I'm...

143
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,127
Yes.

144
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,327
What? The car was abandoned?

145
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:22,327
See! Like I told you, I'm the great Detective Kogoro Mouri!

146
00:08:22,327 --> 00:08:24,027
You mean that famous...

147
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,827
I'm... I'm very sorry!

148
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:30,227
You made it through safely.

149
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:32,227
Cut that strange talk of yours out!

150
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:34,027
You two make a great pair.

151
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:40,227
It'll be at least a two hour wait.

152
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:44,027
I'll go ask because I know the owner of the place.

153
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,227
No, we can try another place.

154
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:50,527
That guy.

155
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,227
That's all he wanted to do?

156
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:18,627
He's crazy to go out of his way to do that.

157
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:20,827
This sure is a great drive.

158
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,027
You get mistaken for a robber.

159
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,327
Looks like it's going to rain.

160
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:27,327
It's because we were talking about that apartment.

161
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:30,327
-What? -That place is cursed after all.

162
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:32,227
The apartment is cursed?

163
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:36,627
Real estate agents are the one who usually introduce apartments, right?

164
00:09:36,627 --> 00:09:41,627
But it seems that Remi Kirisaki asked the landlady directly

165
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,027
if there are any rooms available.

166
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:47,327
I'm sure she was lured to that apartment.

167
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:50,827
"If you're going to commit suicide, do it here."

168
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:52,727
I'm sure it was just coincidence.

169
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:55,227
Kei fell victim to it, too.

170
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,027
She came back here six months ago,

171
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:03,027
but she was originally planning to come back three months ago.

172
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:05,427
And she was just about to move out.

173
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:10,027
My uncle decided to postpone the opening of the resort inn by three months.

174
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,527
You will be jobless if you move out now.

175
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:15,927
No problem. You can stay here for another three months.

176
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:19,927
Right! Someone is going to move into the room next to yours tomorrow.

177
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:21,127
Is that right?

178
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,027
I hope the person's a nice person.

179
00:10:24,427 --> 00:10:26,627
Right after she postpone her schedule,

180
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:31,127
Remi Kirisaki moved in and committed suicide three months later.

181
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:34,027
In other words, if things moved along as originally planned,

182
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:37,227
Kei wouldn't have been involved in something sad

183
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:39,127
like the suicide of her next door neighbor.

184
00:10:40,427 --> 00:10:42,527
The apartment stopped Kei from leaving.

185
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:46,927
It made her go through something very sad.

186
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:48,427
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,927
It's nothing.

188
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,627
And how did the negotiation go?

189
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:54,727
It went well.

190
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:58,827
I told him that you were precious guests who came from Tokyo.

191
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,427
Precious guests!

192
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:08,627
Boy, that was good.

193
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,327
It was delicious.

194
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,727
And Mr. Mouri,

195
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:15,327
I'd like to show you around here now.

196
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,827
An amusement park! Sounds good!

197
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:19,927
Nothing tops this.

198
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,627
I'll go get some tea.

199
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,727
Why do they have this stuff in such a rural area like this?

200
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,327
This is a fantastic drive after all, isn't it?

201
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,927
This is the resort inn where Kei works.

202
00:11:38,827 --> 00:11:40,427
But she just said a while ago that...

203
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,227
What's going on?

204
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:49,227
It was such a clear day until just a while ago.

205
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:51,927
It's probably just a passing shower.

206
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:53,927
I hope so.

207
00:11:59,127 --> 00:12:00,927
It really cleared up!

208
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:03,627
The view is great after the rain lets up, too.

209
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:06,527
I wish it would keep on raining forever.

210
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,627
What kind of person was Ms. Remi Kirisaki?

211
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:11,127
Not that topic again!

212
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,927
She's a brassy woman, okay?

213
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:16,627
Not that. I'm wondering what she looked like.

214
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:19,527
She had long hair with a perm.

215
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:20,627
Did she wear glasses?

216
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,427
Nope, she didn't.

217
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:23,627
Was she fat?

218
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:25,727
She was rather on the skinny side.

219
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,227
Skinnier than you?

220
00:12:27,227 --> 00:12:28,527
About the same, I guess.

221
00:12:28,527 --> 00:12:31,627
Was she taller or shorter than you?

222
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,827
I think we were about the same height, too.

223
00:12:33,827 --> 00:12:34,927
But why do you ask?

224
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,127
That's right.

225
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:38,327
Just what do you want to know at this point?

226
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,927
It's over there, Mr. Mouri!

227
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:48,427
It's huge.

228
00:12:48,427 --> 00:12:50,927
No doubt about it.

229
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,927
That suicide was probably...

230
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:09,694
How dare that brat take her away like that?

231
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,194
Do you have a boyfriend, Kei?

232
00:13:17,394 --> 00:13:18,894
I did in the past.

233
00:13:18,894 --> 00:13:23,694
But he died three years ago of an illness.

234
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:27,794
Staying in Tokyo reminds me of him.

235
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:30,794
So I made up my mind to return here.

236
00:13:36,994 --> 00:13:39,194
At last, it's just the two of us.

237
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,794
Is it okay to leave Conan all by himself?

238
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:45,594
It can't be helped since this is a two-seater boat.

239
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,894
It's getting exciting.

240
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:53,094
Are you all right?

241
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,394
I'm perfectly fine, I think.

242
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:03,994
So what on earth is her motive?

243
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,594
The next one is what I recommend most.

244
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:11,994
The cliff of Shikabanezaki.

245
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:13,094
The time has finally come!

246
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:18,394
The final place has to be the sea coast after all.

247
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:19,994
For her to have gone that far,

248
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:21,594
something really tragic must have happened.

249
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:25,994
They caught the guy.

250
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:27,394
Looks like it.

251
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:33,194
We're sorry to have troubled you, but we somehow arrested him.

252
00:14:33,194 --> 00:14:36,194
I thought you said the perp had a mustache?

253
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,994
I disguised myself by using a fake mustache.

254
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,294
That's nothing to boast about!

255
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:46,094
Well built...

256
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,794
No matter how well you disguise yourself,

257
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:50,494
you can't do anything about the physique, can you?

258
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:52,394
I guess not.

259
00:14:52,394 --> 00:14:54,294
What?

260
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,394
Let's go to Shikabanezaki, the goal, the sea coast!

261
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:59,594
Okay.

262
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:10,594
It's so beautiful and refreshing.

263
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:12,094
Yes.

264
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:14,494
There's no room for evil thoughts.

265
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:19,594
Thank you so much for everything today.

266
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:21,294
Not at all. Thank you.

267
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:23,894
Gosh. There's no more time to think.

268
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:26,994
He has to drive the car!

269
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,794
Then...

270
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:31,394
We're heading home to Tokyo!

271
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:34,094
I can't go home like this.

272
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:37,394
I'm so full of unanswered questions. I'm jumbled up.

273
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,994
Unanswered questions?

274
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:40,894
You were planning to come here,

275
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:43,694
but postponed it by three months.

276
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:47,194
Then immediately after that, Ms. Remi Kirisaki moved in, right?

277
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:50,494
Moreover, she did not go through a real estate agent

278
00:15:50,494 --> 00:15:52,994
but by asking the landlady directly in person.

279
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,494
She was using aliases since two years ago,

280
00:15:55,494 --> 00:15:57,694
and yet she used her real name to rent the apartment.

281
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:01,094
Since her handwriting was left on the rental agreement,

282
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,394
it was concluded that she wrote the suicide note.

283
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:07,394
So what?

284
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:10,294
Since her relatives came to confirm the corpse,

285
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:14,194
it was no doubt that Ms. Remi Kirisaki is the one who died.

286
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:17,194
But the description of her personality doesn't match.

287
00:16:17,194 --> 00:16:19,094
Remember during the small fire commotion.

288
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:22,894
Kei came bursting out of Ms. Kirisaki's room.

289
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:26,694
Obviously, Kei had access in and out of Ms. Kirisaki's room.

290
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,594
Excluding their hair style and glasses,

291
00:16:29,594 --> 00:16:31,994
they both have very similar physiques, right?

292
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:33,994
So what are you getting at?

293
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,594
I can't figure out what's bothering you, either.

294
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,294
The thing that bothers me most is

295
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:42,694
why you postponed coming back here for three months, Kei?

296
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:47,994
That's because her uncle postponed the opening of his resort inn...

297
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:50,094
-But look. -What?

298
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:52,294
According to what Kei's uncle is saying,

299
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,894
they've been planning to open the resort inn from 10 years ago

300
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:56,594
during their Silver Anniversary,

301
00:16:56,594 --> 00:17:00,194
and it's written here that they did exactly that.

302
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:03,894
So the opening of the inn was never postponed.

303
00:17:03,894 --> 00:17:05,194
Which means,

304
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:08,594
Kei postponed coming back here for three months

305
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:12,594
because she had reasons on her side for doing so, right?

306
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:17,294
And something happened during the three months

307
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:19,294
that she postponed coming back.

308
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:20,394
Don't tell me that...

309
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:24,794
But that way, everything falls into place.

310
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,594
Hello.

311
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:30,094
Yes, I didn't know until the time of the small fire alarm

312
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:35,494
that Ms. Nakanishi and Ms. Kirisaki were good friends.

313
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:40,794
Because I never saw the two together even once.

314
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,394
I thought so.

315
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:49,494
It's no mistake that Ms. Kirisaki hung herself in the room next to yours,

316
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,994
but she never...

317
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:57,194
No. No one has ever lived in that room.

318
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:01,694
You've seen through me.

319
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:05,294
But why did you do something like that?

320
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,794
Out of hate from three years ago.

321
00:18:09,794 --> 00:18:13,294
I had a fiance.

322
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:15,294
His name was Natsuyuki Ogawa.

323
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,494
When I visited him that day, I found him lying on the floor.

324
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:20,894
I called the ambulance right away.

325
00:18:22,994 --> 00:18:24,994
But a car was illegally parked

326
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:29,894
and the ambulance couldn't make it to his residence.

327
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:32,194
"Natsuyuki Ogawa (29)"

328
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,894
Kei. Kei.

329
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:38,194
I'm here. I'm here beside you!

330
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:43,694
He died before reaching the hospital.

331
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:47,094
I heard that it was already too late

332
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,994
by the time the ambulance got there,

333
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:54,294
but I still thought that if only that car wasn't parked there.

334
00:18:54,294 --> 00:18:56,394
It was frustrating.

335
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:58,994
Yes. They never answered their calls.

336
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:02,494
I had to give the owner of the car a piece of my mind.

337
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:04,094
But she had the nerve to say...

338
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:10,094
That guy probably didn't have a long life span, anyway.

339
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:11,394
Idiot!

340
00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:19,394
And that person was Ms. Remi Kirisaki, right?

341
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:22,594
She had the nerve to laugh about your fiance

342
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,594
as well as you who just went through losing him.

343
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:28,494
Then you happened to see Ms. Kirisaki three years later somewhere.

344
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:31,594
Just three days before I was planning to come back here...

345
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,194
"Anzai"

346
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:44,794
She was probably using aliases because she was into no good.

347
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:48,894
I figured that she was not a good woman.

348
00:19:48,894 --> 00:19:50,694
So you thought about it, right?

349
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:52,894
You couldn't leave Tokyo leaving things as they are.

350
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:56,094
You had to avenge the death of your fiance who died three years ago.

351
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,294
Yes.

352
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:58,994
You came up with an idea.

353
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:01,394
In order for you to run free despite killing someone,

354
00:20:01,394 --> 00:20:05,094
it would be best to set up a suicide.

355
00:20:05,094 --> 00:20:09,894
That's why you suddenly postponed coming back to your hometown

356
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:12,894
and disguised yourself as Ms. Remi Kirisaki.

357
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:13,994
What?

358
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,894
Is that room available?

359
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:19,794
You rented the room next to your own room.

360
00:20:19,794 --> 00:20:23,794
Right! Someone is going to move into the room next to yours tomorrow.

361
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,194
Is that right?

362
00:20:25,194 --> 00:20:27,794
I hope the person's a nice person.

363
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:30,694
You acted as Kei Nakanishi yourself,

364
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:33,694
as well as played the role of Remi Kirisaki within one apartment.

365
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:35,894
I really want to die.

366
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:38,994
Come on, Ms. Kirisaki. Don't say that.

367
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:40,494
You started dropping hints of suicide

368
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:43,094
to make everyone get that impression.

369
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:46,194
That means, during the small fire alarm, you were probably...

370
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,394
Fire! Fire!

371
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:50,794
Fire!

372
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:53,194
Where's the fire?

373
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:54,394
What?

374
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:56,694
You probably took off your disguise

375
00:20:56,694 --> 00:21:00,294
and was just about to go back to your room, right?

376
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:01,594
Yes.

377
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,394
After setting up the background for three months,

378
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:07,194
you contacted Ms. Remi Kirisaki.

379
00:21:07,794 --> 00:21:09,594
You're using an alias,

380
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:12,494
but you're Ms. Remi Kirisaki, aren't you?

381
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:14,294
Who's asking?

382
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:16,594
I'd like to discuss something with you.

383
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:18,994
You created an appropriate excuse

384
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:22,094
and secretly took her to the room next to yours.

385
00:21:25,394 --> 00:21:28,694
You made it look like suicide and left a suicide note behind.

386
00:21:29,894 --> 00:21:33,694
You probably phoned the landlady

387
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,794
and told her to get rid of her things

388
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,194
because she wanted to move out of the room.

389
00:21:38,194 --> 00:21:40,494
Exactly.

390
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:44,494
Are you going to drive me over to the police, Mr. Mouri?

391
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:46,894
Yes.

392
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:55,394
The sun's completely set.

393
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:59,194
It may have set today, but it will come up again tomorrow.

394
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:00,394
For sure.

395
00:23:30,694 --> 00:23:32,594
"Haido Police Station"

396
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,394
I just brought in a suspect!

397
00:23:41,394 --> 00:23:42,994
Wait a minute!

398
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:45,694
I cooperated with the police, you know?

399
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:46,694
Hey!

400
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,494
So it ends up like this after all.

401
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:55,894
"Next Episode"

402
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,094
Fantastic!

403
00:23:58,094 --> 00:24:00,894
And? What is it, Doc?

404
00:24:00,894 --> 00:24:03,394
There's something good coming up after this, right?

405
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:05,794
It's almost Christmas, right?

406
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:09,194
So let's use this 10,000 yen gift certificate.

407
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:14,894
What... what was that voice just now?

408
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:16,094
It came from the stairs!

409
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:20,494
Next Conan,

410
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:24,294
"The Detective Squad in a Grove (Part 1)"

411
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:27,337
Next Conan's Hint:

412
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,537
"Christmas present"

413
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:31,037
Pops, do you have a fear of sharp things?

414
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,737
-Why do you ask? -Because it says no poking (parking).

415
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,137
This brat!
