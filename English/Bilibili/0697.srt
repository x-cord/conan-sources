00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:06,024
Please! Re-investigate my older sister's suicide case!

3
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:08,624
Well, well, please take it easy.

4
00:00:08,624 --> 00:00:10,524
First of all, please give me your name.

5
00:00:10,524 --> 00:00:12,224
Oh, yes.

00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:15,224
"Misaki Yanai (17)" -I am Misaki Yanai.

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,624
I was going to the same school as Sonoko

8
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:19,624
and Ran until intermediate school.

9
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:21,924
And, from high school

10
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,624
she went to Seimi Yanai Academy

11
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,924
where her mother is chairman.

12
00:00:25,924 --> 00:00:29,324
I see. To Seimi Yanai Academy?

13
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:32,224
And? You have doubts about your older sister's suicide?

14
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:34,624
Yes! Nagisa...

15
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:37,724
My older sister would never commit suicide!

16
00:00:37,724 --> 00:00:40,024
But, the if the police concluded it as suicide,

17
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:42,924
they would've had to come up with evidence to prove it.

18
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:45,124
There were two eye-witnesses.

19
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:48,524
I see. Eye-witnesses.

20
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:51,324
One of them is me.

21
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:52,924
I see...

22
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:56,824
But, that's a mistake!

23
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,124
Well...

24
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,624
Please!

25
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:02,624
Please prove that my older sister didn't commit suicide!

26
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:06,024
But...

27
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:11,124

A shocking truth is revealed on campus.

31
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:19,324
He sees through the one and only truth.

32
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:21,424

35
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:17,746
Yeah. Forensics were sure too.

36
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:21,546
They declared that Ms. Nagisa Yanai unmistakably committed suicide.

37
00:03:21,546 --> 00:03:22,946
Just as I thought, after all.

38
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:25,446
Thank you very much, Inspector.

39
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:29,946
So, Inspector Megure told me.

40
00:03:29,946 --> 00:03:32,046
I know!

41
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:35,046
That's why I came to see you Detective Mouri.

42
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:36,146
Misaki!

43
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:37,146
Geez!

44
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:40,046
Hey. Help me.

45
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:41,346
Hey, Pops.

46
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,046
Why don't you at least ask her what she witnessed?

47
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:46,846
I guess so.

48
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:51,546
At any rate, calm down. Tell him exactly what you saw.

49
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:53,346
Yep. I'll do that.

50
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:55,546
I'm just going to hear you out, okay, Miss.

51
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:58,646
At sundown 5 days ago.

52
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:01,046
Just around 18:00.

53
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:04,046
"Wet paint!" -I was asked to come to the bench by Ms. Kodama

54
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:06,246
and told that she wanted to talk to me.

55
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,946
Ms. Kodama?

56
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:10,346
Yes, she's my advisor for both my high school

57
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:13,346
and university drama club.

58
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:16,346
My older sister and I both belong to the drama club.

59
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:20,646
My older sister was scheduled to play the main actress

60
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:23,846
at next year's academy foundation day festival.

61
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,346
"Harue Kodama (25), Theatre Club Advisor" -Although it's going to be held

62
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,946
early next year, I'm still not decided on the program.

63
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:33,546
To put it simply, it's whether it should be a comedy or tragedy.

64
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:35,746
Yes, I heard about it from my sister.

65
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:38,646
That if it's for foundation day, it should have a happy ending

66
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:39,846
or you have to touch the hearts of people

67
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,146
and bring it to a climax with acting skills.

68
00:04:42,146 --> 00:04:44,346
Nagisa is also undecided.

69
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:48,446
That's why I wanted to hear what you have to say too.

70
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:50,046
But, she sure is late.

71
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:52,946
Nagisa told me to wait here.

72
00:04:52,946 --> 00:04:54,746
What?

73
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:57,746
That's the model art crafts club, isn't it?

74
00:04:57,746 --> 00:04:59,946
I'm sure all the club members have left though.

75
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:02,946
Maybe it's the advisor, Mr. Shibagaki?

76
00:05:02,946 --> 00:05:07,546
He's supposed be having a meeting with the chairman from 17:30.

77
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,346
Sis?

78
00:05:15,346 --> 00:05:18,046
Ms. Yanai? Why is she...

79
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:20,446
What's she trying to do?

80
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,646
Sis!

81
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:23,646
"Nagisa Yanai (22), Misaki's Sister" -Where did your sister

82
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:24,846
hook the rope up?

83
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:28,246
The beams in that room are all plain to see.

84
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,146
Sis! Sis!

85
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,746
No good, it's sound proof!

86
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:38,346
No!

87
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,846
It's locked!

88
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,346
Today of all days!

89
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,946
That's right, call the chairman's room!

90
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:52,846
Yes!

91
00:05:52,846 --> 00:05:55,146
Was the chairman's room nearby?

92
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,346
Yes. It was way faster than for us to go around

93
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:01,246
to the front gate. Besides, it's on the same 2nd floor.

94
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,746
So, your mother was there.

95
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,746
And the teacher called Shibagaki, too.

96
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:11,546
Hello.

97
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:14,346
What is it about?

98
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:16,546
Sis is in trouble!

99
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:19,946
The model art crafts club. Hurry! Come quick!

100
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:33,346
Nagisa! Nagisa!

101
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,346
Why did you do something like this?

102
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:40,046
That teacher called Shibagaki, was he your sister's boyfriend?

103
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:42,046
He's the chairman in charge of finances at the academy

104
00:06:42,046 --> 00:06:45,646
and they were planning to get married after her sister's graduation.

105
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:47,946
"Touichirou Shibagaki (26)" -How can you leave without me?

106
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:51,146
It's ridiculous, I can't believe it!

107
00:06:55,846 --> 00:06:57,546
Hey, Misaki.

108
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,046
Why did you think that it wasn't what it seemed like

109
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:01,246
despite having witnessed the scene?

110
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,546
I guess you have a reason for it, wasn't it?

111
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:06,246
Your sister had a lover that she was going to get married to, too.

112
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:09,646
So wasn't she having the best time of her life?

113
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:13,246
True. I wonder if she's commit suicide at a time like that.

114
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:16,946
The problem was with that lover of hers, though.

115
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:18,446
What do you mean?

116
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:22,946
Mr. Shibagaki attended the same university as Ms. Kodama.

117
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:25,446
They used to be in love with each other previously.

118
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,846
She's the teacher that witnessed the scene with you, right?

119
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:30,446
Huh? Then maybe he was two-timing?

120
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:33,646
-Yes. -Did they admit to their relationship?

121
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,946
The investigation of the police revealed it so,

122
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:38,346
Mr. Shibazaki did though unwillingly.

123
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:41,346
And, what's Ms. Kodama saying about it?

124
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:43,046
What's with this boy?

125
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,746
He's a precocious brat. Don't let him bother you.

126
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,846
But, he can be sharp at times.

127
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,646
Only at times?

128
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:53,746
And, what did Ms. Kodama say?

129
00:07:53,746 --> 00:07:56,646
She did admit that they used to be lovers before.

130
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:59,746
But, she says they parted once and for all already.

131
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,346
I wonder.

132
00:08:01,346 --> 00:08:04,246
To think that the two are working at the same school.

133
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:08,546
So, Nagisa, who troubled over this, committed suicide. Maybe.

134
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:12,946
No, she would never commit suicide without saying anything.

135
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:16,546
She would've slammed the wedding ring back at the betrayer.

136
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,146
She would've done that at least, my sister.

137
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,746
But...

138
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:22,346
Is something bothering you?

139
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:24,246
You found out about that scandal

140
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,746
only after the police investigated it, didn't you?

141
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,246
How did your sister find out about it?

142
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:31,046
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,446
That's true.

144
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:37,346
That's right. Besides I got this from big sis.

145
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:40,346
See, it's carved Nagisa.

146
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:44,446
She asked me to go get the size adjusted at the shop she bought it from.

147
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:47,146
-When was this? -The day she committed suicide.

148
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:52,946
In other words, Nagisa still didn't know about Shibagaki and his ex-lover.

149
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,446
Not only that,

150
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,746
she said that she wanted to keep the bracelet on

151
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,846
even after she got married.

152
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:00,546
You sister was full of happiness, wasn't she?

153
00:09:00,546 --> 00:09:05,046
That's why I can't believe that she committed suicide!

154
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:08,246
But you saw with your very eyes

155
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:11,246
that your sister committed suicide.

156
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,246
No!

157
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:18,846
The rope that was used

158
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:22,946
was what the model art crafts club had prepared for packing.

159
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,546
The stool that she used for a step ladder

160
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:28,146
was knocked over in the corner of the room by the partition screen.

161
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:31,046
Since there were casters on the stool

162
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:35,446
it probably rolled some distance after it was kicked.

163
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:37,446
But, this is really something.

164
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,946
Is this the model of Seimi Yanai Academy?

165
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,946
Did the students make all these?

166
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:46,046
We all made it together, but the advisor probably also helped.

167
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:48,246
Oh, you mean Mr. Shibagaki?

168
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:52,746
Yes. He's a model making freak and a war maniac.

169
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:54,646
So, he donated his own collection for exhibition, too.

170
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:56,846
I think he donated a lot of it, too.

171
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,546
Wow!

172
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:01,346
This is the radio controlled model of war tank Elefant (Elephant)

173
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:03,446
that was developed in Germany in World War II.

174
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:05,646
You're really knowledgeable.

175
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,646
Sort of.

176
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,846
You're a boy after all.

177
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:13,146
As a girl, this is more like it.

178
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:17,146
Mr. Mouri, hello.

179
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:20,346
Takagi, is it all right to bring that picture along with you?

180
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:22,246
Don't blame me if the Inspector gets on you.

181
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,246
Well, since we found that this was not a homicide case.

182
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:29,246
But these kids are saying that it's not suicide.

183
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,346
Oh, I see.

184
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,146
What do you mean, "I see"?

185
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,146
Listen.

186
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,946
What's suspicious in cases like these

187
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:39,246
is that somebody gains from the death of the victim!

188
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:41,346
But, in this case,

189
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:44,046
almost everybody lost out instead of make gains.

190
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:47,346
Ms. Kodama and Mr. Shibagaki were suspected of scandal,

191
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,046
while Chairman Yanai, because of shock from losing her daughter,

192
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:52,546
is saying that she wants to close down Seimi Academy.

193
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:55,746
Let's say, even if there were to be a culprit, no one made out.

194
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:57,746
There would be no reason to cause the incident.

195
00:10:57,746 --> 00:10:59,046
Alright.

196
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:01,146
What is it, Conan?

197
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:03,546
Did you find anything that bothers you?

198
00:11:04,946 --> 00:11:07,646
The pictures aren't enough,

199
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:10,046
so let's go to the site!

200
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:11,846
-To the site? -Yep.

201
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:15,046
Then we may be able to find something, right?

202
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:18,546
It's okay to go, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

203
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:21,046
Yeah. It's not really closed off or anything

204
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:22,446
so it should be okay.

205
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:23,946
I'm not going.

206
00:11:23,946 --> 00:11:27,846
Okay, we'll report to you later then, Pops.

207
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,196
It's about time.

208
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:44,196
Oh, there she is.

209
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:50,196
Get serious!

210
00:11:50,196 --> 00:11:52,396
Talk about hopeless.

211
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,496
Wait.

212
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,796
Back then, all of Sis' face was in clear view.

213
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,696
Okay, I'll go tell her that then.

214
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:03,196
I'll call you on the cell phone.

215
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:04,696
Okay.

216
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:10,796
Back then, the front entrance was locked, right?

217
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:11,996
Yeah.

218
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:16,096
Will going back this much do?

219
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:19,396
Yep, right. Try getting on.

220
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:25,296
How about this time?

221
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,896
That's just the place!

222
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:28,196
Okay.

223
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,896
Is this the trace of a crawler?

224
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,996
It must've crashed pretty badly.

225
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,996
Hey.

226
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:55,696
Can we finish replaying the scene?

227
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:56,696
Oh, yep.

228
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:57,796
Then...

229
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:07,996
Are you okay?

230
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,696
If you think so, hurry and get off of me!

231
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:12,196
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:15,696
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

233
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,396
Oh, Misaki?

234
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:22,096
As to that case. As we mentioned the other day, our office...

235
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:24,496
Yes, I know.

236
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:28,796
But... Unless you come and actually talk to me at the site.

237
00:13:28,796 --> 00:13:31,696
My mother and I cannot be convinced.

238
00:13:31,696 --> 00:13:33,996
But, even so...

239
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:37,596
Please, just explaining will do.

240
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,096
All right.

241
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,496
Thank you very much!

242
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:45,196
But, mind you, I'm just going over to explain.

243
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:47,696
Yes, sir! I'm looking forward to seeing you!

244
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,796
See you later, then.

245
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,596
Well, in other words, I'm doing it

246
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:56,296
just to convince that girl and make her give up what she's doing.

247
00:13:56,296 --> 00:13:59,096
This is also one of the duties of a great detective!

248
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:02,696
What on earth is Mr. Mouri thinking of starting?

249
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,096
Haven't you heard anything?

250
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:08,496
No. He just said, you'll know if you come.

251
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:11,096
We're busy getting ready to close down the school now

252
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:13,196
and can't spare much time.

253
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:15,696
Well, sorry to keep you waiting.

254
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:20,496
What brings you here, Inspector?

255
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:27,196
Dad?

256
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:32,196
He's already gotten into the Sleeping Kogoro mode!

257
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:35,196
Thank you for waiting, everyone.

258
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:38,596
I am here of request from Ms. Misaki Yanai.

259
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:41,296
That's already been solved!

260
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:44,196
Of course I know that.

261
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:46,996
It's true that the victim was thought to have committed suicide.

262
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:49,096
But, she committed suicide on the very day

263
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,996
that she asked her younger sister to go

264
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:53,596
and adjust her bracelet for her.

265
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,496
Isn't this a bit unnatural?

266
00:14:56,496 --> 00:15:00,096
As to that, I'm to blame for it.

267
00:15:00,096 --> 00:15:03,996
Nagisa who found out that I betrayed her, probably impulsively...

268
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:09,996
Then when and how did Nagisa find out about it?

269
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:12,996
Well. Now that Nagisa is no longer here...

270
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,496
There is no way of knowing. I see.

271
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:19,396
By the way, I hear that Misaki, Ran and the others,

272
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:22,196
replayed the scene of the incident to re-confirm things.

273
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:26,596
Sonoko, could you replay the scene for us again here now?

274
00:15:26,596 --> 00:15:29,196
You want us to do it again?

275
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,196
I'm sorry, but Mrs. Yanai,

276
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,096
please bear with us for a while longer.

277
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:37,896
Sonoko, at first, put the step ladder in that position,

278
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:42,196
but it didn't match the position that Nagisa was witnessed from.

279
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:43,496
In order to match the position,

280
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:46,596
there was a need to pull more away from the window.

281
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:49,096
Uh... About here.

282
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:51,896
What about it?

283
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:53,896
That's not the point.

284
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:56,896
She couldn't have committed suicide there.

285
00:15:56,896 --> 00:16:00,096
Because at the time of the incident on that day...

286
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:04,696
the model of Seimi Academy was placed there.

287
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:09,496
Just to be sure, I'd like to ask you, Misaki.

288
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:12,696
How much of the room space did the model crafts take up?

289
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,996
Oh, yes. Up to this line.

290
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:20,296
As you can see, it's not possible to put the step ladder there.

291
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:23,696
But if you avoid the model crafts and place the step ladder in position,

292
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:26,396
it doesn't match the testimonies of the eye-witnesses.

293
00:16:26,396 --> 00:16:30,496
In order to make it come out the same by going near the window,

294
00:16:30,496 --> 00:16:33,196
a step ladder that is much lower was needed.

295
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,196
Hey, hey. The only thing

296
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:37,096
that could serve as a step ladder that was around was the stool.

297
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,896
Well, in fact there was something else.

298
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:41,596
Uh, Inspector.

299
00:16:41,596 --> 00:16:44,896
Why are you so stuck on the position she committed suicide?

300
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:47,596
It's almost like you're trying to determine where to stand on stage.

301
00:16:47,596 --> 00:16:49,196
Come to think of it,

302
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:52,096
back then, sis' face up to her hips were in view

303
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:54,496
as if she had used a measure or something.

304
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,596
I wonder if that was just a coincidence?

305
00:16:56,596 --> 00:16:59,096
If that was not a coincidence then...

306
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:04,196
If someone had told her what to do...

307
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:07,996
To make sure that the two in the yard could get a good view of her.

308
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:09,996
You mean Sis committed suicide

309
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,596
making sure that we saw what she did?

310
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:16,296
That's right, Nagisa wanted Ms. Kodama

311
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,896
to watch her suicidal act.

312
00:17:18,896 --> 00:17:22,196
Therefore, she chose the best position to do this.

313
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:26,496
Oh, so that's why she told me to wait at the bench in the courtyard.

314
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:29,696
So, that suicide was an act that Sis' put on?

315
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:31,796
This is what Nagisa thought.

316
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,696
She wanted the audience that came to see her

317
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:36,196
at the Foundation Festival, to watch her act.

318
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:38,196
For that, she thought she had to

319
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:40,296
overwhelm Ms. Kodama with her performance.

320
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:41,396
If she succeeds,

321
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:43,796
even if it were to have a tragic ending,

322
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,296
everyone who watches it would take to it.

323
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:47,896
I understand...

324
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:51,196
I'm sure Nagisa would've carried such a performance.

325
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,396
So, in this way,

326
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,696
he lead the victim on with his skillful talk.

327
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:58,796
The only one who could've done that is...

328
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:02,196
Hey. Just what're you talking about?

329
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:03,696
Nothing out of the ordinary.

330
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:07,596
I never mentioned your name whatsoever yet.

331
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:12,196
There are several rows of benches in the courtyard,

332
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:13,596
but for some reason all the benches other than the ones

333
00:18:13,596 --> 00:18:15,396
that Misaki and Ms. Kodama sat on

334
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:18,296
had a "wet paint" sign on them.

335
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,596
I heard from an employee

336
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:25,596
that Mr. Shibagaki had asked to have them painted on that very day.

337
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:28,096
This way, the special seat to watch her performance from

338
00:18:28,096 --> 00:18:31,096
was automatically set.

339
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:34,396
Moreover, for some reason only on that day,

340
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,196
the side entrance door was locked.

341
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:41,196
And, who took care of the keys?

342
00:18:41,196 --> 00:18:44,696
It's you, wasn't it, Mr. Shibagaki?

343
00:18:45,696 --> 00:18:47,296
But, Mr. Mouri,

344
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,996
let's say her suicide was in fact an act,

345
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,396
why did it turne out to be real?

346
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,796
That's because the step ladder moved on its own.

347
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:56,796
What?

348
00:18:56,796 --> 00:18:59,796
The stool would've been too high to use as a step ladder,

349
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:03,596
therefore, the culprit told her to get on the war tank.

350
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:04,896
A war tank?

351
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,296
The Elefant war tank that was at the site?

352
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:12,296
Officer Takagi, would you please bring it over here?

353
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:16,896
It's from Germany and made from aluminum die-casting.

354
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:20,896
It is totally capable of supporting the weight of a woman.

355
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:25,496
Which means that she used this war tank as a step ladder?

356
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,896
6:00 in the evening, was probably the time

357
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,196
that the victim was told to start the performance.

358
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:04,296
If the remote controller is used exactly at that time,

359
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:07,896
there's no need to be in this room to move the war tank.

360
00:20:07,896 --> 00:20:09,996
Mr. Shibagaki, you were keying in

361
00:20:09,996 --> 00:20:13,096
the calculator back then with your left hand, weren't you?

362
00:20:13,096 --> 00:20:15,696
You had your right hand in your pocket.

363
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,396
What if you had the remote controller

364
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:20,496
in your pocket at that time?

365
00:20:20,496 --> 00:20:21,796
I've been framed!

366
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:24,096
I got a call from Misaki

367
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:26,196
and was shocked to hear about Nagisa having committed suicide.

368
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:27,896
I'm a victim too, you know.

369
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:30,296
That's a lie! All I could say was rush over to the model art crafts club

370
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,396
and yet...

371
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:34,596
Sis' in trouble!

372
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:37,996
In the model art crafts room. Hurry! Quick!

373
00:20:37,996 --> 00:20:40,696
And yet, how did you know it was suicide?

374
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:43,396
That was just a slip of the tongue.

375
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:47,396
When you got to the site, was the step ladder there?

376
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,896
I saw it through the curtains by the partition screen,

377
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:52,296
-if you're talking about the stool. -I see.

378
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:54,996
In other words, you confirmed the step ladder

379
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:57,796
while you went in to save her.

380
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:00,696
This is ridiculous! When I made my donation,

381
00:21:00,696 --> 00:21:03,496
I removed all the power source from all the models.

382
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,396
I didn't want the students

383
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:08,696
to tamper with my precious models, you see.

384
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:11,396
It's true that there seems to be no antennas in sight.

385
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,096
Of course not.

386
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:14,696
Thanks for your deduction,

387
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:16,796
but what doesn't move, doesn't move!

388
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,096
It moved!

389
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:25,496
I had Conan check on it beforehand.

390
00:21:25,496 --> 00:21:28,696
The antennas were modified to built-in types.

391
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:32,096
There are traces that the motors have been removed once,

392
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:35,896
but now they seem to have been put back on again.

393
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:39,496
Could you answer what all this means?

394
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:52,896
It seems that Mr. Shibagaki has finished retorting.

395
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:22,596
Ms. Kodama seems to have confessed to the chairman.

396
00:23:22,596 --> 00:23:25,996
Mr. Shibagaki had been using the academy's finances

397
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:27,796
and was told to say nothing because he would give her a share of it.

398
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:30,196
That scared her, so she parted from him.

399
00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:31,796
If the academy goes bankrupt,

400
00:23:31,796 --> 00:23:34,596
the money he embezzled would also be thrown in the dark.

401
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:36,296
So, the culprit was thinking in term

402
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:39,096
of making gain for himself, after all.

403
00:23:40,896 --> 00:23:42,596
It seems that thanks to Misaki's support,

404
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,896
her mother is back on her feet again.

405
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,396
They're going to continue running this academy, then.

406
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:54,096
"Next Episode" -Could that be...

407
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:55,296
It's a UFO!

408
00:23:55,296 --> 00:23:56,996
The Adamsky type!

409
00:23:56,996 --> 00:23:59,196
UFO?

410
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:03,296
Like I said, I'll pay off everything I owe you tomorrow!

411
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,896
UFO.

412
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:14,996
You seem to have realized something.

413
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,596
Sort of...

414
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,196
Next Conan,

415
00:24:18,196 --> 00:24:22,096
"Unbelievable! UFO Crashes"

416
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:40,196
Next Conan Hint:

417
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,296
"Hanging scroll"

418
00:24:42,296 --> 00:24:43,496
Even after the holidays is Kogoro week!

419
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:44,996
All you're going to do is sleep because you don't have work, right?

420
00:24:44,996 --> 00:24:46,896
He's sleeping even when he works, though.
