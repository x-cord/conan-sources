1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,440
Invited over by Masumi Sera,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,640
Ran, Sonoko and I go to visit the hotel

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,740
that she is staying at.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,840
We decided to go have fun at the pool,

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,740
but Nagami Oiso, the daughter of the owner of the hotel,

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,940
loses her necklace

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,040
and tells all the other guests to get out of the pool.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,940
After finishing lunch, we go back to the pool

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,840
and find that Nagami's whereabouts have become unknown.

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,840
Then...

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
Hey, look!

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,040
There's something in the water in the center of the pool.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,540
What?

14
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,440
Isn't... isn't that

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,540
a person?

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,240
Lady...

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,540
Nagami?

18
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,740
But Ms. Nagami mentioned, didn't she?

19
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,340
That Mr. Samaki, her fiance,

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,740
had something going with you, her younger sister.

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,040
She also said that the manager offered them

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,140
to use the hotel room for their rendezvous.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,540
You've got me wrong.

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,640
Nagami just over thought things.

25
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,540
The thing is her birthday was coming up.

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,540
We were discussing celebrating her birthday

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,940
in the suite room of this hotel that she favored.

28
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,940
We talked of the decorations and food.

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,340
Of course, it was to be a surprise party,

30
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,240
so it was kept a secret from Lady Nagami.

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,640
We were discussing this in that room,

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,640
so Nagami probably misunderstood.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,840
Well, Lady Nagami really liked that room,

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,740
so it's no surprise that she would get upset.

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,040
She liked it that much?

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Yes.

37
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,640
I hear she kicked a guest who had reservation out of the room

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
in order to spend a night there.

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,340
So, we have no motive to want to kill her!

40
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,040
We were trying to celebrate her birthday!

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,840
If you still suspect us, you can ask the other staff of the hotel.

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,840
We talked of the decorations and other stuff with the staff, too.

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,240
We'll be confirming that later.

44
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,340
First of all, we'd like you to tell us

45
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,440
what you've been doing after Ms. Nagami started searching alone.

46
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,840
Let's use the years we walked together as a springboard

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,440
and move forward full speed without slowing down.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,340
The queer testimony of the pool homicide.

49
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,240
The truth comes afloat.

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,740
His name is Detective Conan!

53
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:22,295
"Mystery Sinks into the Summer Pool (Part 2)"

54
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,095
"Reception" -Yes.

55
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:29,795
After we were told to close the pool off,

56
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:32,195
we've only let authorized personnel through.

57
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:36,895
We let the manager, Lady Hamaka and the secretary, Mr. Samaki,

58
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:40,195
plus the two bellboys through.

59
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:45,295
Before Lady Nagami became alone, we let them in, too.

60
00:04:45,295 --> 00:04:48,095
We forgot something, you see.

61
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:51,095
Well, we just came to check things out.

62
00:04:51,095 --> 00:04:55,595
Who was the first to come back here after Ms. Nagami told you all to leave

63
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,595
so that she could do the search alone?

64
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:59,695
I think it was...

65
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,095
Manager Toyoshima.

66
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:06,595
He said he came back to check on how Lady Nagami was doing.

67
00:05:06,595 --> 00:05:08,795
Do you know what time it was?

68
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:11,195
I think it was after 12:00.

69
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:15,195
Just about that time, she received an incoming text mail, you see.

70
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:18,095
Oh, right. Let's me check.

71
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:19,995
It was 12:05.

72
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,995
What was she doing, then?

73
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:25,495
She was in the water searching.

74
00:05:25,495 --> 00:05:28,795
So much so, that she didn't realize that I was there for a while.

75
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,795
But when she noticed me there,

76
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:33,995
she scolded me saying I wasn't called for,

77
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:36,295
so I left immediately.

78
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,995
I see.

79
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:40,795
Then, how about after the manager left?

80
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:41,895
Well...

81
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:43,595
The person who came next was...

82
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:44,595
Oh, right.

83
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,095
It was Mr. Samaki.

84
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,895
Since she was taking quite a while.

85
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:54,895
I went wanting to tell her to leave the search up to someone else,

86
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:59,895
but she wasn't at the poolside, nor in the pool.

87
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,895
I thought maybe she had gone to the ladies room,

88
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,495
so I waited at the poolside,

89
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:07,595
but It didn't seem like she would be coming back,

90
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,695
so I left.

91
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:12,395
Do you know what time you left?

92
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:13,895
Not really.

93
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:16,195
Neither do we.

94
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,495
We don't take notes of everything.

95
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,495
Oh, but Lady Hamaka came in right after Mr. Samaki left,

96
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:23,795
and if it's the time she left,

97
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:26,095
it was 12:54.

98
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:29,995
I know because she asked me what time it was when she left.

99
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,695
Why did you ask for the time?

100
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:36,095
We made reservations to have lunch at the hotel at 13:00.

101
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:37,895
That's why Mr. Samaki

102
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:41,895
asked me to go check the ladies room and the changing room.

103
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:44,795
But couldn't find her anywhere.

104
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:48,695
Nor was she at the pool, so I panicked.

105
00:06:48,695 --> 00:06:51,795
And couldn't believe the time that was displayed on my cell phone.

106
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:54,195
So, I impulsively asked for the time.

107
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:57,295
By the way, where is the ladies room and the changing room?

108
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,295
This way.

109
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,695
Between this reception desk and the pool

110
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:03,795
there are the changing room and the shower room

111
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,495
and beyond it, is the ladies room.

112
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:10,495
Using it seems more than enough a place to hide the corpse.

113
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,595
Yes.

114
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:15,695
This corridor is also a blind spot from the two receptionists.

115
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:18,695
And what happened after that?

116
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:21,695
We called the manager and Mr. Samaki.

117
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,695
And also the bellboys...

118
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,795
and they split up to look for her.

119
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:28,195
Where was Nagami then?

120
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:31,195
She wasn't there. Not inside the pool either.

121
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:34,295
I went to look for her in the locker room of the shower too.

122
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:37,595
Of course, I looked in the men's room, too.

123
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:39,495
I shouted out to her.

124
00:07:39,495 --> 00:07:42,495
We searched for about an hour but couldn't find her,

125
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,495
so we asked the receptionists

126
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:48,295
if they really didn't see her leave.

127
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:49,895
That's when they came.

128
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:51,695
So we was explaining what happened.

129
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:56,995
When these bellboys found her sunk in the pool.

130
00:07:56,995 --> 00:07:58,795
I see.

131
00:07:58,795 --> 00:07:59,995
But...

132
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,695
why did you go back to the pool to look for her?

133
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:05,795
When you all searched for her, she wasn't there, right?

134
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:08,995
That's because I had this bad feeling.

135
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:13,595
I thought I heard a strange sound from the direction of the pool.

136
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:16,395
Like the sound of a large bubble coming out.

137
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:31,795
I thought so. The opening of the drain is fixed on with a screw.

138
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:33,695
Look, Conan.

139
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:38,295
Something that looks like a hook is screwed on above the drain.

140
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:41,795
Moreover, it's right in the middle of side of the pool, too.

141
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:44,895
Hey! What're you guys doing?

142
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:46,895
No doubt about it.

143
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:49,195
That person's the perp.

144
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:54,095
Okay, so let me get it together.

145
00:08:54,095 --> 00:08:56,595
The victim, Ms. Nagami Oiso, says

146
00:08:56,595 --> 00:09:00,195
she'll look for the necklace she lost, alone.

147
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:03,795
Then, after she gets all of you to leave the pool.

148
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,595
At around 12:05 noon, the manager of the hotel,

149
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:11,095
Mr. Toyoshima comes to check on her.

150
00:09:11,095 --> 00:09:13,295
But was sent back saying, he's not called for.

151
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:16,395
Next, when secretary, Mr. Samaki comes,

152
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:19,095
Ms. Nagami was nowhere in sight.

153
00:09:20,095 --> 00:09:23,095
As Mr. Samaki was leaving, he asks Ms. Hamaka who comes,

154
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,795
to check the changing room and the ladies room,

155
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:29,295
but it was confirmed that she wasn't there either...

156
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,995
at 12:54 noon.

157
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:37,195
After that, the manager, Mr. Samaki and Ms. Hamaka,

158
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:39,395
go to search for her along with the two bellboys,

159
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,995
but couldn't find her.

160
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,995
Ten minutes after finish searching for her,

161
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:45,895
the two bellboys return to the pool

162
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:48,095
and find Ms. Nagami

163
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:50,695
who is sunk in the middle of the pool.

164
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:54,195
Are the time and chain of events correct?

165
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:56,795
-Yes. -I think so.

166
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:59,195
Ms. Nagami's ETD

167
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:02,195
is between 12:00 noon and 13:00.

168
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:04,295
Only you three went in and out of the pool

169
00:10:04,295 --> 00:10:06,895
during this time.

170
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:11,195
Therefore, it is highly likely that the perp is one of you.

171
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,995
If the corpse was sunk at the bottom of the pool the whole time,

172
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,795
somebody would've found it,

173
00:10:16,795 --> 00:10:19,295
when you split up to look for her together.

174
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:22,195
However, it is unthinkable that the corpse

175
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,995
was sunk to the bottom of the pool

176
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:28,295
without anyone noticing.

177
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,795
Much less, in the middle of the pool.

178
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:33,295
This is indeed an impossible crime.

179
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:34,795
Right, Takagi?

180
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:36,695
Don't you think so, too?

181
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,195
Officer Takagi?

182
00:10:40,195 --> 00:10:44,795
After whispering something with Conan and Ms. Sera,

183
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:46,995
Officer Takagi headed over to the pool.

184
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:47,995
What?

185
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:50,995
He was carrying a large aquarium along

186
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:53,195
while you were in the men's room, Inspector.

187
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,295
He said he was going to use it to do an experiment.

188
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:57,995
Gosh, what is he doing?

189
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:02,095
I tell you it's Little Sera, not Miss Sera.

190
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,695
Oh, yeah.

191
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,195
Oh, and he also said

192
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:08,495
that he'd like you all to come watch the experiment.

193
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:10,795
It seems he can disclose who the perp is by doing so.

194
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:25,045
Hey!

195
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:26,745
Officer Takagi!

196
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:29,945
He's not...

197
00:11:29,945 --> 00:11:31,845
anywhere.

198
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:35,345
Besides, why has the pool been filled with water again?

199
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,145
Since we finished investigating,

200
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:40,045
we decided to try out the experiment that Officer Takagi told us about.

201
00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:42,845
I'm asking, what are you going to experiment?

202
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:44,245
Oh, well...

203
00:11:45,245 --> 00:11:48,345
Don't disclose the secret beforehand.

204
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:50,745
I don't understand what's going on.

205
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:52,745
Hey, Officer Takagi!

206
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,545
Come out and explain this to me!

207
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:56,845
Hey!

208
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,745
Takagi?

209
00:11:58,745 --> 00:11:59,945
Gosh.

210
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,645
Where'd he go anyway?

211
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:04,445
Officer Takagi's here...

212
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:06,945
in the pool.

213
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,345
What?

214
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,745
He's not there.

215
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,345
Where is he?

216
00:12:14,345 --> 00:12:16,245
Can you see him, Conan?

217
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,545
I can't see him now either, though.

218
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:23,945
But if I cut this fishing line that's on this hook...

219
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,045
Aquarium?

220
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:33,545
-Officer Takagi? -Takagi?

221
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,945
Oh, couldn't you see me?

222
00:12:36,945 --> 00:12:38,445
No.

223
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:39,745
But why?

224
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:41,445
Because of the total reflection of light.

225
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,845
Water and air are both transparent,

226
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:48,745
but the refractive index is different.

227
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:50,945
When light passes through water with a high refractive index

228
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:54,345
to low refractive index air,

229
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:56,645
if you look at the boundary of the water and air

230
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,945
from an angle directly in front,

231
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,645
all the light is reflected like a mirror,

232
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:06,245
and the object on the opposite side of the boundary becomes invisible.

233
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,645
Why don't we try it?

234
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:18,545
See. You can see my ten yen coin sunk in the water of the aquarium, right?

235
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,445
Well, yes.

236
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:23,245
But if you turn the cup upside down

237
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:26,245
and cover the ten yen coin with it with air still in it.

238
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:29,345
It... it disappeared...

239
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:31,445
Wow, Conan!

240
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,345
It's just a simple science experiment.

241
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:37,045
I think you learned it in grade school, too.

242
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,845
Really?

243
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:43,145
First graders nowadays are taught something so difficult?

244
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,745
It's the same as what happened to Officer Takagi.

245
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:49,345
He was in the pool upside down in an aquarium filled with air.

246
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:52,645
That's why he was invisible.

247
00:13:54,745 --> 00:13:58,145
But couldn't you see him from directly above?

248
00:13:58,145 --> 00:13:59,245
Yeah.

249
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,545
Because if you view the boundary

250
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:04,045
between the air and water from a low angle,

251
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:06,245
it doesn't reflect the light like a mirror.

252
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,045
But this is a pool.

253
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:10,445
So, you can't look at it from directly on top, right?

254
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:12,445
True.

255
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,745
In other words,

256
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:18,945
after the perp drowned Ms. Nagami who was searching for the necklace alone,

257
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:21,245
placed an aquarium that was prepared beforehand

258
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,145
over the corpse that was in the pool

259
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:27,945
and secured it passing a fishing line through the holes

260
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:31,045
of the frames of the drain on both sides of the pool.

261
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,545
Then all that was left to do was to tilt the aquarium a little,

262
00:14:33,545 --> 00:14:35,545
insert their hand inside

263
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:38,045
to release the air from Ms. Nagami's tank

264
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,245
till it filled the aquarium and all done.

265
00:14:42,545 --> 00:14:45,045
Since fishing lines are elastic,

266
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:48,045
it's possible to at least tilt the aquarium.

267
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:53,445
But how did they drown her?

268
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:54,945
That's easy.

269
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:59,445
They probably said something to her to put her guard down

270
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:02,245
then grabbed her neck from behind,

271
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:05,745
removed her mouthpiece and held her under.

272
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:10,645
With the tank and weights, Ms. Nagami sank easily.

273
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:14,545
And underwater no one can hear you scream.

274
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:16,045
That's how it was, right?

275
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:19,745
Hotel manager, Mr. Ensaku Toyoshima?

276
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:24,845
Did you lower her guard

277
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:28,045
by pointing your toes in the pool

278
00:15:28,045 --> 00:15:32,645
and telling her that her necklace was there?

279
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:33,845
But...

280
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:37,745
is it possible to secure an aquarium using just one fishing line?

281
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:40,645
The aquarium was filled with air, wasn't it?

282
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:44,045
If you make four dents at the bottom of the aquarium,

283
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:46,845
and hook the fishing lines twice through the dents,

284
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,345
it won't float easily.

285
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,945
And if you attach the end of the line

286
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:55,945
to a hook attached near the surface of the pool,

287
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:58,245
you don't have to go into the water.

288
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,045
But just cut the fishing line.

289
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,845
In order to float the aquarium up

290
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:04,645
and make the corpse appear.

291
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:07,145
Just like Conan did, a while ago.

292
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:12,145
In other words, when Mr. Toyoshima came to check things out,

293
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:15,745
he drowned Ms. Nagami and held her under.

294
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:17,245
Then hid her corpse from everybody's vision

295
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:20,145
using the trick I just described.

296
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,845
Then, after everyone had finished searching,

297
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:24,745
on the way back, he severed the fishing line

298
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:26,845
and made the corpse appear.

299
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:29,445
But when the aquarium came floating up,

300
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:32,045
there was quite a loud noise, wasn't there?

301
00:16:32,045 --> 00:16:35,845
He shouted to mask the sound,

302
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:39,045
saying, "Where are you, Lady Nagami?"

303
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:42,445
The others who were looking for Ms. Nagami

304
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,245
were probably shouting, too.

305
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:47,245
So the sound probably was almost completely blotted out.

306
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:50,145
But that aquarium was cracked, wasn't it?

307
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:53,945
Moreover, not in the middle where she was found in the pool,

308
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:55,445
but near the corner.

309
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:57,945
That's right. When did he move it?

310
00:16:57,945 --> 00:17:00,745
The only time he could've moved the aquarium

311
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:03,645
was when Ms. Nagami's corpse was carried out of the pool.

312
00:17:03,645 --> 00:17:04,945
Back then,

313
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:08,545
the only thing the manager was carrying was the tank.

314
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:11,245
He probably put his foot into the aquarium

315
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:15,245
and moved it by dragging it along through the water.

316
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,245
After moving it over to the corner of the pool,

317
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,445
he struck the tank against it and shattered it to pieces.

318
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:23,345
Everybody else's attention was focused on the girl

319
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:25,645
who was pulled out of the pool besides.

320
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,845
Sound is virtually not heard in the water, you see.

321
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:31,845
But the manager stepped on the cracked pieces of glass

322
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,445
and hurt himself, you know?

323
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:36,845
Would somebody do something like that knowingly?

324
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,645
I think he would.

325
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:41,645
Because nobody would imagine that the person who hurt himself

326
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:43,445
would do something like that.

327
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,845
If the aquarium's going to be discovered by the police anyway,

328
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:50,545
I would figure I may as well shatter it to pieces

329
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:51,945
so people can't tell what it originally was.

330
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,445
You're a sly brat after all!

331
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:56,745
God knows what kind of adult you'll turn into.

332
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,245
Oh, well, you see.

333
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,745
I just tried putting myself in the perp's shoes.

334
00:18:01,745 --> 00:18:04,045
I mean, is that your point?

335
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:07,045
So do you have any proof?

336
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,345
Yeah, the fishing line.

337
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,245
When he cut the fishing line,

338
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:15,145
he had to quickly reel in the line attached to the drain

339
00:18:15,145 --> 00:18:17,245
on the other side.

340
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:20,145
I think that the fingerprints of Manager Toyoshima

341
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:22,645
are on the fishing line.

342
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:26,145
But aren't fishing lines pretty thin?

343
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:28,045
One by one they are.

344
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:32,045
But I'm sure that when he wound the line he bunched it up,

345
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,045
there are several places where his fingerprints

346
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,545
would be a perfect match.

347
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:39,945
That shouldn't be hard to find, right, forensic officer?

348
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:41,245
Of course, not.

349
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,645
But...

350
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:45,545
the manager doesn't have a motive to kill her.

351
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:46,645
He's right.

352
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:51,845
We were just planning to celebrate Nagami's birthday together.

353
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:54,445
I didn't want to celebrate it,

354
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:57,045
especially not in the suite room.

355
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:02,045
I had a younger sister who was much younger than me.

356
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:05,145
I reserved that suite room for her and her husband

357
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,945
because they said that they wanted to experience

358
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,445
staying over there if once in their life.

359
00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:12,745
She said that she wanted to celebrate the birthday of her son

360
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:15,445
who was going to turn three.

361
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,445
That room has a great scenic view

362
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:22,145
and that day you could see the fireworks on display from the veranda, too.

363
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:24,845
But suddenly on that day,

364
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:28,345
Lady Nagami tells me she wants to watch the fireworks

365
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:30,645
with her friends from that room.

366
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:35,045
My younger sister and her family ended up having to move to another hotel.

367
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:38,045
On the way there, they got into a car accident and died,

368
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:40,345
their son and all.

369
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,145
Oh, no.

370
00:19:43,145 --> 00:19:46,445
But that's unjustified resentment, isn't it?

371
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:48,145
Unjustified resentment?

372
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,845
No way.

373
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,645
That day, Lady Nagami

374
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:54,645
didn't spend the night in that room.

375
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:57,445
Do you know why?

376
00:19:57,445 --> 00:20:01,245
Because her friend who was headed over to this hotel

377
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:03,945
caused a traffic accident.

378
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,245
Right!

379
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,345
That woman was in the car that ran over

380
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:10,545
my younger sister and her family!

381
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:17,045
But...

382
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:20,145
how'd you get such information?

383
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:21,645
That day,

384
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:23,745
she called me.

385
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,645
She said that the friend's car that she was riding on

386
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:28,645
got into a traffic accident,

387
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,845
but she didn't want to get involved.

388
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:34,245
So to testify that she was in this hotel room

389
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:37,045
from noon right through.

390
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,345
From that day since,

391
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:42,945
I've been waiting for the chance to take revenge

392
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:46,845
and for that woman to come to this pool.

393
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,445
I gambled on whether I could remove the necklace from her neck,

394
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:53,445
which was to serve as a trigger to committing this murder.

395
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:58,545
The heavens seem to have stood on my side.

396
00:20:58,545 --> 00:21:02,945
But this murder plan that I thought out with care

397
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:06,445
was exposed by these young detectives.

398
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:10,145
My efforts have indeed been washed away like water bubbles.

399
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:37,545
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:39,545
You came all this way,

401
00:22:39,545 --> 00:22:42,045
but I couldn't offer any hospitality.

402
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:44,445
It couldn't be helped because there was a murder case involved.

403
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:50,445
But you, even back during the "Which sweets is it?" case,

404
00:22:50,445 --> 00:22:54,245
you make people appear and disappear out of thin air.

405
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:56,545
It's as if you're a magician or something.

406
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:57,845
A magician?

407
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:02,045
I'm not the magician.

408
00:23:05,545 --> 00:23:08,045
You're a magician, aren't you?

409
00:23:13,645 --> 00:23:14,645
You know what...

410
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,845
Have you ever met me, Sera?

411
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:21,245
Oh, you just called her Sera!

412
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:22,545
Oh, sorry.

413
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,845
It's okay, you can call me Sera.

414
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:26,745
See, she says it's fine.

415
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:27,945
Yes.

416
00:23:27,945 --> 00:23:29,245
See you, then.

417
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:31,245
-Oh, okay. -Bye, bye.

418
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:35,545
So, shall we head on home, too!

419
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,045
That girl...

420
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:45,745
She looks familiar to me, too.

421
00:23:50,845 --> 00:23:53,145
"Next Episode"

422
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:56,345
Yasumi?

423
00:23:57,345 --> 00:24:00,845
In other words, it's an accident?

424
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:02,945
We have nothing to do with it.

425
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,445
So that's the story.

426
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:12,345
The fact is, there is still a continuation to my deduction.

427
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:14,845
There are still some unsolved mysteries, you see.

428
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:17,145
Next Conan,

429
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:20,845
"The Queen's Weather Forecast"

430
00:24:36,545 --> 00:24:39,045
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:41,145
"A Prank"

432
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,645
I'n going to study and become a weather forecaster.

433
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:44,945
Wow!
