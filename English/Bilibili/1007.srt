00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,610
Haruyama Junpei (37)
Café Manager

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,320
Haruyama Junpei (37)
Café Manager
The victim is Haruyama
Junpei-san, 37 years old,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,070
The victim is Haruyama
Junpei-san, 37 years old,

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,740
who operates a café by the train station.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,000
He was killed last night around 9 PM.

6
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,610
We believe he was attacked after closing his
shop and heading towards his home past this area.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,380
At any rate, he was stabbed repeatedly.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,070
It's safe to assume the
suspect's motive is a grudge.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,770
All right.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,950
Gather information from the locals and—

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,610
Uh...

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,500
Is something the matter?

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,770
Nothing. I just thought he might show up.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,280
In any case, gather information and
draw up a list of his acquaintances.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,030
Yes, sir.

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,270
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,530
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,460
Curtains rise on a man's quest for revenge.

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,330
Follow that suspect! Where is he now?

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,140
Always determining the one truth

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,000
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,570
his name is Detective Conan!

23
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,750
Out For Revenge
(Part One)

24
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,310
Out For Revenge
(Part One)
"Out For Revenge, Part One!"

25
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,030
Out For Revenge
(Part One)

26
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,670
It's on the fifth floor of this building.

27
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,410
Inspector!

28
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,420
I knew he'd show up.

29
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,240
Are you here on a case?

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,560
You're gathering information for that
case that was on the news, right?

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,180
Yeah...

32
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,930
One of the victim's friends
is inside this building.

33
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,650
I see.

34
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,100
Then allow me to assist you.

35
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,200
Me, too!

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,870
You must be Natsukawa Yoji-san,
the investment consultant.

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,770
Natsukawa Yoji (40)
Investment Consultant

38
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,320
Natsukawa Yoji (40)
Investment Consultant
Yes, that's me.

39
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,500
Natsukawa Yoji (40)
Investment Consultant
What business do the police have with me?

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
What business do the police have with me?

41
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,990
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

42
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,910
Would that be all right?

43
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,030
Come in.

44
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,770
You have guests.

45
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,620
Don't mind them.

46
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:15,900
Well?

47
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,520
What did you want to ask me?

48
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,570
You've probably already seen it on the news,

49
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,070
but your friend Haruyama Junpei-san
was found murdered this morning.

50
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,470
Huh?

51
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,710
Looks like your guests
knew Haruyama-san, too.

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,630
Excuse me, but who are you two?

53
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,380
We've got nothing to do with this.

54
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,800
I was just thinking about how I'd
heard that story on the news.

55
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,220
For reference, could we get your names?

56
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,690
My name is Fuyuki Ryuzaburo.

57
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,120
My name is Fuyuki Ryuzaburo.

59
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,610

00:04:59,610 --> 00:04:59,940
I'm Akiba Miyako.

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,110
I'm Akiba Miyako.

I work in real estate.

Akiba Miyako (42)
Real Estate Business Manager

64
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,350
Neither of them are on our
list of acquaintances.

65
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,490
Well?

66
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,910
What did you want to ask?

67
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:17,390
Do you know anyone who may have held a
grudge against the late Haruyama-san?

68
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,780
There wasn't anyone like that.

69
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,670
What about you two?

70
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,920
Who knows?

71
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,180
I don't know anyone named Haruyama.

72
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,050
You guys...

73
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,930
Even if I knew Haruyama,

74
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,610
the murder happened last night, right?

75
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,190
If you investigate my whereabouts at that
time, you'll find that I have an alibi.

76
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,160
I have nothing to do with the case.

77
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,320
Likewise.

78
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,680
It would be wise to take your
investigation elsewhere.

79
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,830
Those three are hiding something.

80
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,330
Most likely.

81
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,120
But why hide what they know?

82
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,590
They're either protecting the culprit

83
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,620
or there's some reason why they can't tell us.

84
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,810
The Next Day

85
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,100
All right.

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,480
I'll get the truth out
of him for the inspector.

87
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,200
He did throw up a smokescreen yesterday.

88
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,610
This place is both a residence
and office, right?

89
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,360
Yeah.

90
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,620
Did he go out this morning?

91
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,710
It's unlocked.

92
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,790
Natsukawa-san!

93
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,720
Natsukawa-san, are you all right?

94
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,720
Damn.

95
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,100
Kid, call the inspector.

96
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,340
Got it!

97
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,230
As we told you earlier, last night,

98
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,950
Natsukawa Yoji-san was murdered as well.

99
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,620
He was killed in the same
manner as Haruyama-san.

100
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,460
Fuyuki-san and Akiba-san,

101
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,880
you know why we asked you
to come here, don't you?

102
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,010
You're going to tell us
everything you've been hiding.

103
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,230
Damn.

104
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,390
It wasn't a groundless fear after all.

105
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:46,640
If both Haruyama and Natsukawa have
been killed, then it must be him.

106
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,030
Him, who?

107
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,520
Komoto.

108
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,030
Komoto Takashi.

109
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,410
Who is this Komoto?

110
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,190
Haruyama, Natsukawa, and the two of us got
to know each other as regulars at a bar.

111
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,960
That was ten years ago.

112
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,690
10 Years Ago

113
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,760
10 Years Ago
The four of us had dreams and
ambitions, but we lacked the cash.

114
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,480
The four of us had dreams and
ambitions, but we lacked the cash.

115
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,620
We told each other that if only we
had the capital, we'd manage somehow.

116
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,920
That's when Fuyuki made a suggestion.

117
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,900
"I have a high school classmate
named Komoto Takashi."

118
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,980
"He inherited a huge amount
of money from his parents."

119
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,030
"Let's swindle him out of his money."

120
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,690
"He's a naïve rich boy.
I guarantee it'll work."

121
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,040
We presented him with a
bogus investment opportunity

122
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,050
and split the money we swindled.

123
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,550
We even hired a lawyer to cover up our fraud.

124
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,500
He must have lost hope after being
betrayed by a former classmate.

125
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,670
He left Japan and moved to South America.

126
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,540
I see.

127
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,820
In other words, the four of you

128
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,700
ganged up on Komoto and preyed upon him.

129
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,950
Th-That was ten years ago.

130
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,000
B-But the other day,

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,210
we received a frightened call from Haruyama.

132
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,720
He said Komoto was peering into his shop.

133
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,880
He thought he may have returned
to Japan to get revenge.

134
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,300
But the three of us laughed it off,

135
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,660
saying it must've been someone
else and that he was imagining it.

136
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,980
But then we saw on the news that
Haruyama had been murdered.

137
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,460
We thought it might actually be Komoto.

138
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,110
So the three of you gathered
because you were worried.

139
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,060
They must've been right
in the middle of that.

140
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,370
That's when we visited
Natsukawa with the police.

141
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,380
And now that Natsukawa has
been murdered as well...

142
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,630
Komoto's the only guy who
resented Haruyama and Natsukawa.

143
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,550
Confirm their story ASAP.

144
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,420
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,890
We'll be asking you for more
details down at the station.

146
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,500
MPD Beika Police Station

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,890
MPD Beika Police Station
According to the Immigration Bureau, one
week ago, Komoto Takashi returned to Japan.

148
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,400
According to the Immigration Bureau, one
week ago, Komoto Takashi returned to Japan.

149
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,190
I knew it.

150
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,860
He's already checked out, but we also
found the hotel where he was staying.

151
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,200
We were able to collect Komoto's
fingerprints from the belongings he left behind.

152
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,200
And?

153
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:51,910
They matched the fingerprints collected from
the scenes of both Haruyama's and Natsukawa's murders.

154
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,500
So Komoto is the murderer, then.

155
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,420
We also found this.

156
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,380
This is an image of Komoto Takashi
captured by the hotel's security cameras.

157
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,300
This is an image of Komoto Takashi
captured by the hotel's security cameras.
Komoto Takashi (40)

158
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:01,680
This is an image of Komoto Takashi
captured by the hotel's security cameras.

159
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,840
This is what he looks like now?

160
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,430
His hair is snow white.

161
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,310
Also, Komoto apparently said to an employee

162
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,440
that he has an incurable illness
and doesn't have long to live.

163
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,330
I see.

164
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,650
With death approaching,

165
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,860
Komoto returned to Japan and
murdered Haruyama and Natsukawa,

166
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,710
the men who betrayed him, one after another.

167
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,090
What's wrong with him?

168
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,110
He must be crazy.

169
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,590
Why get revenge now for something
that happened ten years ago?

170
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,700
I was curious about that,

171
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,190
so I asked the local police about it.

172
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,470
Regardless of his motive,

173
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,980
we can't allow him to kill anyone else.

174
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,560
You'll act as their bodyguards and do
whatever it takes to find Komoto Takashi.

175
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,270
Yes, sir!

176
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,240
It's a brutal serial murder case,

177
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,530
but there's nothing left for me to do.

178
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,120
Yeah, seems that way.

179
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,130
The Next Day

180
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,180
Shikigawa Valley

181
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,560
The Uedas

182
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,150
See? It's a little scary, isn't it?

183
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,540
See? It's a little scary, isn't it?
The Shimodas

184
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,160
The Shimodas
But the view is incredible.

185
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,550
But the view is incredible.

186
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,280
It certainly is!

187
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,130
I know I shouldn't be out walking around,

188
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,250
but my client wanted to meet outdoors.

189
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,860
It can't be helped.

190
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,670
I need to check out the area beforehand.

191
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,910
I didn't say anything.

192
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,390
Now this is a view.

193
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,670
Akiba-san, I'm going to
go check out that noise.

194
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,960
Stay there!

195
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,350
Akiba...

196
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,180
K-Komoto...

197
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,050
It's all...

198
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,810
It's all your guys' fault!

199
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,480
Crap!

200
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,820
Die!

201
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,250
Akiba-san! What happened?

202
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,500
K-Komoto just fell.

203
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,800
What? Komoto fell?

204
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,090
There's no way he survived
a fall from that height.

205
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:45,880
Yeah.

206
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,530
You're saying this is what happened.

207
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,760
You were lured away by
a noise in the thicket.

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,540
While you were looking elsewhere,

209
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,340
Komoto attacked Akiba-san, and after a
struggle, Komoto's foot slipped and he fell.

210
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,780
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,170
You didn't see the moment Komoto fell?

212
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,530
No.

213
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,620
What? Are you trying to say I pushed him?

214
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,920
No, I didn't say that.

215
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,350
It's true.

216
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,790
She's telling the truth.

217
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,510
That man accidentally fell by himself.

218
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,790
We saw it, too.

219
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,320
Yeah.

220
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,320
See?

221
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,490
That person must've seen it, too.

222
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,470
Huh?

223
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,830
They're not here anymore.

224
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,580
Looks like there's several witnesses.

225
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,590
Yeah. In other words, Komoto Takashi
accidentally fell to his death.

226
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,520
Looks that way.

227
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,460
But where is the body?

228
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,720
Is it possible that he survived and fled?

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,660
It did take us a while to get down here.

230
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,630
You're saying he disappeared
during that time?

231
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,420
It's not impossible.

232
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,360
But a fall from this height?

233
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,650
Detective Takagi, how did Komoto get here?

234
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,650
There's a rental car that Komoto
seems to have driven here.

235
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:22,800
Then if he survived, even if he was injured,

236
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,290
wouldn't he have used that car to flee?

237
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,800
Maybe he was so badly injured
that he couldn't drive a car.

238
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,050
What?

239
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,440
In any case, I'll check out
the hospitals in the area.

240
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,600
Good idea.

241
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,680
What a waste of time.

242
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,190
There's no way he survived a fall from there.

243
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,440
Anyway, I can go now, right?

244
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,930
That should be fine. Chiba.

245
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,730
Yes, sir.

246
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,440
What?

247
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,720
I don't need a bodyguard anymore, do I?

248
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,610
He's dead now.

249
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,380
It's just to be safe.

250
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,120
He'll escort you home.

251
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,560
Let's go.

252
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,910
Now that the suspect is
dead, the case is closed.

253
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,760
It's not what I would've wanted, though.

254
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,540
I know what Takagi said,

255
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,870
but it's hard to believe he
survived a fall from up there.

256
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,760
Right.

257
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,280
But why haven't they found a body?

258
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,520
It doesn't look that deep.

259
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,630
It wouldn't be odd if the body got caught
on the rocks at the bottom of the cliff.

260
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,450

Thank you.

267
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:45,800
Are you a police detective?

268
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,820
Yes?

269
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,890
If you're looking for him, then is he
the suspect in a case or something?

270
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,840
Yes.

271
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,560
In that case, I hope you find him soon.

272
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,590
It would be terrible if he did anything.

273
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,700
Yes...

274
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,270
Hello, Inspector Megure?

275
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,160
I didn't find anything. Komoto
hasn't shown up at the hospital.

276
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,550
Komoto destroyed himself, then.

277
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,200
He fell headfirst and screamed
all the way down to hell.

278
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,200
In other words, you and I survived.

279
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,090
We have the devil's luck.

280
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,560
2 Days Later

281
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,900
Stabbed repeatedly with a knife.

282
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,570
Same method.

283
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,630
T.K.?

284
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,460
Komoto Takashi.

285
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,620
Akiba-san was murdered
last night around 11 PM.

286
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,840
Komoto Takashi's fingerprints were found
on the lighter left next to the body.

287
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,610
So Komoto survived his fall from that cliff.

288
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,350
And he has resumed his revenge murders.

289
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,270
Inspector Megure.

290
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,080
I've learned why Komoto sought revenge now.

291
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,420
When he first moved to South America,

292
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,580
Komoto Takashi sometimes lost consciousness.

293
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,530
It was a psychological condition caused
by an extreme distrust of others

294
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,960
and posed no threat to his life.

295
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,210
It must've been caused by
the betrayal of those four.

296
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,330
Since it hadn't happened during
the past several years,

297
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,840
he believed he had recovered
from his condition.

298
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,280
But one month ago,

299
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,060
Komoto was told by his doctor that
he didn't have much time left to live,

300
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,460
so he left on a trip with his beloved wife

301
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,520
to make his final days the
happiest they could be.

302
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,340
However, his condition caused
a tragedy on their journey.

303
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,040
They got into an accident
while on their trip.

304
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,750
While Komoto was attempting to call an
ambulance for his badly injured wife,

305
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,020
he lost consciousness due to his condition,

306
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,930
and his wife passed away.

307
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,470
He was still suffering the effects
of their betrayal ten years later.

308
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,740
And if that took the life
of his beloved wife,

309
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,470
I can understand why he sought revenge.

310
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,800
Damn it.

311
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,230
He blamed us for the death of his wife, too?

312
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,850
Save me.

313
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,920

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,660
It's Komoto.

317
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,740
K-Komoto?

318
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,750
You're the last one left, Fuyuki.

319
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,520
You'll pay for deceiving me ten years ago.

320
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,110
Spare me, Komoto!

321
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,690
I was wrong. I'll return your money.

322
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,460
I'll return ten times what we took, okay?

323
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,360
Money, money, money.

324
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,820
You think you can erase your sins with money.

325
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,900
No wonder you think you can buy
your own life with money, too.

326
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,920
You're the same scumbag you ever were.

327
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,800
K-Komoto?

328
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,430
Komoto, hello? Komoto!

329
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,490
Spare me, Komoto!

330
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,110
Find him.

331
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,490
Do whatever it takes to find Komoto.

332
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,490
Yes, sir.

333
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,870
So his revenge wasn't over yet.

334
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,140
Yeah, but why did he bother
to call him this time?

335
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,880
Because he's the one he hated the most.

336
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,110
He's the one who suggested they swindle him.

337
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,340
That's true, but...

338
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,310
