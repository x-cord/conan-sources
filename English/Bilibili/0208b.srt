1
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:05,347
Inspector Yokomizo.

2
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:07,547
We've got the results of the autopsy.

3
00:00:07,547 --> 00:00:09,447
The cause of death was a stab wound

4
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:11,147
pierced right through his chest with a dagger.

5
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:12,847
We believe he died instantly.

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,847
No fingerprints or palm prints were found on the dagger.

7
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,447
The estimated time of death

8
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:22,147
is right after he disappeared from the ropeway.

9
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,747
Well, it's just as was assumed.

10
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:28,547
Okay, block off the esplanade entirely.

11
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:31,647
Have that elderly go down to the foot of the mountain, too.

12
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,747
Yes, sir.

13
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:41,847
Sir, what is that shed down below there?

14
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:44,847
It's a rest house that the construction workers were using

15
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:46,047
at the time they were constructing the tunnel.

16
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:48,447
It's supposed to be destroyed tomorrow.

17
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,747
Then, why is there smoke coming out of there?

18
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,347
I'm not bothering him.

19
00:00:54,347 --> 00:00:55,947
Mr. Yasunori Doumoto.

20
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:58,547
I have something I'd like you to verify for me.

21
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:02,347
Do you have any recollection of this dagger?

22
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:06,647
It's one of my father's collection of daggers.

23
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:10,947
Which means someone stole the dagger.

24
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,147
Was it under strict security?

25
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:17,247
No, anyone could've taken it if they wanted to.

26
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:19,247
That's not what matters though, the problem is...

27
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,347
Yes?

28
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,947
No...

29
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:25,447
It's nothing.

30
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:28,247
He's hiding something.

31
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:30,247
What is it?

32
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:33,647
Thus, this case is about Mr. Eizo Doumoto

33
00:01:33,647 --> 00:01:37,447
being attacked by someone and disappeared in the ropeway.

34
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:40,647
And there's the talisman that was pasted on the window.

35
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:42,747
I can't help but come to the conclusion

36
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:44,847
that the killer is among all of you here.

37
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:46,647
First, I would like to check on the motive for killing.

38
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:52,347
Who would benefit most from the death of Mr. Doumoto?

39
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,747
If you mean our father's assets,

40
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,747
it would be us, who are his children.

41
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:59,547
Not really. Yasunori is the one who would benefit most.

42
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:03,247
Especially now that he can assume entire power of the Doumoto Tours.

43
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:04,547
Junpei!

44
00:02:04,547 --> 00:02:08,747
Yasunori, aren't you happy now that father is dead?

45
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:11,947
Now, you don't have to get nagged on the job either.

46
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:13,647
In terms of motive,

47
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,947
I think you guys got as much motive as I do, Rina.

48
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:19,547
You guys? You mean Aoyagi and me?

49
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,147
Why me?

50
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:23,847
You made up scandals of our company as well as blackmailed father

51
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:27,247
by writing letters and making crank calls beforehand.

52
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,347
But father ignored you, that's why you...

53
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:31,847
Hold it there!

54
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:32,947
Don't tell me that

55
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:35,447
you were blackmailing father about that story?

56
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,547
Mr. Aoyagi, what does that story mean?

57
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:41,447
In order to get this tunnel ready in time,

58
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,947
the construction was started on an outrageous schedule.

59
00:02:43,947 --> 00:02:46,947
This resulted in an accidental in the tunnel

60
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:50,047
where one was buried alive

61
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:53,847
and consequently was left to die.

62
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:55,947
Fearing a bad image falling upon this Mt. Tenbu ropeway,

63
00:02:55,947 --> 00:03:01,647
Eizo Doumoto used cash to silence the family and the people involved

64
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,647
to erase traces of the accident.

65
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:07,747
I was so disappointed at my father and left the house.

66
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:10,747
You mean you had the nerve to blackmail father about it?

67
00:03:10,747 --> 00:03:13,347
You don't have to make me sound so rotten.

68
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:16,647
All I did was ask to be interviewed about it.

69
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:19,147
But to assume that I was trying to blackmail him,

70
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,547
he must've really felt guilty about something.

71
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:25,847
You approached me for that purpose to begin with, didn't you?

72
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,447
Well, you are after all,

73
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:30,347
the best of all witnesses to what happened back then.

74
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:32,247
What a guy!

75
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:35,347
You're pretty good, reading Rina by the nose.

76
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:38,147
But it seems you couldn't do the same with father.

77
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:40,147
Not being able to get the money you wanted,

78
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:42,347
you got furious and killed father, right?

79
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,147
I didn't kill him!

80
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:46,847
Talk for yourself, Junpei.

81
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:50,647
Father kept refusing to give you any financial help.

82
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,747
I'll bet you were pissed about it, right?

83
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:55,347
What about you, then?

84
00:03:55,347 --> 00:03:56,547
That's enough!

85
00:03:56,547 --> 00:04:00,047
How much shame of the family do you intend to display to the public?

86
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,247
Mr. Machida.

87
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:05,247
Your agency Tokai Nippo had an anti-ropeway campaign underway.

88
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,447
How come Tokai Nippo managed to get on the first trial

89
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:14,247
of the ropeway rather than other agencies?

90
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:15,547
Who knows?

91
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,947
We've been wondering about that, too.

92
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:22,547
Don't you think it better to ask the vice president about that?

93
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:25,447
Mr. Yasunori, would you explain?

94
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:26,747
Explain?

95
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:29,547
Well, the president wanted the people who are against

96
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:32,447
the development of the ropeway to be first ones to ride it,

97
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:36,747
so as to make them understand how wonderful it is.

98
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:38,947
I wonder if that's really the reason?

99
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,747
Could there have been some other reason?

100
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:43,447
By the way, Mr. Machida,

101
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:47,047
you were all by the door of the ropeway, weren't you?

102
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:51,747
Are you insinuating that we pushed Eizo Doumoto out the window?

103
00:04:51,747 --> 00:04:53,947
I don't think that's possible.

104
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:59,347
Because the door on Mr. Machida's side was locked.

105
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,347
Moreover, it's a double lock

106
00:05:01,347 --> 00:05:05,747
and I had the keys, so it couldn't have been opened.

107
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,847
Which means that you had free access to the door

108
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:10,047
and could open it If you wanted to.

109
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:13,647
No, she couldn't have committed the crime either.

110
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,647
Although it was in the dark,

111
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,947
I think it would've been impossible for her

112
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:18,647
to move a struggling man over to the door

113
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:21,347
and push him out with her strength.

114
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:22,947
I wonder?

115
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,847
I don't think it is impossible, though.

116
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,247
I was sitting right next to the door,

117
00:05:27,247 --> 00:05:30,347
but I didn't hear the rattling of the door opening.

118
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:33,047
However, the window cannot be opened either.

119
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:36,847
And the emergency exit doesn't seem to have been used.

120
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:38,647
Then how...

121
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:50,047
Anyway, will you all please walk on down to the foot of the mountain?

122
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:52,447
Let's talk over the details there.

123
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:54,347
Oh, Mr. Yasunori.

124
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:58,347
Is it okay for us to use the special guest room?

125
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:00,047
Yes, of course. Please be my guest.

126
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:05,447
Mr. Yasunori sure is acting a bit strange.

127
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,247
Yes, I'm sure he's hiding something.

128
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:11,947
No. He wants to say something, but is hesitant of mentioning it.

129
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:14,047
What one earth is it that he wants to say?

130
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,847
Come to think of it, back then...

131
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,447
Preparations are perfect.

132
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,847
Nobody has noticed anything.

133
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,347
The conversation back then,

134
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,547
and when Mr. Eizo's corpse was found...

135
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:28,247
It can't be...

136
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:31,547
It wasn't supposed to turn out like this.

137
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:35,547
Maybe he was expecting some other result?

138
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:38,647
Is there such a thing as the curse of the statue of goddess?

139
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:42,147
We come to write an article on it and we end up as suspects.

140
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,947
Could this really be some kind of a curse?

141
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,547
Don't be ridiculous! We're lucky.

142
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,547
This is a real scoop!

143
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:53,147
The other result may be...

144
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,047
Even if we were to ask Mr. Yasunori

145
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,847
to come to the station with us on his own initiative,

146
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,647
we still have to figure out how

147
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:01,447
Mr. Eizo disappeared from the ropeway

148
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:03,547
ended up being found in the palm of the statue of the goddess

149
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,647
in a matter of seven seconds.

150
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:07,847
That's right.

151
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:11,247
Well, that's the biggest problem.

152
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:13,147
The corpse couldn't have walked

153
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:16,447
all the way up to the goddess on its own.

154
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:19,347
It couldn't be that...

155
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:23,047
No. But if that were to be the case...

156
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,347
It must be that shed...

157
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:41,147
I've found it!

158
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:48,547
What's this? There something stuck to it.

159
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,147
This is...

160
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,447
Worker's slacks. Just great!

161
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:06,447
All I need now is...

162
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:09,447
Okay. I can use that mop.

163
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,147
All set.

164
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:15,847
Hey!

165
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,247
Just what are you doing here?

166
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,047
You scared the wits out of me.

167
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:22,347
What do you mean I scared you?

168
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:25,447
You'd get people worried disappearing all of a sudden.

169
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:27,347
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,247
Right, Ran!

171
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:30,547
What is it?

172
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:35,247
I'm a bit cold, so won't you lend me your jacket?

173
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,047
Okay, sure.

174
00:08:38,147 --> 00:08:40,147
-Here you go. -Thanks!

175
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:41,747
I'll be waiting for you at the foot of the mountain, then.

176
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,147
Oh, Conan!

177
00:08:45,147 --> 00:08:48,547
What? So, you're leaving me here like this?

178
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,847
It's just as I thought.

179
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:21,147
Mr. Yasunori, in the ropeway,

180
00:09:21,147 --> 00:09:23,647
you were sitting beside Mr. Eizo.

181
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:27,347
It's strange that you didn't notice a thing.

182
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,647
Just what are you hiding?

183
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:32,547
I'm not hiding anything.

184
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,947
You re talking Iike I'm the killer or something!

185
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:39,147
Show me the evidence, will you?

186
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:41,147
No, I didn't say you were the killer or anything.

187
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,447
Since it's such a mysterious case,

188
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:45,547
we're trying to catch some clues by questioning all of you.

189
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,847
Then, why don't you also question everybody else?

190
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:50,247
Well, that's of course.

191
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,447
Conan!

192
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:54,147
You came down before me,

193
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:56,747
and yet why are you here after me?

194
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,047
I sort of got lost.

195
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,047
Won't you please let us go already?

196
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:06,047
I have no motive for killing Eizo Doumoto.

197
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:08,447
So, you don't want to have anything to do with anybody here

198
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,147
because you can't blackmail any longer, right?

199
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,847
I can't stand watching

200
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,047
the ugly dispute over family affairs any longer!

201
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,647
Watch your mouth!

202
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:19,047
Now, now. Everyone, cool it.

203
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:20,247
It'll only be a while longer.

204
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:23,147
Inspector Yokomizo!

205
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:26,747
Why don't we all try riding the ropeway again?

206
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,347
The ropeway?

207
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:31,147
Hey, stay out of this!

208
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,847
Yes, let's ride it!

209
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,547
They say its best to go to the site a hundred times.

210
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:38,447
We may find something new.

211
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:41,347
We're riding that stuff again?

212
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:45,047
There's no curse or anything like that is involved in this case.

213
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,647
I've figured out why the two journalists of Tokai Nippo

214
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,547
were invited on the test run.

215
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:52,047
And the trick as to how Mr. Eizo disappeared

216
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,447
as well as Mr. Yasunori's strange remark.

217
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,947
And the wrist in the incinerator.

218
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,647
I'm going to figure the entire mystery inside the ropeway.

219
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:21,794
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that you're...

220
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,794
Shut up! Does it bother you?

221
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:25,294
Oh, no!

222
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:26,694
I'm relieved now that I know

223
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:30,494
that the renown detective is just as human as we all are.

224
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:32,894
Hey, Ran.

225
00:11:32,894 --> 00:11:34,094
You see...

226
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,594
What? Why do something like that?

227
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,994
Pops said to do it secretly.

228
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,094
Dad said so?

229
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:46,294
Okay.

230
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:51,594
10 sheep, 11 sheep...

231
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:54,294
Pops, are you trying to fall asleep or something?

232
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:57,694
Don't talk to me! I'll forget what I'm counting.

233
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:59,594
-What number sheep was it? -Okay.

234
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:02,094
I'll let you sleep as much as you want.

235
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:05,894
It's come...

236
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:08,794
Mr. Mouri, what's wrong?

237
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,794
So, it's finally coming!

238
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,394
Dad!

239
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:13,494
Take a picture of him.

240
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:15,294
He has become the Sleeping Kogoro!

241
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:17,394
Yes, sir.

242
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:22,194
Mr. Yasunori, excuse me for all my rude remarks.

243
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:25,794
But I knew from the start

244
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,094
that you are not the one who killed Mr. Eizo.

245
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:30,494
Just as expected of you, Mr. Mouri.

246
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,694
Didn't you have plans with Mr. Eizo

247
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:34,894
to do something that would surprise everyone

248
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:40,094
at today's commencement event?

249
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,094
A large scale scheme that would get rid of the rumor of the curse

250
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:48,794
of the statue of goddess that is creating a bad image of the ropeway

251
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:50,694
as well as something

252
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:52,694
that would be a great way to advertise the ropeway.

253
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:57,694
I will now attempt to replay your plan.

254
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,194
What on earth is going on?

255
00:13:04,194 --> 00:13:07,094
(Chanting)

256
00:13:07,094 --> 00:13:09,594
It's the same thing that happened back then.

257
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:12,394
What's about to happen? Cut it out!

258
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:22,994
Ran is gone?

259
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:25,494
It's just like the time father disappeared.

260
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:28,094
How on earth...

261
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:30,294
Is something like this possible?

262
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:32,994
Mr. Mouri, where did your daughter disappear to?

263
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:35,394
Please look at the statue of the goddess.

264
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:36,594
It can't be...

265
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:42,494
Look, on top of the palm of the statue of the goddess!

266
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:47,694
Ran? No...

267
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:51,394
A dummy wearing Ran's jacket?

268
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:55,094
Exactly! It is made with a mop and some branches.

269
00:13:55,094 --> 00:13:58,494
Come out here, Ran.

270
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:00,494
What?

271
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:05,094
Under the seat?

272
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:11,294
Mr. Yasunori, you thought up this grand scaled yet simple plan,

273
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,194
and Mr. Eizo acted out.

274
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:14,894
Isn't that right?

275
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,694
Yes, that's right.

276
00:14:17,694 --> 00:14:19,894
I asked an acquaintance who is a doll maker

277
00:14:19,894 --> 00:14:25,094
to secretly make a rubber dummy duplicate of my father.

278
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:28,194
The day before the commencement ceremony

279
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:33,294
and after I left your party and started off down the esplanade,

280
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:35,194
I stopped over at the observatory

281
00:14:35,194 --> 00:14:38,494
to pick up the dummy that I had asked to be made beforehand

282
00:14:38,494 --> 00:14:40,694
and put it on the palm of the statue of the goddess.

283
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:43,394
The palm of the statue of the goddess

284
00:14:43,394 --> 00:14:45,394
can only be seen from inside the ropeway

285
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:46,994
that has come out of the tunnel.

286
00:14:48,294 --> 00:14:52,594
That's why I didn't have to worry about being seen by anyone.

287
00:14:52,594 --> 00:14:54,294
You went on to carry out your plan

288
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:58,494
the following day during the commencement ceremony.

289
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:01,694
Yes. After we entered the tunnel,

290
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:05,294
I severed the circuit cord for the lights.

291
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:07,594
After the lights went out, I immediately

292
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:10,494
took my recorder out and played the chant.

293
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,594
After father put on an act of being terrified,

294
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:16,694
he hid in the space under the seat.

295
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:21,194
And I stuck the talisman onto the window glass.

296
00:15:23,394 --> 00:15:27,294
I'm the one who brushed journalist Nakano's camera onto the ground

297
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:31,294
because I didn't want the trick to be disclosed by the camera's flash.

298
00:15:31,294 --> 00:15:34,694
The aisle under the seat is the place to put emergency goods,

299
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:38,594
and weights necessary when the wind is strong,

300
00:15:38,594 --> 00:15:41,594
but I had taken everything out beforehand.

301
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:44,194
While everyone was headed for the observatory,

302
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,894
my father was supposed to go back to the tunnel

303
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:47,594
using the empty ropeway,

304
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,294
then jump down.

305
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,994
After arriving at the observatory,

306
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:57,394
he was supposed to take the dummy away from the statue,

307
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,694
then went up in place of the dummy instead.

308
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,394
He was supposed to greet all of us

309
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,094
who went to check on him with a smile.

310
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:04,194
Well?

311
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:05,994
There's no such things

312
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:09,594
as curses and evil spells exist in this world!

313
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,694
He was supposed to convince everyone that there was no grounds

314
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:14,894
to the rumor that was going around and get rid of it all at once.

315
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,494
So, that's why we were invited to come.

316
00:16:16,494 --> 00:16:19,394
No, that's not the only reason!

317
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:24,194
Mr. Eizo was planning to frame Tokai Nippo.

318
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:27,394
Just what do you mean by he was planning to frame us?

319
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:29,194
Do you have any idea

320
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:32,394
why the commencement ceremony started in the afternoon?

321
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,994
It's probably the whim of the host.

322
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,894
Mr. Machida, you sent in an article from the top of the mountain, right?

323
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:39,994
This is Machida!

324
00:16:39,994 --> 00:16:41,994
Please leave one page of the evening news open!

325
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,594
There's been a curse!

326
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:45,494
Eizo Doumoto has been stabbed

327
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:47,394
on top of the palm of the statue of the goddess!

328
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:50,294
If Eizo were not stabbed,

329
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:52,894
would you have been able to change the article for something else?

330
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:56,194
The deadline for the evening news is 1:30 pm!

331
00:16:56,194 --> 00:17:00,194
Right! Your agency would have put false information in the papers.

332
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,294
In other words,

333
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:03,594
Mr. Eizo's purpose for scheming this trick

334
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:05,794
was to prove that no such thing as a curse existed

335
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:10,494
as well as to soil the reputation of Tokai Nippo.

336
00:17:10,494 --> 00:17:11,694
I see.

337
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:14,094
That's why he said what you did back then.

338
00:17:14,094 --> 00:17:18,094
I wonder how long you'll be able to stay obnoxious like that.

339
00:17:18,094 --> 00:17:20,294
What a dirty thing to do!

340
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:21,494
By the way,

341
00:17:21,494 --> 00:17:23,494
aside from curses and spells,

342
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:25,594
there is another sad tragedy hidden

343
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:29,494
behind the tunnel of this ropeway, isn't there?

344
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:31,294
The accidental death of the worker.

345
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:33,494
I heard about it from Rina.

346
00:17:33,494 --> 00:17:36,794
Can you tell us about it, Mr. Yasunori?

347
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:40,894
The person who passed away was called Takahata.

348
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,894
His mother was not only sickly,

349
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,094
but had long years of obligatory feelings towards the Doumoto family,

350
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:48,794
so father forcibly made them agree not to publicize about it

351
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:50,794
in return for cash.

352
00:17:50,794 --> 00:17:55,194
Did the late Mr. Takahata have any other family members alive?

353
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:59,194
I've heard that his father who had divorced 10 years ago

354
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,794
took his younger sister along to Tokyo with him.

355
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:05,094
It could be that his sister

356
00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:08,594
is here in the ropeway with us.

357
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:09,594
What?

358
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,494
But the only ones in this ropeway are...

359
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:14,294
Ms. Yoshino, don't tell me that...

360
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:18,694
Yes, the one who killed Mr. Eizo Doumoto

361
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:21,494
is you, Ms. Ayaka Yoshino!

362
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,394
She killed dad?

363
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,194
Unbelievable.

364
00:18:27,194 --> 00:18:29,194
Ms. Ayaka is the killer?

365
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:30,294
No way.

366
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:36,494
The killer had to be someone

367
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:39,594
who could act secretly with Mr. Eizo,

368
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:43,694
and someone he would not suspect.

369
00:18:43,694 --> 00:18:47,494
Ms. Ayaka stayed back at the ropeway station because she wasn't well.

370
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:50,894
Then, she got on the ropeway headed downward.

371
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:54,194
Since the station at the top of the mountain was in chaos

372
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:57,394
because of what happened to the president,

373
00:18:57,394 --> 00:18:59,894
nobody noticed that she gets onto the ropeway headed downward.

374
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:04,394
Since you were going around with the president,

375
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:07,794
you stabbed him on top of the palm of the statue of goddess.

376
00:19:07,794 --> 00:19:10,894
Then, you burned his dummy in the incinerator.

377
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:13,094
After you made everything was burned,

378
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:16,294
you went back to the observatory where everyone was.

379
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:23,194
The only one who could've committed this crime was you

380
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:25,694
who knew the secret between Mr. Eizo and Mr. Yasunori.

381
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:29,794
What you just mentioned are all mere assumptions!

382
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,294
Mr. Yasunori.

383
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:34,594
Will you please open the package that is right beside me?

384
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:36,194
Yes.

385
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:38,894
This one, right?

386
00:19:41,294 --> 00:19:43,394
This is...

387
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:44,694
What's that?

388
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:47,194
Could this be the the dummy's wrist?

389
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:50,694
This was found left in the incinerator.

390
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:53,494
When Ms. Ayaka burned the dummy,

391
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:56,494
she dropped something very important

392
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:59,394
on it's hand!

393
00:19:59,394 --> 00:20:00,594
What is this?

394
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:03,294
It looks like jewelry or something.

395
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:04,694
Oh, no. Don't tell me...

396
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:05,794
Yes.

397
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:09,394
The jade that belongs on the broche that you have on your chest.

398
00:20:09,394 --> 00:20:10,594
If we enlarge the picture that was taken

399
00:20:10,594 --> 00:20:12,694
during the commencement ceremony,

400
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:16,494
it is plain to see that nothing was wrong with your broche

401
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,294
before you got on the ropeway.

402
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:24,894
It's exactly as Mr. Mouri says.

403
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:27,594
Could you tell us why you did it?

404
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,494
Although our parents were divorced,

405
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,394
I kept in touch with my brother all the time,

406
00:20:32,394 --> 00:20:34,594
and we used to encourage each other.

407
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:36,994
Last year when my mother fell into critical condition

408
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:38,894
I went to see her at the hospital.

409
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:42,294
She told me about the mortifying death of my brother while crying.

410
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:46,194
As well as the hatred she felt for Eizo Doumoto before she died.

411
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:51,094
I hid my identity and entered Doumoto Tours

412
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:52,994
so that I could avenge the death of my brother

413
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:54,994
who had been driven to his death by Eizo Doumoto,

414
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:58,594
as well as to take revenge for my mother who suffered because of him.

415
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,394
Ms. Ayaka...

416
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:32,694
She's so kind and nice and yet...

417
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:36,694
The reason the story of the statue of the goddess's curse

418
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:41,394
were handed down for generations probably to teach

419
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:45,694
that if people do wrong or commit an unforgivable crime,

420
00:22:45,694 --> 00:22:48,294
a terrifying end awaits us.

421
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:50,294
Just like the case this time.

422
00:22:55,094 --> 00:22:57,194
Oh, no. I fell asleep!

423
00:22:57,194 --> 00:22:58,494
Huh?

424
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:01,994
Hey! Where is everybody?

425
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:04,494
Hi there, Sleeping Kogoro!
