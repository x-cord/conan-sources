1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,840
Friendship, love and mystery.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,840
We stick it out because we believe promises will be kept.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,540
The true killer is found together with a secret cassette tape.

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,440
A message that sways Ai's heart.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,040
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:52,868
"The Secret Hidden in the Toilet (Part 2)"

9
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:58,868
The burglary that happened after my older sister visited here

10
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,368
was most likely done by those people.

11
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:01,968
Yeah.

12
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:05,168
They probably guessed that she may have hidden something here

13
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,168
and came to look for it.

14
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,068
There were traces of them having set up

15
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,768
wiretaps in the toilet too.

16
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:13,768
It's most likely that they couldn't find it

17
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,368
when they broke in here the first time,

18
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,668
and so they set up a wiretap.

19
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:19,968
But after hearing that the people here

20
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,768
knew nothing of something being hidden,

21
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,768
they probably broke in here a second time

22
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:27,968
to remove the wiretap.

23
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,268
But I think it has nothing to do with this case.

24
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:32,768
President Dejima may be your father's friend

25
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:36,768
and your father may have been a member of the Black Organization,

26
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,168
but they haven't met for 30 years.

27
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:41,268
What if it's me that they're after?

28
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,268
They killed my father's friend

29
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:46,068
to mentally corner me.

30
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:47,068
Then what?

31
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,068
Don't be silly!

32
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,568
How could they ever find out something like that?

33
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:53,668
I could feel it.

34
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:55,468
The day when we went to that department store

35
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,168
in Haido-cho,

36
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,868
I could feel that callous glare on me

37
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:04,268
as I went unconscious.

38
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,668
What?

39
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:07,568
Then why did you come here?

40
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:10,068
Why did you do this if you knew you'd be in danger?

41
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:11,768
I wanted to know.

42
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:13,668
Is that reason good enough?

43
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,368
I wanted to know whether my parents

44
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:19,668
were really the kind of people the organization rumored them to be.

45
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:22,768
After meeting your cheerful mother,

46
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,468
I had this urge of wanting to do so.

47
00:03:24,468 --> 00:03:29,368
But leaving aside my mad scientist father,

48
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:31,668
it seems that my mother was reticent, somber,

49
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:34,668
and hard to understand as rumor has it.

50
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:36,268
Don't be silly.

51
00:03:36,268 --> 00:03:37,968
It's just rumor, isn't it?

52
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,768
Don't make conclusions without seeing it for yourself.

53
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:42,268
Do you know

54
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:45,268
what my mother was referred to as in the organization?

55
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:47,468
Hell Angel.

56
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,768
An angel who has fallen to hell.

57
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:55,768
Well, now I'm totally uninterested in her

58
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,368
and feel sort of relieved.

59
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:01,368
Now that I've finished all I have to do here,

60
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,068
let's leave the homicide case to the police

61
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,268
and get out of here quickly.

62
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:09,568
I'm not even sure if we have any place

63
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:12,268
to run to at this point though.

64
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:18,068
But unless we find what your older sister had hidden...

65
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:22,168
He made a deduction a while ago regarding the wiretap.

66
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:24,168
It could be that after hearing

67
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,568
the conversation of the employees here,

68
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:27,668
they specified the place the object was hidden,

69
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,568
broke in here a second time,

70
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,568
found what they were looking for and retrieved the wiretap

71
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:32,968
while they were at it too.

72
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:35,468
Right?

73
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,468
That's why there's no reason we should stay here any longer.

74
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:41,968
So you were burglarized,

75
00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:44,568
but nothing was stolen?

76
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:45,568
No.

77
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:47,068
"Isamu Natsuhori (35)" -But it seemed that the president

78
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,768
"Designer" -thought that his design was stolen.

79
00:04:49,768 --> 00:04:50,868
"Tetsuo Imai (52)" -He insisted someone

80
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,768
"Designer" -had secretly taken a picture of his design.

81
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:56,668
The president was always nervous about things like that.

82
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:59,068
He would lose his temper every time he saw

83
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,768
a design that was similar to his.

84
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:03,068
He went to shout his mouth off this morning too.

85
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,268
This morning?

86
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:05,268
"Ukihiko Zaitsu (41)" -Yes.

87
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:06,968
"Designer" -To another design office.

88
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:09,268
He went to tell them off for stealing his design,

89
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,768
and he accused them of the burglary some time ago.

90
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:14,668
Don't tell me that...

91
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,968
Yes, it's possible that when he went to that design studio,

92
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:21,668
someone managed to get him in contact with the poison.

93
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:24,868
Well, I don't blame the president for being angry though.

94
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,168
If his design was copied and news began spreading,

95
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:30,368
people would get bored and it'd be disposed of in no time.

96
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:31,468
Disposed of?

97
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:36,868
Oh, yes. A strange thing happened after the burglary.

98
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,568
A strange thing?

99
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:40,368
A pen that was lost a long time ago

100
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,768
suddenly appeared again.

101
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,168
Right, right!

102
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,268
Together with my ruler.

103
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:50,568
So it was not stolen, and it suddenly reappeared?

104
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:54,968
Yes. I just found it on the shoe cabinet near the front door.

105
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:58,268
But wasn't that before the burglary?

106
00:05:58,268 --> 00:05:59,368
What?

107
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:00,968
Was it?

108
00:06:00,968 --> 00:06:04,268
But what was even stranger after that was the president.

109
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:07,368
Yeah. Now that you mentioned it,

110
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,668
it started around that time, didn't it?

111
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:12,168
He kept going around saying we should save water.

112
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:14,668
He started nagging us to save water.

113
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:18,868
So, we had to stop taking showers during work.

114
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,068
He wasn't the type to be worried about something like that.

115
00:06:21,068 --> 00:06:22,868
And yet...

116
00:06:22,868 --> 00:06:24,468
I see.

117
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,668
So that's what it was.

118
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:30,968
Could you take us to the design office then?

119
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,668
Yes, sir.

120
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:35,468
Something isn't right after all.

121
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:42,068
This case has nothing to do with the men in black.

122
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,268
The killer is probably that man.

123
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:47,968
He used the toilet to his advantage

124
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:50,468
to kill President Dejima.

125
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:52,468
And why should we leave when the treasure

126
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:54,968
is right before our eyes?

127
00:06:54,968 --> 00:06:56,368
Then...

128
00:06:56,368 --> 00:07:02,268
Yeah, it should still be in that toilet.

129
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:05,468
The thing that your sister hid in there.

130
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:12,068
Inspector! Let's go to the design office.

131
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,668
Yeah.

132
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,668
Maybe we can find out

133
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,168
how the poison was put on President Dejima

134
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:19,668
without being noticed by anybody.

135
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:21,468
No, you'll find nothing.

136
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:23,868
Well, you see...

137
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:30,168
Even if there were something with poison on it,

138
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:33,368
wouldn't he have touched something as soon as he came back here?

139
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:36,468
For example, the doorknob or the back of the chair.

140
00:07:36,468 --> 00:07:40,168
But the poison was detected only on the president's left hand,

141
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,968
the right side of his slacks, the belt holes of his belt,

142
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,468
the handkerchief that he had

143
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:48,368
and the wrapper of the hamburger

144
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,668
that he took a bite of just before he collapsed.

145
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:55,068
Besides, the poison was of a very small amount.

146
00:07:55,068 --> 00:07:57,468
He must've touched the poison beforehand

147
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:00,768
for it to rub off on those spots.

148
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:02,968
You can already make it out, can't you?

149
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,968
Where did the poison got onto the president's hand?

150
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:09,068
The place where you loosen your belt,

151
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:11,168
pull your slacks up and down,

152
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:13,868
and the place where you use a handkerchief.

153
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:17,768
Don't tell me

154
00:08:17,768 --> 00:08:19,568
it was in the toilet?

155
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,968
Yes. President Dejima came in contact

156
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,968
with the poison in the toilet and was killed

157
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:31,568
by one of the three employees over there!

158
00:08:44,248 --> 00:08:46,248
But Dr. Agasa,

159
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:49,648
there was no poison reaction found in the toilet.

160
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,948
It's only natural that there was no reaction.

161
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:57,848
Because the thing with the poison smeared on it

162
00:08:57,848 --> 00:09:01,648
was taken out of the toilet by President Dejima himself.

163
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,448
What?

164
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,048
It was taken out?

165
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:07,748
You know, the thing that you have to throw away

166
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:10,448
once it's been used up.

167
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:13,248
There wasn't any freshener inside.

168
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:14,648
And if he had changed the towel,

169
00:09:14,648 --> 00:09:17,748
there would've been a cleaner one inside.

170
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:20,248
Then, all that's left would be changing the toilet paper...

171
00:09:20,248 --> 00:09:23,848
Right! The cylinder!

172
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,248
It's the cylinder of the toilet paper!

173
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:28,948
If poison is smeared on it and it's left in place,

174
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:31,148
when the paper runs out and the roll has to be changed,

175
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:32,548
the person would take the empty roll

176
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:34,348
out of the toilet to dispose of it!

177
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:37,148
But if that was the case,

178
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:39,548
poison should be found on the toilet paper

179
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:41,548
that had been newly changed.

180
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,048
Usually, after you change the toilet paper roll,

181
00:09:44,048 --> 00:09:45,348
you would use it, wouldn't you?

182
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:48,748
But in this case, the part with the poison on it

183
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:53,448
was torn off, used and flushed down the toilet.

184
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:55,448
-I see. -I see.

185
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:59,348
You see, are you convinced now?

186
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:05,848
And this is probably what President Dejima did in the toilet.

187
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,348
First, he realized that the roll was out of paper.

188
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:12,648
He touched the roll with poison on it with his right hand

189
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,748
and put it on the floor.

190
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,948
Then, he reached over for the new roll of toilet paper

191
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,148
on the shelf and replaced it.

192
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,348
After finished using the toilet paper,

193
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:24,148
he pulled his slacks up with his poisoned right hand,

194
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:25,948
fastened his belt,

195
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:27,748
and flushed the toilet with the lever

196
00:10:27,748 --> 00:10:31,448
on the left side of the tank with his right hand.

197
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:32,948
After washing his hands,

198
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:35,248
if he wiped his hands with the handkerchief,

199
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,048
the poison would be wiped off.

200
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,348
And if he exited the toilet with the empty roll,

201
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,548
no poison would be left inside the toilet.

202
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:47,548
But the poison was detected on the victim's left hand.

203
00:10:47,548 --> 00:10:50,348
He wasn't left-handed, so why would the poison

204
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,248
that was on the roll go on his left hand?

205
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:54,048
Come on, Inspector!

206
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:55,848
If you open the door with your right hand,

207
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:58,948
you would naturally hold the roll with your left hand, wouldn't you?

208
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:05,648
I see.

209
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:07,648
So, he brought the roll out of the toilet

210
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:09,048
and threw it into the wastebasket,

211
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:11,648
then grabbed the burger with his poisoned left hand,

212
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:15,248
ate it, and died.

213
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:17,748
Shall we test it out?

214
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:21,348
Let's go into the toilet.

215
00:11:28,548 --> 00:11:31,248
Wait, Dr. Agasa!

216
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:35,048
The most important thing isn't solved yet!

217
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:36,948
Who of the three employees

218
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:39,548
was the one that set up this trick?

219
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:42,148
The most suspicious would be the one

220
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:46,148
who went into the toilet right before the president.

221
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:47,948
Hold it.

222
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:49,548
Isn't it strange?

223
00:11:49,548 --> 00:11:50,948
It's true that the president

224
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:54,048
can be poisoned to death in the way he just explained,

225
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,548
but unless the president had the runs, went to the toilet

226
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,248
and used the toilet paper

227
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:01,148
while somebody went out to buy the hamburgers,

228
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:03,348
this crime wouldn't have occurred.

229
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,048
Besides, the president was the one who said

230
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,648
he wanted to eat hamburger.

231
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:12,848
It did fit in a bit too well.

232
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:18,248
That's why the killer carried out repeated simulations.

233
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:23,148
President Dejima had probably never dreamed

234
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:26,848
that the coffee which Mr. Imai served him everyday...

235
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,548
contained laxative.

236
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:32,848
-Laxative? -Laxative?

237
00:12:35,748 --> 00:12:36,948
Then...

238
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,948
Mr. Imai's the one...

239
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,048
What?

240
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:44,248
He put more laxative in the coffee everyday

241
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:47,248
to get the president used to the taste,

242
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:48,648
and he calculated the timing of the president going to the toilet

243
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:51,248
with the amount of laxative he put in the coffee.

244
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:55,648
So, the president had frequent runs lately because...

245
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,248
Yes.

246
00:12:57,248 --> 00:13:00,048
And since the president ordered hamburger,

247
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:03,548
he decided to kill him today.

248
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:07,748
Mr. Imai brought the cookie together with the coffee

249
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:10,648
so that it would urge the president to go to the toilet.

250
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:15,448
When people eat, a strong peristaltic movement takes place

251
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:18,948
from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon.

252
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:21,548
In other words, when something goes into the stomach,

253
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:23,948
there will be a need for bowel movement.

254
00:13:24,848 --> 00:13:26,548
Well, if President Dejima was taking laxatives

255
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:29,748
on a regular basis because of his hemorrhoids,

256
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:32,048
it wouldn't seem strange if laxatives were detected

257
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:35,148
in his body during the autopsy.

258
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,048
Even if laxatives were to be found in his coffee...

259
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:40,848
We would think that he had been drinking coffee that way.

260
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:43,748
So, there would be nothing suspicious.

261
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:47,248
Which means that Mr. Imai set the poison up

262
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:49,348
when he went to the toilet.

263
00:13:49,348 --> 00:13:52,648
Hey! I went in before the president.

264
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,548
If I hadn't urinated but had gone to move my bowels instead,

265
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,248
are you saying I would've been dead?

266
00:13:56,248 --> 00:13:57,948
No.

267
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:01,648
You always hold your drink in your left hand.

268
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:02,748
And if you had to frequently urinate,

269
00:14:02,748 --> 00:14:05,348
it isn't hard to imagine that you'd do the same.

270
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:06,748
If you had to moved your bowels,

271
00:14:06,748 --> 00:14:10,748
he would probably plan to give you a wet tissue or something,

272
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:14,048
telling you to wipe your hands before eating.

273
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,448
How can you tell if somebody's going to urinate

274
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:16,948
or move his bowels?

275
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:19,748
He couldn't have looked into the toilet.

276
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:22,848
From the sound of the toilet being flushed.

277
00:14:22,848 --> 00:14:24,448
The sound of flushing?

278
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:28,748
President Dejima had nagged everyone about saving water.

279
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:30,448
You wouldn't use the lever that flushes a lot of water

280
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,748
when you urinate, would you?

281
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,648
He knew that Conan and Ai who went into the toilet after you

282
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:38,348
and were rushed out of there by the president

283
00:14:38,348 --> 00:14:42,348
didn't touch the toilet paper roll smeared with poison.

284
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,648
Okay! All we need to find now

285
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:47,148
is the roll that President Dejima threw away somewhere!

286
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:48,948
-Yes, sir! -Wait.

287
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:51,248
He always throws it in here.

288
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:53,648
See? I found it.

289
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:55,748
Inspector!

290
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:59,148
Here, forensic officer!

291
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:02,448
If there's poison on this,

292
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:04,348
there should be a bag that was used to carry it here

293
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:07,748
and a container for the poison somewhere.

294
00:15:07,748 --> 00:15:11,148
It's inside the triangular garbage disposer in the kitchen.

295
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:15,848
If it were me, I would go to the toilet and set the poison up,

296
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,848
then hide it in the kitchen while making coffee.

297
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:21,848
It's dirty and stinks,

298
00:15:21,848 --> 00:15:24,648
so nobody would want to touch it.

299
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:27,348
He wouldn't have to go and dispose of it himself

300
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:29,948
because somebody else would probably do it for him anyway.

301
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:36,248
And unlike the wastebasket,

302
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,248
just in case he wanted to change the place he hid it,

303
00:15:38,248 --> 00:15:39,948
it would be easy to retrieve.

304
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:46,448
Inspector! I found a strange plastic bag

305
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:48,648
inside the triangular garbage container in the kitchen.

306
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,048
You did!

307
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:52,348
If poison is detected from this bag

308
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:55,148
and your fingerprints are found on it...

309
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:56,548
I'm sure you'll find both.

310
00:15:57,548 --> 00:16:01,148
I had it on me day and night so that I wouldn't miss

311
00:16:01,148 --> 00:16:04,048
the chance to kill the president.

312
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:09,848
I first intended to kill him about 20 years ago.

313
00:16:09,848 --> 00:16:12,048
Twenty years ago?

314
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,548
Yeah.

315
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:16,848
Not too long after you joined this office.

316
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:20,348
Do you remember when I went independent and quit the job here,

317
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:22,548
then came back again?

318
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,048
It was back then.

319
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:27,248
Yeah, I heard about it from the president some time ago.

320
00:16:27,248 --> 00:16:29,348
You went independent, but couldn't make it,

321
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:30,848
so he accepted you again.

322
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:34,048
I couldn't make it?

323
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,648
There was no way I could make it.

324
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:38,448
Because the president was moving behind the scenes

325
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:40,948
and contacted the publishing companies,

326
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:43,748
telling them not to give a traitor any work.

327
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:46,848
Are you serious?

328
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:50,648
Yeah, a publisher friend told me.

329
00:16:50,648 --> 00:16:54,048
I was also enraged then, to the point of no return.

330
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,848
I was thinking of how to kill him when he came back.

331
00:16:58,848 --> 00:17:01,448
I was thinking all sorts of things in the kitchen.

332
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:04,048
Then it just so happened

333
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,548
that Akemi who was there with her parents

334
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:08,548
was standing behind me.

335
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:10,748
She asked me, "What's wrong? You look scary.

336
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:11,848
Are you looking for something?

337
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:15,348
Or are you hiding something?

338
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:18,848
Don't hide it in the triangular garbage container

339
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,448
because somebody might throw it away."

340
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:25,348
She remarked with a sad look on her face.

341
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:29,948
When I answered, "I think I was just tired",

342
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,948
she just smiled.

343
00:17:33,448 --> 00:17:34,948
It was after that

344
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:41,048
that Akemi started hiding our things all over the place.

345
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:44,448
But after seeing her innocent smile,

346
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:47,248
my will to kill vanished off somewhere.

347
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:53,148
Then why did you decide to go through it at this time?

348
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:54,948
The other day, when I told the president

349
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,848
I wanted to go independent again, this is what he said.

350
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:01,748
"You would never make it at your age.

351
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,448
It would've been a different story

352
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:06,248
if this were 20 years ago though."

353
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:07,648
When I saw her again after such a long time,

354
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,948
I felt like anything was possible.

355
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:12,348
But the president's words made me blow my top.

356
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:15,248
"Her"?

357
00:18:15,248 --> 00:18:17,748
Do you mean Akemi who came to use the restroom?

358
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:22,348
Yeah. I was kind of expecting her to come around again

359
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:25,348
after she smiled at me and said...

360
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:28,348
I'll come back again in about a week

361
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,148
with my younger sister.

362
00:18:31,048 --> 00:18:33,848
But she never came.

363
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:35,948
I thought that she would

364
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,648
blow off my intent to kill with that smile of hers again,

365
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:41,648
but I guess I was just being selfish.

366
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:52,548
So?

367
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,548
You found it, didn't you?

368
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:57,448
When you went into the restroom with Dr. Agasa.

369
00:18:57,448 --> 00:18:59,548
The thing that Akemi hid.

370
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:03,348
Yeah.

371
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:05,948
It dawned on me when they said,

372
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:08,548
as soon as your sister came to use the restroom,

373
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,948
President Dejima started nagging them

374
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,048
about saving water all of a sudden.

375
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:15,448
An object must've been attached

376
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:17,548
to the float in the toilet tank

377
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:20,448
which caused the water to flow out little by little.

378
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:26,148
I opened the tank and checked behind the float.

379
00:19:26,148 --> 00:19:28,348
And it turned out that a plastic bag with something inside it

380
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:31,048
was firmly attached to the float with masking tape.

381
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:35,348
There were traces of old masking tape on it too,

382
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,648
so it's most likely that 20 years ago,

383
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:38,648
your sister took Mr. Imai's words,

384
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:41,148
"I think I'm just tired" too seriously

385
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:42,248
and hid the pens and rulers

386
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,048
so he could take a rest from work.

387
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,848
Then, 20 years later, she came back again,

388
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:51,148
removed the things she had hidden

389
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,248
and replaced them with these.

390
00:19:55,048 --> 00:19:57,348
She put these cassette tapes

391
00:19:57,348 --> 00:20:01,548
numbered from 1 to 20 in this plastic bag.

392
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:04,348
Cassette tapes?

393
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:06,648
Yeah. I think that there's at least some clues

394
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:09,448
about those guys in here.

395
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:10,848
Some really important information

396
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,248
that she wishes to keep a secret

397
00:20:12,248 --> 00:20:14,548
from the Men in Black who are watching her.

398
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,048
Hey! Don't tell me

399
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:19,048
that you're listening to it now?

400
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:23,648
Yeah. I'm listening to the one numbered 11 to 15,

401
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,248
but the top part of the tape is blank,

402
00:20:25,248 --> 00:20:26,548
so I haven't heard anything yet.

403
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:28,148
No, don't!

404
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:30,248
It's something you don't need to know about!

405
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:32,748
If you delve any deeper, you'll really...

406
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,248
Sorry, Ai.

407
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:41,648
This is definitely a tape I shouldn't be listening to.

408
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:45,048
It's yours. A voice only for you.

409
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,048
Listen to it.

410
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:55,748
To Shiho who has turned 11 years old.

411
00:20:55,748 --> 00:20:57,548
Happy birthday.

412
00:20:58,348 --> 00:20:59,548
Mother?

413
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:03,548
Have you found somebody you like?

414
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:06,948
My first love was when...

415
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:09,448
She probably gave the tape to Akemi

416
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:11,448
after feeling that her life would soon be ending.

417
00:21:12,448 --> 00:21:16,048
She sent words to her maturing daughter

418
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:18,148
about the love she felt for her.

419
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:21,048
Akemi who received the tape

420
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:24,048
couldn't give it to Ai because of severe monitoring.

421
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:26,948
But she probably remembered hiding things

422
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:29,048
at the design office in the past and hid it in the toilet there

423
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:31,748
so she could secretly give it to you.

424
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:35,448
I'm happy for you, Ai.

425
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:39,748
Mother...

426
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:46,148
Your mother was genuinely an angel.

427
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:13,548
Sorry to keep you waiting.

428
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:17,848
I don't think I'll need any help from you.

429
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:22,748
Get her the minute you see her. Understand?

430
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,148
Calvados.
