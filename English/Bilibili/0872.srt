1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,610
"Cafe Poirot?" -What? Was it a look alike?

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,710
No joke?

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,810
Which means, you didn't go to the hall back then after all, Azusa?

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,710
No. Did they look that similar?

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,710
Yes.

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,910
I was called at the entrance of the hall

7
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,210
and completely deceived too.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,810
I wonder who on earth it was.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,810
Maybe Thief Kid?

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,910
He probably came to steal my heart.

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,210
No way.

12
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,310
Well, it was Vermouth.

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,510
But, she came all the way here to check things out so...

14
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:35,910
This probably means that the code that Koji Haneda left

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,110
behind 17 years ago, "Asaca Rum"

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,810
is also a concern of the Black Organization.

17
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,110
I wonder what his purpose was.

18
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,410
It's a bit creepy.

19
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,310
Talk about creepy...

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,610
When I went out to get some groceries a while ago,

21
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,510
two odd looking people went up to the detective agency.

22
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,110
Two odd looking people?

23
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,010
Were those two people dressed in black?

24
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,910
They were dressed like any other ordinary couple.

25
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,010
The dark one was her boyfriend.

26
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,410
Just like Mr. Amuro, he had dark skin.

27
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,810
Dark skinned?

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,210
Wasn't it Makoto?

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,710
Why would he be with a woman?

30
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,310
I wonder... Beats me.

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,610
They were talking about something weird.

32
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,910
Something about a rag.

33
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,010
A rag?

34
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,010
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

35
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,410
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

36
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,510
Rags dance in a terrifying case.

37
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,610
The forest where the Nue cries is a frightening place.

38
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,310
He sees through the one and only truth.

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,210
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

40
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,810
His name is Detective Conan!

41
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:33,867
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Roar Edition)"

42
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:36,067
"Mouri Detective Agency"

43
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,067
They weren't talking about rags,

44
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,367
but rather riches, buried treasure, you know!

45
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,667
Hidden treasure?

46
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,967
So it was him after all.

47
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:48,167
A letter came from the village head of a place called Yadori Village

48
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:51,867
asking Heiji to help in the excavation

49
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,767
because a clue to the buried treasures of Tokugawa was found.

50
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,467
So, I figured that while I was at it,

51
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:59,367
I might as well take your Dad, along with me.

52
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:00,867
I'm not going.

53
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:05,067
Because eve if it were to be the authentic buried treasures of Tokugawa

54
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:08,367
almost all of it would become the possession of the country.

55
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,567
Which means you're passing, right, Pops?

56
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,167
Okay then, since it's a consecutive holiday,

57
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:16,767
why don't you take this kid along with you and go with them, Ran?

58
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:20,467
But searching for buried treasures sounds kind of spooky, doesn't it?

59
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,767
Let's go together, Ran.

60
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,667
It seems that the village head is going to pay

61
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,667
for our transportation too

62
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:31,067
and since the letter came to Heiji,

63
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,967
it could be that Shinichi also got the letter

64
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:36,467
because he's a high school detective too.

65
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,067
To Shinichi too?

66
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,367
Yeah.

67
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:42,567
Come to think of it, Shinichi mentioned some time in the past

68
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:45,367
that he was interested in searching for buried treasures,

69
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:46,867
so maybe he'll come.

70
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:48,067
Hey, hey, hey!

71
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,667
Yeah, that's right! So, let's go too, Ran. Okay?

72
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,967
Gee, what're you up to anyway?

73
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,767
I'm sure you don't care for buried treasures either, do you?

74
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,167
I don't have a choice, do I.

75
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,467
If she doesn't come, you won't come either, will you?

76
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,967
There must be something behind this.

77
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:06,067
No darn way.

78
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:10,467
The buried treasures of Tokugawa are at Mt. Akagi in Gunma.

79
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:14,967
If an incident occurs that klutzy detective's going to show up.

80
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,567
Don't worry about that

81
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,767
because we're going to Shizuoka and not Gumna.

82
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,267
Shizuoka?

83
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:26,067
Hi. Welcome. Thank you for coming,

84
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,067
Mr. Heiji Hattori.

85
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:30,767
And hello to all your friends too.

86
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:33,767
I'm counting on you to excavate the buried treasures.

87
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,367
"Densuke Takekuma (58)" -After all, this is crucial

88
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,267
"Village head of Yadori Village" -to Yadori Village.

89
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,767
But, why Heiji?

90
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:44,367
There are detectives other than a high school detective, right?

91
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:46,467
Yes, but...

92
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,267
since we called a historical researcher

93
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,067
and archaeologist too,

94
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,167
we ran low of funds.

95
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,267
No offense,

96
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:56,667
but I thought that we could get a high school detective to come

97
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,867
if we offered to pay transportation fee and feed him meals.

98
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,467
Hey.

99
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,867
You're going to pay us for the Bullet Train charges

100
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,767
it took us to get here, right?

101
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,667
Of course.

102
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:14,267
Hey, you! You've got to be joking!

103
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,967
Are you telling us to stay at this shabby hotel?

104
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,167
It may look that shabby on the outside

105
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,567
but the inside has been cleaned spic-and-span.

106
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:25,367
I've also bought loads of groceries too,

107
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:28,067
so I'll do my very best to make you good food!

108
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,967
You're making the food?

109
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:33,167
In the past, we had many tourists

110
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,367
who came here to view Kurogane Lake there.

111
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,267
So, this hotel was flourishing too

112
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,167
but ever since that accident...

113
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,967
That accident...

114
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:43,067
What kind of accident?

115
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,267
Well, you know...

116
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:48,567
One of the members of the Tokugawa Buried Treasures team while excavating

117
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,467
"Michiki Tanzawa (62), Archaeologist" -got mixed up in a cave-in accident

118
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,367
and died.

119
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:54,967
Hey, hey.

120
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,967
Is it true that there are buried treasures near here?

121
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:03,967
Yeah. It was here at Sunpu Castle, in Shizuoka Prefecture too

122
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:06,367
that Ieyasu Tokugawa retired and passed away in.

123
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:10,367
Besides, there is a legend that goes like this too.

124
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,067
During the war-torn era,

125
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,367
Ieyasu who was almost captured by the Imagawa clan,

126
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,367
was saved by an old couple,

127
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:19,267
who hid and sheltered him here in Kurogane forest.

128
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,367
After Ieyasu subjugated and pacified the nation,

129
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,267
"Yasukatsu Someji (55)" -as a token of his appreciation

130
00:07:23,267 --> 00:07:25,167
"Historical Researcher" -to the old couple and their son,

131
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,967
he gave them a mountain-high heap of oval gold coins.

132
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,367
Really?

133
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,867
Yeah, I think it's also written in a Japanese poem.

134
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,267
The light of dawn seeps through.

135
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:37,567
The light of the sunset shines on 2,000 such jars

136
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,667
filled with 1,000 gold coins.

137
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:44,267
It's a nursery song passed down in our village from ages ago.

138
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,967
Well, the phrase, "the light of dawn seeps through",

139
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,967
is scattered throughout the nation

140
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:53,067
as a song relating to the place of the buried treasures, but...

141
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:55,467
"Fumie Masuko (46), Novelist" -If 2,000 jars

142
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:58,067
filled with 1,000 oval gold coins were found,

143
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,967
it would excite every man's spirit of adventure.

144
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:02,767
Which means there are 2 million oval gold coins...

145
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,267
It would be fantastic if it were true.

146
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,967
No, no.

147
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:10,467
For me, you two cuties

148
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:12,867
look more like shiny golden treasure.

149
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,067
Hey you!

150
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,967
What's with you?

151
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,967
Don't tell me that they're your girlfriends?

152
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,467
I'm the one that asked you the question first, you dork!

153
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,967
Come on and answer me, will you?

154
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:26,667
I'm a reportage that goes around throughout the nation

155
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,367
"Hajime Tsurumi (22), Journalist" -seeking monster legends.

156
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:30,967
-Mo... -Monsters?

157
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,267
It has nothing to do with the buried treasures.

158
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,467
You haven't heard?

159
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,467
Actually in this village...

160
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:41,867
Dog?

161
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,167
Stop it, I said!

162
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,067
I don't take to dogs...

163
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,067
-Cute. -Yeah.

164
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,567
It's the dog of the man of the excavating team

165
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:53,167
that I told you about a while ago.

166
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:56,767
After the accident, a neighbor who lives nearby fostered him,

167
00:08:56,767 --> 00:09:00,667
but since he kept running away and coming here,

168
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,867
we're just letting him be.

169
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:06,167
There are lakes right behind some trees

170
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,767
and it can be very dangerous but,

171
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:10,467
it seems that somebody comes to feed him sometimes.

172
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,467
"Stay out, danger!"

173
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:14,667
What a huge sign board!

174
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:19,767
Conan, it's dangerous so you shouldn't go in there.

175
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:24,467
And are these all the people you called here today?

176
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,767
Yes, well sort of...

177
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:34,567
Shinichi's not here after all.

178
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,667
I was planning to tell him the answer

179
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,067
to the question that was asked in London and yet...

180
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,767
And...

181
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:43,667
The thing you were telling me on the phone is true, right?

182
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,267
Of course! The view is beautiful!

183
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,167
Is it better than the night view of Big Ben in London?

184
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,267
Of course!

185
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,667
It's no comparison.

186
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,367
I hope you're really telling the truth!

187
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,467
I guarantee it!

188
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:01,667
Kazuha, I'll bet Heiji asked you to come here?

189
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,567
Yes. He said because he knew I wasn't doing anything during the holidays.

190
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,967
But talking about the cave-in accident

191
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:08,467
and monster story that we heard I while ago

192
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,467
is only giving me bad premonitions.

193
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:13,867
No, it could be...

194
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,367
A presentiment of romance.

195
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,467
I'm filled.

196
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:26,367
I'm really stuffed.

197
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,367
The potted dish was really delicious, wasn't it?

198
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,267
Thank you, sir.

199
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:32,567
No, problem. Don't mention it.

200
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:39,067
Now, I'll put rice in the pot,

201
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,867
pour mixed eggs into it...

202
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:46,067
And if you mix it like this with chopsticks, walla.

203
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:48,367
Super delicious porridge is made.

204
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:49,767
You're going to mix it?

205
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:53,267
The egg will be fluffier if you just put the lid over it.

206
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,867
It's better if you mix it

207
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:57,667
because you can taste the egg in every bite.

208
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,067
And?

209
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,367
Tell me about the monster story

210
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,967
that you were going to tell me a while ago.

211
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,467
That?

212
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,867
Among that excavation team there was a foreigner

213
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,367
by the name of Charles Abel

214
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:12,367
who spoke a few words of Japanese.

215
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,567
That foreigner was the man who got into the cave-in accident,

216
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,167
and when the other members of the team got to him,

217
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,567
he was still alive.

218
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:20,867
He was stuck between two rocks

219
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,967
and was trying to say something

220
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,667
so they asked him if he found something.

221
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:29,767
But he hurt his throat and couldn't talk.

222
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:33,067
Then one of the members handed him a notebook and pen.

223
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:39,867
He took it and slowly wrote three alphabets.

224
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:44,767
The members who saw the letters froze with fear.

225
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,167
Because on that paper,

226
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,967
the word Nue was written on it!

227
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:50,967
Nue...

228
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:51,967
Was written?

229
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:54,467
Nue... Don't tell me that...

230
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:57,567
It's the monster that appears a lot in old folklore?

231
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,367
Right. It has the head of a monkey,

232
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,667
the body of a badger,

233
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,067
its legs and arms a like that of a tiger,

234
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,467
and the tail of a snake.

235
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:08,367
It appears along with black smoke and an eerie roar.

236
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:12,667
It's an ancient monster said to bring upon misfortune!

237
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,967
Are you saying that the monster was beyond inside the cave?

238
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:19,567
Yeah. What else could it have been?

239
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:22,267
That's why I was invited here.

240
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:27,267
To tell the world about the existence of the monster

241
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,667
that plunged the excavation team into the depths of fear!

242
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,667
What do you think you're doing, hag?

243
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:38,167
How dare you gleefully recount a person's death!

244
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,967
You've ruined the porridge.

245
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,367
I sort of thought that your novels were somewhat similar

246
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,267
to what he just said though?

247
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,267
Indeed?

248
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:51,667
It's hard to believe that those words came from you just now,

249
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:55,567
because of the grotesque way that you describe

250
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:56,867
one being eaten to death by the monster.

251
00:12:56,867 --> 00:13:00,267
Oh, my... Should I be leaving?

252
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,967
Well, well everyone, let's cool off here.

253
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,267
Let's all sleep well tonight

254
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:08,767
and tomorrow morning let's hall head off to the excavation site.

255
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:19,367
What's this eerie sounding thing?

256
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,067
How unusual.

257
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,367
Is it here...

258
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:28,667
In this forest too?

259
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:30,367
It's here?

260
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:32,567
What's this sound?

261
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,267
It's the cry of...

262
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,367
The Nue.

263
00:13:49,634 --> 00:13:51,834
Nue's cry?

264
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,334
Don't tell me that it's in this forest?

265
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,034
You mean that monster that appears in old folklore?

266
00:13:58,034 --> 00:14:00,934
It's not the monster, but the bird.

267
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:02,834
Bird?

268
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:07,934
The bird called White's Thrush used to be called Nue.

269
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:10,534
They favor living in hillocks, low mountains,

270
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:12,934
and broad-leaved forests.

271
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:15,634
The monsters that used to appear in the Tale of Heike cried

272
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:18,234
in a similar way as the Nue bird,

273
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:21,234
so it was named as such.

274
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:28,634
I didn't think White's Thrush lived around here.

275
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,734
How unusual...

276
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,734
So, maybe the bird that the foreigner

277
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:38,034
who got into the cave-in accident saw was also that bird?

278
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,234
Because the only three alphabets he wrote on the memo

279
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:45,034
just before he died spelled the word Nue.

280
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,434
What the heck are you talking about?

281
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:52,934
That foreigner saw it at the cave of the excavation site, you know?

282
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,834
It couldn't have been a bird!

283
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:56,734
It was really there!

284
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:58,134
Deep inside the cave...

285
00:14:58,134 --> 00:15:01,034
The legendary monster, Nue!

286
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:06,434
But, it's not that someone who is alive now

287
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:09,934
saw that monster back then, right?

288
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:13,134
Well, I guess we can't say it's completely baloney.

289
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:15,934
Long ago, in the northwest of Lake Hamana, in Shizuoka Prefecture here,

290
00:15:15,934 --> 00:15:18,034
the corpse of a Nue came falling.

291
00:15:18,034 --> 00:15:21,334
The names of the towns called Mikkabicho, Nueshiro,

292
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:23,434
Dohzaki, Hanehira and Ona,

293
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:24,934
that all are a part of Hamamatsu city, Kita ward,

294
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,734
are each said to correspond to Nue's head,

295
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:30,534
body, wings, and tails.

296
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,334
The paws and legs of the Nue

297
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:36,334
are said to have fallen here in Yadori Village too.

298
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:38,234
Yadorimura in the past,

299
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:41,634
used to be written as night and bird,

300
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:45,634
therefore, resulting in the kanji character Nue.

301
00:15:47,034 --> 00:15:51,034
So, this cry that we're hearing may not be a bird but rather...

302
00:15:55,634 --> 00:15:56,934
It stopped crying?

303
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,434
Hey, let's go home already.

304
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:05,134
But, we came all the way here.

305
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:11,134
And all those monster stories are heard second-hand.

306
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,334
The foreigner who wrote "Nue" at his death

307
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,834
can't be trusted either.

308
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,134
I've got that paper!

309
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,434
You've got the paper?

310
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:27,334
See. "Nue" is written here, right?

311
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,734
After the cave-in accident,

312
00:16:28,734 --> 00:16:30,034
when the previous village head dug out the foreigner,

313
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:32,334
he found this near the body.

314
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:38,434
It's been kept at the village hall for 16 years since then

315
00:16:38,434 --> 00:16:40,634
together with this old beat up hair pin

316
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:43,434
that was found together with the paper.

317
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:47,634
If that foreigner was the dog's owner,

318
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:50,534
this dog must be pretty old too.

319
00:16:50,534 --> 00:16:53,634
It may die any day now.

320
00:16:53,634 --> 00:16:57,734
It seems to still have been a puppy when the man had it, though.

321
00:16:57,734 --> 00:17:01,134
What was found recently was this notebook with a page

322
00:17:01,134 --> 00:17:04,034
that perfectly matches the torn edge of this piece of paper.

323
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:09,334
It details where and how the team was excavating the cave

324
00:17:09,334 --> 00:17:11,934
and on what basis of information.

325
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,834
If we could go to the cave tomorrow

326
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:20,434
and describe where the buried treasure could be in front of the camera,

327
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:24,134
you'd be you'd be doing Yadori Village a huge favor.

328
00:17:24,134 --> 00:17:25,234
I see.

329
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:27,534
He wants to make a video to revitalize this village.

330
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:32,334
So, he never expected us to find any buried treasure to begin with.

331
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,934
Please rest well, everyone.

332
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:42,934
Did you get the beverages I requested?

333
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:46,834
I can't sleep well without it.

334
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:48,934
Now that you've mentioned it, what about my sake?

335
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,134
And mine?

336
00:17:50,134 --> 00:17:53,334
Yes, yes! I've bought them all.

337
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:56,334
I'll deliver them to your rooms later.

338
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,834
Milk and whiskey for Mr. Someji.

339
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:02,234
For Mr. Tanzawa, Japanese sake and dried cuttlefish.

340
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:04,934
Ms. Masuko, white wine and carbonated water

341
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:08,934
and Cola and potato chips for Mr. Tsurumi, correct?

342
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:12,034
I'll just drink out of the bottle, so I don't need a cup.

343
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,634
Yes, sir.

344
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,834
Shall I bring something for your party too, Mr. Hattori?

345
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,534
No need!

346
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,334
-Right? -Yeah.

347
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:21,734
Taking too much liquids

348
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:24,434
may want to make me go to the restroom in the middle of the night.

349
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:28,334
Rather, I'm worried whether I can sleep tonight or not.

350
00:18:28,334 --> 00:18:29,334
Yeah.

351
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:33,634
Make sure you check your room thoroughly before going to bed.

352
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,734
There was a desiccated mouse corpse

353
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:38,534
in the desk drawer of my room.

354
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,834
-What? -What?

355
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:43,834
That's strange I cleaned it thoroughly.

356
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:47,134
If you two are so scared,

357
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,134
would you like to sleep with me in my room?

358
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:53,234
You go and sleep with the mice!

359
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,834
I totally agree!

360
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,434
A letter?

361
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,234
What're you doing?

362
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:13,534
If you want to open the drawer,

363
00:19:13,534 --> 00:19:15,134
why don't you get to it?

364
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:16,334
But...

365
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:19,134
I don't want any mice coming out.

366
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:21,034
There's nothing like that inside.

367
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:25,934
Something's inside.

368
00:19:25,934 --> 00:19:28,834
"Notebook" -It looks like an old notebook.

369
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,334
I wonder who it belongs to?

370
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:32,034
I wonder if somebody forgot it?

371
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:37,934
Creepy.

372
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:41,334
A lot of the same words are written.

373
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:43,234
What is it?

374
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:47,634
The foreign excavator who died

375
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:49,834
must've been practicing hiragana, maybe?

376
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:51,334
-What? -See!

377
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:55,134
Charles Abel is written in hiragana on the back of the notebook.

378
00:19:55,134 --> 00:19:56,934
So, this room must be the room

379
00:19:56,934 --> 00:20:00,634
that the foreigner who died was using?

380
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,034
It's bright outside.

381
00:20:04,534 --> 00:20:05,534
What is it?

382
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,934
It's burning in front of the hotel!

383
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:10,934
-What? -What?

384
00:20:10,934 --> 00:20:12,134
Fire!

385
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,234
Hurry, get out of here! Fire!

386
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,334
"Stay out, danger!"

387
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:23,634
Who would do something like this?

388
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,434
It's Nue.

389
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:35,834
The Nue came along with the black smoke.

390
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:39,434
Idiot!

391
00:20:39,434 --> 00:20:42,534
-A thing like that doesn't exist. -Heiji!

392
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,634
Look at that.

393
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,534
Humongous.

394
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,034
What the heck?

395
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,134
It ran away.

396
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:08,134
Darn.

397
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,734
The trees are in the way so we can't go after it from here.

398
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:12,834
Village head, get the fire extinguisher!

399
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,434
Use all the extinguishers that you have here

400
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:15,634
and put out the fire!

401
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:16,834
Okay.

402
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:19,434
Kazuha, you guys help put out the fire too!

403
00:21:19,434 --> 00:21:20,934
What about you, Heiji?

404
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:23,034
Don't ask stupid questions, idiot!

405
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:25,834
I'm going around back to expose the identity of that monster!

406
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:26,934
-Wait! -Conan!

407
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,934
Look at these teeth marks!

408
00:21:36,934 --> 00:21:38,334
Yeah.

409
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,434
But, it's odd.

410
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:42,834
I came around from back and yet...

411
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,834
We didn't pass that monster.

412
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:49,234
Don't tell me that it slipped through the trees

413
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:51,934
and maybe it fled into the lake?

414
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:57,734
Blood?

415
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,434
It goes all the way towards the lake.

416
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:14,134
Isn't that Mr. Someiji?

417
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:16,034
Is he passed out?

418
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,734
No, he's already dead.

419
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:23,134
He's got claw marks on him

420
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,234
as if he were attacked by a beast.

421
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,334
"Next Episode" -He was dead?

422
00:23:56,334 --> 00:24:00,934
It's Nue. He was killed by that huge beast.

423
00:24:00,934 --> 00:24:03,034
That's some sort of a trick.

424
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:06,334
This burnt area smells of kerosene too.

425
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:07,734
What's with that fire?

426
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:09,734
Beats me. It broke out just like that.

427
00:24:12,934 --> 00:24:14,834
What was that scream?

428
00:24:19,034 --> 00:24:20,534
Next Conan,

429
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:24,334
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Claw Traces Edition)"

430
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,077
Next Conan's Hint:

431
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:29,377
"Huge beast"

432
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:30,477
The answer to the question that was asked in London?

433
00:24:30,477 --> 00:24:31,677
The intuition of blooming love?

434
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,977
-They're both acting funny. -They're both acting funny.
