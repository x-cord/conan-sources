1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,040
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,240
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,840
Misunderstanding and compassion-As a storm clears the air,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
today's incident helps strengthen the bond of friendship.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:01,153
Ms. Yoko Okino invites us to the engagement party of her friend.

9
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:03,953
"Yoko Okino (22), Idol" -Yoko and her friend, Kaoru Kusano,

10
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,053
are both ex-members of a pop group,

11
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:09,253
"Kaoru Kusano (20), Actress" -called "Earth Ladies."

12
00:02:10,753 --> 00:02:11,853
We get to the party,

13
00:02:11,853 --> 00:02:13,953
where we see other ex-members of "Earth Ladies",

14
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:16,953
"Yuki Takeno (22), Multi-talented" -Yuki Takeno...

15
00:02:16,953 --> 00:02:20,353
"Terumi Hoshino (23), Actress" -and Terumi Hoshino, who were also invited.

16
00:02:20,353 --> 00:02:23,653
But Kaoru, while taking a bath

17
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:25,753
is attacked by someone.

18
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:37,953
"The Secrets of Pop Stars (Part 2)"

19
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,653
But before that,

20
00:02:42,653 --> 00:02:45,253
aren't you forgetting to do something?

21
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,953
The deadly weapon.

22
00:02:48,953 --> 00:02:51,653
The knife that was used to cut Kaoru's throat.

23
00:02:51,653 --> 00:02:56,253
If It's found in our belongings or indoors,

24
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,953
the criminal's among us.

25
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:00,353
I don't think a criminal from outside

26
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:03,253
would hide the weapon somewhere in this condo.

27
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:05,853
The criminal may have wiped the blood from the knife,

28
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,653
and the hemoglobin of the blood may be invisible to the naked eye.

29
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:10,153
But, luminol solution can detect

30
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,853
the small amount of hemoglobin in the blood.

31
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:15,353
It's not something you can hide after all, right?

32
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:17,953
You're right.

33
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:26,453
You know very well.

34
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:30,453
I'm hooked on detective novels by thanks to someone.

35
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:35,053
Okay, Takagi, you body check Mr. Kenzaki

36
00:03:35,053 --> 00:03:38,053
and you police women search those ladies.

37
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:40,653
The rest of you split up to search for the weapon.

38
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:41,853
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

39
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,253
But Inspector, if Mr. Maguma,

40
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:47,553
who is accompanying her to the hospital were the murderer,

41
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,753
the weapon would already...

42
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:50,753
This is bad.

43
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:52,653
You don't have to worry about it.

44
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:58,353
I asked the paramedics to call here if he were to act strangely.

45
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:00,253
I see.

46
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:05,853
Next, Ms. Takeno, please.

47
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:06,853
Yes.

48
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:12,953
Hey, was Ms. Takeno a regular on "Detective Samonji"?

49
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,453
Yeah. She played a role of an annoying journalist

50
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:17,153
who followed Detective Samonji.

51
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:20,453
But she canceled her appearance on the drama

52
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:22,953
because of her father's illness, so her role went to Kaoru.

53
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:26,753
Actually, Terumi's name first came up for the role,

54
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:30,453
but thanks to Mr. Maguma's push, Kaoru got the role.

55
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:35,453
A little while ago, she called Mr. Maguma a loser.

56
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:38,153
Mr. Maguma was also a would-be actor

57
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,253
and he belonged to the same studio as us.

58
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:46,253
But he gave up his dream early on and became her manager.

59
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:50,853
Nonetheless, and contrary to what she said before,

60
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:53,453
Kaoru thought highly of him and expressed her regret over his decision,

61
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:57,653
saying "he gave up too soon, he just doesn't have courage"

62
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:05,553
I see. No weapon was found.

63
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:07,353
No. We couldn't find it anywhere, the room,

64
00:05:07,353 --> 00:05:10,053
the drain pipe, or their belongings.

65
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:13,853
Did you check their fashion accessories too?

66
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:16,453
Yes. Ms. Takeno's false nails

67
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:18,453
and Ms. Hoshino's earrings.

68
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:21,853
We even checked Mr. Kenzaki's choker...

69
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,553
but there was no luminol reaction.

70
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,953
About Mr. Maguma going to the hospital?

71
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:32,453
Investigator said that he had looked into Mr. Maguma's glasses

72
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:34,653
but no results.

73
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:37,253
And until our detectives got to the hospital,

74
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,953
he was sitting depressed and gloomy on the chair.

75
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:41,953
I think it is very unlikely

76
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:43,853
that he would try to get rid of the weapon in question.

77
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:49,753
So, it appears that the criminal took the weapon outside then.

78
00:05:49,753 --> 00:05:52,853
We're driven back to the theory that it was done by someone from outside.

79
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,053
No, maybe not.

80
00:05:55,053 --> 00:06:00,453
The culprit wouldn't have known that Ms. Kusano was taking a bath.

81
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:03,553
So, it would be too daring if the culprit just walked inside

82
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:05,553
and tried to kill her.

83
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:08,553
But if it was an inside job,

84
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:11,353
the weapon must be hidden somewhere in this apartment right now.

85
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:13,653
But where is the weapon?

86
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,053
Inspector.

87
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:20,453
There's a bugging device in a stuffed animal in her bedroom.

88
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:21,453
What?

89
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:27,153
And there're signs of someone having rummaged in the drawers.

90
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:32,753
So, the criminal had known from the outside that Ms. Kusano was engaged,

91
00:06:32,753 --> 00:06:37,053
or even that she was in the bathroom.

92
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:39,753
If the perpetrator is her fanatic fan,

93
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:41,653
it would be possible that the culprit aggressively attacked.

94
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:45,153
Ms. Kusano and took something away to remember her by.

95
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:47,453
Then call her office immediately,

96
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:50,753
and ask if she had a stalker-like fan like that.

97
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:51,753
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,953
This is the bedroom.

99
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,953
That is the drawer they were talking about...

100
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:09,753
There are some pen and scissors.

101
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,053
This is the drawer of clothes and accessories.

102
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:15,753
This has been left untouched.

103
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:23,853
This picture...

104
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:27,453
Hey!

105
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:31,253
Don't do that! You're violating privacy.

106
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:32,853
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:39,253
Girls have secrets that she doesn't want anyone to know about.

108
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:42,853
Even though sometimes it could be foolish to keep a secret.

109
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:49,553
That picture, put it back in the drawer at the lower left.

110
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,653
She will be troubled if she can't find it.

111
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,053
Oh, yeah.

112
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:01,853
Okay, into the drawer at the lower left...

113
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:07,053
I see.

114
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,353
That's why...

115
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:12,553
I've solved the mystery about the weapon used by the criminal...

116
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:17,853
Now how would the culprit try to erase the evidence.

117
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,353
Anyway...

118
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:25,253
as long as the murder weapon isn't found indoors,

119
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:29,853
the crime may have been committed by someone from outside.

120
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:33,753
Maybe this was the work of an obsessed fan.

121
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,453
Now all we can do is hope and pray that Ms. Kusano,

122
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:40,753
who was taken to the hospital, gets better.

123
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,053
She may have at least seen the criminal.

124
00:08:58,253 --> 00:09:00,253
Hello.

125
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:05,353
Oh, yes. I'm a friend of Ms. Kusano.

126
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:06,453
Yes.

127
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:11,253
Kaoru...

128
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,053
Yoko?

129
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:18,253
What's wrong? It's from the hospital, isn't it?

130
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:21,753
Wait! Don't tell me that Kaoru...

131
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:24,953
Don't worry. The operation has been a great success.

132
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:28,153
They said she will come to in a few hours.

133
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,553
Oh, that's great.

134
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:31,053
Thank goodness.

135
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:35,653
Then you had better go to her now, Mr. Kenzaki.

136
00:09:35,653 --> 00:09:37,253
She needs you, her future husband.

137
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:39,353
Yeah.

138
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,253
But, is it okay

139
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,553
because I heard that hospital is being thronged

140
00:09:43,553 --> 00:09:45,353
by journalists who smelt trouble.

141
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:47,853
So, I'll go later.

142
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,153
I don't want to cause trouble to other patients at the hospital,

143
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:51,553
and I don't want this to be blown all out of proportion

144
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:54,453
by the media with misinterpretations.

145
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:55,553
Misinterpretations?

146
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,753
I mean...

147
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:59,653
Maybe it's about time you let it all out?

148
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:02,653
The real reason for this engagement party...

149
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:05,653
The real reason?

150
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:09,053
Oh well, that...

151
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:11,353
Well, actually... well...

152
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:41,739
That's too bad.

153
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:44,033
Things didn't go as planned.

154
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,328
Was it you?

155
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:51,540
The criminal who slashed at her throat in the bathroom.

156
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,836
Hey, kid. I'm sorry to say this, you are acting like a detective,

157
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,338
but there's no weapon here.

158
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:00,966
That deadly darned thing that cut her throat.

159
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:04,762
Listen, kid. The police searched everywhere in this room

160
00:11:04,762 --> 00:11:06,263
but found nothing,

161
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:08,641
and I didn't have it on me either.

162
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:14,355
If you insist that I'm the one, tell me where the weapon is?

163
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,940
I don't know where it is now,

164
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,360
but I can tell you what it is.

165
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,947
It's something long, attached to the tip of your finger.

166
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:27,743
Oh, you mean these fake nails? I'm sorry.

167
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:31,163
The police have already checked these nails but...

168
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:34,250
No, the fake nails are a camouflage.

169
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,838
It's the thing that you're hiding under your fake nails.

170
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:42,633
It's very hard, second only to teeth,

171
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,092
and can be used as a weapon to slit the opponent's throat.

172
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:44,552
that is capable of slashing the throat.

173
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:47,179
If you cut off your blood stained nail,

174
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,348
they would soon find out.

175
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:51,851
On the other hand, you thought a nail clipper

176
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,561
wouldn't be checked by the police.

177
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,147
But, you didn't bring one because

178
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:59,150
you didn't want to have such evidence on you.

179
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,278
And moreover, because you knew all personal items

180
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,781
belonging to the suspects would be checked closely.

181
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:14,457
So? Tell me... how I cut my nail not being able to find a nail clipper?

182
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,167
I have already told you

183
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:20,880
your nail is very hard only second to...

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,257
your teeth.

185
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:25,968
After biting the nail into bits,

186
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:27,845
you drained it down the sink somewhere.

187
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,350
Doing so, even if bits of the nail are found,

188
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,562
they wouldn't look like a weapon.

189
00:12:36,562 --> 00:12:39,857
I have proof that you did that.

190
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:45,154
Look! Your lipstick mark on the card.

191
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:46,947
I didn't think much of it at the time but as time went on,

192
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:49,950
a part of it turned brownish.

193
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,162
If this is Ms. Kusano's blood that got on your nail during the crime,

194
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:55,581
and that smeared on to your lips when you bit off the nail.

195
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:57,541
This is concrete evidence that...

196
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:05,257
Without it, she will attest the truth of all

197
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:10,262
that I called her from outside when she was taking bath...

198
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:16,769
and that I made her sniff something when she went out of the bathroom.

199
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:18,562
What?

200
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:21,440
Did she drink something before I came in here?

201
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:28,364
I loved him...

202
00:13:28,364 --> 00:13:30,449
I loved Mr. Kenzaki

203
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,160
ever since performed together.

204
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:41,375
But both my role and Kenzaki were taken away from me by Kaoru.

205
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,543
No, you're wrong.

206
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:49,841
So when I said "Congratulations" and you know what she said?

207
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:52,469
It's just a gimmick, a gimmick to make a topic out of it.

208
00:13:52,469 --> 00:13:56,765
See, he's kind of cute, it's good enough.

209
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:59,851
It surprised me

210
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:04,272
that my jealousy drove me to commit the crime.

211
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:07,859
Fatal misunderstanding!

212
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:12,572
The real reason why Kaoru got engaged with Mr. Kenzaki is...

213
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:15,867
How stupid I am.

214
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,578
If I only cut a little deeper...

215
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:24,376
but when I saw her face, I couldn't kill her.

216
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:26,753
I couldn't do it.

217
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:28,463
She is my friend.

218
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:33,343
I'm glad that Kaoru didn't die.

219
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:39,057
What? What did she drink?

220
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:43,061
Her face is pale, breaking into cold sweat

221
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:46,064
pulse racing, and hands shaking...

222
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,567
having jitters...

223
00:14:49,568 --> 00:14:51,862
My dad often goes to see the doctor at this hospital

224
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:53,155
because of his diabetes,

225
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:55,073
so I know the number.

226
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:59,077
Hypoglycemiants.

227
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,246
Medicine for people with diabetes

228
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:02,664
if a normal person takes it,

229
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:04,541
their blood sugar level will drop too low

230
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,877
and so the pill is very likely to be fatal.

231
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:10,964
If she had prepared it in advance,

232
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:13,842
she may have been planning to kill herself all along.

233
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,470
"Sugar stick" -I found it.

234
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,973
I won't let you die

235
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,476
just because of a misunderstanding. That's too sad.

236
00:15:22,476 --> 00:15:24,352
I will not let you die!

237
00:15:28,857 --> 00:15:30,942
Kaoru...

238
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:33,445
I'm sorry, Kaoru.

239
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:35,238
I'm so sorry.

240
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,866
Kaoru.

241
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:43,455
Kaoru...

242
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:45,957
Are you awake yet?

243
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,376
Where am I?

244
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:49,753
Haido hospital.

245
00:15:49,753 --> 00:15:52,255
You have been sleeping for two whole days now.

246
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,466
You're so silly.

247
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:58,845
You mistook your daddy's medicine for a vitamin pill.

248
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:03,350
Well, I'm going to call Terumi and tell her that Yuki has finally awake.

249
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:18,365
Well, Kaoru... I...

250
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:22,369
All right. I told the police in detail about what happened...

251
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:24,663
that the person who attacked me in the bathroom

252
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:27,374
was a short fat middle aged woman.

253
00:16:28,542 --> 00:16:31,169
I just kind of tentatively said that the criminal was a middle aged woman.

254
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:35,966
I don't want to be thought that some stalker old man saw me naked, so...

255
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:39,678
But... It was me...

256
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:41,763
Well, I will thankfully accept this scar on my neck

257
00:16:41,763 --> 00:16:45,267
as a punishment for deceiving you

258
00:16:45,267 --> 00:16:47,060
without considering your feelings at all.

259
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,770
Were you deceiving me?

260
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,775
Yeah. That engagement party thing was all a hoax,

261
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:55,652
a complete fabrication that Mr. Kenzaki and I made up

262
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:58,738
to help somebody make a decision.

263
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:01,366
Remember, I used to say that my dream

264
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:06,079
was to suddenly get married at 20, just like Yukiko Kudo.

265
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,164
-Yeah. -And, and...

266
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:11,251
Now that dream has just come true!

267
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:12,460
"Kaoru Kusano announced her marriage..." -Look.

268
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,753
"with her manager, Atsushi Maguma after four years of being friend"

269
00:17:13,753 --> 00:17:15,171
Look at the morning paper today.

270
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,841
He finally made up his mind.

271
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:22,554
Do you still like him, that geek guy?

272
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:25,640
Shut up. He sure doesn't have guts,

273
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,475
but he still has good points.

274
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:31,646
He announced his feelings for me in front of the journalists and cameras.

275
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:35,358
She is the one I love, I don't want to lose her.

276
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:40,155
He said that about me.

277
00:17:43,742 --> 00:17:44,868
Really...

278
00:17:44,868 --> 00:17:46,161
Actually, a lot of things happened but...

279
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:47,871
I think it was meaningful to carry out my plan,

280
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,040
despite Terumi's objection.

281
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,668
What? Terumi also knew about the plan?

282
00:17:53,668 --> 00:17:57,547
In fact, we, Terumi and I weren't on bad terms with each other.

283
00:17:57,547 --> 00:18:01,343
That fight was a fake fight to disband our group

284
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,470
because we thought if we had continued the group,

285
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,057
we would have gotten all messed up.

286
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:09,768
I knew you and Yoko wanted to continue the group.

287
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,062
So, we were hiding the real reason from you. I'm sorry.

288
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:19,277
I see. You pretended to be fighting in order to hide it from me.

289
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:21,363
Then what did she mean when she wrote,

290
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:24,240
"I express my condolences" on that card.

291
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,452
Oh, that kid told me, that the painful remarks

292
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:31,665
from her meant that "our plan has failed miserably".

293
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:32,666
That kid?

294
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,668
Conan, you know...

295
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:38,463
Mr. Mouri must have trained him very well.

296
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,842
When Mr. Kenzaki carried me out of the bathtub,

297
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:46,471
Conan saw that he got bashful, covering my body with a towel,

298
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:49,849
and realized that he wasn't my fiancee.

299
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:51,976
Then, judging from the picture of Maguma and me,

300
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:55,563
and Terumi's words and deeds,

301
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:59,943
he asked me directly if I like him a lot.

302
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:03,071
He is also the one who put sugar in your mouth

303
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:08,076
as a stop-gap measure when you collapsed with the effect of the medicine.

304
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:12,247
Oh, that boy...

305
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,874
And so, what will you do now?

306
00:19:14,874 --> 00:19:16,459
I mean, about Mr. Kenzaki.

307
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,752
If you still insist on hesitating,

308
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:19,963
Terumi may take him away from you.

309
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:21,256
Why?

310
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:23,675
This is also what Conan was saying.

311
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:26,177
The reason why Terumi is now hooked on mystery novels

312
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:28,763
is probably because she likes Mr. Kenzaki

313
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:30,640
playing the role of "Detective Samonji."

314
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:35,562
Unfortunately, that is wrong.

315
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:39,858
I heard Terumi dumped Mr. Kenzaki before.

316
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,652
Oh, really? So who is her ideal guy now?

317
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,656
I don't know, but it would not surprise me at all

318
00:19:46,656 --> 00:19:49,451
if Terumi has a younger lover.

319
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:22,377
Okay, the next part is you push your struggling opponent into the corner!

320
00:21:22,377 --> 00:21:26,673
Terumi, we'll count on you to act the cool female Shogi player, as usual.

321
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:27,674
Yes.

322
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:33,763
"Shinichi Kudo"

323
00:21:33,763 --> 00:21:34,764
Okay.

324
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:39,477
Oh, don't you know that you have already lost the game.

325
00:21:39,477 --> 00:21:42,355
In my point of view, the game ended twenty eight turns ago

326
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:44,566
when you moved "Gin".

327
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:50,154
In fact, your formation looks solid but...

328
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:54,367
Terumi acts like a detective rather than a Shogi player.

329
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:57,161
In order to win a brilliant victory,

330
00:21:57,161 --> 00:22:01,541
there's only one move to make. This is the truth.

331
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,959
Certainly.

332
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:07,046
No way.

333
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:13,344
"Next Episode"

334
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:14,679
Don't tell me that...

335
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:16,764
Conan!

336
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:22,770
No good, he's dead already.

337
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,065
He's bleeding from his head, which means...

338
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:27,442
What's this?

339
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:30,778
A piece of chocolate?

340
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,239
Next Conan,

341
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:36,993
"Tragedy at OK Ranch"

342
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:39,704
Next Conan's Hint:

343
00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:41,789
"Horseshoe"

344
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:43,499
Next is horse!

345
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:45,168
Did someone call me?
