1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.940
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.940
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.740
A strange member, a deep secret.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.740
What will become of Conan and Ai in the future?

5
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:58.353 --> 00:02:00.253
Ai Haibara and I board a bus

9
00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.653
with Dr. Agasa and the Youth Detective Squad

10
00:02:03.653 --> 00:02:05.653
on our way to get in some Spring skiing.

11
00:02:06.953 --> 00:02:10.953
On the way, Mr. Araide and Miss Jodie

12
00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:13.153
also board the bus

13
00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:16.853
and Haibara suddenly becomes scared, she's just not herself.

14
00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:23.053
Just then,

15
00:02:23.053 --> 00:02:26.153
two men wearing ski suits board the bus

16
00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:28.253
and hijack it.

17
00:02:29.653 --> 00:02:32.653
I hide and try to contact the police, but...

18
00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:38.653
You little brat...

19
00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:44.053
Brat! Try something like that again,

20
00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:45.453
you're really going to get it!

21
00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:48.653
Gosh. He took my phone.

22
00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:50.953
Conan! Are you all right?

23
00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.153
That's strange.

24
00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:55.653
He came straight for me.

25
00:02:55.653 --> 00:02:57.953
But I'm sure he couldn't see me. I was hiding behind the seat.

26
00:02:59.753 --> 00:03:01.453
That must mean...

27
00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:04.053
another one from their gang's on this bus.

28
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:06.653
It must be one of those three

29
00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:08.353
since they could see what I was doing.

30
00:03:11.253 --> 00:03:14.153
But how'd he let him know?

31
00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:18.553
How'd he let him know where I was?

32
00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:20.753
How'd he do it without anybody noticing?

33
00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:30.053
"Mysterious Passenger (Part 2)"

34
00:03:33.453 --> 00:03:36.653
Hey, Haibara. Do you have any ideas?

35
00:03:37.353 --> 00:03:38.953
Hey.

36
00:03:46.953 --> 00:03:49.653
Don't do anything foolish, cool kid.

37
00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:55.053
You'll get your chance soon.

38
00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:59.653
You don't have to be so scared.

39
00:03:59.653 --> 00:04:02.253
What's your name, little red riding hood?

40
00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:05.453
She's...

41
00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:12.853
What's your name, little red riding hood?

42
00:04:15.953 --> 00:04:17.953
She's a stranger.

43
00:04:17.953 --> 00:04:19.753
We just happen to be sitting next to each other.

44
00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:23.453
She's really scared, so I think we should leave her alone.

45
00:04:23.453 --> 00:04:25.853
-I'm sorry! -You over there!

46
00:04:25.853 --> 00:04:28.653
What're you doing over there?

47
00:04:28.653 --> 00:04:32.753
Miss Jodie. Please don't upset them.

48
00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:35.153
Oh, okay!

49
00:04:35.153 --> 00:04:38.353
Let's talk about it later.

50
00:04:38.353 --> 00:04:39.653
Sure.

51
00:04:44.653 --> 00:04:47.953
Hey, don't tell me...

52
00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.353
It can't be, someone's here?

53
00:04:51.253 --> 00:04:52.753
Here, on this bus...

54
00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:56.953
Someone from the organization?

55
00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:01.653
But for now, we've got to find out

56
00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:04.353
who these hijacker's partner is.

57
00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:07.353
I've got to figure out who it is and take care of him,

58
00:05:07.353 --> 00:05:10.853
for now, the organization is the least of my worries.

59
00:05:10.853 --> 00:05:13.453
And those three are very suspicious.

60
00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:16.053
The most suspicious one is...

61
00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:20.953
the guy who has the opportunity to signal him by sound.

62
00:05:20.953 --> 00:05:23.853
The guy who's been coughing.

63
00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:25.453
That guy.

64
00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:29.753
But then, Dr. Agasa is also coughing.

65
00:05:30.953 --> 00:05:34.853
There's not too much difference in the sound of their coughs.

66
00:05:34.853 --> 00:05:36.453
And if the signal's sound,

67
00:05:36.453 --> 00:05:39.753
then that woman chewing gum is also a suspect.

68
00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:43.353
But the coughing sound is louder.

69
00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:46.153
Those guys were by the driver's seat that time.

70
00:05:47.253 --> 00:05:50.253
They wouldn't be able to hear her chewing gum from there.

71
00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:54.753
That leaves that guy with the hearing aid.

72
00:05:56.353 --> 00:05:58.853
If that hearing aid were a wireless microphone,

73
00:05:58.853 --> 00:06:02.453
he'd be able to whisper a message,

74
00:06:02.453 --> 00:06:03.953
but neither of the hijackers

75
00:06:03.953 --> 00:06:06.453
don't have anything in their ear.

76
00:06:06.453 --> 00:06:07.453
Besides, if he said something,

77
00:06:07.453 --> 00:06:09.653
the other two beside him would've heard him.

78
00:06:11.553 --> 00:06:13.353
The only thing those hijackers are

79
00:06:13.353 --> 00:06:14.953
also checking is that back mirror.

80
00:06:14.953 --> 00:06:16.353
Hey, old man!

81
00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:20.153
What're you messing with?

82
00:06:20.153 --> 00:06:23.953
It's... only cough medicine.

83
00:06:23.953 --> 00:06:25.953
Again.

84
00:06:25.953 --> 00:06:28.053
They've been signaled again.

85
00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:30.353
Gosh! How's it being done?

86
00:06:30.353 --> 00:06:32.853
How're they being signaled?

87
00:06:36.053 --> 00:06:38.153
We've been waiting for your call, Mr. Yajima.

88
00:06:38.153 --> 00:06:41.353
Well? How are things on your end?

89
00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:44.853
No problem. I lost the cops.

90
00:06:44.853 --> 00:06:49.053
All right then, we'll meet at the usual place 3 days from today.

91
00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:52.153
Okay, driver.

92
00:06:52.153 --> 00:06:54.353
Get on the expressway then the Chuo freeway.

93
00:06:54.353 --> 00:06:55.753
Yes, sir!

94
00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.453
When you get to the Kobotoke Tunnel,

95
00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:03.453
drop your speed.

96
00:07:04.453 --> 00:07:06.253
Don't worry about anything.

97
00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:09.353
We'll release the passengers, just like you told us to.

98
00:07:20.253 --> 00:07:23.753
Hey! You with the glasses,

99
00:07:23.753 --> 00:07:26.453
and that guy in the back coughing!

100
00:07:26.453 --> 00:07:28.753
You two get up here.

101
00:07:31.753 --> 00:07:34.553
What're you doing? Hurry up!

102
00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:37.453
You better do it. It's for your own good.

103
00:07:40.153 --> 00:07:42.853
So that's how you did it.

104
00:07:43.853 --> 00:07:48.053
And now I know who your other partner is.

105
00:07:48.053 --> 00:07:50.653
And you intend to get away from this bus.

106
00:07:59.253 --> 00:08:00.453
A notebook?

107
00:08:09.953 --> 00:08:11.753
"Do you have lipstick?"

108
00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:37.053
Good.

109
00:08:37.053 --> 00:08:39.853
Now to use this badge and get those guys to...

110
00:08:45.853 --> 00:08:49.653
What can you do with one lipstick?

111
00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:51.453
Show me your magic.

112
00:08:53.753 --> 00:08:55.553
Cool guy.

113
00:09:03.553 --> 00:09:05.253
Sato here.

114
00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:06.553
The bus is presently

115
00:09:06.553 --> 00:09:09.753
on the Chuo Freeway heading for the Otsuki direction.

116
00:09:09.753 --> 00:09:12.753
We're almost at the Kobotoke Tunnel.

117
00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:16.853
Continue tailing them. Don't lose them.

118
00:09:16.853 --> 00:09:18.353
Yes, sir!

119
00:09:18.353 --> 00:09:21.853
Listen carefully! The bus is nearly out of gas.

120
00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.153
I'm certain the hijackers

121
00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:24.853
will release three of the passengers as promised

122
00:09:24.853 --> 00:09:27.353
when they stop for gas.

123
00:09:27.353 --> 00:09:29.853
Contact the Yamanashi Prefectural Police

124
00:09:29.853 --> 00:09:32.653
and ask them to place officers at all parking areas

125
00:09:32.653 --> 00:09:34.653
the bus might stop at!

126
00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:36.553
Yes, sir!

127
00:09:36.553 --> 00:09:37.753
When the door opens,

128
00:09:37.753 --> 00:09:40.253
we'll rush in, that's the best scenario.

129
00:09:41.753 --> 00:09:44.553
Inspector! The bus is slowing down.

130
00:09:44.553 --> 00:09:46.053
What?

131
00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:49.653
The bus is now entering Kobotoke Tunnel.

132
00:10:03.553 --> 00:10:04.753
Okay, you two!

133
00:10:04.753 --> 00:10:07.653
Put these ski suits on and sit on the floor.

134
00:10:07.653 --> 00:10:10.353
And don't forget these hats and goggles.

135
00:10:14.653 --> 00:10:17.753
You're going to change places with us for awhile

136
00:10:17.753 --> 00:10:20.553
and buy us some time.

137
00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:21.553
We're going to disguise ourselves

138
00:10:21.553 --> 00:10:24.753
as two of the released passengers and make our getaway

139
00:10:24.753 --> 00:10:27.553
and you're going to buy us time to do that.

140
00:10:27.553 --> 00:10:30.353
Don't worry. The other passengers will testify later

141
00:10:30.353 --> 00:10:33.653
that you're not the hijackers.

142
00:10:33.653 --> 00:10:37.353
And whether our escape is successful or not,

143
00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:40.853
depends on you, driver! It's all in your hands.

144
00:10:40.853 --> 00:10:43.253
When we get off the bus,

145
00:10:43.253 --> 00:10:46.853
drive away and draw the police's attention to the bus.

146
00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:49.953
And to make sure you follow our orders,

147
00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:52.153
we're going to take one hostage with us.

148
00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:05.553
That woman in the back chewing gum!

149
00:11:08.953 --> 00:11:11.653
You, come here!

150
00:11:23.453 --> 00:11:26.353
When we get to the end of the tunnel,

151
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:27.953
I'll give you the signal to speed up.

152
00:11:27.953 --> 00:11:30.253
After the cop car following us is out of sight,

153
00:11:30.253 --> 00:11:31.753
you stop the bus.

154
00:11:32.653 --> 00:11:34.353
After we get off,

155
00:11:34.353 --> 00:11:36.853
keep going until you run out of gas.

156
00:11:36.853 --> 00:11:40.353
That's if you want this girl to stay alive.

157
00:11:41.353 --> 00:11:42.753
Yes, I'll do it!

158
00:11:42.753 --> 00:11:44.453
No, that's wrong.

159
00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:46.753
She's no hostage.

160
00:11:46.753 --> 00:11:49.153
She's one of them!

161
00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:50.453
I was right.

162
00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:53.053
After the three of them leave the bus,

163
00:11:53.053 --> 00:11:55.853
they're going to detonate the bomb in these bags

164
00:11:55.853 --> 00:11:58.653
killing us all so we can't testify as to what happened.

165
00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:03.353
That's right.

166
00:12:03.353 --> 00:12:06.953
They're going to be under police protection

167
00:12:06.953 --> 00:12:08.653
because everyone will think they were really passengers

168
00:12:08.653 --> 00:12:10.853
and they're going to make-up a story

169
00:12:10.853 --> 00:12:13.453
about the whole thing.

170
00:12:15.853 --> 00:12:17.353
And the police probably think

171
00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:20.953
there were only two hijackers.

172
00:12:20.953 --> 00:12:22.353
So if they say there was a struggle

173
00:12:22.353 --> 00:12:25.653
between the passengers and the hijackers,

174
00:12:25.653 --> 00:12:28.553
the police will believe that something happened

175
00:12:28.553 --> 00:12:31.453
and the bomb went off killing everyone.

176
00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:34.753
Which means

177
00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:37.353
the bodies of Mr. Araide and the guy with the cold

178
00:12:37.353 --> 00:12:42.053
will be found wearing ski suits

179
00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:46.353
and the police will think that they were the hijackers.

180
00:12:46.353 --> 00:12:48.953
They made them change in the tunnel

181
00:12:48.953 --> 00:12:51.853
so that they couldn't be seen from the outside

182
00:12:51.853 --> 00:12:54.653
but this darkness will work for me too.

183
00:13:02.753 --> 00:13:04.453
Is that our badge?

184
00:13:05.753 --> 00:13:07.653
Conan?

185
00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:10.653
Ears...

186
00:13:10.653 --> 00:13:14.353
Listen. Do exactly what I'm about to tell you.

187
00:13:14.353 --> 00:13:16.653
Don't worry. The inside of the bus is dark

188
00:13:16.653 --> 00:13:18.053
and they're so sure their plan is going to work,

189
00:13:18.053 --> 00:13:20.753
their guard is down.

190
00:13:20.753 --> 00:13:23.953
The moment the bus comes out of the tunnel,

191
00:13:23.953 --> 00:13:25.253
that's when we make our move!

192
00:13:42.661 --> 00:13:44.861
Okay! Speed up!

193
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:46.661
Okay.

194
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:50.361
Don't try anything stupid.

195
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:52.761
Just do what we tell you and you won't get killed.

196
00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:54.161
What a liar!

197
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:55.561
What?

198
00:13:55.561 --> 00:13:57.561
I know you're going to kill us.

199
00:13:57.561 --> 00:14:01.261
Isn't that why you're letting us see your face?

200
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:02.761
Listen, everybody. If we don't do something,

201
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:04.961
they're going to kill us...

202
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:06.561
with this bomb!

203
00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:11.161
You little brat!

204
00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:12.361
I'll shut you up!

205
00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:14.161
No, idiot! Don't shoot!

206
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:20.661
Huh? What is that red graffiti?

207
00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:21.761
Hurry!

208
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:23.361
Huh?

209
00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:30.361
Stop?

210
00:14:39.361 --> 00:14:40.661
This way, mister!

211
00:14:44.161 --> 00:14:45.861
Mitsuhiko, don't let go!

212
00:14:45.861 --> 00:14:47.261
You don't have to tell me!

213
00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:02.261
That hurts!

214
00:15:13.461 --> 00:15:14.861
You little...

215
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.961
Mr. Araide!

216
00:15:21.961 --> 00:15:24.161
Grab both that lady's arms!

217
00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:27.561
Her wristwatch is

218
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:29.361
is the device that'll set off the bomb!

219
00:15:29.361 --> 00:15:31.361
What?

220
00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:33.961
Kid, you just made a big mistake!

221
00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:50.761
I'm so sorry!

222
00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:53.361
We braked so suddenly, I lost my balance...

223
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:55.561
Stop that.

224
00:15:57.861 --> 00:15:59.961
What's wrong? The trigger...

225
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:05.861
You're so stupid.

226
00:16:05.861 --> 00:16:10.361
Didn't you know that the safety on that type of gun lock

227
00:16:10.361 --> 00:16:12.861
when you pull the hammer back lightly and stop it halfway.

228
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:15.261
You should have at least studied that

229
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:18.661
before you attempted to use it.

230
00:16:18.661 --> 00:16:21.161
What the? Who the heck are you anyway?

231
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:26.061
It's a big secret.

232
00:16:26.061 --> 00:16:29.561
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

233
00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:33.561
A secret makes a woman, a woman.

234
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:39.561
You surrender, huh?

235
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:47.261
We've got to get away from here right now!

236
00:16:47.261 --> 00:16:48.761
When the bus skidded,

237
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:49.861
my wristwatch must've hit something.

238
00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:51.861
The bomb's been activated!

239
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:54.861
There's less than a minute before it explodes!

240
00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:57.361
Are you serious?

241
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.261
Inspector. The bus's in the Kobotoke Tunnel area.

242
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:05.461
They've come to a sudden stop and now there's no movement.

243
00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:08.561
What should we do? Should we storm the bus?

244
00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:12.261
No. Wait for your backup to arrive.

245
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:15.461
Huh?

246
00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:22.961
Conan?

247
00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:24.361
What happened?

248
00:17:24.361 --> 00:17:26.161
The bomb those hijackers brought on the bus

249
00:17:26.161 --> 00:17:28.561
is going to go off in less than 20 seconds!

250
00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:30.461
-What? -We've go to do something!

251
00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:34.061
I'll stop the cars at the tunnel.

252
00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:35.861
Chiba, you go to the other lane!

253
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:38.761
You other men, help the passengers out of the bus!

254
00:17:38.761 --> 00:17:40.261
Yes, madam!

255
00:17:43.561 --> 00:17:45.361
Huh? Where's Ai?

256
00:17:45.361 --> 00:17:47.361
I don't see her.

257
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:49.361
Don't tell me...

258
00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:50.761
Is she really...

259
00:17:55.061 --> 00:17:58.661
That is right. This is the best way.

260
00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:00.561
Even if were saved,

261
00:18:00.561 --> 00:18:02.761
I'd probably run into that person

262
00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:05.561
when the police question us.

263
00:18:06.761 --> 00:18:09.361
If I were to disappear right now,

264
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:13.161
then there'd be nothing left to link those guys with the organization.

265
00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:17.961
I've always known that

266
00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:20.161
from the moment I ran away from the organization,

267
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:24.661
there'd never be a place for me in society.

268
00:18:25.661 --> 00:18:28.161
I'm such a fool.

269
00:18:28.161 --> 00:18:31.361
I really am a fool, aren't I, sis?

270
00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.561
Conan!

271
00:19:07.461 --> 00:19:09.261
Conan!

272
00:19:09.261 --> 00:19:11.661
Conan...

273
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:15.761
She's hurt!

274
00:19:15.761 --> 00:19:18.161
Can you take her with Dr. Aqasa and the others to a hospital?

275
00:19:18.161 --> 00:19:20.161
Huh?

276
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:23.461
I can answer all the police's questions by myself.

277
00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:26.061
Okay.

278
00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:29.861
There.

279
00:19:29.861 --> 00:19:32.661
Don't run away, Haibara.

280
00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:35.661
From your destiny...

281
00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:37.261
Don't run away.

282
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:43.961
Get to the hospital, quickly!

283
00:19:43.961 --> 00:19:45.261
Yes.

284
00:19:50.361 --> 00:19:52.961
Oh, cool kid!

285
00:19:55.661 --> 00:19:59.161
Breaking the window like that and rescuing the girl

286
00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:02.161
was so James Bond!

287
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:06.361
Miss Jodie, you're more like Agent 007 than me.

288
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:09.261
You tripped the hijacker and pretended to apologize.

289
00:20:09.261 --> 00:20:11.761
But actually, you put the safety on, on that gun, didn't you?

290
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.761
Oh, yes!

291
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:17.761
It went exactly like in the movies!

292
00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:20.761
Oh, come on.

293
00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:23.661
But you're very bright.

294
00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:26.461
How did you know she was part of their gang?

295
00:20:27.961 --> 00:20:30.161
It was the bubbles.

296
00:20:30.161 --> 00:20:32.061
Bubbles?

297
00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:35.061
She was chewing bubble gum.

298
00:20:35.061 --> 00:20:37.261
That's how she was signaling the hijackers

299
00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:40.461
which passenger was acting suspicious.

300
00:20:41.861 --> 00:20:45.061
The bubble would break

301
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:48.061
and the hand she used to pull the gum off with

302
00:20:48.061 --> 00:20:50.761
would show which seat that passenger was in.

303
00:20:50.761 --> 00:20:56.461
Then how did you know her wristwatch would set off the bomb?

304
00:20:56.461 --> 00:21:00.661
She was wearing a watch that had stopped at 1:00.

305
00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:02.461
That made me suspicious.

306
00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:04.561
I'm so mad though!

307
00:21:04.561 --> 00:21:07.861
Their boss got away!

308
00:21:07.861 --> 00:21:10.261
Don't worry.

309
00:21:10.261 --> 00:21:13.661
The police wouldn't let a dangerous man like that

310
00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:16.561
out of prison so easily. Not without a plan.

311
00:21:16.561 --> 00:21:20.061
I'm sure he'll be captured right away.

312
00:21:20.061 --> 00:21:23.061
Attention to all passengers!

313
00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:24.661
We have some questions to ask all of you,

314
00:21:24.661 --> 00:21:26.661
please get into the cars.

315
00:21:26.661 --> 00:21:28.661
We've got to go, too.

316
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:30.661
You're pretty messed up.

317
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:32.561
Are you sure you're all right?

318
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:34.561
I'm fine, no problem.

319
00:21:36.961 --> 00:21:39.661
I knew it! You've been hurt badly.

320
00:21:39.661 --> 00:21:41.761
You're a very reckless boy.

321
00:21:41.761 --> 00:21:43.961
Mr. Araide.

322
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:46.861
You can answer their questions after you've been treated.

323
00:21:46.861 --> 00:21:48.461
All right.

324
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:24.461
Ai, does it hurt?

325
00:23:24.461 --> 00:23:26.961
You're bleeding a lot from your leg.

326
00:23:26.961 --> 00:23:30.461
I'm all right. That isn't my blood.

327
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:32.061
What?

328
00:23:32.061 --> 00:23:33.361
That's right.

329
00:23:33.361 --> 00:23:37.061
This is his blood. He put it on me

330
00:23:37.061 --> 00:23:39.161
so that I'd be taken away from there.

331
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:44.361
It seems you've repaid your debt to me, Kudo.

332
00:23:46.061 --> 00:23:47.961
Please get it quickly.

333
00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:51.561
Unable to continue search

334
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:53.861
as unforeseen situation has occurred.

335
00:23:53.861 --> 00:23:55.661
The target did not show.

336
00:23:55.661 --> 00:23:58.261
We will resume investigation in a few days.

337
00:23:58.261 --> 00:23:59.361
Over.

"Next Episode"

339
00:24:13.661 --> 00:24:16.761
I guess he fell from his own apartment.

340
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:19.761
Did he slip while going to and from the veranda?

341
00:24:22.261 --> 00:24:24.461
Huh? This door bell's not working.

342
00:24:25.261 --> 00:24:27.461
Mr. Yoshimura's death wasn't an accident.

343
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:28.861
He was murdered!

344
00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:35.161
