1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,940
What? You have an appointment with someone?

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,140
Right now?

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,240
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,440
Since you called for us to come at this hour,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,040
I was sure we were going out to have dinner.

6
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,340
Dad just happens to be out

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,440
drinking with the master of Poirot and the others.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,840
Well, it can't be helped.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,840
There's someone I wanted you to meet.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,040
"Mouri Detective Agency" -All right, looks like it's time to go.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,240
It's fax.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,240
What's this about?

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,140
No way!

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,640
A catch-22 crisis is gracefully revived.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,940
The table is turned and the mystery solved!

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,440
A three-way battle among a woman judo champion, Kogoro and Eri.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,140
He sees through the one and only truth.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

20
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:48,962
"Might Over Mystery (Part 1)"

21
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:51,862
Troubled by a stalker?

22
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:54,362
Your acquaintance, Mom?

23
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:58,462
Well... Her husband was taken to court in the past,

24
00:02:58,462 --> 00:03:02,762
in order to settle a traffic accident.

25
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:06,362
Oh, remember the judo player Yuko Arisawa!

26
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:08,662
You know her, don't you?

27
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:10,262
I do, I do!

28
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,662
They say that, if she hadn't got injured,

29
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:14,662
she would have won a gold medal at the Olympics!

30
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:18,562
She's the former All-Japan champion for the 70kg class, right?

31
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:22,362
But if it's her, wouldn't the stalker be the one running away?

32
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:25,762
No. Even though she was the one who approached me,

33
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:28,062
it was her husband that was concerned.

34
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,062
What?

35
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:30,862
He was suddenly on edge,

36
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:34,462
and noted that ever since the traffic accident,

37
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,162
it seemed like someone was always watching him.

38
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:38,562
It seems he isn't sleeping at night, either.

39
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:42,962
Then, maybe the stalker's the victim of the traffic accident?

40
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:45,362
I'm not convinced that's the case.

41
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,762
The victim came to a mutual understanding

42
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:51,062
that it had been his own fault, and settled privately.

43
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:55,562
Also, it seems the victim has completely recovered from his injuries.

44
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:58,362
Then, who is the stalker?

45
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:00,762
She tried to convince him otherwise,

46
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:04,262
and even told him, "It's probably your imagination",

47
00:04:04,262 --> 00:04:07,262
but he won't listen to her.

48
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:09,762
That's why she wants me to come.

49
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:12,662
If there aren't any wiretaps or cameras,

50
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:16,262
we can prove there isn't a stalker.

51
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:19,462
But why are you going, Ms. Kisaki?

52
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:21,762
I wonder. Her husband seemed very grateful

53
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:24,562
during the settlement proceedings before,

54
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:28,662
so she probably thought that he would believe what I tell him.

55
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:31,262
No, that's not what I mean.

56
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,362
Huh?

57
00:04:32,362 --> 00:04:36,362
I mean, why didn't you ask Pops to handle the case?

58
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,662
-What? -That's right...

59
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:42,262
Mom is a lawyer! Dad is a detective!

60
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,662
If it's a stalker case, a detective is...

61
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:47,662
Because I didn't want to!

62
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,762
Isn't that reason enough?

63
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:52,662
Of course that's not "enough" at all!

64
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:56,262
Well, considering the things Pops usually does...

65
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,062
Strike!

66
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,362
Oh, no!

67
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:01,762
Jackpot!

68
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,162
It may just be a waste of time asking him to do the job.

69
00:05:04,162 --> 00:05:06,362
What's this?

70
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:08,462
While you have no problem coming to another's defense,

71
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:12,462
you won't intercede when it comes to your personal affairs, huh.

72
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:13,762
"Yuko Arisawa (37)" -Don't you think it's time

73
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:16,962
"Judo player" -for you to forgive your husband, Ms. Kisaki?

74
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:20,262
Yuko Arisawa! It's really her!

75
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:23,362
I'm afraid that's impossible for the time being.

76
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:28,862
Before I do, I'll wait for him to demonstrate his sincerity.

77
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,762
Then, why not go on and divorce him?

78
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:33,762
No, well, that's...

79
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:36,062
Well, at least he was able to give you a lovely daughter.

80
00:05:36,062 --> 00:05:38,762
I guess it's not that easy.

81
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:42,062
Oh, my. Did you have a son as well?

82
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:45,762
No, he's a boy of our acquaintance who's staying with us for now.

83
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,962
Well, at any rate, shall we head over to your house?

84
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:52,862
I'm sure your husband is waiting, too.

85
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:55,062
Yes, you're right.

86
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:57,162
Since it's about time for him to return from the office,

87
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:59,362
so I'll give him a call.

88
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:10,262
That's strange.

89
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:12,062
No answer.

90
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:14,662
Could he be taking a bath?

91
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,662
Oh, dear.

92
00:06:16,662 --> 00:06:18,462
Where are you?

93
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:19,762
I'm at a wake.

94
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:21,962
What? A wake?

95
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,962
Yeah, someone I know passed away,

96
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:27,162
so I came to his wake.

97
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,862
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

98
00:06:29,862 --> 00:06:31,662
The speaker phone?

99
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:35,762
So yeah, I'll be home late so go to bed ahead of me.

100
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,862
Ahead of you? It's tonight, you know!

101
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:43,062
Lawyer Kisaki is coming over now to discuss the stalker problem.

102
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:45,162
Was that today?

103
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:47,562
I'm at Lawyer Kisaki's office right now.

104
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:50,562
I'll put her on!

105
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:54,662
Yes, this is Kisaki speaking.

106
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:56,362
Well, no...

107
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:57,662
If it's truly an inconvenience,

108
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:01,362
we can meet on a more suitable day.

109
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:05,362
Yes.

110
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:09,062
Is that so? We will review the situation then.

111
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,062
How was he?

112
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,462
He said he'll be arriving home at 9:25,

113
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:17,262
so I'll meet with him then.

114
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:20,762
25 minutes later... That's really peculiar, isn't it?

115
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,862
Normally, wouldn't you say 9:00 or 9:30?

116
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:26,962
He's just really punctual.

117
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:30,662
He's rarely late for anything without a reason.

118
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:33,662
It does seem like he completely forgot

119
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,562
about Lawyer Kisaki coming over tonight, though.

120
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:39,062
Furthermore, we still have another two hours until 9:30.

121
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:43,562
Then, how about if we have dinner at a nearby hotel restaurant?

122
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:46,662
Actually, while I were killing time in the cafe until the appointment,

123
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:51,662
my car was in the parking lot of the hotel.

124
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:54,262
Not to mention, the parking fee will be cheaper.

125
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:57,262
In that case, is it all right if these two come along?

126
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,062
Why, of course!

127
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,662
You won the karate tournament championship!

128
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:06,962
That's amazing, Ran!

129
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:08,862
Thank you very much.

130
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,562
But didn't you do so, as well?

131
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:15,262
No. My talent developed later on!

132
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,862
I was first crowned a champion in university.

133
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:21,462
Given the comparatively high injury rate,

134
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:24,162
my peak lasted only two, three years.

135
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:27,062
And after retiring, I got married.

136
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:30,862
I still haven't been able to achieve my dream of earning the gold medal

137
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:33,062
in front of the superior I admired so much.

138
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,262
The superior you admired?

139
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:39,462
He's currently the coach for the all Japan team, Hajime Kajimoto.

140
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:43,262
At one time, he was an unrivalled gold medalist in the 81kg class.

141
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:49,262
I took up judo after seeing him on TV.

142
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,562
It's the same as me, then.

143
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:56,562
I admire the karate champion of Japan.

144
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:59,562
But admiration is admiration.

145
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:02,362
It's the same as viewing flower from afar.

146
00:09:02,362 --> 00:09:04,262
When you get too close,

147
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:06,262
it becomes like Icarus who lost his wings

148
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:09,062
and plunged to the earth after flying too close to the sun.

149
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,662
Disaster befalls oneself.

150
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:16,362
I'm sorry to drop that remark.

151
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:17,562
No.

152
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:21,362
-But I'm glad I brought Ran with me. -What?

153
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:25,362
I called you to my office so that you could see her.

154
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:27,962
Since you both practice martial arts,

155
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:31,462
I figured you'd both have something in common.

156
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:35,262
I didn't think we'd be having dinner together though.

157
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:37,962
Then, why didn't you call Dad as well?

158
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:40,262
Dad actually practiced judo!

159
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,662
Now that you mentioned it, I suppose he did.

160
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:45,262
The truth is, I was worried.

161
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:46,262
What?

162
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:48,562
I wasn't sure whether or not he was on a case,

163
00:09:48,562 --> 00:09:52,462
so I decided against using the hand of such a renowned detective.

164
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:55,262
Is that so?

165
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,262
If that's the case, you should have mentioned it from the start!

166
00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:00,662
Well, didn't I mention it?

167
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:02,262
-Say? -Yes, what?

168
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:05,062
Isn't it about time to go?

169
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,562
You said it would take ten minutes

170
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:09,562
to get to your house by car, right?

171
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:10,862
That's true.

172
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,062
But before we go, I need to go to the bathroom.

173
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:21,162
Wasn't it delicious, that blend of western and Japanese style food?

174
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,862
Yes, absolutely.

175
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,762
Do you come here often?

176
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:27,562
Yeah, I make sure I come once a week!

177
00:10:27,562 --> 00:10:29,262
With your husband, right?

178
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,562
Nope, I come alone without telling him.

179
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,962
My husband has zero tolerance for new food.

180
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,062
Oh, yeah?

181
00:10:37,062 --> 00:10:40,262
Let's see, where did I park?

182
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:45,662
Isn't it that white car?

183
00:10:45,662 --> 00:10:47,462
When I saw you with your husband before,

184
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:50,562
that's the car you were driving, right?

185
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,562
Yep, yep! That's it!

186
00:10:55,162 --> 00:10:57,562
Then, I'll give Ran and the boy a ride as well.

187
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:01,162
We'll pass right by the detective agency on the way home.

188
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,162
Thank you very much.

189
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:08,762
You know how to adjust the seat, don't you?

190
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:10,262
There's a lever on the right side of the seat.

191
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:11,762
And if you pull it...

192
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:15,462
See, like this, the seat will move.

193
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:18,962
No need to worry, my car has the same thing.

194
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:24,462
Well, sonny,

195
00:11:24,462 --> 00:11:27,262
we'll get there right away so stay put, okay?

196
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:40,962
Huh? The parking ticket...

197
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:43,062
Where did I put it?

198
00:11:43,062 --> 00:11:47,062
I'm afraid you'll have to pay the daily maximum of 3,000 yen.

199
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,862
Guess it can't be helped.

200
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:51,362
If you don't mind, I'll gladly pay half.

201
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:54,362
It's fine, because it's my fault.

202
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:02,062
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,262
The children are truly being an inconvenience.

204
00:12:04,262 --> 00:12:05,862
Not at all.

205
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:09,562
It's because you insisted on having it your way, Conan.

206
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,562
Because, if she's the former All-Japan champion,

207
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:15,362
she must have a lot of trophies and plaques, right?

208
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:18,062
Don't you wanna see them too, Ran?

209
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:20,562
Well, I suppose so, but...

210
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:22,962
I'm home!

211
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:25,362
Oh, my husband's shoes!

212
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,862
It's just 9:30.

213
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:32,562
I guess he really punctual.

214
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:35,262
Well, I'll go get my husband.

215
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,762
You can wait in our living room here.

216
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:40,962
Dear! Lawyer Kisaki is here!

217
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,662
No matter how you look at it, this is something.

218
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:46,862
Look at the number of these trophies and plaques!

219
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,262
Yeah, I know!

220
00:12:48,262 --> 00:12:50,962
When she was in her prime, she never lost.

221
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,562
She was even said to be invincible!

222
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:55,862
Say, this picture...

223
00:12:55,862 --> 00:13:00,062
See the tall man standing to the far right?

224
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:04,262
I think that's the gold medalist that she mentioned earlier.

225
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,962
Right, right. That's Hajime Kajimoto of the 81kg class.

226
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:10,162
Oh, and the other one, standing to her left.

227
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:14,762
That's Yuko's husband, Shiro Arisawa.

228
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,062
Then, the boy making the peace sign, is Arisawa's son?

229
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:25,862
No, that's Kajimoto's son, Kouta!

230
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:30,062
He would come along to the judo dojo where I worked as a coach.

231
00:13:30,062 --> 00:13:33,462
He is really cute.

232
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,762
And, your husband?

233
00:13:35,762 --> 00:13:38,562
The thing is, I can't find him anywhere.

234
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:40,862
He's not in the bath or bathroom either.

235
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:45,162
He might have gone out for cigarettes after getting home.

236
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:47,562
I'll try to get him on his cell.

237
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:54,762
A ringtone...

238
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:56,362
You hear it, too?

239
00:13:57,762 --> 00:13:59,062
Don't cut the phone!

240
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:00,662
Conan!

241
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:06,162
Could it be inside this closet?

242
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:17,262
Dear!

243
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:33,355
The victim is Shiro Arisawa, age 37.

244
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:37,155
He was a businessman that worked for Haido Co.

245
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,755
This is his residence.

246
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:43,055
And Yuko Arisawa.

247
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:46,755
Are you sure he is your husband?

248
00:14:46,755 --> 00:14:47,755
Yes, very sure.

249
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:52,055
It appears that some sort of rope was used to strangle him to death.

250
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:55,455
Absolutely. We haven't found the weapon yet.

251
00:14:55,455 --> 00:14:58,555
It was likely something along the line of a thin cloth.

252
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,255
Like a tie, right?

253
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:01,355
-What? -What?

254
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:03,455
Because before, on the phone...

255
00:15:03,455 --> 00:15:05,855
He said, "I'm at a wake",

256
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,655
so shouldn't he have a tie?

257
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:10,455
Usually, when men go to a wake,

258
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:12,555
don't they wear suits with a black tie?

259
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:14,755
That's true.

260
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:16,855
This raises the possibility of the culprit

261
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:19,555
taking the victim's tie and using it as a weapon.

262
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:22,355
And, do you know whose wake it was?

263
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,755
Well, all my husband said on the phone

264
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:28,155
was that someone he knew passed away suddenly.

265
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:32,955
And I think I heard chanting in the background.

266
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:36,955
What? Ran, you spoke with the victim on the phone as well?

267
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:40,755
No. While I was speaking with my husband on the phone,

268
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:44,255
my fingers slipped and hit the speaker button.

269
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:46,655
That's why we heard it as well.

270
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:52,055
But why were you and the children with her

271
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,055
while she was speaking to the victim?

272
00:15:54,055 --> 00:15:56,055
Actually...

273
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,255
The victim was her husband, Shiro, who had consulted with me

274
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:04,655
on settling a traffic accident in the past.

275
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:09,855
Ever since the accident, he had been plagued by a stalker,

276
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,955
which led her to consulting with me again.

277
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:13,455
Her husband had been saying that

278
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:16,755
he felt as if "someone was always watching him".

279
00:16:16,755 --> 00:16:18,455
But personally,

280
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:21,155
I never felt there was any indication of anything like that

281
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:24,855
so I had our old lawyer, Ms. Kisaki visit our us.

282
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:28,755
Since my husband has such great faith in Ms. Kisaki,

283
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,355
I thought that, if she could prove

284
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:35,255
there weren't any wire taps or cameras anywhere,

285
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:40,255
it might put his mind at rest.

286
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:44,755
Also, prior to leaving Ms. Kisaki's office by car,

287
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,155
as this boy said earlier,

288
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:50,855
my husband told me that he was at a wake.

289
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,255
And her husband told her over the phone

290
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:56,255
at time that he would be back around 9:30.

291
00:16:56,255 --> 00:16:59,255
Until then, we were at a nearby restaurant,

292
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,455
with the children and ate there.

293
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,555
Then we came here in her car afterwards.

294
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,455
Do you know what time it was?

295
00:17:06,455 --> 00:17:08,655
Let's see, it was...

296
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:13,355
She called her husband at around 7:30 in the evening,

297
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:15,855
and we went to the hotel immediately.

298
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:20,655
So, by the time we finished our meal and left, it was around 9:00.

299
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:23,755
When we got here, it was almost exactly 9:30.

300
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:29,755
And then, somehow, you came across the body in the closet?

301
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:33,055
Yeah, since I couldn't find him,

302
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:35,555
I called his cell phone and...

303
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:42,455
We heard ring tone from the closet.

304
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:43,855
Which amounts to...

305
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,755
Your husband claimed he wouldn't be home until 9:30,

306
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:50,455
but actually arrived thirty minutes early.

307
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:53,855
His estimated time of death is around 9:00 tonight.

308
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,655
So, at that time, he must have already been home.

309
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:04,055
That means, there's a chance that the stalker is still somewhere nearby.

310
00:18:04,055 --> 00:18:07,855
The culprit had been lying in wait,

311
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:11,755
for her husband to return.

312
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,155
About your husband's stalker...

313
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:17,055
Did you have nothing of the situation?

314
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,255
No, at all.

315
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:23,255
Not being a fan of hers, it's unlikely that you'll understand.

316
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:24,555
What?

317
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:26,955
A fan of hers?

318
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:29,855
Oh, don't you recognize her?

319
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:34,655
She is the former All-Japan champion of judo in the 70kg class.

320
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,355
This is Yuko Arisawa.

321
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:39,455
It really is her!

322
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:42,255
I thought I'd seen her face somewhere!

323
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,355
Thanks.

324
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:48,555
But it's strange for a guy to be so worried about a stalker

325
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:50,355
when he has such an able-bodied bodyguard like her.

326
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:52,255
That's true.

327
00:18:52,255 --> 00:18:53,755
After thinking about it,

328
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,255
it could be the victim from that traffic accident.

329
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,355
I'm not so sure that's the case.

330
00:18:58,355 --> 00:19:02,455
They might have just been after the money.

331
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:03,755
Conan!

332
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,455
Cause look down here!

333
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:08,055
At this person's left ring finger!

334
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,655
It looks like one was there before.

335
00:19:10,655 --> 00:19:12,355
But now there's no ring!

336
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:13,555
It's true.

337
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:17,155
Isn't the left finger for wedding bands?

338
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:19,755
Did your husband always wear his wedding ring?

339
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:21,255
Yeah.

340
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:24,355
But that's weird!

341
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,255
Even though the ring is gone,

342
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:29,455
this fancy-looking watch is still here!

343
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:32,255
Why is it?

344
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:36,255
I'm so sorry. I should be keeping a better eye on him.

345
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:39,555
Since it's still here, their motive wasn't money after all, huh?

346
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,255
Guess not.

347
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:42,555
At any rate,

348
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,355
for time being, we'll concentrate on inspecting the house.

349
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:48,955
While we do, will all of you please wait in another room.

350
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:56,455
To think all of this started while looking into a stalker...

351
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:58,455
I feel sorry for Yuko.

352
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:00,555
Yes, I guess so.

353
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:04,855
I don't want to conclude that she planned the murder already.

354
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,155
What?

355
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:13,255
Are you trying to say Yuko is the culprit?

356
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:16,355
Yeah, it's certainly a possibility, isn't it?

357
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:20,255
But her husband was killed around 9:00 tonight.

358
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:23,555
That's the same time we left the hotel restaurant.

359
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,755
Wasn't Yuko with us the entire time?

360
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:30,555
But she excused herself to the bathroom once, didn't she?

361
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:32,555
Just before we left the restaurant.

362
00:20:32,555 --> 00:20:35,455
But it was only for around ten minutes.

363
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,455
Her husband was at a wake then.

364
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:40,155
Are you saying that she would tell him to come to the hotel

365
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,755
despite knowing what she did?

366
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:43,755
No, that's not it.

367
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:48,855
When Officer Takagi checked the call history on her phone,

368
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:54,855
it said that last call she made was at 7:30, which was from my office.

369
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:59,155
Then, how could Yuko be the culprit?

370
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:03,055
The call from my office could have been fabricated.

371
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,255
What?

372
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:09,855
By then, shouldn't he have already been home, normally?

373
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:13,755
But this time, when she called her husband,

374
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,455
she went for his cell instead of the home phone.

375
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:19,255
Isn't that suspicious?

376
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:22,755
What's more, I think she purposely put it on speaker,

377
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:25,655
just so we could hear the conversation.

378
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,955
What? A wake?

379
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,255
Yeah. Someone I know suddenly passed away.

380
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,355
You're thinking about it too much.

381
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:39,555
Because after that, didn't she let you speak to him?

382
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:42,655
The voice on the phone was that of her husband, right?

383
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:46,955
Yeah. I doubt there was a trick involved there.

384
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:48,955
That's true.

385
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:52,155
If his voice had been recorded beforehand

386
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,855
and it was just played back over the phone,

387
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,755
she could easily fake a conversation that way.

388
00:21:58,755 --> 00:22:01,355
But it would've been 100% impossible

389
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:03,855
to hold a conversation with Ms. Kisaki after that.

390
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,555
Someone could have imitated his voice over the phone.

391
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:12,755
After meeting with her so many times during the settlement proceedings,

392
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:15,055
she would be hard to fool.

393
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:18,855
If she really did call her husband then...

394
00:22:20,055 --> 00:22:22,555
I'm at a wake.

395
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:25,255
You can hear the chanting, can't you?

396
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:28,955
Without knowing where the wake was being held...

397
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:32,455
Could Arisawa really have planned to murder him?

398
00:23:57,555 --> 00:24:00,755
"Next Episode" -Say! Should I give Dad a call?

399
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:03,755
I'd rather sell my soul to the devil.

400
00:24:03,755 --> 00:24:05,955
A devil, huh?

401
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:08,455
-Ron! -Ron?

402
00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:13,055
Sorry! I'm at the table practicing with some of the neighbors.

403
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,555
Yes. I want the culprit

404
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,255
the one who strangled Shiro, your husband to death

405
00:24:19,255 --> 00:24:20,755
to turn himself into the police!

406
00:24:21,955 --> 00:24:27,555
Next Conan, "Might Over Mystery (Part 2)"

407
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:40,455
Next Conan's Hint:

408
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:42,555
"The sound of Mahjong"

409
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:44,455
In the next episode, Dad is really on his toes!

410
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:46,755
No way! Seriously?

411
00:24:46,755 --> 00:24:47,861
Ron!
