1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:04,170
As times change, difficult
cases will increase in number!

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,010
Shinichi's rival suddenly appears!

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,140
Can I fight him as Conan?!

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,840
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,350
and looks like a kid but
has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,430
His name? Detective Conan!

7
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:34,055
The Diplomat Murder Case (Part 1).

8
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:44,355
Sheesh! You finally call me
for once but you have a cold!

9
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,895
Just get back here already, Shinichi!

10
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,055
I can't help it;

11
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:52,355
I'm in the middle of a dangerous case.

12
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,855
Oh, a client.

13
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:57,975
It looks like a client is here,
so I'll talk to you later!

14
00:01:57,975 --> 00:01:59,825
And get over your stupid cold!

15
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,475
Hey, Ran!

16
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:07,725
Ugh! She worries when I don't call,

17
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:10,145
and yells at me when I do call!

18
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:12,425
All she ever does is complain!

19
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,885
I just don't get girls!

20
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:24,795
No point in lying, Missy.
I know he's here!

21
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:27,715
So bring out Kudo Shinichi!

22
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,345
Eh? Me?

23
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,675
C'mon, already!

24
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:32,395
Conan-kun!

25
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,765
You have a cold, too?!

26
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:35,415
Yeah...

27
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,595
Here, stay still.

28
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:42,425
Honestly, both you and Shinichi...

29
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:44,485
Is there a cold going around?

30
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:46,255
Kudo has a cold?

31
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:50,475
How do you know that
if you dunno where he is?

32
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:54,925
The phone.

33
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:57,915
Shinichi called just
now with a nasally voice.

34
00:02:58,345 --> 00:02:59,755
Kudo called here?

35
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,925
He does call once in a while.

36
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:02,875
There a problem with that?

37
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:07,755
So I guess the rumor you're
Kudo's woman really is true...

38
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,305
Woman?!

39
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,175
Eh?!

40
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:12,255
Who said that?!
Who said that?!

41
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:15,465
Some friend of yours named Suzuki.

42
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:17,255
Says Kudo doesn't go to school,

43
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:20,505
and that you're probably involved!

44
00:03:20,505 --> 00:03:21,815
Sonoko...

45
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,105
Darn her...

46
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:26,385
So, what did you and Kudo talk about?

47
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:27,925
Nothing.

48
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:32,135
He told me about good
mystery novels he read recently,

49
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:36,745
the J-League, and asked
how people at school are.

50
00:03:37,215 --> 00:03:38,545
Did he ask about you?

51
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,635
Eh? Me?

52
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,425
Come to think of it,

53
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:47,545
he always talks about
himself and never about me.

54
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,055
W-What's going on?

55
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:54,255
Hey, now! What're you doing?!

56
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:55,805
Doesn't it seem strange?

57
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:57,055
Eh?

58
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:04,095
His occasional calls mean
he has some interest in you.

59
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:08,655
Wouldn't someone like that
care how the other person is doing?

60
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:11,615
There's only one reason why
he wouldn't ask that.

61
00:04:12,055 --> 00:04:16,215
Kudo is watching you from somewhere!

62
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,075
Eh?!

63
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:18,705
Probably from nearby, too.

64
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:22,915
Shinichi... is watching me?

65
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:26,255
I'm sure he's spying from somewhere!

66
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:27,885
Talk about creepy!

67
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,345
Who is this guy?!

68
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,465
By the way, who are you?

69
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:36,475
Oh, right. I forgot.

70
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:39,095
My name is Hattori Heiji.

71
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,895
A high school detective,
just like Kudo.

72
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,565
High school...

73
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:45,105
...detective?!

74
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:48,405
Oh, he's just a detective.

75
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:54,785
Hey, kid. I got just
the thing for your cold!

76
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:57,925
Come to think of it,

77
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:01,425
I have heard of a
skilled detective in Kansai...

78
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:09,135
Yep. They call us "Hattori of the West"
and "Kudo of the East."

79
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:10,365
Here ya go!

80
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:11,615
Oh, thanks...

81
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:16,675
But there's been no
word about Kudo lately.

82
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:19,925
He's never in the papers anymore,

83
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:22,395
and rumors say he's missing...

84
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,885
But now the east has Mori Kogoro--

85
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:28,235
So what do you want with Shinichi?!

86
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:32,325
Nothing. I just wanna see for myself.

87
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,035
The east has me, Mori!

88
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:37,425
I wanna see if Kudo Shinichi's

89
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:40,995
really worthy of being compared to me.

90
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:43,035
Huh?

91
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:46,875
Conan-kun! What's wrong?!

92
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:51,555
Ran-neechan...

93
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:54,845
Conan-kun! Hey!
What did you give him!

94
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,505
Chinese alcohol known as baigar.

95
00:05:57,505 --> 00:06:00,255
I'll be staying here until I meet Kudo.

96
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:02,305
So this is a gift!

97
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,265
How can you just do that?!

98
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,195
Do you know how long I rang the bell?!

99
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:12,695
I see this agency isn't
equipped to greet clients, either!

100
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:18,215
I'm in a hurry,
so could we make this quick?

101
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:21,505
A background check
on your son's girlfriend?

102
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:24,875
That is a photo of her, and her history.

103
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:28,805
Katsuragi Yukiko-san, age 24.

104
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:33,675
Graduated Mitsuba Middle School
and High School top of her class,

105
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,425
currently attends
Toto Medical University.

106
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:38,505
Well on her way to
becoming a woman doctor.

107
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:40,555
Something wrong with all this?

108
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,645
No. It's just...

109
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:45,105
Too perfect, so you don't like her.

110
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:49,215
People are inquisitive,
jealous creatures...

111
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,755
When they see something perfect,

112
00:06:50,755 --> 00:06:52,775
they naturally look for flaws.

113
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,925
Right, lady?

114
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:57,675
Who is he?!

115
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:00,885
Oh, just a friend of my daughter's...

116
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:06,205
In any case, we can talk in more
detail at my home, with my husband.

117
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:09,665
Umm... Right now?

118
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,345
Couldn't you have both come here?

119
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:16,635
As I told you,
my husband is a diplomat.

120
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:19,095
If people found out he came here...

121
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:21,255
...it'd turn into scandal.

122
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:23,435
Alright! I'm coming too!

123
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:24,805
What?!

124
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:31,235
It'd be less suspicious
if we went as a family, right?

125
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,215
Yes. That would be best.

126
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,235
Eh?! M-Madam!

127
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:38,405
Why don't you come, too?

128
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:40,215
Why me?

129
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,365
The more the merrier, y'know?

130
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:47,075
Besides, who knows,
maybe Kudo'll show up!

131
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:52,045
Ran-neechan. Ran-neechan!

132
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:54,345
Let's go with them!

133
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:56,215
But are you okay with your cold?

134
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:59,885
Yeah! His medicine got rid of it!

135
00:08:00,215 --> 00:08:01,505
Told ya!

136
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:05,095
Yeah, right! It made it even worse!

137
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:06,755
I don't wanna go,

138
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:09,895
but there's no telling
what this guy might say!

139
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:12,925
Welcome back, Madam.

140
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:13,815
Where is my husband?

141
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:15,145
I do believe he's still in his study.

142
00:08:15,145 --> 00:08:17,775
Koike Fumio (48)-- Butler
I do believe he's still in his study.

143
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:20,255
Who are these folks?

144
00:08:20,255 --> 00:08:22,925
This is Mori-san, an old friend.

145
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:25,495
Mother! Hello there!

146
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:27,555
Oh! You're from the photo--

147
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:29,415
W-Why are you here?!

148
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,425
I asked her here.

149
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:36,345
Dad won't see her,
so I'm forcing him to.

150
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:39,725
He still won't come out
of his study, though.

151
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:43,425
Umm, might these people be
acquaintances of yours, Mother?

152
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:45,805
That is none of your business!

153
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:51,895
And you have no
right to call me "Mother"!

154
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,815
I-I'm sorry...

155
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,655
This way.

156
00:08:57,845 --> 00:09:00,275
Sure acts big for a second wife...

157
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:03,175
Oh, Father.

158
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,445
I didn't know you were home.

159
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:10,415
Come, now! You said you wanted
to hear about the fish I caught!

160
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:12,805
What do you think?

161
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:14,375
A real whopper, wouldn't you say?

162
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:18,425
Oh, right. I'll be there soon.

163
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,055
Please wait in the
Japanese-style room.

164
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:21,005
Yeah.

165
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:30,305
Dear! He's here! Dear!

166
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:33,355
That's odd. Is he not in there?

167
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:39,565
Oh, you are in here!

168
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:44,535
Honestly, now! Leaving the stereo
on and taking a nap in here!

169
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:47,135
An opera?

170
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:50,535
Dear! Hey! Please wake up! Dear!

171
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,615
Dear--

172
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:01,425
Dear! Say something! Dear!

173
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:04,345
Too late. He's already dead!

174
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:07,215
Ran! Call the police!

175
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:07,925
Right!

176
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,345
Dear!

177
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:13,185
His body is still warm.

178
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:17,755
And his lips are
starting to turn purple.

179
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:20,655
There's a small
red dot by his hairline...

180
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,345
Could it be?!

181
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:29,495
Oww!
Oww!

182
00:10:30,135 --> 00:10:32,615
Stupid kid! Getting in the way!

183
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:33,595
Conan-kun!

184
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:36,205
Isn't it your job to watch him?!

185
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:39,165
Kids shouldn't be
seeing dead bodies, anyway!

186
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:40,305
Yeah...

187
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:48,305
The deceased is Tsujimura Isao-san,
age 54 and a diplomat.

188
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:53,765
And the detective who happened
to be here when the body was found...

189
00:10:53,765 --> 00:10:57,255
Was I, Mori Kogoro, Inspector Megure!

190
00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:01,135
So, is it another
murder today, great detective?

191
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:04,595
Well, as there are no
signs of foul play, it's probably--

192
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:07,195
Look closer at the body!

193
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:08,945
He was probably...

194
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:09,815
...poisoned.

195
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:11,655
Yeah. He was pois--

196
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,055
Someone killed this old man with poison.

197
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:19,425
There's a red dot by his hairline,

198
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:22,335
and a needle's
lying next to the body.

199
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:25,715
The old man died propped up,

200
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:29,805
but he was probably set that
way after someone poisoned him.

201
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:32,425
But it could've been suicide...

202
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,015
What? You don't get it?
Check out the body.

203
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:40,425
The lips and digits
are turning purple,

204
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:42,445
and his eyes have excess blood.

205
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:44,885
This is proof he suffocated.

206
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:50,405
Yet, there are no signs at all of
strangulation, drowning, or suffering.

207
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:52,595
The only possibility left is that

208
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:56,715
he was paralyzed and then suffocated

209
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,375
with powerful poison
that can kill instantly!

210
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:06,505
Add in the body's warmth
and the lack of rigor mortis

211
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:10,595
and that means he
was killed half an hour

212
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,725
before we entered the room!

213
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:16,435
And by someone
who stopped by this room...

214
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,885
Mori-kun. Who is this lad?

215
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:23,505
Hattori Heiji.
A cheeky kid detective.

216
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,485
Hattori... Heiji?

217
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:30,595
Oh, you're the son of Hattori Heizo-san,

218
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:33,555
Osaka's chief of police!

219
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:35,785
Osaka's chief of police?

220
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:42,925
It's strange, Hattori-kun
somehow reminds me of Shinichi...

221
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:48,255
Are you all right, Conan-kun?!

222
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,555
This is bad!
My cold's gotten worse!

223
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:56,845
All the windows are
locked from the inside.

224
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,015
Entering from outside is impossible.

225
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:08,755
Which means one of you entered
through the door with a spare key.

226
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:12,595
Madam. I assume there are
several spare keys to this study?

227
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:15,255
No, only two.

228
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:19,305
I have one here.
My husband has the other.

229
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:20,955
Y-Your husband?!

230
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:25,055
Yes. He always kept it
in his pants pocket.

231
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,665
Let's have a look.

232
00:13:29,095 --> 00:13:31,045
Damn, his pants are tight.

233
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:40,395
I-Impossible!

234
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:41,965
Eh? What is?

235
00:13:41,965 --> 00:13:43,755
Don't you get it?!

236
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:47,425
The door was locked when we arrived!

237
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:51,365
In other words,
the killer locked the door and left!

238
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:55,095
One of the keys is with his wife,
who entered the room with us,

239
00:13:55,095 --> 00:14:00,325
and the other was in a double
pocket of the victim's pants...

240
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,665
Making this an
absolutely impossible crime...

241
00:14:03,305 --> 00:14:05,375
...a locked room murder!

242
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,255
A locked room murder?!

243
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:10,215
That can't be...

244
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:12,845
Just as I thought.

245
00:14:12,845 --> 00:14:16,885
This guy's been in the papers,
but he didn't solve those cases.

246
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:20,185
Kudo Shinichi did!

247
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:25,605
This guy secretly
contacts Kudo for help.

248
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:28,175
Probably will this time, too.

249
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:29,135
Alright!

250
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:34,035
Let's see who solves this locked
room murder first, Kudo Shinichi!

251
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,385
I don't feel good...

252
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:39,075
Even my ears are ringing now...

253
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:42,095
Looks like I better solve this case

254
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:44,255
so I can go home and get some rest...

255
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:46,245
What're you doing?

256
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:49,675
The murder took place
between 3:30 and 4:00.

257
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:54,095
Shouldn't you start by asking
all the suspects for their alibis?!

258
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:56,425
T-That's right!

259
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,275
Hey! Don't let him beat you!

260
00:14:58,275 --> 00:14:58,965
Huh?!

261
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,425
Do you want some outsider
kid to upstage you?!

262
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:05,715
I'm counting on you
as always, great detective!

263
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,305
Y-Yeah...

264
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:16,175
So you spoke with neighbors at
the front door between 3:00 and 4:00?

265
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:16,905
Yes.

266
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:20,095
Is it true Takayoshi-san
and Yukiko-san

267
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:23,075
arrived just before his wife?

268
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,285
Yes. That is correct.

269
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:31,095
So where were you two while
he was greeting her at the door?

270
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:32,925
My dad's study.

271
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:35,755
But the door was locked
and he wouldn't respond,

272
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:37,595
so we went back downstairs.

273
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:41,015
Then we saw Mother at the front door...

274
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:44,975
It was shortly after
2:00 when you arrived, yes?

275
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:46,595
That's right.

276
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:49,925
I came all this way,
but Isao was holed up in here,

277
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,755
and Kimie-san had left...

278
00:15:51,755 --> 00:15:53,255
With nothing else to do,

279
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,905
I went to the next room
and watched TV.

280
00:15:56,215 --> 00:15:58,365
What time did you leave?

281
00:15:58,365 --> 00:15:59,905
An hour ago.

282
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:05,595
Which means that only those
three could've gotten near the victim

283
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,835
at the time of the murder.

284
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:11,255
Oh! What an impressive number of CDs!

285
00:16:11,255 --> 00:16:14,755
Yes. He loved classical music.

286
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:20,595
Classical? Oh yeah, there was
an opera playing when we found him...

287
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,515
Oh? Madam.
What is this photograph?

288
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,725
Huh?! Oh no!

289
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:31,595
This photo is twenty years old!
What does it matter?!

290
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,555
M-My eyesight is blurring!

291
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:36,305
Inspector! What shall we
do with the books on the desk?

292
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,445
Oh. Just leave 'em.

293
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,055
Books?

294
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:43,155
Come to think of it, there were
irrelevant books stacked by the body.

295
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:46,615
Almost as if pulled
straight out of the bookshelf...

296
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:50,385
Inspector. We found something
odd about the victim's key.

297
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,375
What?!

298
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,365
The key holder opens up to reveal...

299
00:16:54,365 --> 00:16:55,545
...Scotch tape!

300
00:16:56,885 --> 00:17:00,675
What's that thin bulge in the middle?

301
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,885
L-Let me see, too...

302
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,755
Conan-kun?

303
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,095
Now it's my chest!

304
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,185
I gotta solve this case, quick!

305
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:15,595
Got any realizations for me,
great detective?

306
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:17,385
Nope, nothing.

307
00:17:17,385 --> 00:17:19,405
Wait! Could it be?!

308
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,675
The unnaturally-stacked
books in front of the body,

309
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:27,785
and the opera playing
at the scene of the crime!

310
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,875
The tape on the key!

311
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,835
The mysterious bulge
in the middle of it!

312
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:36,125
And the slit beneath this door!

313
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:37,665
The opera!

314
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,425
That's it!

315
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,385
I figured out the locked room trick!

316
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:44,655
And...

317
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,975
...who... did it...

318
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,215
Conan-kun!

319
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:55,525
Conan-kun! What's wrong?!

320
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,221
Hey! Call a doctor!

321
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,671
Yes, sir!

322
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:06,631
You're really burning up!

323
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:09,401
Huh? Hattori-kun's gone...

324
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:13,011
He asked where the
Japanese-style room was, then left.

325
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,351
Japanese-style room?

326
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:20,401
It has to be here!
If my theory's right...

327
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:24,821
it has to be here somewhere!

328
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:32,031
Bingo! This is it!

329
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:36,461
I win, Kudo!

330
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:41,691
I'm sorry, but is there
anywhere he can lie down?

331
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,401
You can use the bed in my room.

332
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:46,151
It's at the end of the hallway.

333
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:50,231
Thank you! I appreciate it!

334
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,611
Hattori-kun...

335
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:52,761
I figured it out.

336
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:57,351
The locked room trick,
and who did it.

337
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:58,641
What?!

338
00:18:58,641 --> 00:18:59,601
Eh?!

339
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:01,151
You solved it already?

340
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:03,361
That's what you get for being slow!

341
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:06,031
I'll show you the proof right now.

342
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,161
Fishing line?

343
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,901
Inspector Megure.

344
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,361
Hate to ask, but could
you play the role of the body?

345
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:17,191
O-Okay...

346
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:20,731
D-Don't tell me he's...

347
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,731
At the time of the murder,

348
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:27,031
all the windows were
locked from the inside,

349
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:30,731
and the only other entrance
was locked as well.

350
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:35,431
That clearly makes this
a locked room murder.

351
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:41,101
But even when this room seems locked,
there's still one opening.

352
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,441
Opening?

353
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:47,071
Yes. The opening beneath the door!

354
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,691
Hey, now. You're not suggesting
the key was thrown through that gap

355
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,741
and into the victim's pocket, are you?

356
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:58,731
It can be done!

357
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:05,531
With tape and this needle-ended
fishing line I found!

358
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:06,591
Fishing line?

359
00:20:08,361 --> 00:20:10,551
Don't worry, Conan-kun!

360
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:13,091
A doctor will be here soon!

361
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:16,731
Damn! This isn't funny!

362
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,821
Fainting from a
cold at a time like this!

363
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:24,151
Conan-kun!

364
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:30,571
After pricking the victim's
neck with the needle and killing him,

365
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,531
the killer stole the victim's key.

366
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:37,281
The killer then took out
the needle-ended fishing line,

367
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:41,791
taped the non-needle
end to the key holder,

368
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,731
stuck the needle
end into the victim's pocket,

369
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,751
pulled the line through,

370
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:49,901
and then sat him in the chair

371
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:53,971
and put him in the pose we found him in.

372
00:20:53,971 --> 00:21:00,651
The killer then took both ends
outside the room, beneath the door,

373
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:04,351
and then closed and locked the door.

374
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:08,981
All that remained was to put the
key down and pull the needle end.

375
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:13,031
The key slipped under
the door, climbed up the table,

376
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:17,571
and entered the
victim's pocket on its own.

377
00:21:18,031 --> 00:21:19,691
I-It went in!

378
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:22,731
Then, with one last tug...

379
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,001
the line pulled through the tape.

380
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:28,751
Then, by simply winding it up,
the evidence disappeared

381
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:32,461
and created the perfect
"locked room murder"!

382
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,881
I-Indeed...

383
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:38,231
Say something,
Conan-kun! Conan-kun!

384
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:41,391
I'm burning up...
My heart's about to burst...

385
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,351
That must be the doctor!

386
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,651
Hang in there!
I'll bring him right here!

387
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:53,571
A-Am I gonna die...

388
00:21:53,571 --> 00:21:57,861
Am I gonna die like this?!

389
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:03,691
Well, Kudo?

390
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:06,651
If you got any problems
with my theory, show yourself!

391
00:22:06,651 --> 00:22:10,241
Better hurry before I solve it all!

392
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:46,851
Nope, I'm afraid not.

393
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:52,021
You got it all wrong!

394
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,191
Kudo!

395
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:55,321
Shinichi!

396
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,151
Just what's wrong
with my theory, Kudo?!

397
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:03,571
That... can't be!

398
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:07,911
Yes. The killer... is you!

399
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,941
On the next Conan--

400
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:13,041
"The Diplomat Murder Case (Part 2)."
