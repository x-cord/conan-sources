00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,730
"Takeuchi Construction Company's Bribery Case"

2
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:52,928
What?

3
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:56,132
Attorney at law Kisaki is here.

4
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:57,399
Please let her through.

5
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:01,904
-This way. -Thank you.

6
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:03,806
Ms. Kujo.

7
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,107
May we go out somewhere?

8
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,210
Yes, sure.

9
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,615
Thank you for the other day.

10
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:15,217
Did you get information about Mr. Takeuchi?

11
00:01:15,217 --> 00:01:16,619
Yes.

12
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,122
I heard charges have been dropped due to the death of the suspect.

13
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:24,126
I'm sorry for all the inconvenience I caused you, Ms. Kisaki.

14
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,230
By the way,

15
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,500
I heard you submitted an informal resignation,

16
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,102
but is it true?

17
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,608
Don't tell me that you're planning on quitting your job as prosecutor.

18
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,111
I pressured the suspect who turned himself in,

19
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:45,014
to the point of committing suicide

20
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:47,716
that I'm ready for whatever may happen to my job.

21
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:50,219
What are you going to do about the hit-and-run incident?

22
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,720
Another prosecutor

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,925
is preparing to set up evidence that his wife committed the crime.

24
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,928
You mean that's okay with you?

25
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:00,029
If under the law,

26
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,932
the truth is brought into the light,

27
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:06,602
my individual position is of no concern!

28
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:09,505
Even if that means letting the killer go free?

29
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,506
Huh?

30
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:18,914
-Killer? -Yes.

31
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:21,116
There is suspicion that maybe Mr. Takeuchi was murdered

32
00:02:21,116 --> 00:02:23,619
under the pretense of having committed suicide.

33
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,521
That... that can't be

34
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,723
because I saw him with my own eyes.

35
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:30,726
What did you see with your own eyes?

36
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,199
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

37
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,008
What was his wife doing at that time?

38
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,313
I don't know.

39
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:54,617
I was so absorbed in stopping Mr. Takeuchi back then,

40
00:02:54,617 --> 00:02:57,019
that my attention was not on her at all.

41
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,120
Don't tell me that...

42
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:03,125
His wife had a motive of wanting to kill her husband.

43
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,228
You mean it was all planned out?

44
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,131
Setting an incumbent prosecutor up as eye-witness,

45
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,532
would ensure that investigation will follow through

46
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,902
with just a matter of procedure.

47
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:14,303
They would never perform an investigation

48
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:18,307
that would go right against the testimony of a prosecutor.

49
00:03:18,307 --> 00:03:19,608
That's true.

50
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,310
Oh, my goodness.

51
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,113
That possibility didn't even cross my mind.

52
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:25,514
So, what are you going to do?

53
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:27,016
If you quit now,

54
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,918
it'll be exactly what the culprit wants you to do.

55
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,519
Are you sure you want it that way?

56
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,721
Ms. Kisaki, I'm sorry,

57
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,423
but if you'll excuse me, I must go!

58
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,625
I have to get back to work.

59
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,830
Hello, Mr. Sasaki,

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,132
will you please get together

61
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,200
the investigation reports of Mr. Takeuchi's case right away?

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,103
Yes. And, please contact the local police

63
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,805
and make an appointment with the police detective in charge too.

64
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:54,009
The defendant, Mariko Takeuchi,

65
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,211
on the same day late at night at around 23:00,

66
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:58,414
drove her own car,

67
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:01,317
and when she got to the Toriyacho intersection,

68
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:04,320
collided into the bicycle

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,524
driven by victim, Yasuyuki Matsukawa, who was crossing the street,

70
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:11,427
then hit-and-ran.

71
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:13,228
She then tells her husband,

72
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:17,032
Hiroaki Takeuchi to turn himself in to the police, in her place,

73
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:19,301
and attempts to free herself from the crime she committed.

74
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,903
After her husband commits suicide,

75
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:24,006
next they bring charges against her.

76
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:26,408
Maybe Madonna's upset at the mass media getting down on her,

77
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:29,011
that she's just trying to push her way through?

78
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:33,415
Hey, Conan. Wasn't the one who hit-and-ran, his wife?

79
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:36,018
Then, why is mom acting as her attorney?

80
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:39,121
I'm sure she has something in mind.

81
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:44,226
I wonder what she has in mind.

82
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,601
Is the defendant admitting the charges?

83
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,103
I am innocent!

84
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,705
She had the nerve to pressure my husband into committing suicide,

85
00:04:56,705 --> 00:05:00,009
-and now, she dares brings charges against me too. -Order!

86
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,210
If you have any counterargument,

87
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,513
you will be given a chance to make a statement, so please do so then.

88
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:09,018
Please present your evidence,

89
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,419
Prosecutor.

90
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:12,121
Yes, Your Honor.

91
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:13,622
The evidence I'd like to submit

92
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,824
are the analysis report of the vehicle that collided,

93
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:18,727
the dactyloscopy report of the fingerprints left on the steering wheel,

94
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,929
the pieces of shattered glass collected from the site of the accident,

95
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,131
bits of the coating of the car,

96
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:24,199
and the result of the analysis report of the traces of paint

97
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,702
found on the victim's bicycle.

98
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,205
The dinner party ended at around 22:00,

99
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,308
and the president drove her own car home.

100
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,510
Thank you.

101
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,211
That will be all.

102
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,513
All right.

103
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:40,215
Will the attorney for the defendant cross-examine?

104
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,518
Yes, Your Honor.

105
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,621
Mr. Yajima, I'd like to just ask you one question.

106
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:49,825
Did you see the defendant drive her car?

107
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:53,529
No, because I was talking to one of our business partners.

108
00:05:53,529 --> 00:05:56,932
Please answer only whether you saw or did not see the defendant.

109
00:05:56,932 --> 00:05:59,101
I didn't see her.

110
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:00,402
That will be all.

111
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:05,507
Now I know why your fees are so high.

112
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,512
Your Honor!

113
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:14,216
The defense counsel would like to request a special witness.

114
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:15,417
Prosecutor.

115
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:19,021
A request was submitted today, just before the hearing,

116
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:20,823
anything on this?

117
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:22,324
I accept.

118
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:25,828
Will the special witness for the defense counsel,

119
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:28,630
Kogoro Mouri, come to the witness stand.

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,303
Prosecutor, is it really okay?

121
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:36,605
Yes, no problem.

122
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,507
Dad is taking the stand.

123
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:43,112
I guess I'll sit and watch what Pops is going to do.

124
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,977
Now, Mr. Mouri,

125
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:53,981
I hear you were an acquaintance of Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi.

126
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,283
Yeah, although it was just that I used to see him

127
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,186
off and on at the pub I used go to.

128
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,888
At those times,

129
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:04,992
did Mr. Takeuchi ever drink and drive himself home?

130
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,796
No, not that I know of, not even once.

131
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:14,101
That's why when I heard that he got into a car accident after drinking,

132
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,605
an inspiration flashed through this seven-colored brain cell of mine!

133
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:21,575
After doing some investigation,

134
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:26,780
I started to suspect that maybe he turned himself in to protect his wife.

135
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,183
What made you think so?

136
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:31,085
Well, there were many reasons,

137
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:34,588
but the question here is why he took the blame in her place.

138
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:38,392
I've heard that he wasn't getting along with his wife.

139
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,494
He must've had a darn good reason for admitting

140
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,997
to have committed a crime he didn't do, in place of someone else.

141
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:45,800
Why did he do what he did?

142
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,502
The reason he did what he did was for freedom.

143
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,004
Freedom?

144
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:52,072
Yes, freedom.

145
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,075
He was already in a humiliating position

146
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,678
being that he married into the president's family.

147
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,280
But, after his father-in-law fell ill

148
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,082
and his wife took over the presidency,

149
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,084
he had to face her day in and day out every single day

150
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,986
at home as well as at the company.

151
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,389
I mean, that's like being thrown into jail.

152
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,894
Well, what I mean is...

153
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,496
In exchange to taking the blame for his wife's crime,

154
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,799
he wanted to divorce his bickering wife, and start a new life.

155
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,704
Will the defense counsel come here for a minute?

156
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:24,772
Prosecutor too, please.

157
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:31,278
Defense counsel, what are you trying to prove anyway?

158
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:37,284
Mr. Mouri's testimony sounds more in favor of the prosecution.

159
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,886
I would like to make clear

160
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:42,990
the emotional entanglement that existed between the couple.

161
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,992
Prosecution, any comments?

162
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,696
If that's what it takes to substantiate the murder case...

163
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:49,997
A murder case?

164
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,172
I see that there is a need to hear about this in more detail.

165
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,474
We will suspend eye-witness testimony for now

166
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,077
and court will be adjourned for 30 minutes!

167
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:04,678
Come with me, both of you.

168
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:11,485
Conan, where are you going?

169
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,887
To the restroom!

170
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,802
Please explain what is going on.

171
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,372
I'm sure you both understand that this court hearing

172
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:35,976
is only to pass sentence on a hit-and-run case.

173
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,078
Yes, of course.

174
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,682
However, this case and the case involving Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi

175
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,884
are very closely connected.

176
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,586
And solving that case

177
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:49,590
will very importantly influence the hearing of this case.

178
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,900
Okay.

179
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,002
If the prosecutor feels the same way,

180
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:05,873
let's have Mr. Mouri continue his testimony.

181
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:07,775
However,

182
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,878
if there is anymore commotion in court,

183
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,380
the court will be adjourned immediately.

184
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,782
Understood?

185
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,383
You, especially, Ms. Kujo.

186
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:20,087
Because you seem to be personally involved in this case.

187
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,689
I understand.

188
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,793
It's about time for Pops to go off the scene.

189
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,499
Order in the court!

190
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,702
We will resume the hearing.

191
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,905
I wonder where Conan went.

192
00:10:37,905 --> 00:10:41,175
Will the witness resume testimony?

193
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:42,376
All right.

194
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:50,184
Okay, it's time we get down to business.

195
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:52,486
Like I said a while ago,

196
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,988
Prosecutor Kujo was waiting for Mr. Takeuchi,

197
00:10:53,988 --> 00:10:58,692
who turned himself in to the police, in place of his wife.

198
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,595
And, five years ago when he was pressed

199
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:05,399
to tell the truth about the construction fraud,

200
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,902
an idea flashed through his mind.

201
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,305
What kind of idea was that?

202
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:15,576
If the prosecution hasn't forgotten about the incident in the past,

203
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:18,479
he could use it to blackmail and make money.

204
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:21,081
In other words, not only would he be able to get a hold of freedom,

205
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,386
but also could maybe make a huge sum of cash.

206
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:28,088
One billion yen?

207
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,490
Just what do you mean?

208
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,594
The contract was for divorce and 30 million yen palimony, right?

209
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:36,797
I was in jail for a while, so I raised the price.

210
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,701
I could never dish out such a large sum of money!

211
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,102
If you don't want to, it's fine with me.

212
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:46,373
All I need to do is tell the prosecutor the truth.

213
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,377
I guess you can spend time in jail together with your sick father.

214
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,084
So, the will of wanting to kill

215
00:11:57,084 --> 00:12:00,587
sprouted in Mrs. Takeuchi's mind.

216
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,489
Hey! Just what do you mean the will to kill?

217
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:05,592
Defendant! Order, please!

218
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,095
Witness, are you saying that the defendant

219
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:12,599
may be involved with the death of Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi?

220
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,001
Exactly.

221
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,602
Your Honour!

222
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,604
I would like you to consider this as a testimony

223
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,073
in relation to bringing into light the truth of the matter.

224
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,375
Just what're you talking about?

225
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,477
Aren't you supposed to be my lawyer?

226
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,381
Prosecution, any comments?

227
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:31,385
I agree as to bring to light the truth of the matter.

228
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,290
The witness may proceed.

229
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,192
Wait! Why would I do something like that?

230
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:42,596
Defendant! I will hear you out later.

231
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,097
Please proceed.

232
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,702
That day, Mr. Takeuchi calls Prosecutor Kujo and tells her

233
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,104
to come over because he wants to tell her everything.

234
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,173
Of course, I think it was just

235
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:56,176
a bluff to assure he gets the money he was after.

236
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,383
Talk about way from enough.

237
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,486
Do you think that I get to move

238
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:08,789
a large sum such as a billion yen just like that so easily?

239
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,091
Then, write me an I.O.U.

240
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,993
What?

241
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,896
The prosecutor will be here in two hours.

242
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:18,699
I wonder what I should tell her.

243
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,201
First, the truth of the hit-and-run case.

244
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,904
Then the trick behind the construction fraud

245
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,072
that occurred five years ago.

246
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:29,076
That's when Mrs. Takeuchi executed her scheme.

247
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,496
But, Mr. Mouri,

248
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,999
I heard that Mr. Takeuchi jumped off

249
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,201
right before the eyes of the witness.

250
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,204
When Mr. Takeuchi jumped from the veranda,

251
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:59,072
he was wearing a suit.

252
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,376
However, the pants he was wearing were jeans.

253
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:05,178
That's where the secret lies.

254
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,081
After killing her husband,

255
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,284
Mrs. Takeuchi put the top of a suit on him

256
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:13,587
and rigged a wire hanger on his back.

257
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,890
She then carried his dead body to the veranda

258
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,893
and tied a rope to the tip of the wire hanger that was rigged to him.

259
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,995
The other end of the rope

260
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,798
was hooked onto the hook of the clothing pole of the ceiling

261
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,200
and pulled into the bedroom.

262
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,202
All she had to do later

263
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,804
was hide in the bedroom and pull the rope.

264
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,173
Then the body would be suspended from the ceiling

265
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,475
and looks as if it is standing on its own.

266
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,477
That's a lie! How can you say such things?

267
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,479
Defendant!

268
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,481
You will be given an opportunity to speak your mind later.

269
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,786
However,

270
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,889
even if would be possible to make the dead body stand in that situation,

271
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,293
wouldn't it be impossible to make it jump off?

272
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,795
Exactly.

273
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:56,396
In order to do so,

274
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,098
she would've had to not only suspend him from above,

275
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,802
but also pull him simultaneously from the front.

276
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:04,905
So, in order to pull the body from the front,

277
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,875
she used the BS antenna that is set up outside the veranda

278
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:12,579
and tied a rope around the chest of the body.

279
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,982
Then, she leaves the suicide note that was prepared beforehand

280
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:16,283
in the living room,

281
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,386
and waited for Prosecutor Kujo to come.

282
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,587
Hold on!

283
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,491
She pretended to have just come back from outside,

284
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:27,494
and went back into the room with Prosecutor Kujo.

285
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,896
Dear? Where are you?

286
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,098
Dear?

287
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:34,401
Dear? What're you doing there?

288
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,702
Please, don't!

289
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:42,376
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

290
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,884
It is most likely that because of the darkness of the veranda

291
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:53,186
and the shock of what was happening before her,

292
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:54,988
Ms. Kujo did not realize

293
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,491
the unnatural movements of Mr. Takeuchi,

294
00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:01,495
or the suspicious way Mrs. Takeuchi was acting.

295
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:02,996
Cut out all that bull!

296
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,198
Where do you have such evidence?

297
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,901
The rope that was supposed to come off smoothly

298
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:10,203
probably got stuck to something.

299
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:14,574
Only the BS antenna of your room is bent downwards.

300
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,077
You can't tell when it got bent, can you?

301
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,578
It could've been bent before the incident.

302
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,881
A wire clothes hanger that was bent out of shape

303
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:23,583
was found in the closet of the bedroom.

304
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,986
It got bent, so I was planning on throwing it away.

305
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,988
Blood stains and hair

306
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,590
were found on the brick under the outdoor unit.

307
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,992
Don't be ridiculous!

308
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,394
I'm sure I got rid of the brick.

309
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:41,201
You switched it with the brick that was in the garden.

310
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,304
The brick that was used as the murder weapon

311
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,772
has already been confiscated

312
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,375
and is with the forensic officers right now.

313
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,476
Come on!

314
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,078
How dare you all pick on me?

315
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,979
-Order! -But...

316
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,082
Order! Defendant!

317
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,788
Court is adjourned for today.

318
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:05,592
The date of the next hearing will be decided upon discussion.

319
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,594
Prosecution is required to submit a petition

320
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,498
as to the separate murder case.

321
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,799
That will be all.

322
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,989
Hi, Ms. Kujo.

323
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,392
Thank you so much the other day.

324
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:46,893
I've gotten a pay-cut

325
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:51,097
and one month suspension from duty because of the case.

326
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

327
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,002
I was bawled out by my boss too.

328
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,472
But, I think it's a good chance for me to relax,

329
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,075
since I haven't had time off for quite a while.

330
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:04,377
Then, I guess you should forget all about work

331
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,580
and rest to your heart's content.

332
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,681
Yes, I will.

333
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:10,383
Prosecutor Kujo, where are you going

334
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,786
with a suitcase like that?

335
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:17,490
To Tottori.

336
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,793
It's been three years since my previous boss passed away,

337
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:22,896
so I thought I'd go visit his grave.

338
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,800
I see. Take care.

339
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,501
Goodbye, then.

340
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,875
I'll see you in court again.

341
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,477
You won't beat me next time!

342
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,979
The same here.

343
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,481
Goodbye.

344
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,386
I'm glad.

345
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:48,889
She seems to have returned to her normal self.

346
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:49,890
Yes.

347
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,394
The Madonna of Prosecution...

348
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:59,299
rises again!

349
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,183
Next Conan's Hint:

350
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,085
"Lift".

351
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,187
The next episode is about my sweet naive love story with Shinichi

352
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:56,089
in our intermediate school days.
