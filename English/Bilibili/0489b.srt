00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.713
"Takeuchi Construction Company's Bribery Case"

2
00:00:31.913 --> 00:00:32.913
What?

3
00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:36.113
Attorney at law Kisaki is here.

4
00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:37.413
Please let her through.

5
00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:41.913
-This way. -Thank you.

6
00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:43.813
Ms. Kujo.

7
00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:45.113
May we go out somewhere?

8
00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.213
Yes, sure.

9
00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:52.613
Thank you for the other day.

10
00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:55.213
Did you get information about Mr. Takeuchi?

11
00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:56.613
Yes.

12
00:00:56.613 --> 00:01:00.113
I heard charges have been dropped due to the death of the suspect.

13
00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:04.113
I'm sorry for all the inconvenience I caused you, Ms. Kisaki.

14
00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:08.213
By the way,

15
00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:11.513
I heard you submitted an informal resignation,

16
00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:13.113
but is it true?

17
00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:19.613
Don't tell me that you're planning on quitting your job as prosecutor.

18
00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.113
I pressured the suspect who turned himself in,

19
00:01:22.113 --> 00:01:25.013
to the point of committing suicide

20
00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:27.713
that I'm ready for whatever may happen to my job.

21
00:01:27.713 --> 00:01:30.213
What are you going to do about the hit-and-run incident?

22
00:01:30.213 --> 00:01:31.713
Another prosecutor

23
00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:35.913
is preparing to set up evidence that his wife committed the crime.

24
00:01:35.913 --> 00:01:38.913
You mean that's okay with you?

25
00:01:38.913 --> 00:01:40.013
If under the law,

26
00:01:40.013 --> 00:01:42.913
the truth is brought into the light,

27
00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:46.613
my individual position is of no concern!

28
00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:49.513
Even if that means letting the killer go free?

29
00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:50.513
Huh?

30
00:01:56.713 --> 00:01:58.913
-Killer? -Yes.

31
00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:01.113
There is suspicion that maybe Mr. Takeuchi was murdered

32
00:02:01.113 --> 00:02:03.613
under the pretense of having committed suicide.

33
00:02:03.613 --> 00:02:05.513
That... that can't be

34
00:02:05.513 --> 00:02:07.713
because I saw him with my own eyes.

35
00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:10.713
What did you see with your own eyes?

36
00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:17.213
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

37
00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:26.013
What was his wife doing at that time?

38
00:02:29.513 --> 00:02:31.313
I don't know.

39
00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:34.613
I was so absorbed in stopping Mr. Takeuchi back then,

40
00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.013
that my attention was not on her at all.

41
00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:38.113
Don't tell me that...

42
00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:43.113
His wife had a motive of wanting to kill her husband.

43
00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:46.213
You mean it was all planned out?

44
00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:49.113
Setting an incumbent prosecutor up as eye-witness,

45
00:02:49.113 --> 00:02:50.513
would ensure that investigation will follow through

46
00:02:50.513 --> 00:02:52.913
with just a matter of procedure.

47
00:02:52.913 --> 00:02:54.313
They would never perform an investigation

48
00:02:54.313 --> 00:02:58.313
that would go right against the testimony of a prosecutor.

49
00:02:58.313 --> 00:02:59.613
That's true.

50
00:02:59.613 --> 00:03:01.313
Oh, my goodness.

51
00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:04.113
That possibility didn't even cross my mind.

52
00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:05.513
So, what are you going to do?

53
00:03:05.513 --> 00:03:07.013
If you quit now,

54
00:03:07.013 --> 00:03:08.913
it'll be exactly what the culprit wants you to do.

55
00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:10.513
Are you sure you want it that way?

56
00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:12.713
Ms. Kisaki, I'm sorry,

57
00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:14.413
but if you'll excuse me, I must go!

58
00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:16.613
I have to get back to work.

59
00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:21.813
Hello, Mr. Sasaki,

60
00:03:21.813 --> 00:03:23.113
will you please get together

61
00:03:23.113 --> 00:03:25.213
the investigation reports of Mr. Takeuchi's case right away?

62
00:03:25.213 --> 00:03:28.113
Yes. And, please contact the local police

63
00:03:28.113 --> 00:03:29.813
and make an appointment with the police detective in charge too.

64
00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:34.013
The defendant, Mariko Takeuchi,

65
00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.213
on the same day late at night at around 23:00,

66
00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:38.413
drove her own car,

67
00:03:38.413 --> 00:03:41.313
and when she got to the Toriyacho intersection,

68
00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:44.313
collided into the bicycle

69
00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:48.513
driven by victim, Yasuyuki Matsukawa, who was crossing the street,

70
00:03:48.513 --> 00:03:51.413
then hit-and-ran.

71
00:03:51.413 --> 00:03:53.213
She then tells her husband,

72
00:03:53.213 --> 00:03:57.013
Hiroaki Takeuchi to turn himself in to the police, in her place,

73
00:03:57.013 --> 00:03:59.313
and attempts to free herself from the crime she committed.

74
00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:00.913
After her husband commits suicide,

75
00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:04.013
next they bring charges against her.

76
00:04:04.013 --> 00:04:06.413
Maybe Madonna's upset at the mass media getting down on her,

77
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.013
that she's just trying to push her way through?

78
00:04:09.013 --> 00:04:13.413
Hey, Conan. Wasn't the one who hit-and-ran, his wife?

79
00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:16.013
Then, why is mom acting as her attorney?

80
00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:19.113
I'm sure she has something in mind.

81
00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:24.213
I wonder what she has in mind.

82
00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:32.613
Is the defendant admitting the charges?

83
00:04:32.613 --> 00:04:34.113
I am innocent!

84
00:04:34.113 --> 00:04:36.713
She had the nerve to pressure my husband into committing suicide,

85
00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:40.013
-and now, she dares brings charges against me too. -Order!

86
00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.213
If you have any counterargument,

87
00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:44.513
you will be given a chance to make a statement, so please do so then.

88
00:04:46.613 --> 00:04:49.013
Please present your evidence,

89
00:04:49.013 --> 00:04:50.413
Prosecutor.

90
00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:52.113
Yes, Your Honor.

91
00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:53.613
The evidence I'd like to submit

92
00:04:53.613 --> 00:04:55.813
are the analysis report of the vehicle that collided,

93
00:04:55.813 --> 00:04:58.713
the dactyloscopy report of the fingerprints left on the steering wheel,

94
00:04:58.713 --> 00:05:00.913
the pieces of shattered glass collected from the site of the accident,

95
00:05:00.913 --> 00:05:02.113
bits of the coating of the car,

96
00:05:02.113 --> 00:05:04.213
and the result of the analysis report of the traces of paint

97
00:05:04.213 --> 00:05:06.713
found on the victim's bicycle.

98
00:05:06.713 --> 00:05:10.213
The dinner party ended at around 22:00,

99
00:05:10.213 --> 00:05:13.313
and the president drove her own car home.

100
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.513
Thank you.

101
00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:16.213
That will be all.

102
00:05:16.213 --> 00:05:17.513
All right.

103
00:05:17.513 --> 00:05:20.213
Will the attorney for the defendant cross-examine?

104
00:05:20.213 --> 00:05:22.513
Yes, Your Honor.

105
00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:25.613
Mr. Yajima, I'd like to just ask you one question.

106
00:05:25.613 --> 00:05:29.813
Did you see the defendant drive her car?

107
00:05:29.813 --> 00:05:33.513
No, because I was talking to one of our business partners.

108
00:05:33.513 --> 00:05:36.913
Please answer only whether you saw or did not see the defendant.

109
00:05:36.913 --> 00:05:39.113
I didn't see her.

110
00:05:39.113 --> 00:05:40.413
That will be all.

111
00:05:42.913 --> 00:05:45.513
Now I know why your fees are so high.

112
00:05:49.113 --> 00:05:50.513
Your Honor!

113
00:05:50.513 --> 00:05:54.213
The defense counsel would like to request a special witness.

114
00:05:54.213 --> 00:05:55.413
Prosecutor.

115
00:05:55.413 --> 00:05:59.013
A request was submitted today, just before the hearing,

116
00:05:59.013 --> 00:06:00.813
anything on this?

117
00:06:00.813 --> 00:06:02.313
I accept.

118
00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:05.813
Will the special witness for the defense counsel,

119
00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:08.613
Kogoro Mouri, come to the witness stand.

120
00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:14.313
Prosecutor, is it really okay?

121
00:06:14.313 --> 00:06:16.613
Yes, no problem.

122
00:06:16.613 --> 00:06:18.513
Dad is taking the stand.

123
00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:23.113
I guess I'll sit and watch what Pops is going to do.

124
00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:48.734
I started to suspect that maybe he turned himself in to protect his wife.

125
00:06:48.734 --> 00:06:51.134
What made you think so?

126
00:06:51.134 --> 00:06:53.034
Well, there were many reasons,

127
00:06:53.034 --> 00:06:56.534
but the question here is why he took the blame in her place.

128
00:06:56.534 --> 00:07:00.334
I've heard that he wasn't getting along with his wife.

129
00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:02.434
He must've had a darn good reason for admitting

130
00:07:02.434 --> 00:07:04.934
to have committed a crime he didn't do, in place of someone else.

131
00:07:04.934 --> 00:07:07.734
Why did he do what he did?

132
00:07:07.734 --> 00:07:10.434
The reason he did what he did was for freedom.

133
00:07:10.434 --> 00:07:11.934
Freedom?

134
00:07:11.934 --> 00:07:14.034
Yes, freedom.

135
00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:17.034
He was already in a humiliating position

136
00:07:17.034 --> 00:07:19.634
being that he married into the president's family.

137
00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:21.234
But, after his father-in-law fell ill

138
00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:24.034
and his wife took over the presidency,

139
00:07:24.034 --> 00:07:26.034
he had to face her day in and day out every single day

140
00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:27.934
at home as well as at the company.

141
00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:30.334
I mean, that's like being thrown into jail.

142
00:07:32.934 --> 00:07:35.834
Well, what I mean is...

143
00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:37.434
In exchange to taking the blame for his wife's crime,

144
00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:40.734
he wanted to divorce his bickering wife, and start a new life.

145
00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:45.634
Will the defense counsel come here for a minute?

146
00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:46.734
Prosecutor too, please.

147
00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:53.234
Defense counsel, what are you trying to prove anyway?

148
00:07:53.234 --> 00:07:59.234
Mr. Mouri's testimony sounds more in favor of the prosecution.

149
00:07:59.234 --> 00:08:00.834
I would like to make clear

150
00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:04.934
the emotional entanglement that existed between the couple.

151
00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:06.934
Prosecution, any comments?

152
00:08:06.934 --> 00:08:10.634
If that's what it takes to substantiate the murder case...

153
00:08:10.634 --> 00:08:11.934
A murder case?

154
00:08:15.034 --> 00:08:20.134
I see that there is a need to hear about this in more detail.

155
00:08:20.134 --> 00:08:22.434
We will suspend eye-witness testimony for now

156
00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:25.034
and court will be adjourned for 30 minutes!

157
00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:26.634
Come with me, both of you.

158
00:08:31.334 --> 00:08:33.434
Conan, where are you going?

159
00:08:33.434 --> 00:08:34.834
To the restroom!

160
00:08:47.734 --> 00:08:50.734
Please explain what is going on.

161
00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:53.334
I'm sure you both understand that this court hearing

162
00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:57.934
is only to pass sentence on a hit-and-run case.

163
00:08:57.934 --> 00:09:00.034
Yes, of course.

164
00:09:00.034 --> 00:09:03.634
However, this case and the case involving Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi

165
00:09:03.634 --> 00:09:05.834
are very closely connected.

166
00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:07.534
And solving that case

167
00:09:07.534 --> 00:09:11.534
will very importantly influence the hearing of this case.

168
00:09:20.234 --> 00:09:21.834
Okay.

169
00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:23.934
If the prosecutor feels the same way,

170
00:09:23.934 --> 00:09:27.834
let's have Mr. Mouri continue his testimony.

171
00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:29.734
However,

172
00:09:29.734 --> 00:09:32.834
if there is anymore commotion in court,

173
00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:35.334
the court will be adjourned immediately.

174
00:09:35.334 --> 00:09:36.734
Understood?

175
00:09:36.734 --> 00:09:38.334
You, especially, Ms. Kujo.

176
00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:42.034
Because you seem to be personally involved in this case.

177
00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:43.634
I understand.

178
00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:47.734
It's about time for Pops to go off the scene.

179
00:09:52.334 --> 00:09:54.434
Order in the court!

180
00:09:54.434 --> 00:09:56.634
We will resume the hearing.

181
00:09:56.634 --> 00:09:59.834
I wonder where Conan went.

182
00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:03.134
Will the witness resume testimony?

183
00:10:03.134 --> 00:10:04.334
All right.

184
00:10:09.134 --> 00:10:12.134
Okay, it's time we get down to business.

185
00:10:12.134 --> 00:10:14.434
Like I said a while ago,

186
00:10:14.434 --> 00:10:15.934
Prosecutor Kujo was waiting for Mr. Takeuchi,

187
00:10:15.934 --> 00:10:20.634
who turned himself in to the police, in place of his wife.

188
00:10:20.634 --> 00:10:23.534
And, five years ago when he was pressed

189
00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:27.334
to tell the truth about the construction fraud,

190
00:10:27.334 --> 00:10:30.834
an idea flashed through his mind.

191
00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:33.234
What kind of idea was that?

192
00:10:33.234 --> 00:10:37.534
If the prosecution hasn't forgotten about the incident in the past,

193
00:10:37.534 --> 00:10:40.434
he could use it to blackmail and make money.

194
00:10:40.434 --> 00:10:43.034
In other words, not only would he be able to get a hold of freedom,

195
00:10:43.034 --> 00:10:47.334
but also could maybe make a huge sum of cash.

196
00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:50.034
One billion yen?

197
00:10:50.034 --> 00:10:51.434
Just what do you mean?

198
00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:55.534
The contract was for divorce and 30 million yen palimony, right?

199
00:10:55.534 --> 00:10:58.734
I was in jail for a while, so I raised the price.

200
00:11:00.134 --> 00:11:02.634
I could never dish out such a large sum of money!

201
00:11:02.634 --> 00:11:04.034
If you don't want to, it's fine with me.

202
00:11:04.034 --> 00:11:08.334
All I need to do is tell the prosecutor the truth.

203
00:11:08.334 --> 00:11:12.334
I guess you can spend time in jail together with your sick father.

204
00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.034
So, the will of wanting to kill

205
00:11:19.034 --> 00:11:22.534
sprouted in Mrs. Takeuchi's mind.

206
00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:24.434
Hey! Just what do you mean the will to kill?

207
00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.534
Defendant! Order, please!

208
00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:30.034
Witness, are you saying that the defendant

209
00:11:30.034 --> 00:11:34.534
may be involved with the death of Mr. Hiroaki Takeuchi?

210
00:11:34.534 --> 00:11:35.934
Exactly.

211
00:11:35.934 --> 00:11:37.534
Your Honour!

212
00:11:37.534 --> 00:11:39.534
I would like you to consider this as a testimony

213
00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:42.034
in relation to bringing into light the truth of the matter.

214
00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.334
Just what're you talking about?

215
00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:45.434
Aren't you supposed to be my lawyer?

216
00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:49.334
Prosecution, any comments?

217
00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:53.334
I agree as to bring to light the truth of the matter.

218
00:11:55.634 --> 00:11:58.234
The witness may proceed.

219
00:11:58.234 --> 00:12:00.134
Wait! Why would I do something like that?

220
00:12:00.134 --> 00:12:04.534
Defendant! I will hear you out later.

221
00:12:04.534 --> 00:12:06.034
Please proceed.

222
00:12:06.034 --> 00:12:10.634
That day, Mr. Takeuchi calls Prosecutor Kujo and tells her

223
00:12:10.634 --> 00:12:13.034
to come over because he wants to tell her everything.

224
00:12:13.034 --> 00:12:15.134
Of course, I think it was just

225
00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:18.134
a bluff to assure he gets the money he was after.

226
00:12:22.734 --> 00:12:25.334
Talk about way from enough.

227
00:12:25.334 --> 00:12:27.434
Do you think that I get to move

228
00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:30.734
a large sum such as a billion yen just like that so easily?

229
00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:33.034
Then, write me an I.O.U.

230
00:12:33.034 --> 00:12:34.934
What?

231
00:12:34.934 --> 00:12:37.834
The prosecutor will be here in two hours.

232
00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:40.634
I wonder what I should tell her.

233
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:43.134
First, the truth of the hit-and-run case.

234
00:12:43.134 --> 00:12:45.834
Then the trick behind the construction fraud

235
00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:47.034
that occurred five years ago.

236
00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:51.034
That's when Mrs. Takeuchi executed her scheme.

237
00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:11.434
But, Mr. Mouri,

238
00:13:11.434 --> 00:13:13.934
I heard that Mr. Takeuchi jumped off

239
00:13:13.934 --> 00:13:16.134
right before the eyes of the witness.

240
00:13:16.134 --> 00:13:19.134
When Mr. Takeuchi jumped from the veranda,

241
00:13:19.134 --> 00:13:21.034
he was wearing a suit.

242
00:13:21.034 --> 00:13:24.334
However, the pants he was wearing were jeans.

243
00:13:24.334 --> 00:13:27.134
That's where the secret lies.

244
00:13:27.134 --> 00:13:30.034
After killing her husband,

245
00:13:30.034 --> 00:13:32.234
Mrs. Takeuchi put the top of a suit on him

246
00:13:32.234 --> 00:13:35.534
and rigged a wire hanger on his back.

247
00:13:35.534 --> 00:13:38.834
She then carried his dead body to the veranda

248
00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:41.834
and tied a rope to the tip of the wire hanger that was rigged to him.

249
00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:43.934
The other end of the rope

250
00:13:43.934 --> 00:13:46.734
was hooked onto the hook of the clothing pole of the ceiling

251
00:13:46.734 --> 00:13:49.134
and pulled into the bedroom.

252
00:13:49.134 --> 00:13:50.134
All she had to do later

253
00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:52.734
was hide in the bedroom and pull the rope.

254
00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:55.134
Then the body would be suspended from the ceiling

255
00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.434
and looks as if it is standing on its own.

256
00:13:57.434 --> 00:13:59.434
That's a lie! How can you say such things?

257
00:13:59.434 --> 00:14:01.434
Defendant!

258
00:14:01.434 --> 00:14:03.434
You will be given an opportunity to speak your mind later.

259
00:14:06.134 --> 00:14:07.734
However,

260
00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:10.834
even if would be possible to make the dead body stand in that situation,

261
00:14:10.834 --> 00:14:15.234
wouldn't it be impossible to make it jump off?

262
00:14:15.234 --> 00:14:16.734
Exactly.

263
00:14:16.734 --> 00:14:18.334
In order to do so,

264
00:14:18.334 --> 00:14:20.034
she would've had to not only suspend him from above,

265
00:14:20.034 --> 00:14:23.734
but also pull him simultaneously from the front.

266
00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:26.834
So, in order to pull the body from the front,

267
00:14:26.834 --> 00:14:30.834
she used the BS antenna that is set up outside the veranda

268
00:14:30.834 --> 00:14:34.534
and tied a rope around the chest of the body.

269
00:14:34.534 --> 00:14:36.934
Then, she leaves the suicide note that was prepared beforehand

270
00:14:36.934 --> 00:14:38.234
in the living room,

271
00:14:38.234 --> 00:14:41.334
and waited for Prosecutor Kujo to come.

272
00:14:41.334 --> 00:14:42.534
Hold on!

273
00:14:42.534 --> 00:14:46.434
She pretended to have just come back from outside,

274
00:14:46.434 --> 00:14:49.434
and went back into the room with Prosecutor Kujo.

275
00:14:49.434 --> 00:14:51.834
Dear? Where are you?

276
00:14:51.834 --> 00:14:53.034
Dear?

277
00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:56.334
Dear? What're you doing there?

278
00:14:56.334 --> 00:14:57.634
Please, don't!

279
00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:04.334
Mr. Takeuchi! What're you doing?

280
00:15:10.234 --> 00:15:12.834
It is most likely that because of the darkness of the veranda

281
00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:15.134
and the shock of what was happening before her,

282
00:15:15.134 --> 00:15:16.934
Ms. Kujo did not realize

283
00:15:16.934 --> 00:15:19.434
the unnatural movements of Mr. Takeuchi,

284
00:15:19.434 --> 00:15:23.434
or the suspicious way Mrs. Takeuchi was acting.

285
00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:24.934
Cut out all that bull!

286
00:15:24.934 --> 00:15:27.134
Where do you have such evidence?

287
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:29.834
The rope that was supposed to come off smoothly

288
00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:32.134
probably got stuck to something.

289
00:15:32.134 --> 00:15:36.534
Only the BS antenna of your room is bent downwards.

290
00:15:36.534 --> 00:15:39.034
You can't tell when it got bent, can you?

291
00:15:39.034 --> 00:15:40.534
It could've been bent before the incident.

292
00:15:40.534 --> 00:15:42.834
A wire clothes hanger that was bent out of shape

293
00:15:42.834 --> 00:15:45.534
was found in the closet of the bedroom.

294
00:15:45.534 --> 00:15:47.934
It got bent, so I was planning on throwing it away.

295
00:15:47.934 --> 00:15:49.934
Blood stains and hair

296
00:15:49.934 --> 00:15:52.534
were found on the brick under the outdoor unit.

297
00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:53.934
Don't be ridiculous!

298
00:15:53.934 --> 00:15:56.334
I'm sure I got rid of the brick.

299
00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:03.134
You switched it with the brick that was in the garden.

300
00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:06.234
The brick that was used as the murder weapon

301
00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:07.734
has already been confiscated

302
00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:10.334
and is with the forensic officers right now.

303
00:16:10.334 --> 00:16:11.434
Come on!

304
00:16:11.434 --> 00:16:13.034
How dare you all pick on me?

305
00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:14.934
-Order! -But...

306
00:16:14.934 --> 00:16:17.034
Order! Defendant!

307
00:16:21.134 --> 00:16:23.734
Court is adjourned for today.

308
00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:27.534
The date of the next hearing will be decided upon discussion.

309
00:16:27.534 --> 00:16:29.534
Prosecution is required to submit a petition

310
00:16:29.534 --> 00:16:33.434
as to the separate murder case.

311
00:16:33.434 --> 00:16:34.734
That will be all.

312
00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:04.934
Hi, Ms. Kujo.

313
00:18:04.934 --> 00:18:07.334
Thank you so much the other day.

314
00:18:07.334 --> 00:18:08.834
I've gotten a pay-cut

315
00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:13.034
and one month suspension from duty because of the case.

316
00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:15.234
Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:18:15.234 --> 00:18:17.934
I was bawled out by my boss too.

318
00:18:17.934 --> 00:18:21.434
But, I think it's a good chance for me to relax,

319
00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.034
since I haven't had time off for quite a while.

320
00:18:24.034 --> 00:18:26.334
Then, I guess you should forget all about work

321
00:18:26.334 --> 00:18:28.534
and rest to your heart's content.

322
00:18:28.534 --> 00:18:29.634
Yes, I will.

323
00:18:29.634 --> 00:18:32.334
Prosecutor Kujo, where are you going

324
00:18:32.334 --> 00:18:34.734
with a suitcase like that?

325
00:18:36.734 --> 00:18:39.434
To Tottori.

326
00:18:39.434 --> 00:18:41.734
It's been three years since my previous boss passed away,

327
00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:44.834
so I thought I'd go visit his grave.

328
00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:48.734
I see. Take care.

329
00:18:48.734 --> 00:18:50.434
Goodbye, then.

330
00:18:53.934 --> 00:18:56.834
I'll see you in court again.

331
00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:59.434
You won't beat me next time!

332
00:18:59.434 --> 00:19:00.934
The same here.

333
00:19:02.334 --> 00:19:03.434
Goodbye.

334
00:19:06.434 --> 00:19:08.334
I'm glad.

335
00:19:08.334 --> 00:19:10.834
She seems to have returned to her normal self.

336
00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:11.834
Yes.

337
00:19:14.134 --> 00:19:16.334
The Madonna of Prosecution...

338
00:19:19.234 --> 00:19:21.234
rises again!

339
00:19:39.734 --> 00:19:42.034
Next Conan's Hint:

340
00:19:42.034 --> 00:19:43.934
"Lift".

341
00:19:43.934 --> 00:19:46.034
The next episode is about my sweet naive love story with Shinichi

342
00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:47.934
in our intermediate school days.
