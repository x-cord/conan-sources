1
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:07,783
What? Cancel our last live show?

2
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:08,984
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,986
I don't think any of you

4
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:13,689
have the thing it takes to fill the hall up anymore.

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:14,990
I think it's better for you this way too.

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,893
Boss! Please wait, Boss!

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,394
Our last live is something

8
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,096
that I went out of my way to get to.

9
00:00:21,096 --> 00:00:23,799
Well, you see this is all business.

10
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:24,800
I can't go through with something that I know

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,902
is going to put us in the red.

12
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,205
Then, just how do you propose we say goodbye to our fans?

13
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,608
Why don't you write about it on your website or something?

14
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:36,111
I can write it for you again like last time. Would you like me to?

15
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:40,682
But you'll still have to work another six months for me.

16
00:00:40,682 --> 00:00:42,684
As for variety shows and talk shows,

17
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:45,988
you're still worth some value.

18
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:47,689
You've gotta be kidding.

19
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:49,491
If you're not going to let us do our last live show,

20
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,593
I'll quit right this.

21
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,095
Just fine with me!

22
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,499
But if you quit while the contract is still valid,

23
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:01,003
you're paying me for damages incurred.

24
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,205
Okay. Bye.

25
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:51,386
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

26
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:53,488
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

27
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,090
The stage today is at a TV station.

28
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,491
In a glamorous world of masks,

29
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,393
there is danger of real faces being exposed.

30
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,895
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:01,596
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:03,098
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:42,297
"Devil at the TV Station".

34
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,207
-What? -What?

35
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,708
You mean the location that the TV station

36
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,510
was going on was cancelled?

37
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,612
No joke?

38
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,914
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:58,914 --> 00:04:01,082
I was really looking forward to it.

40
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:05,086
Yes. We thought we would be seeing...

41
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:08,590
-I'm so sorry. -a new Jocker monster.

42
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,893
I was looking forward to eating box lunch on location.

43
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:13,395
The staff member was an acquaintance of mine,

44
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:15,197
so I got to invite you over,

45
00:04:15,197 --> 00:04:17,999
but they don't seem to be able to cope with spectators now.

46
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:19,801
So, I'm really so sorry!

47
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,403
No, it's okay.

48
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,308
I'm so sorry.

49
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:28,310
Well, all's well

50
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,813
because we did get to specially come into the TV studio after all.

51
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,182
So, why don't we go look around here?

52
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:36,184
Right!

53
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,686
That's right!

54
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:40,088
I'll bet there're many famous people here!

55
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:43,191
I'd like to see the weather lady!

56
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,893
I'd like to see Toraya!

57
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,995
I want to see Yak!

58
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:52,601
Hey, a popular idol, Ms. Yoko Okino,

59
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,302
is right before your eyes.

60
00:04:54,302 --> 00:04:57,405
Good morning, Yoko!

61
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,508
Good morning.

62
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,110
It's Ms. Kazuka Inoue! See.

63
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,211
Really!

64
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,313
The gourmet lady.

65
00:05:05,313 --> 00:05:06,515
"Kazuka Inoue" -Yoko.

66
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,984
Take it easy on me today, okay?

67
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,586
Same to you!

68
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:14,089
Her parents run a noodle shop, right?

69
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,690
I wonder if they serve eels over rice.

70
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,093
Oh, come on, Genta.

71
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:22,097
Kazuka Inoue, birthday May 13th.

72
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:24,799
166 centimeters tall.

73
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,802
Good morning.

74
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:31,907
-Good morning! -Good morning.

75
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:34,809
"Azusa Yamamoto" -Good morning.

76
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:41,182
It's Ms. Azusa Yamamoto, Genta!

77
00:05:41,182 --> 00:05:44,185
Famous people here there and everywhere.

78
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:47,989
Yoko Okino, Kazuka Inoue, Azusa Yamamoto.

79
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,691
Hey, you guys...

80
00:06:04,806 --> 00:06:08,009
But how lucky to see so many idols so soon!

81
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:09,210
-Yep! -Right!

82
00:06:12,113 --> 00:06:14,983
You all look familiar.

83
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:18,086
I think I've seen you somewhere before too.

84
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,491
You probably saw us in the papers or something!

85
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:25,293
Because we are...

86
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:28,496
-the Youth Detective Squad! -The Youth Detective Squad!

87
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,699
-Youth Detective Squad? -Youth Detective Squad?

88
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,102
Right, we're the Youth Detective Squad!

89
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,905
We've arrested a lot of bad guys!

90
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:38,707
Yes!

91
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:39,908
Really?

92
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:42,010
Wow!

93
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,612
Well, it's really no big deal...

94
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,882
Conan here in particular is special.

95
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:50,986
He's a famous detective trained by Mr. Mouri.

96
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:55,890
You mean that famous Mr. Mouri?

97
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,093
Yes! Kogoro Mouri!

98
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,996
He's a great fan of mine!

99
00:07:00,996 --> 00:07:02,497
Come to think of it,

100
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:05,200
he's well known for being a fan of yours.

101
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,902
I guess questions involving cases and deductions

102
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:10,005
are all yours, Yoko.

103
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,906
Not really!

104
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,009
What questions?

105
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,014
We're shooting a quiz program today.

106
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:20,115
All three of us

107
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,183
are challenging each other answering the questions.

108
00:07:22,183 --> 00:07:26,688
I see. That's why you said to take it easy on you.

109
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:29,090
Yoko, forget that we're friends today.

110
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,392
I'm going to be a devil today

111
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,994
and I'm going to win no matter what!

112
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,297
What? Oh, no. A devil?

113
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:37,699
A devil.

114
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,300
A devil, she says.

115
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:44,005
What's the matter, Ayumi?

116
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:48,309
-It appeared! -It appeared!

117
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,884
So I'll bet you're the new monster

118
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:57,886
that's appearing in Kamen Yaiba?

119
00:07:59,387 --> 00:08:01,489
I'd say he's more like

120
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:04,993
the new executive of the evil organization rather than a monster.

121
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:09,197
He's the new boss! I'm sure he's the boss!

122
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,901
What's with you, Brats?

123
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:19,007
You mean you guys really don't know who I am?

124
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:20,708
-No. -No.

125
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,709
Nope.

126
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,815
I've really fallen to the pit.

127
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,686
Well, I guess you're not all that wrong in saying

128
00:08:31,686 --> 00:08:34,489
that I'm a monster that appears in Kamen Yaiba.

129
00:08:37,992 --> 00:08:39,394
Good morning!

130
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,696
I wonder who he is?

131
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:43,598
I've never seen him before.

132
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:45,700
Neither have I.

133
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,704
He's the vocal for a rock group called Styx III.

134
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:51,706
Mr. Satan Onizuka!

135
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:55,210
"Satan Onizuka (32), vocalist for Styx III"

136
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,214
I heard that he's going to be appearing on a variety show today.

137
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:04,385
A rock singer appearing on a variety show.

138
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:07,088
I guess the world of devils is going through tough times too.

139
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,391
Onizuka? Satan.

140
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:13,194
Satan? Onizuka Satan?

141
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:15,797
Satan Onizuka?

142
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:18,199
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

143
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,701
It's nothing.

144
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,803
Satan Onizuka...

145
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:24,806
I've heard this name somewhere before, I think.

146
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,613
I remember!

147
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,182
My older sister is Satan Onizuka's fan,

148
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,784
and she asked me to do her a favor!

149
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,886
She asked me to get his autograph for her

150
00:09:37,886 --> 00:09:40,188
if I get to see him at the TV station!

151
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,891
I've got to go after him right away and get his autograph!

152
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:46,494
But he seems to have gone some place already.

153
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:51,799
Talk about exaggerating.

154
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,301
Now, now.

155
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,603
If we ask Yoko where his dressing room is,

156
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:57,305
I'm sure we can.

157
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,807
Right, Yoko?

158
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,010
Huh? Where's Yoko?

159
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:10,185
Yoko was here just a second ago...

160
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:14,489
Oh, the AD came to get her just a while ago

161
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,090
saying that it was time for her to go on air.

162
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,493
He took the two challengers along too.

163
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:23,298
Well, I guess we'll just have to find her on our own.

164
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:24,999
True!

165
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,503
I mean we know that he's here in the TV station after all.

166
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,604
Yes!

167
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:32,307
Let's go look for him together!

168
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,210
"Satan Onizuka"

169
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:42,083
Huh?

170
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,586
Mr. Satan.

171
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:47,088
You're already here.

172
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:51,192
I thought you were supposed to come in after noon?

173
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,196
Yeah, I came early because I had nothing to do.

174
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,601
So, won't you order me a take out meal, manager?

175
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:01,703
I didn't have lunch yet.

176
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,205
Okay, no problem.

177
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,107
So, what would you like?

178
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,312
Tenpuku-tei's ramen and...

179
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:14,115
Tenpuku-tei's ramen.

180
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,484
Fried rice from Janjanken.

181
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:19,287
Janjanken's fried rice and...

182
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:23,891
That's right, I want to eat Eirinan's dumplings.

183
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,095
Erinan's dumplings.

184
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:28,596
Ramen, fried rice, dumplings...

185
00:11:28,596 --> 00:11:30,798
You mean you want all three dishes from a different shop?

186
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,701
Since they are all Chinese dishes, why not order them from the same shop?

187
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:35,403
Who cares!

188
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,905
I want that certain dish from that certain shop!

189
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,309
Besides, I go to all three shops often to eat,

190
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,012
so I'm sure they'll bring my order even it's only one dish each.

191
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,682
By the way,

192
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:49,684
did you find that mirror?

193
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:51,085
Yes!

194
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,588
An acquaintance of mine seems to have found something similar,

195
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,190
so I was thinking of going to that shop now.

196
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,792
Is that right?

197
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:59,494
Thanks.

198
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:00,995
It just has to be that mirror,

199
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:03,698
or I just can't seem to get myself into make-up mode.

200
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:07,302
Okay, I'll be on my way then, to go get it.

201
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,304
And...

202
00:12:09,304 --> 00:12:11,406
after I eat lunch, I'll catch some sleep,

203
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:14,409
so, don't wake me up, okay?

204
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,810
Yes, sir.

205
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,912
I had it out with boss last night,

206
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:21,883
and couldn't sleep because I was bothered about it.

207
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:24,786
Boss is here too, isn't he?

208
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,787
Yes.

209
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,090
I'm sure he's in the reception room on the second floor.

210
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,992
I'll be on my way then.

211
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:34,796
After I finish shooting, I want to go apologize.

212
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,197
Good idea.

213
00:12:45,106 --> 00:12:48,609
TV stations are so complicated

214
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,312
that it's hard to tell what's where.

215
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,715
I'll bet it's even hard to find the restroom.

216
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,383
It's like a labyrinth.

217
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,386
I think it's better to ask someone, after all.

218
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,788
I guess so.

219
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:15,703
Yes!

220
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,311
"Meeting Room"

221
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:24,812
You're early!

222
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:27,782
I thought the meeting was scheduled to start from 2:00?

223
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:29,684
Oh, it's you.

224
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,886
I'm sorry about last night.

225
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:43,398
Are you going to have a meeting at the TV station, Boss?

226
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:45,099
I want to have them use one of the actors of my company

227
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:48,803
as a regular on the new program, so I'm putting in a request.

228
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:53,708
Don't you have to take a program from 2:00 yourself too?

229
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,611
-Are you ready for it? -Yes.

230
00:13:56,611 --> 00:14:00,014
All I need is 30 minutes. That'll be more than enough.

231
00:14:01,682 --> 00:14:03,885
Right, about that matter...

232
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,188
I already refused.

233
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:08,890
I know you're not feeling good about it,

234
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,592
but I did so for your sake too.

235
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:14,295
Forget it, let's not talk about that.

236
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:18,299
By the way, what do you think of this raincoat?

237
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,203
It's light and water-proof.

238
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:24,405
And above all, it's cheap!

239
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,608
I guess it's good.

240
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:31,212
And, what I like most of all about it

241
00:14:31,212 --> 00:14:33,915
is when you pull the hood over your head like this...

242
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:49,597
It's a superb item that keeps blood

243
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,999
from splattering on your body.

244
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,091
"Satan Onizuka"

245
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,393
There it is!

246
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:12,295
Satan Onizuka.

247
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:14,197
I'm sure it's here.

248
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:15,898
Lucky you, Mitsuhiko!

249
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:16,999
Yes!

250
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,001
But I wonder if it'll be okay?

251
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,204
To just go in like that without an appointment.

252
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:24,006
Maybe he's going to scold us with that frightening face.

253
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,708
We'll be fine!

254
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,778
There are many people walking the corridor,

255
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,681
so if things start looking bad, we can call for help.

256
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,583
What? Why call for help?

257
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:37,486
Okay, I'm going to knock on the door then!

258
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:41,090
Hey!

259
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,491
No!

260
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:45,695
Satan is sleeping now.

261
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,297
He's sleeping?

262
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:51,701
Yes.

263
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,002
I'm going to sleep.

264
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:57,907
If I don't sleep, I can't build up my evil powers.

265
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,979
I... I'm sorry,

266
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,481
but if it's okay with you, may I have your autograph?

267
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:09,485
My... my older sister is a great fan of yours.

268
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,898
What's her name?

269
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,200
Asami.

270
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,003
The kanji character is "Asa" as in morning and "mi" as in beautiful!

271
00:16:27,003 --> 00:16:29,605
My follower, Asami.

272
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,110
Here you go!

273
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,481
Thank you very much!

274
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,283
So now, your older sister

275
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:42,885
is a member of our evil group.

276
00:16:45,488 --> 00:16:47,189
It's origami!

277
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:53,296
Hey, hey!

278
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:57,199
There're so many paper cranes!

279
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,601
You're right!

280
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:06,108
Did you fold all this, Satan?

281
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,678
Yeah. Sometimes, I do things that humans do

282
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:12,381
while I'm waiting.

283
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:15,584
All I got to fold today were those five though.

284
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,889
What's this ruler for?

285
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,390
Using a ruler

286
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,492
helps me fold the cranes neatly and nicely.

287
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:27,396
But a devil folding origami

288
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,398
is sort of image breaking, isn't it?

289
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:33,102
Yeah, that's why I tell all my followers

290
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,904
to keep it a secret.

291
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,606
I tell them that I'll curse them to death

292
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:39,909
if they let the word out!

293
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,480
Okay!

294
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,182
That's right, Satan.

295
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,584
I found the mirror you were looking for.

296
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,985
Well...

297
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,287
This is the one, right?

298
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,688
Here you go.

299
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:53,990
This is it, this!

300
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,491
With this, I'll be able to put on make-up

301
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,093
while I'm waiting in the dressing room.

302
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:59,695
-Thank you! -Not at all.

303
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:04,600
Is anything the matter?

304
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,901
Oh, no.

305
00:18:05,901 --> 00:18:08,304
It's just that my contacts slipped out of place a bit.

306
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:11,407
Why don't you come in?

307
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,908
Thank you.

308
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:15,077
Are you okay, Mitsuhiko?

309
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:17,179
You look nervous.

310
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,582
I... I'm fine.

311
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,787
That's right, and this.

312
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,789
I also got you eye drops.

313
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,290
You ran out, right?

314
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,093
Yeah, leave them there somewhere.

315
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,194
Okay.

316
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,601
"Tenpuku-tei"

317
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:40,102
"Eirinan"

318
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:41,904
"Janjanken"

319
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:45,007
The names on the shop of all these plates

320
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:48,010
are of different shops. Why?

321
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,982
Satan is particular when it comes to where he orders what food.

322
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:55,985
Well, I guess you can say that the food of humans

323
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:59,388
rarely suit my taste.

324
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:08,197
Police car?

325
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,899
An ambulance too.

326
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:14,503
I wonder if something happened near here.

327
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,580
It seems that something's happened here at the TV station.

328
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,082
-What? -Here at the TV station?

329
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,390
What the...

330
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,391
Yes?

331
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,895
I'm sorry.

332
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,297
We were just about to leave for the studio.

333
00:19:41,297 --> 00:19:44,600
Well, your boss...

334
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,104
Something terrible's happened to your boss!

335
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,407
Anyway! Please come. Come right away!

336
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,209
Please excuse me and open the way.

337
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,578
Satan? Satan Onizuka?

338
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:56,979
Excuse me!

339
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,380
Satan Onizuka!

340
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,187
-Satan? It's been a long time since I saw him last. -Excuse me!

341
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,390
This way, please.

342
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,097
Boss!

343
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,699
Boss...

344
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:26,008
Who on earth could've done such a thing?
