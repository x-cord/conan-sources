1
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:16,354
A bright step forward to a prosperous future.

2
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:18,454
My heart is of course prepared for what is to come!

3
00:00:18,454 --> 00:00:20,054
The stage today is at a TV station.

4
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,454
In a glamorous world of masks,

5
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,354
there is danger of real faces being exposed.

6
00:00:23,354 --> 00:00:24,854
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:26,554
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:28,054
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:07,254
"Devil at the TV Station".

10
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:17,154
-What? -What?

11
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,654
You mean the location that the TV station

12
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:20,454
was going on was cancelled?

13
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,554
No joke?

14
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:23,854
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:26,054
I was really looking forward to it.

16
00:02:26,054 --> 00:02:30,054
Yes. We thought we would be seeing...

17
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:33,554
-I'm so sorry. -a new Jocker monster.

18
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,854
I was looking forward to eating box lunch on location.

19
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:38,354
The staff member was an acquaintance of mine,

20
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:40,154
so I got to invite you over,

21
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:42,954
but they don't seem to be able to cope with spectators now.

22
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,754
So, I'm really so sorry!

23
00:02:44,754 --> 00:02:46,354
No, it's okay.

24
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:51,254
I'm so sorry.

25
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,254
Well, all's well

26
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:56,754
because we did get to specially come into the TV studio after all.

27
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,154
So, why don't we go look around here?

28
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,154
Right!

29
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,654
That's right!

30
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:05,054
I'll bet there're many famous people here!

31
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:08,154
I'd like to see the weather lady!

32
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,854
I'd like to see Toraya!

33
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,954
I want to see Yak!

34
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:17,554
Hey, a popular idol, Ms. Yoko Okino,

35
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:19,254
is right before your eyes.

36
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:22,354
Good morning, Yoko!

37
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:24,454
Good morning.

38
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,054
It's Ms. Kazuka Inoue! See.

39
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:28,154
Really!

40
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:30,254
The gourmet lady.

41
00:03:30,254 --> 00:03:31,454
"Kazuka Inoue" -Yoko.

42
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:33,954
Take it easy on me today, okay?

43
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,554
Same to you!

44
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:39,054
Her parents run a noodle shop, right?

45
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:40,654
I wonder if they serve eels over rice.

46
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,054
Oh, come on, Genta.

47
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:47,054
Kazuka Inoue, birthday May 13th.

48
00:03:47,054 --> 00:03:49,754
166 centimeters tall.

49
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:52,754
Good morning.

50
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:56,854
-Good morning! -Good morning.

51
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:59,754
"Azusa Yamamoto" -Good morning.

52
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:06,154
It's Ms. Azusa Yamamoto, Genta!

53
00:04:06,154 --> 00:04:09,154
Famous people here there and everywhere.

54
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:12,954
Yoko Okino, Kazuka Inoue, Azusa Yamamoto.

55
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,654
Hey, you guys...

56
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:32,954
But how lucky to see so many idols so soon!

57
00:04:32,954 --> 00:04:34,154
-Yep! -Right!

58
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:39,954
You all look familiar.

59
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:43,054
I think I've seen you somewhere before too.

60
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:48,454
You probably saw us in the papers or something!

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,254
Because we are...

62
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,454
-the Youth Detective Squad! -The Youth Detective Squad!

63
00:04:53,454 --> 00:04:55,654
-Youth Detective Squad? -Youth Detective Squad?

64
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:59,054
Right, we're the Youth Detective Squad!

65
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,854
We've arrested a lot of bad guys!

66
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:03,654
Yes!

67
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:04,854
Really?

68
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:06,954
Wow!

69
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:09,554
Well, it's really no big deal...

70
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:12,854
Conan here in particular is special.

71
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,954
He's a famous detective trained by Mr. Mouri.

72
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,854
You mean that famous Mr. Mouri?

73
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,054
Yes! Kogoro Mouri!

74
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:25,954
He's a great fan of mine!

75
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:27,454
Come to think of it,

76
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:30,154
he's well known for being a fan of yours.

77
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:32,854
I guess questions involving cases and deductions

78
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,954
are all yours, Yoko.

79
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:36,854
Not really!

80
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:38,954
What questions?

81
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:43,954
We're shooting a quiz program today.

82
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:45,054
All three of us

83
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,154
are challenging each other answering the questions.

84
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:51,654
I see. That's why you said to take it easy on you.

85
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:54,054
Yoko, forget that we're friends today.

86
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,354
I'm going to be a devil today

87
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,954
and I'm going to win no matter what!

88
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:01,254
What? Oh, no. A devil?

89
00:06:01,254 --> 00:06:02,654
A devil.

90
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,254
A devil, she says.

91
00:06:06,554 --> 00:06:08,954
What's the matter, Ayumi?

92
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:13,254
-It appeared! -It appeared!

93
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:20,854
So I'll bet you're the new monster

94
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:22,854
that's appearing in Kamen Yaiba?

95
00:06:24,354 --> 00:06:26,454
I'd say he's more like

96
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:29,954
the new executive of the evil organization rather than a monster.

97
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:34,154
He's the new boss! I'm sure he's the boss!

98
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:37,854
What's with you, Brats?

99
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:43,954
You mean you guys really don't know who I am?

100
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:45,654
-No. -No.

101
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:46,654
Nope.

102
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:51,754
I've really fallen to the pit.

103
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:56,654
Well, I guess you're not all that wrong in saying

104
00:06:56,654 --> 00:06:59,454
that I'm a monster that appears in Kamen Yaiba.

105
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:04,354
Good morning!

106
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:06,654
I wonder who he is?

107
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:08,554
I've never seen him before.

108
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,654
Neither have I.

109
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:14,654
He's the vocal for a rock group called Styx III.

110
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:16,654
Mr. Satan Onizuka!

111
00:07:16,654 --> 00:07:20,154
"Satan Onizuka (32), vocalist for Styx III"

112
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:24,154
I heard that he's going to be appearing on a variety show today.

113
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:29,354
A rock singer appearing on a variety show.

114
00:07:29,354 --> 00:07:32,054
I guess the world of devils is going through tough times too.

115
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,354
Onizuka? Satan.

116
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,154
Satan? Onizuka Satan?

117
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:40,754
Satan Onizuka?

118
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:43,154
What's up, Mitsuhiko?

119
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,654
It's nothing.

120
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:46,754
Satan Onizuka...

121
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,754
I've heard this name somewhere before, I think.

122
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:56,554
I remember!

123
00:07:56,554 --> 00:07:59,154
My older sister is Satan Onizuka's fan,

124
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,754
and she asked me to do her a favor!

125
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,854
She asked me to get his autograph for her

126
00:08:02,854 --> 00:08:05,154
if I get to see him at the TV station!

127
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:07,854
I've got to go after him right away and get his autograph!

128
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,454
But he seems to have gone some place already.

129
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:16,754
Talk about exaggerating.

130
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,254
Now, now.

131
00:08:18,254 --> 00:08:20,554
If we ask Yoko where his dressing room is,

132
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,254
I'm sure we can.

133
00:08:22,254 --> 00:08:23,754
Right, Yoko?

134
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,954
Huh? Where's Yoko?

135
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:35,154
Yoko was here just a second ago...

136
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:39,454
Oh, the AD came to get her just a while ago

137
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:41,054
saying that it was time for her to go on air.

138
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,454
He took the two challengers along too.

139
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:48,254
Well, I guess we'll just have to find her on our own.

140
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:49,954
True!

141
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:53,454
I mean we know that he's here in the TV station after all.

142
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:54,554
Yes!

143
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:57,254
Let's go look for him together!

144
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:00,154
"Satan Onizuka"

145
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,054
Huh?

146
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:09,554
Mr. Satan.

147
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:12,054
You're already here.

148
00:09:12,054 --> 00:09:16,154
I thought you were supposed to come in after noon?

149
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:20,154
Yeah, I came early because I had nothing to do.

150
00:09:20,154 --> 00:09:24,554
So, won't you order me a take out meal, manager?

151
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,654
I didn't have lunch yet.

152
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:29,154
Okay, no problem.

153
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:31,054
So, what would you like?

154
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:36,254
Tenpuku-tei's ramen and...

155
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:39,054
Tenpuku-tei's ramen.

156
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:41,454
Fried rice from Janjanken.

157
00:09:41,454 --> 00:09:44,254
Janjanken's fried rice and...

158
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:48,854
That's right, I want to eat Eirinan's dumplings.

159
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,054
Erinan's dumplings.

160
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:53,554
Ramen, fried rice, dumplings...

161
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:55,754
You mean you want all three dishes from a different shop?

162
00:09:55,754 --> 00:09:58,654
Since they are all Chinese dishes, why not order them from the same shop?

163
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:00,354
Who cares!

164
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:02,854
I want that certain dish from that certain shop!

165
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:06,254
Besides, I go to all three shops often to eat,

166
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,954
so I'm sure they'll bring my order even it's only one dish each.

167
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:12,654
By the way,

168
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,654
did you find that mirror?

169
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:16,054
Yes!

170
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:18,554
An acquaintance of mine seems to have found something similar,

171
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:21,154
so I was thinking of going to that shop now.

172
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,754
Is that right?

173
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,454
Thanks.

174
00:10:24,454 --> 00:10:25,954
It just has to be that mirror,

175
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,654
or I just can't seem to get myself into make-up mode.

176
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:32,254
Okay, I'll be on my way then, to go get it.

177
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,254
And...

178
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:36,354
after I eat lunch, I'll catch some sleep,

179
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:39,354
so, don't wake me up, okay?

180
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:40,754
Yes, sir.

181
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,854
I had it out with boss last night,

182
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:46,854
and couldn't sleep because I was bothered about it.

183
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,754
Boss is here too, isn't he?

184
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:50,754
Yes.

185
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:54,054
I'm sure he's in the reception room on the second floor.

186
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,954
I'll be on my way then.

187
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:59,754
After I finish shooting, I want to go apologize.

188
00:10:59,754 --> 00:11:01,154
Good idea.

189
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:13,554
TV stations are so complicated

190
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:16,254
that it's hard to tell what's where.

191
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:18,654
I'll bet it's even hard to find the restroom.

192
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,354
It's like a labyrinth.

193
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:23,354
I think it's better to ask someone, after all.

194
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:25,754
I guess so.

195
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:40,654
Yes!

196
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:48,254
"Meeting Room"

197
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,754
You're early!

198
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:52,754
I thought the meeting was scheduled to start from 2:00?

199
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,654
Oh, it's you.

200
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:56,854
I'm sorry about last night.

201
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:08,354
Are you going to have a meeting at the TV station, Boss?

202
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:10,054
I want to have them use one of the actors of my company

203
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:13,754
as a regular on the new program, so I'm putting in a request.

204
00:12:13,754 --> 00:12:18,654
Don't you have to take a program from 2:00 yourself too?

205
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,554
-Are you ready for it? -Yes.

206
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,954
All I need is 30 minutes. That'll be more than enough.

207
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:28,854
Right, about that matter...

208
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:32,154
I already refused.

209
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,854
I know you're not feeling good about it,

210
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,554
but I did so for your sake too.

211
00:12:36,554 --> 00:12:39,254
Forget it, let's not talk about that.

212
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:43,254
By the way, what do you think of this raincoat?

213
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,154
It's light and water-proof.

214
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:49,354
And above all, it's cheap!

215
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:52,554
I guess it's good.

216
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:56,154
And, what I like most of all about it

217
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,854
is when you pull the hood over your head like this...

218
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:14,554
It's a superb item that keeps blood

219
00:13:14,554 --> 00:13:16,954
from splattering on your body.

220
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,198
There're so many paper cranes!

221
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,598
You're right!

222
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:13,098
Did you fold all this, Satan?

223
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:15,698
Yeah. Sometimes, I do things that humans do

224
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:19,398
while I'm waiting.

225
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:22,598
All I got to fold today were those five though.

226
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,898
What's this ruler for?

227
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:28,398
Using a ruler

228
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:30,498
helps me fold the cranes neatly and nicely.

229
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,398
But a devil folding origami

230
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:36,398
is sort of image breaking, isn't it?

231
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:40,098
Yeah, that's why I tell all my followers

232
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,898
to keep it a secret.

233
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:44,598
I tell them that I'll curse them to death

234
00:15:44,598 --> 00:15:46,898
if they let the word out!

235
00:15:50,298 --> 00:15:51,498
Okay!

236
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:53,198
That's right, Satan.

237
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:55,598
I found the mirror you were looking for.

238
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,998
Well...

239
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,298
This is the one, right?

240
00:15:58,298 --> 00:15:59,698
Here you go.

241
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:00,998
This is it, this!

242
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,498
With this, I'll be able to put on make-up

243
00:16:02,498 --> 00:16:04,098
while I'm waiting in the dressing room.

244
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:06,698
-Thank you! -Not at all.

245
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:11,598
Is anything the matter?

246
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:12,898
Oh, no.

247
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:15,298
It's just that my contacts slipped out of place a bit.

248
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:18,398
Why don't you come in?

249
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:19,898
Thank you.

250
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:22,098
Are you okay, Mitsuhiko?

251
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,198
You look nervous.

252
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:26,598
I... I'm fine.

253
00:16:29,098 --> 00:16:31,798
That's right, and this.

254
00:16:31,798 --> 00:16:33,798
I also got you eye drops.

255
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:35,298
You ran out, right?

256
00:16:35,298 --> 00:16:38,098
Yeah, leave them there somewhere.

257
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,198
Okay.

258
00:16:44,098 --> 00:16:45,598
"Tenpuku-tei"

259
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,098
"Eirinan"

260
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:48,898
"Janjanken"

261
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:51,998
The names on the shop of all these plates

262
00:16:51,998 --> 00:16:54,998
are of different shops. Why?

263
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:59,998
Satan is particular when it comes to where he orders what food.

264
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:02,998
Well, I guess you can say that the food of humans

265
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:06,398
rarely suit my taste.

266
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,198
Police car?

267
00:17:15,198 --> 00:17:16,898
An ambulance too.

268
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:21,498
I wonder if something happened near here.

269
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,598
It seems that something's happened here at the TV station.

270
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:34,098
-What? -Here at the TV station?

271
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:41,398
What the...

272
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:42,398
Yes?

273
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:46,898
I'm sorry.

274
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,298
We were just about to leave for the studio.

275
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:51,598
Well, your boss...

276
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:55,098
Something terrible's happened to your boss!

277
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:58,398
Anyway! Please come. Come right away!

278
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:00,198
Please excuse me and open the way.

279
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:02,598
Satan? Satan Onizuka?

280
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:03,998
Excuse me!

281
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,398
Satan Onizuka!

282
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:12,198
-Satan? It's been a long time since I saw him last. -Excuse me!

283
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:15,398
This way, please.

284
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,098
Boss!

285
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:23,698
Boss...

286
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:32,998
Who on earth could've done such a thing?
