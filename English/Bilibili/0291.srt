1
00:00:00,324 --> 00:00:02,224
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,224 --> 00:00:04,024
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:05,924
It's summer, the ocean, and the islands!

4
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,924
Start of the case written on the sand.

5
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,624
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:11,524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:13,424
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:08,111
All right, then. That girl with short brown hair is next.

9
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:12,511
Her suit's dotted and kind of dull,

10
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,111
so how about the one in the dark one piece.

11
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:17,111
No, she's kind of chubby.

12
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:21,511
She is wearing that black bikini to make herself look thinner.

13
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:29,211
See, I told you. I win again.

14
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:34,011
You're not very good when it comes to solving this kind of mystery.

15
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:35,011
Shut up.

16
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,311
What are you two talking about?

17
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,911
Kazuha.

18
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:45,811
Ran.

19
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,511
Playing "Guess what's kind of swimsuit she's wearing"

20
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:50,711
with the little boy.

21
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,611
If your parents could see you now,

22
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,311
I'm sure they'd be crying their eyes out.

23
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,711
You don't understand.

24
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,611
This kid kept bugging me about it, I had no choice.

25
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:03,711
Heiji's really good.

26
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:04,711
He guessed right off

27
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:08,311
that you'd be wearing a tiger striped swimsuit, Kazuha!

28
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,611
Shut up!

29
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:14,211
Tiger striped? You call these tiger stripes?

30
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:17,211
This is a zebra print. Zebra.

31
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:19,711
What's the difference?

32
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:21,711
The only stripes that matter in Osaka are tiger stripes.

33
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:24,711
Yes, you're right.

34
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:26,111
Kazuha.

35
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:28,011
You're not mad at me

36
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:32,511
for making you wait in front of Big Man in Umeda, are you?

37
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:35,011
Don't be silly.

38
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:39,111
Why would I be mad at a stupid boy for making me wait four hours?

39
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,611
I'm not the least bit mad! Not one bit!

40
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:46,011
She's furious.

41
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:48,111
I don't blame her.

42
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:53,811
Just calm down, he invited you to Okinawa to make up for it, didn't he?

43
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:57,111
I'm not here because he invited me.

44
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,711
I only came here because your father brought me.

45
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,211
Your father, the Sleeping Kogoro.

46
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:04,111
Tomorrow's the big day, isn't it?

47
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,211
The battle of the best detectives from the East and West!

48
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:08,711
How do you feel? Are you confident you'll win?

49
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:10,811
Confident?

50
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:13,511
No one can be completely confident of anything.

51
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:17,611
All I'm certain of is, I, Kogoro Mouri will not lose to a kid from Osaka

52
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:21,611
who's still wet behind the ears, that much, I'm sure of.

53
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:29,211
The old fool.

54
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:36,711
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 1)"

55
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,811
Will all the staff gather round?

56
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,011
We're going to go check things out soon!

57
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:43,011
Check things out?

58
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:46,811
Yeah, we're going to check out the area on the island,

59
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:49,111
you and Mr. Mouri are going to tomorrow.

60
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,111
"Masao Taketomi (43)" -It's an uninhabited island,

61
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:53,911
a body and some strange words were found there.

62
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:57,611
You want to come along? Young detective from the East.

63
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,011
Might be interesting...

64
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:03,411
I might be cheating by taking a look around before them,

65
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,911
but if that Kudo helps the old man

66
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:07,711
and just by chance, he solves the mystery before me,

67
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,911
it's going to burn me up.

68
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,111
Okay, then. I'm going to go check things out with them!

69
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,411
Hey.

70
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:22,011
That's fine.

71
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:24,111
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:25,811
We're going to put our heads together

73
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,611
and solve the mystery in no time.

74
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,711
To show all the people in Osaka

75
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,711
that we're smarter than the detectives in Tokyo!

76
00:05:33,711 --> 00:05:36,711
But I'm from Tokyo.

77
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:41,411
Look, that's it!

78
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:45,311
That's Funaura Island where the unidentified body was found!

79
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,111
It's nicknamed Onikame Island.

80
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,711
Onikame Island?

81
00:05:48,711 --> 00:05:50,011
Take a look.

82
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,611
The tip of the island looks like a turtle's head, doesn't it?

83
00:05:55,311 --> 00:06:01,011
And then? So why are you and old Kogoro going there to solve a mystery?

84
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:04,711
I guess it's some sort of local event they came up with.

85
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,211
Mr. Kaneshiro's the mayor of that island we were just on,

86
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:11,711
he told me that members of his family have been kidnapped and robbed,

87
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,411
that's why the island has a bad reputation

88
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:15,911
and tourism has gone down the drain,

89
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:16,911
so he called the television station

90
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,811
and they came up with an idea to improve the island's image.

91
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:23,011
It seems the mayor owns that island, too.

92
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:25,911
I don't think solving the mystery behind a murder

93
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:29,011
is going to improve the island's image, though.

94
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:31,411
They're from the television station,

95
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:34,711
but Mr. Taketomi's the only one with television experience,

96
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:38,511
the others are locals who know this area well.

97
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:42,311
Where're you girls from?

98
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:43,811
Tokyo?

99
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:46,211
-Yes. -I'm from Osaka!

100
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:48,711
"Yoshizuki Kume (25)" -Then how about coming diving with us

101
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:50,311
after tomorrow's shoot?

102
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:54,011
"Noburou lkema (24)" -We live here so we know some great spots.

103
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,511
Oh no, no way!

104
00:06:56,411 --> 00:07:00,811
Their schedule's full for today, tomorrow and the day after.

105
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,411
You can't expect them to stick a tube in their mouth

106
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,811
and put fins on their feet to make them look like penguins

107
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:08,311
so that they can waste time staring at fish in the ocean with you guys!

108
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,411
Huh? Who the hell are you?

109
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,311
Is that kid your boyfriend or something?

110
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,911
I'm glad you asked that.

111
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,911
She's my...

112
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,611
I'm his...

113
00:07:20,611 --> 00:07:22,211
She's nothing

114
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,611
but just an old friend.

115
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:27,311
And she's a real pest, so you better not try anything with her!

116
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:31,811
He's not making a lot of sense...

117
00:07:31,811 --> 00:07:33,711
So what's your business then?

118
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:37,211
Why are you on this boat anyway? You're not part of the crew.

119
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:40,611
He's Heiji Hatton, the detective from the East.

120
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:44,811
"Yoshie Taira (26)" -He's one of the main guests,

121
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,511
he's Kogoro Mouri's opponent.

122
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,311
This kid?

123
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,611
But he's still just a kid.

124
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:53,211
That's what makes it so interesting!

125
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:56,011
The popular high school detective...

126
00:07:56,011 --> 00:07:58,711
challenges Kogoro Mouri. How's that?

127
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:03,211
I'm challenging that old fool?

128
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,611
Who cares about that?

129
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,011
Just do what you came here to do

130
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:11,011
and then let's get back as soon as possible.

131
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:13,011
"Mikihito Daito (47)" -They say that when it gets dark around here,

132
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:17,011
"guso's messenger" comes for the "mabui".

133
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,611
Right, captain?

134
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:23,511
"Takashi Shimoji (38), Crew"

135
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,811
Guso's messenger?

136
00:08:25,811 --> 00:08:28,011
Comes for the mabui?

137
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,011
"Guso" means the nether world,

138
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,111
and "mabui" means soul.

139
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,511
It's an old Okinawa legend.

140
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:39,611
When a woman is up all night whiling time away...

141
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:43,911
The messenger from the other world dressed in death's robes

142
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:47,011
rises silently from the ocean

143
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:50,211
and sucks her soul out, so they say.

144
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:57,211
You're giving me the creeps!

145
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,311
I was planning on going for a swim when we go to the island.

146
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:03,211
It's probably white.

147
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:08,211
That girl's swimsuit, I bet it's a white high leg cut.

148
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:10,811
Who cares?

149
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,811
Hey, captain! Don't make so much waves!

150
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:29,111
She's wearing a black wetsuit.

151
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,811
Huh? That's strange.

152
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:38,611
From what I've heard, this island...

153
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,211
Heiji!

154
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:42,911
The director's calling you!

155
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,111
You've got to get to work now.

156
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:46,711
Yeah. I know...

157
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:59,311
"The princess sleeps, not in B but in A".

158
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:03,411
Are you sure the body was found in front of this pillar

159
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:05,211
with the words carved?

160
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:06,411
That's right.

161
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:09,911
He was leaning against it, the words behind him.

162
00:10:09,911 --> 00:10:13,411
They found him a year ago, he died of starvation,

163
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,411
he hadn't eaten or drunk anything for who knows how long.

164
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:22,011
It was exactly a year ago that several big typhoons passed through here,

165
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:24,711
so everyone figured he was a crew member

166
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,811
from some shipwrecked ship and got washed up here,

167
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,611
that's what the locals told me.

168
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:33,911
These strange words puzzle me.

169
00:10:34,911 --> 00:10:38,311
By the way, who built this place?

170
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,911
This island's uninhabited. Who's place is this?

171
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:43,111
It's Mayor Kaneshiro's.

172
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:47,711
It seems he used to use it as a vacation house.

173
00:10:47,711 --> 00:10:49,811
It looks like he hasn't fixed it

174
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,411
the typhoon wrecked it, though.

175
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:54,411
I knew it was white.

176
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:59,611
You're right, it doesn't look Iike it did the last time I saw it.

177
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:02,611
I feel like I'm in another dimension.

178
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:07,211
You mean you come to this island a lot?

179
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,811
Yeah, until two years ago,

180
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:12,111
I used to look out at this from my ship.

181
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:15,711
The ocean around here's full of brown striped mackerel scad.

182
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:17,811
Brown striped mackerel scad?

183
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,911
You guys did too, didn't you?

184
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:24,711
Yeah. There's a great diving spot right at the tip of this island.

185
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:28,711
But ever since they found that body, nobody comes near here.

186
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,811
It gives them the creeps.

187
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:32,211
Oh, well,

188
00:11:32,211 --> 00:11:35,311
Heiji and I will be discussing things around here,

189
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:39,611
so you go look for other spooky areas on this island.

190
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:42,411
Look for something that you think will solve this mystery.

191
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,711
Okay.

192
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:46,511
What?

193
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:48,411
He doesn't make this show sound so serious.

194
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:51,111
I bet he doesn't believe in me.

195
00:11:53,611 --> 00:11:57,711
The princess sleeps, not in B but A.

196
00:11:58,711 --> 00:12:02,411
A and B probably refers to 1, 2 and 3.

197
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:07,111
That means "The princess is sleeping in number 1, not 2".

198
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:10,011
Hey, Kudo. You got any ideas?

199
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:12,011
No, nothing.

200
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,511
You sure you haven't figured it out already,

201
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:18,711
but you don't want to tell me cause you want to beat me?

202
00:12:18,711 --> 00:12:20,511
I wouldn't do that.

203
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:25,311
Listen, maybe it means the princess sleeping face is the prettiest?

204
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,311
Hey, wait.

205
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,611
Maybe it means

206
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:34,611
the princess who's usually pretty looks gross when she is sleeping?

207
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,111
That's not grossly impossible.

208
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:40,011
Hey! Pretty good!

209
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:43,111
Stop gabbing, ninnies!

210
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,011
Seriously!

211
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:49,011
Ms. Taira's late. I wonder where she is?

212
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,811
You're right.

213
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:55,411
It's been about an hour since the rest of us got back to the ship.

214
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:59,011
Do you think she's still diving?

215
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,311
It's possible.

216
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,511
-Wait up! -Heiji!

217
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:12,911
I'll search from this side up to the shore.

218
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,011
Okay. I'll take this side!

219
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,011
Hey, Miss Taira! Where are you?

220
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:22,411
Miss Taira! Miss Taira!

221
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:24,111
Hey!

222
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:40,411
Miss Taira.

223
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:41,611
Miss Taira!

224
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:45,111
"I am the 'guso's messenger'." (I Death's messenger)

225
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:54,562
What?

226
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:56,662
Miss Taira's been murdered?

227
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:58,362
I can't believe it.

228
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,062
You've got to be kidding!

229
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:04,262
She was killed about 2 hours ago.

230
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:07,262
She has strangled something like a thin rope.

231
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:13,062
She probably got those scratches on her arms and legs

232
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:17,062
when she struggled as she was being strangled.

233
00:14:17,062 --> 00:14:20,862
Which means the murderer killed her in the woods,

234
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:23,362
then carried her out her to the beach,

235
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,362
and ran away not too long ago

236
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:30,462
after leaving this weird message in the sand.

237
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:33,562
"I am the 'guso's messenger'"?

238
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:41,562
Hey, young detective.

239
00:14:41,562 --> 00:14:45,062
How do you know that the murderer ran away not too long ago?

240
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:46,862
It's easy!

241
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,662
Look over there!

242
00:14:48,662 --> 00:14:51,262
The sand's wet up till there.

243
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:55,962
That means the water was up to there during the high tide.

244
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:58,662
But the waves are just below the words now,

245
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:01,662
you'd have had to write them recently

246
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:04,762
when the tide was low or the waves would wash them away.

247
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:06,762
Let me also add that

248
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:09,662
this place is exactly on the other side of the boat landing.

249
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:14,462
We were all on the boat an hour ago waiting for her to get back.

250
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:17,062
This kid and I were the first to go look for her,

251
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:19,062
we split up and went around the island,

252
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:22,062
then we found her body, which means...

253
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:26,662
there's somebody else on this island besides us.

254
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:30,762
And that person strangled her to death.

255
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,262
No way.

256
00:15:32,262 --> 00:15:34,162
Somebody besides us?

257
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:37,762
Kazuha, you've got a digital camera, don't you?

258
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:41,062
Yes. I have it with me.

259
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,462
All right then, Kudo.

260
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:45,562
Let me have that glowing watch of yours and one side of your sandal.

261
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:49,962
I understand about the watch but why my sandal?

262
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,762
Oh, I get it.

263
00:15:51,762 --> 00:15:55,162
You needed something to show how big the words were.

264
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,462
I have to take a picture now

265
00:15:56,462 --> 00:16:01,062
or they'll get washed away at the next high tide.

266
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:06,162
Hey, what is this? You didn't need my watch.

267
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,962
I guess not.

268
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:11,162
Okay then, let's carry her body back to the boat

269
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:12,662
before she gets washed out to sea.

270
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:14,862
Okay.

271
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:19,362
Who'd want to kill her though?

272
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:23,262
Maybe there's something in the ocean?

273
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:25,262
Something inside the ocean?

274
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:30,462
You remember, she went snorkeling as soon as she got to this island.

275
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:32,562
I'm sure there's something there

276
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:35,062
for her to be so dead set on diving here.

277
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,562
What do you think they mean?

278
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:41,362
I don't know, but I think it'd be better if we went back to the boat now

279
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:44,262
and wait for daylight before we investigate.

280
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:48,262
I knew he'd say that.

281
00:16:48,262 --> 00:16:50,462
Hey, what'd you done that for?

282
00:16:51,862 --> 00:16:52,962
I don't believe him.

283
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:55,062
He threw my sandal knowing I'd see him and try to stop him.

284
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:58,262
Somebody stop Heiji!

285
00:16:58,262 --> 00:17:00,062
He's going to go into the ocean!

286
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:02,962
So what? He's just going for a swim.

287
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:06,662
But the key to the murder's in the ocean?

288
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:08,762
That kid's got guts!

289
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,662
The current around here is fast and to dive at night is reckless,

290
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:17,862
even a professional diver could end up losing his life.

291
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,062
What?

292
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:24,762
I'm pretty sure it was around here.

293
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:27,762
Heiji, don't do it!

294
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:30,162
It's dangerous!

295
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:32,762
Heiji!

296
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,462
What's that?

297
00:17:38,462 --> 00:17:42,662
There's something black down there.

298
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,662
That's...

299
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:47,362
an anchor?

300
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:56,562
Heiji!

301
00:17:57,562 --> 00:17:59,562
Heiji!

302
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:04,862
There he is!

303
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,562
Heiji.

304
00:18:06,562 --> 00:18:08,862
Hey, you swim pretty fast!

305
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:11,162
The current swept me away, you fool!

306
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:14,062
What? You mean you knew the current around here was fast?

307
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:15,662
Yeah.

308
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,562
Remember what those guys said?

309
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,562
About there is a lot of brown striped mackerel scads around here.

310
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,062
Well, they're migratory fish

311
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:25,462
that swim in waters where there's a fast current

312
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:29,162
and there were a lot of seagulls flying around trying to get the fish.

313
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:34,762
Is that why you rushed out to look for Miss Taira?

314
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:35,962
That's right.

315
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:39,362
I figured that if she was still diving at that time,

316
00:18:39,362 --> 00:18:42,862
she might've been carried out to sea.

317
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:48,762
But Heiji, you try too hard to look good!

318
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:52,262
You dummy! I just wanted to solve this case as soon as possible.

319
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:53,762
Yeah, sure!

320
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:58,362
I'm sure Heiji wouldn't be so sneaky and cheat

321
00:18:58,362 --> 00:19:00,962
by getting as much information possible beforehand

322
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:03,162
so that he can beat Uncle Kogoro tomorrow.

323
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:05,862
You know me. I wouldn't do that.

324
00:19:07,462 --> 00:19:11,462
Anyway, let's take Miss Taira's body back to the cruiser first,

325
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:12,862
then talk things over.

326
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:15,162
Where did you say you were taking the body?

327
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:17,062
You heard me. I said the cruiser...

328
00:19:18,962 --> 00:19:22,562
-What? -The cruiser's gone!

329
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:29,462
Hey, do you think that captain panicked

330
00:19:29,462 --> 00:19:31,162
when he heard somebody got killed and left us here?

331
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:35,162
Fool! The only ones who know it was murder are us,

332
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:37,162
we're the ones who found the body.

333
00:19:37,162 --> 00:19:40,662
Then maybe he's the murderer.

334
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,462
After we all left to look for Miss Taira,

335
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:45,462
he took the cruiser and got ahead of us,

336
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:49,562
carried her body out to the beach and wrote those words.

337
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:51,462
Impossible.

338
00:19:51,462 --> 00:19:55,762
Conan and I were scouring the shoreline at that time.

339
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:59,362
We'd have noticed if the cruiser went past us.

340
00:20:00,362 --> 00:20:02,262
It doesn't matter anyway.

341
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:07,162
It seems that the captain holds the key to this crime.

342
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:10,962
Well, anyway.

343
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:14,362
We just have to wait for someone to come rescue us.

344
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:16,162
Yes, you're right.

345
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:19,462
When the TV station realizes their staff hasn't returned by nightfall,

346
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:22,362
I'm sure they'll come looking.

347
00:20:22,362 --> 00:20:24,762
Don't hold your breath.

348
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:29,762
We weren't supposed to come here until tomorrow.

349
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:33,362
We were having such a hard time getting the boat and setting things up,

350
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:35,762
so we decided to come here today instead,

351
00:20:35,762 --> 00:20:37,162
and we didn't tell the producer.

352
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:38,462
You've got to be kidding!

353
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:42,562
Are you telling me no one knows we're on this deserted island?

354
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:44,162
Yeah.

355
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:47,362
I told them we'd get everything done tomorrow.

356
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:52,462
I just hope you and that captain didn't plan this

357
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:54,462
to bring the ratings up!

358
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,962
Of course, not.

359
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:59,262
Don't worry. Everything will be fine!

360
00:20:59,262 --> 00:21:01,762
I'm sure Ran's father will notice we're not back,

361
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:04,862
he'll come looking for us.

362
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:07,162
Let's wait inside that house!

363
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:25,062
Boy, this "awamori" is the best!

364
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:26,162
Yes.

365
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:30,262
It is this is a well cured sake, I ordered it special so you'd relax

366
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:34,162
and your wits would be sharpened for tomorrow's match.

367
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,562
"Hyougo Kaneshiro (63)" -I'll be counting on you

368
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:38,962
to solve the mystery tomorrow, Detective Mouri.

369
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:44,462
Whatever the outcome, I'll be prepared for it.

370
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:49,662
I wonder what's keeping that Hattori fellow,

371
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:51,362
your daughter and the others?

372
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:54,462
Oh, you don't have to worry about them.

373
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:58,862
He probably doesn't want to face me the night before the match.

374
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,662
That seems pretty immature.

375
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:05,062
Let's forget about those kids,

376
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:08,662
I intend to drink until morning and sharpen my wits!

377
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:12,162
Here's to my victory!

378
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:22,562
I think we're in a lot of trouble here.

379
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:24,162
I think so, too.

380
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:09,762
"Next episode" -This is interesting.

381
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:12,462
Look at this tea cup.

382
00:24:12,462 --> 00:24:16,262
It looks somebody used it as an ashtray.

383
00:24:16,262 --> 00:24:18,862
The cigarette's not an expensive brand

384
00:24:18,862 --> 00:24:23,062
and the water at the bottom of the cup isn't completely dry yet.

385
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:27,062
Yeah. There might have been several of them.

386
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:29,562
I'm talking about the messengers of death.

387
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:31,562
Next Conan,

388
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:35,762
"Princess of the Island and the Dragon King's Palace (Part 2)"

389
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,647
Next Conan's Hint:

390
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:40,947
"Automatic Pilot"

391
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,147
The next episode will present us with another mystery.

392
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,447
You can leave that to me!

393
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:45,447
So you say but you seem to be having a very hard time.
