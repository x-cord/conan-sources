1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,970
We arrive at the shooting site of a zombie movie.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,770
That place is rumored to be a place where zombies appear.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,570
Hattori and Kazuha also come to the site to verify the rumor.

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,570
On top of that,

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,770
the staff and cast that are involved in the zombie movie sequel arrive too.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,570
However, in the midst of the shooting,

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,370
the producer, Mr. Takashi Harawaki, dies.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,270
Since a video of Mr. Harawaki drinking poison

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,870
and a sentence that could be taken as a will were found in his cell phone,

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,370
it was concluded that he had committed suicide but...

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,770
What bothers me more is what was written on the top of the sentence.

12
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,670
Joji Naito.

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,870
Who is he anyway?

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,170
He was the president of the horror club

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,870
that we belonged to at the university!

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,770
And at the same time, he was my younger brother.

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,770
"Tetsuto Naito (38)" -The way he died was really strange.

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,870
Maybe it influenced Harawaki.

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,570
And? How'd he die?

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,370
Why don't we make this movie a mystery movie instead of a horror movie?

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,970
You're the one who suggested we shoot a zombie movie, right?

22
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,370
It's not that there'll be no zombies.

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,870
The twist will be that the real murderer isn't a zombie,

24
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,070
but a living human!

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,370
"Joji Naito" -If you think it's impossible,

26
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,370
I'll disappear from this room right now,

27
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,770
like a corpse that has returned to life as a zombie!

28
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,170
He told us to wait ten minutes.

29
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,870
So Ninomiya went outside to stand guard watching the window.

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,270
After ten minutes, we re-entered the room,

31
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,170
"Orie Baisho (29)" -we found that the president had really disappeared!

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,570
He had completely vanished!

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,570
And we thought that maybe he went out through the window

34
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,670
while Ria and Ninomiya were going over to the window from outside.

35
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,070
So we searched the forest, but he was nowhere in sight.

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,970
"Kyoko Ejiri (30)" -Since we were calling the president's name

37
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,970
until our throats got parched,

38
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,270
we wanted to go get a beer.

39
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,770
So we decide to forget the president for now

40
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,270
and go to town to drink some beer on Harawaki's car!

41
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,570
Then Ria caught a cold and had to stay in bed for three days.

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,270
And when we returned to the villa on the morning of the fourth day...

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,470
A canvas stained black with crime.

44
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color.

45
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,870
The chief turns into a zombie.

46
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,170
Those guys close in on the villa of mysteries!

47
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

48
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,970
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

49
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,170
His name is Detective Conan!

50
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:29,928
"The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 2)"

51
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,528
So?

52
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:38,328
How long has it been since your brother died?

53
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:42,228
We were told it's been about half a day.

54
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,328
The only strange thing was that

55
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:46,028
the fingernails of both my brother's hands

56
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,928
seemed as if they had scratched something really hard and come off,

57
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:53,528
but there were no scratch marks anywhere in the room.

58
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:57,828
Don't tell me that one of you here killed Joji

59
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:00,728
and moved his body over here?

60
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:03,228
Why would we do something like that?

61
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:05,028
Before we found the body,

62
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:09,728
we all went to Ria's condo to take care of her.

63
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:11,428
True.

64
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:16,528
Well, but I had a whole bunch of rare horror DVDs at home,

65
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:18,228
"Ria Kawabata (29)" -so, everybody was drinking and living it up,

66
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:21,128
while saying they were taking care of me though.

67
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:26,528
Well, the only one who could among us was Harawaki.

68
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:29,428
But he was wasted after drinking for a successive three days.

69
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,028
Wait up!

70
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,228
You mean the only one who could drive

71
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,828
was Mr. Harawaki who committed suicide?

72
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:37,028
Yes, that's right.

73
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:38,228
No good!

74
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:42,128
We can't go call the police then, even if a person died!

75
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:43,828
What? Why not?

76
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:47,728
Why not go to the police on the motorbike we came on!

77
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,528
I know!

78
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:53,028
But, the gas tank of that motorbike is practically empty!

79
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:54,528
No!

80
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,128
Didn't you realize that it was empty?

81
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:58,628
Then, why don't we call the police using our cell phones

82
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,028
and ask them to come?

83
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:01,828
This place is out of service range.

84
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,828
What?

85
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:07,428
Then, we'll just have to wait for Ran's Dad to recover.

86
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:09,828
Yeah.

87
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:13,328
And what happened to that movie?

88
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:15,828
It wasn't completed.

89
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:18,828
The data of that film also went missing.

90
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:22,628
Well, if the whereabouts of the data can be found then,

91
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:26,328
maybe the mystery of Harawaki's suicide can be solved too.

92
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:28,028
What do you mean by mystery?

93
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:30,528
Do you know something, Kyoko?

94
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:32,828
I can't tell you yet.

95
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:35,928
I'll talk about it after the police get here.

96
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,928
Because after all, I may be mistaken.

97
00:06:42,228 --> 00:06:44,028
Hey, Ran.

98
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,828
Will you come to the restroom with me?

99
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:47,128
Okay.

100
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:52,028
I was thinking of asking you the same thing too, Kazuha.

101
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:56,228
I wish they'd cut out talking about something so horrific.

102
00:06:56,228 --> 00:06:58,028
It really sounds like zombies would appear.

103
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:00,128
Come on.

104
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:06,628
Hey, Kazuha.

105
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:10,428
Is there something behind, us?

106
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:12,628
No way.

107
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:14,928
Zombie...

108
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:22,028
Dad?

109
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:25,128
It's your Dad, Ran.

110
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,928
Don't scare us, Dad.

111
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:34,928
There are zombies around the house.

112
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:38,328
-Zombies? -Zombies?

113
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:39,628
That's ridiculous.

114
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:44,128
You're probably feverish and thought you saw them?

115
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:47,228
Come on. You're sick so stay in bed, will you?

116
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:58,128
Hey, Pops. Have you recovered yet?

117
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:04,328
We need you to drive or our hands are tied!

118
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:06,428
Heiji, he can't. Not yet!

119
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:10,128
He ate poison mushroom, you know?

120
00:08:10,128 --> 00:08:14,028
By the way, outside... Look outside.

121
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,828
No! Dad! You can't go outside yet.

122
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:19,428
He's got to stay in bed a while longer.

123
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:22,928
I guess we're going to have to spend the night here.

124
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:23,928
What?

125
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:26,728
We haven't eaten dinner, you know?

126
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:28,728
I'm starving!

127
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:31,428
I hear there's a convenience store

128
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,028
about a three hour walk down the mountains from here!

129
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:36,028
-Really? -If we ask to use the phone there,

130
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:38,528
we could probably contact the police as well as call an ambulance.

131
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:41,728
It seems to be a store that they frequented

132
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:44,128
when they came to film movies for their university festival.

133
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:45,628
Really?

134
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:47,828
But, how interesting that

135
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,628
all the members back then of the horror research club

136
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:53,628
are now the staff of movie.

137
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:54,928
You heard, haven't you?

138
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:58,828
That back then the younger brother of Directior Naito died?

139
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:02,628
And it seems that that's why the director invited everybody,

140
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:07,628
suggesting to complete the movie that his brother had been working on!

141
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:11,428
He said that he found the script for the university festival at home.

142
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:15,028
That script that he changed from a horror story to a mystery?

143
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:16,228
No, no.

144
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:18,728
It seems it was the script that he had upgraded

145
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:20,828
before turning it into a mystery!

146
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,528
Since the movie turned out to be more of a hit than expected,

147
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,928
the director said that he decided to make a sequel,

148
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:29,628
and thus got everybody together!

149
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:34,328
Although they came here to make a preview of a zombie movie this time,

150
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:36,028
it actually turned out they are making a trailer

151
00:09:36,028 --> 00:09:39,328
of the sequel of the first movie that will be coming up.

152
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,928
But it's kind of scary going down the mountain

153
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:43,228
to the convenience store, don't you think so?

154
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:44,828
It feels like zombies may appear.

155
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:45,928
Don't worry.

156
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,228
Because there are no such things as zombies!

157
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:50,428
Zombies...

158
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:53,228
There are zombies around the house.

159
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:54,428
Don't be silly.

160
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:58,328
Open both eyes of yours and take a good look!

161
00:09:58,328 --> 00:09:59,528
There are no...

162
00:10:03,628 --> 00:10:05,128
What the heck are they?

163
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:10,928
What are the group of zombies doing here?

164
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:13,728
The entire villa is surrounded by them!

165
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:21,028
Kazuha, you take Ran and Pops and go upstairs!

166
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:23,228
But, Heiji...

167
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,728
Don't worry!

168
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,628
I won't let even one of them get upstairs!

169
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,728
Okay.

170
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:34,128
You folks hurry upstairs too!

171
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:42,428
Darn it! This is all we have!

172
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:43,428
A microphone?

173
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:44,528
That's right.

174
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:45,928
I'm sure that in there.

175
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:49,128
Hey, Hattori!

176
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:53,528
This is bad! They broke through the window and came in!

177
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:15,128
Anybody who attacks, I will see as an enemy.

178
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:20,728
If you wanna die, come take me on!

179
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,295
Dad, get a hold of yourself!

180
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:34,595
Let's go inside that room.

181
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,595
-No way. -No good!

182
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:39,995
The corpse is in here!

183
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:01,995
Darn it. How many of them are there anyway?

184
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:14,495
Sorry, Kudo.

185
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,395
But, we can't go on like this.

186
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:21,195
Yeah. I know.

187
00:12:21,195 --> 00:12:23,095
In times like this,

188
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:26,195
all we have to do is beat the boss to silence the rest.

189
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:30,895
It's that one!

190
00:12:30,895 --> 00:12:33,495
The brawny big one over there!

191
00:12:33,495 --> 00:12:35,595
I'll bet you're the boss, right?

192
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:44,395
I killed him!

193
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,995
Kudo, what shall I do?

194
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,795
Look, Hattori!

195
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,395
That's guy's moving despite his head being chopped off!

196
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,595
What?

197
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:57,995
I thought they were a band of robbers pretending to be zombies

198
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:00,195
but if they really are zombies,

199
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:03,595
I guess I've got no choice but to send them all to underworld!

200
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:05,495
Hold it.

201
00:13:05,495 --> 00:13:06,495
What?

202
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:09,095
It's not what we were told.

203
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:11,695
I got this head fixed and now it's...

204
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,795
No good!

205
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:19,595
An audition for extras?

206
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:20,895
-Yeah. -Yes.

207
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,795
Are you all extras?

208
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:24,595
Yes. I guess

209
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,595
We were told that if we passed,

210
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:28,395
we could act in the sequel of "Zombie Blade".

211
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:32,295
Come to think of it,

212
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,395
I've heard of some guy, who in order to save on movie making budget,

213
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:37,995
had the fans put on make-up for themselves and did an audition.

214
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:40,695
You mean the Halloween Party on the Ship.

215
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,195
It was tough, you know!

216
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:46,595
We had to put up tents in the forest

217
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:48,995
and help each other put on make-up.

218
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,595
We had to wait while being bitten by mosquitoes and all,

219
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:53,495
until the time of the audition which started at 8 pm!

220
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:55,595
I set up my tent for three days!

221
00:13:55,595 --> 00:14:01,495
I tried to rehearse my part with a couple who came on pilgrimage,

222
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:04,095
I was run over by a car and on top of that my head broke off.

223
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,095
I spent two days fixing my head, you know?

224
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,695
What're you going to do about it?

225
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:10,495
So, it was him.

226
00:14:10,495 --> 00:14:13,095
The zombie who scared the couple.

227
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:16,995
And? Who planned this audition?

228
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:19,595
The producer, Mr. Harawaki!

229
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,195
The man who committed suicide?

230
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,295
He uploaded on his blog.

231
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:28,495
It said, "Zombies, come gather because I'll be doing an audition."

232
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:32,595
It was on a secret page that only core fans are aware of.

233
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,395
He said not to publicize it

234
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:37,495
because he wants to surprise the director and staff.

235
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:40,595
Mr. Harawaki was supposed to appear at an appropriate moment

236
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:42,595
and disclose that it was a surprise.

237
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:44,295
What's going on anyway?

238
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:45,995
Hey, Hattori.

239
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:50,495
Would somebody who was planning such a surprise commit suicide?

240
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:51,495
No.

241
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:54,395
If so, then maybe that suicide actually was...

242
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:02,395
It seems like some extras broke through the second floor window too.

243
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:06,295
I tell you, talk about a pain in the butt.

244
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:08,995
Kazuha! They're not zombies.

245
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,495
Heiji...

246
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:13,395
Ms. Kyoko is bleeding from the neck.

247
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,895
She won't answer us.

248
00:15:14,895 --> 00:15:16,395
She's not moving at all!

249
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,595
-What? -What?

250
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:22,995
Kyoko? Get a hold of yourself!

251
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,395
Kyoko?

252
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,095
Move! Don't touch her!

253
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,295
No good. She's gone.

254
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:34,695
Her carotid artery is slashed.

255
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:38,795
Ran, ask the zombies downstairs to get the police.

256
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:40,695
Zombies?

257
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,995
Because I'm sure some of them came by car.

258
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,695
Okay. Zombies...

259
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,095
What was the situation when you found the corpse?

260
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:51,395
We were all in separate rooms.

261
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:54,395
But, we decided it was safer to stick together.

262
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:57,295
We were looking for Kyoko and came to this room.

263
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:59,195
And that's how we found her.

264
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:05,595
Is this cell phone on the chair Kyoko's?

265
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,395
Yes.

266
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:12,895
Just like Mr. Harawaki's, this one's recording too.

267
00:16:12,895 --> 00:16:13,895
What?

268
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:20,695
Don't tell me that the perpetrator is there?

269
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:25,295
The first one to enter the frame is Kyoko.

270
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:28,995
It seems like she's being chased by someone.

271
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:32,095
Then someone's coming in.

272
00:16:32,095 --> 00:16:33,995
No, stay away!

273
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,595
He bit her neck!

274
00:16:38,595 --> 00:16:41,595
It's hard to tell who it is, since his back is turned.

275
00:16:41,595 --> 00:16:42,995
Hey, look this way!

276
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,895
Yeah, that's the way keep going.

277
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:45,895
What?

278
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,095
No.

279
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:52,895
Was that Harawaki?

280
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:53,995
It's impossible!

281
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:56,995
He committed suicide, didn't he?

282
00:16:56,995 --> 00:16:58,195
Heiji?

283
00:16:58,195 --> 00:16:59,595
No way!

284
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:02,895
A dead person can never come back to life.

285
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:10,595
The corpse is gone.

286
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:12,995
No way! When I can here with Ran a while ago,

287
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:15,595
it was lying here with a sheet over it.

288
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:17,695
-Really? -Really!

289
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,895
What on earth's...

290
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,595
Going on, anyway?

291
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,395
What? The corpse vanished?

292
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:35,095
Yeah. As you can see.

293
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,595
The only thing left in the room is the sheet that was over the corpse,

294
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,895
the top that Kyoko was wearing before she was killed

295
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,395
and the blood stained cutter-knife.

296
00:17:45,395 --> 00:17:47,495
That cutter-knife.

297
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:50,395
I think it was in the tool box.

298
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,795
Why is there blood on it?

299
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,795
It's probably the weapon that the perpetrator used

300
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,995
to slash Kyoko's neck and kill her.

301
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,195
What?

302
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:02,595
Wasn't Kyoko bitten on the neck?

303
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:03,695
No!

304
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:05,995
By the looks of what was taken on the cell phone,

305
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:08,095
it looked like her neck was being bitten off

306
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:10,495
but she was actually slashed with a knife.

307
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:14,795
It's obvious just by looking at the wound of the carotid artery

308
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:17,395
The question is, who for what and why the perpetrator

309
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:20,895
put Kyoko's cell phone up on the chair that way

310
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:23,295
and took of video of something like that.

311
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,295
"Masahachi Ninomiya (29)" -Isn't it Harawaki?

312
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:28,295
Didn't he want to video tape himself

313
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:31,495
after reviving as a zombie and killing Kyoko?

314
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:32,595
Idiot!

315
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:36,195
What makes you think that a dead person can revive so easily?

316
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:38,595
That video is a trick of some kind!

317
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:41,095
Trick?

318
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:44,195
Yeah. Talking about trick, there's one more.

319
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:48,695
Hey, you guys.

320
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:53,195
Did anybody come out of this window or drop something?

321
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:54,395
What?

322
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:57,695
We were waiting here from about an hour ago.

323
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:00,995
But nobody opened that window.

324
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:02,895
Hey, Hattori!

325
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:06,895
There's a window at the dead end of the corridor, right?

326
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,695
-Yeah. -I heard from a zombie

327
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:13,895
that climbed up to the window and looked into the house,

328
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:16,795
but he doesn't remember who went into which room

329
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:20,895
but there was nobody who carried a corpse out!

330
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,395
It seems that nobody went out this window either.

331
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:29,995
Which means Mr. Harawaki's corpse is...

332
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:31,595
Yeah.

333
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:36,095
Hidden in somewhere in this room by someone!

334
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:39,395
Okay then, let's all split up and search the room!

335
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:42,495
First, let's start with this wardrobe!

336
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:45,195
I'll help with the wardrobe too, then.

337
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,395
I guess so.

338
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,995
We've got to move it to find out

339
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:52,295
if there's a hidden door behind it or not.

340
00:19:52,295 --> 00:19:54,495
Will you look under the bed, sonny?

341
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,595
Okay!

342
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,995
This bed is built-in.

343
00:19:57,995 --> 00:19:58,995
Yeah!

344
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:02,595
So there might be a hidden aisle or something under it too.

345
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:07,895
What? What's the matter, Orie?

346
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,795
No. It's nothing.

347
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,095
Why?

348
00:20:15,095 --> 00:20:17,495
Why isn't the corpse anywhere?

349
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:21,195
The only thing in the drawer is Harawaki's jacket.

350
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:26,295
There seems to be nothing like a hidden door behind the wardrobe either.

351
00:20:26,295 --> 00:20:28,995
It seems all clear under the bed too.

352
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,795
Nothing in the mattress either!

353
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,395
That's impossible.

354
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:36,095
It's got to be somewhere.

355
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:38,395
It... It disappeared.

356
00:20:38,395 --> 00:20:40,695
Just like the president did eight years ago,

357
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:43,695
he turned into a zombie and left the room!

358
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:51,095
Wait...

359
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:54,495
I guess you didn't know

360
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:56,895
since you and Ninomiya went outside to guard the window,

361
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:57,995
but eight years ago,

362
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:00,395
I, along with Harawaki and Kyoko

363
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:02,795
searched every nook and cranny in this room!

364
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:06,095
What? Which means this room is...

365
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:07,795
Yes, that's right!

366
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:09,495
The room that the chief vanished from

367
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,795
and was found dead four days later.

368
00:21:12,795 --> 00:21:15,395
It was this room!

369
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:18,595
Who was the first to discover the corpse back then?

370
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,495
Kyoko and Ria!

371
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:23,795
Back then they said that they would go search the second floor,

372
00:21:23,795 --> 00:21:27,395
and then a while later we heard Ria scream.

373
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:30,195
So we all rushed over to find Ria on her rear end

374
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:33,495
with Kyoko standing dumbstruck behind her.

375
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:35,195
Does it bug you that I was on my rear end?

376
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:38,995
I mean a person who vanished reappeared before me as a corpse, you know?

377
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,995
Talk of vanishing,

378
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:43,395
the cart went missing back then too.

379
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:44,695
Cart?

380
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:49,595
Yes. A small cart measuring about 60 x 30 cm

381
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:51,795
that was used for carrying equipment vanished.

382
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:52,995
Come to think of it,

383
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,195
I lent my younger brother a lot of things

384
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,195
because he said he was going to make a movie

385
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:59,795
but that's the only thing he didn't return.

386
00:21:59,795 --> 00:22:01,095
Somebody said that

387
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:06,395
maybe the cart was used to carry the chief's body to the room.

388
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:11,795
But that cart was gone from even before the chief disappeared.

389
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:15,295
Eight years ago, a person suddenly vanishes

390
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:19,095
and reappears as a corpse in the same room.

391
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,795
Then this time the corpse vanishes

392
00:22:20,795 --> 00:22:25,695
and a person is killed by that corpse.

393
00:22:25,695 --> 00:22:29,595
As expected...

394
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:33,095
-There is something in this room. -There's something in this room.

395
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:56,995
"Next Episode" -There's nothing to worry about anymore

396
00:23:56,995 --> 00:23:58,595
now that monster hunter Yamamura is here for you.

397
00:23:58,595 --> 00:23:59,995
What're you doing?

398
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:01,595
The corpse is upstairs.

399
00:24:01,595 --> 00:24:03,895
Did you figure out who the perpetrator is too, Conan?

400
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:08,395
No! I'm just helping Heiji out!

401
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:11,195
But, isn't Harawaki the perpetrator?

402
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,195
Yeah!

403
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:15,695
Because there was a video of him attacking Kyoko, right?

404
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:18,395
The proof is right there on the monitor!

405
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:24,379
Next Conan, "The Villa Surrounded by Zombies (Part 3)"

406
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,838
Next Conan's Hint:

407
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:29,438
"Toilet paper"

408
00:24:29,438 --> 00:24:31,338
The Gunma Prefectural Police arrive in the next episode.

409
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:32,438
It's Inspector Yamamura.

410
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,138
-Bummers! -We've got to solve the case quickly.
