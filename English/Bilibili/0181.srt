1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,740
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,740
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,540
Flowers hold deep meaning behind them.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,640
Time is no obstacle for songs or the will to kill.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,240
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,390
We got a request for a job from Yoshinori Kana,

9
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,190
chairman of the Kana Amusement Group.

10
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,690
He asks us to attend a party and protect his wife, Misaki,

11
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,290
who is being stalked by someone.

12
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,690
There is a black out during the party.

13
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,590
Misaki is attacked in her room.

14
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,890
Suspicion falls on Gerald Tenma, the main guest of the party.

15
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,090
However, Gerald Tenma himself is killed.

16
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,690
"Nocturne of Red Will to Kill (Part 2)"

17
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,190
The murder weapon is the sword of the knight.

18
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,790
A tuning fork used for tuning the piano.

19
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,990
I wonder what this scratch is.

20
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,890
And, why is the piano chair over here?

21
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,490
It's stuck under the large sofa.

22
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,590
You stay put!

23
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,790
Please move over to the waiting room

24
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,290
so that we can keep the scene of the murder as is.

25
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,390
Gerald.

26
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,090
Yoshinori, are you the one who killed Mr.Tenma?

27
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,690
No, I didn't.

28
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,990
I was in the waiting room. Right here.

29
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,290
Tenma ignored me and went alone into the piano room.

30
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,390
Without a choice,

31
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,490
just as I was about to sit in the chair,

32
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,990
I heard a thump and a scream, so I went to look,

33
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,990
and found Tenma dead!

34
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,190
But, back then, everyone else was in the large reception room downstairs.

35
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,790
That's right, Yoshinori.

36
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,890
Of all things, what a thing to do?

37
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,390
I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

38
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,490
You didn't like the fact

39
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,390
that I decided on this whole thing on my own in the first place.

40
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,690
So, when you found out that Misaki and Mr. Tenma

41
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,090
used to go with each other in the past,

42
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,490
you were enraged, weren't you?

43
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,490
Well, that's...

44
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,990
So, the Kana family is finished.

45
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,690
It's too bad, chairman.

46
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,890
I wonder who is going to be

47
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,390
taking over the Kana Amusement Group from now on?

48
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,290
I'm innocent.

49
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,590
And, did you see the killer?

50
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,390
Well...

51
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,790
when I got there, there was already no one there.

52
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,490
When we were guided there by Misaki,

53
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,790
the lid of the piano was closed, wasn't it?

54
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,290
I wonder if Gerald opened it?

55
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,490
No, in a room this size, sound will go around,

56
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,190
Gerald would never open it.

57
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,590
Come to think of it...

58
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,890
The top lid of the piano was open

59
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,990
even before Tenma came into this room.

60
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,990
Which means that

61
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,590
the killer could've opened the top lid of the piano beforehand

62
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,590
to block our view.

63
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,990
The only way out of this room is to go through the waiting room.

64
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,090
One of the windows was open, but below it,

65
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,290
is the sea way below.

66
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,790
Even if the killer were to jump in,

67
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,690
it would be difficult to avoid the rocks.

68
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,590
There is a scratch on this window frame too.

69
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,490
It looks like a scratch made from a string or some sort.

70
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,190
It's the same as when Misaki was attacked.

71
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,090
If a rope were used, you could flee to the top or bottom.

72
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,590
Well, that is a possibility.

73
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,990
But, I wonder if one could flee so quickly?

74
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,490
A scratch made by the tip of the sword piercing

75
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,890
right through the floor is vertical?

76
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,190
This means...

77
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,590
Maybe...

78
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,490
Let's organize the position of all of you

79
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,090
during the time of the crime, once again.

80
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,190
Let's all go to the room next door.

81
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,790
The small chandelier on this side

82
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,790
is positioned higher than the big one over there.

83
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,190
When we were led in here,

84
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,790
I'm sure it was positioned lower.

85
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,990
There is a scratch here too.

86
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,590
It resembles the one that was by the window.

87
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,490
So, this is the chain that moves the chandelier up and down.

88
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,890
I guess it's easy to roll it up.

89
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,390
Only this box has no dust on it.

90
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,190
"Nocturne of Red Love."

91
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,890
This song was one that Mr. Tenma had written for Misaki 10 years ago.

92
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,490
Wait a second.

93
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,390
So, what does this mean?

94
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,390
What's that...

95
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,690
on the piano?

96
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,890
Is it blood?

97
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,890
No.

98
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,390
Inside the piano too?

99
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,790
Officer Kobayashi.

100
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,290
What is it, Conan?

101
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,290
Lend me your ear, please.

102
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,390
What? The Inspector said to?

103
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,690
Look for Beethoven?

104
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,690
Yes.

105
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,890
Is it really inside the ocean?

106
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,990
Yes. Good luck.

107
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,490
At any rate, I'll have to have you come to the station with me.

108
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,890
I didn't do it.

109
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,090
How many times do I have to tell you to make you believe me?

110
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,090
Misaki, help me.

111
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,090
Dear.

112
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,090
If this piece fits into that part...

113
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,190
Just as I thought.

114
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,890
These are the debris from the decorations up there.

115
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,090
Only that person could've committed the murder.

116
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,490
I'll take care of the company, Yoshinori.

117
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,790
You're already thinking of

118
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,890
selling a memorial CD of Gerald Tenma, aren't you?

119
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,990
How dare you!

120
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,290
He's the one who attacked Misaki.

121
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,190
Inspector Megure.

122
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,190
Just as you have said, this statue of Beethoven was found on the beach.

123
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,690
I never asked you to do such a thing.

124
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,790
Shoots.

125
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,590
What's this?

126
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,090
There is a scratch below the railing

127
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:21,090
that looks to have been made by scraping a thin string or wire on it.

128
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,890
What's this?

129
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,290
What is this string called?

130
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,190
Isn't this the string that you use when fishing?

131
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,590
It's called a fishing gut.

132
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,390
Inspector, there was a fishing gut

133
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,690
and this stick on this chest statue.

134
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,290
What?

135
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,490
I see. The scratch on the railing

136
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,790
was made by the fishing gut scraping against it.

137
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,790
All right, Pops, that's the way to go.

138
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,090
But, why the statue of Beethoven?

139
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,090
See, there's Mr. Beethoven in this picture too.

140
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,390
-What is this? -That was a picture...

141
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,190
that was taken secretly from this room last night.

142
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,290
This is just about there.

143
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,290
The statue of Beethoven is not here?

144
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,290
I see, I've figured out the trick of the caped monster.

145
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,390
What?

146
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,290
Yes, the statue of Beethoven belongs in this room.

147
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,390
If this trick were to be used...

148
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,390
Don't you think that beam fits the length of the stick?

149
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,390
Hey!

150
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,990
Doesn't that piece that was found,

151
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,190
fit right into the crack over there?

152
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,890
Right. Let's try it from the balcony on the other side.

153
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,590
Would you please lend us a fishing pole if you have one?

154
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,890
Yes.

155
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,590
The eaves protrude more than the railing,

156
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,690
but if a fishing pole were used, it's simple.

157
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,690
There is a loop at the tip of the string

158
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,390
and a weight at the end to carry this out.

159
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,690
Then, pull this string under the railing...

160
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,990
Officer Kobayashi,

161
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,590
please put your finger through the loop of the fishing gut

162
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,090
and hold it in place.

163
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,590
All right.

164
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,290
Inspector Megure, may I borrow your coat?

165
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,390
So, now we're all set.

166
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,190
Officer Kobayashi, struggle with the monster

167
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,690
and let your hand go when I signal,

168
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,490
then, pull the string.

169
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,990
All right.

170
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,390
Let's begin.

171
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,790
Help me!

172
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,090
Now!

173
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,390
Pull the string!

174
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,890
Let the string go.

175
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,090
This is fantastic! It's perfect!

176
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,990
Hey. My coat!

177
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,290
That movement just now

178
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,490
was exactly the same as the attacker who attacked Misaki.

179
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,490
-Then... -Don't tell me it was you?

180
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,790
In a dark room,

181
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,390
it looked like the caped monster had fled.

182
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,390
That is, the victim and the attacker are one and the same.

183
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,590
The killer lowers the breaker that is in the corridor,

184
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,690
and goes back to her room right away, locks the door and screams.

185
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,090
Isn't that right, Misaki?

186
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,490
Misaki.

187
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,690
Perfect, just as would be expected of a renown detective.

188
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,190
However, all the pranks and blackmails I have experienced up to now

189
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,490
are a matter of fact.

190
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,490
I wanted you to believe me,

191
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,290
so I put on an act.

192
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,890
I see.

193
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,490
But, this is not directly connected to the murder of Mr. Tenma.

194
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,190
Yoshinori,

195
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,790
please come with me to the station.

196
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,290
Okay.

197
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,790
This won't do.

198
00:12:58,779 --> 00:12:59,779
What the?

199
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,079
The piano room?

200
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,179
Conan, what's up?

201
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,479
Where are you?

202
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:14,779
What is it now?

203
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:16,279
Inspector Megure,

204
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,879
please wait about taking him to the station.

205
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,679
What?

206
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:21,479
So it's come?

207
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:25,079
Yes. I've finally figured it out, Inspector.

208
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,179
Please look at the sword mark on the floor.

209
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,679
The angle of the scratch is perpendicular.

210
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,379
The result of the investigation shows likewise..

211
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,779
And, the railing of the spiral corridor by the window.

212
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,479
The scratch left on the tuning fork that Mr. Tenma was holding.

213
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,879
If we connect all the traces left behind,

214
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,079
a certain horrible trap comes to the surface.

215
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,379
There is a chandelier right above the scratch on the floor.

216
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:56,579
That is in fact, the last point that connects all the traces.

217
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,179
It can't be?

218
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,579
Yes.

219
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,179
The sword that was suspended from that chandelier

220
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:06,979
fell straight down, pierced Mr. Tenma

221
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,279
and left a vertical mark on the floor.

222
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,579
Oh, no.

223
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:14,179
But, Mr. Mouri,

224
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,879
even if he were to be standing conveniently right under the place

225
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,979
where the sword descended,

226
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:19,779
wouldn't he have been stabbed in the head or shoulder?

227
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:23,679
However, Mr. Tenma was lying on his stomach.

228
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,279
No such thing could be done.

229
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,079
The answer to that mystery is the tuning fork.

230
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,379
Tuning fork?

231
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,079
And, the piano chair.

232
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,779
The space between the piano and the chair

233
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,779
is good only for one person.

234
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,479
This was the trap.

235
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:45,179
When Mr. Tenma comes before the keys of the piano to play,

236
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,179
the chair was toppled beside the piano.

237
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,479
He also finds the tuning fork used for tuning the piano on the floor.

238
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:56,379
Well, Mr. Tenma would naturally go to pick it up.

239
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:01,379
Yeah, if so, he would turn his back against the sword.

240
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,679
And, the tuning fork that he picked up

241
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,479
is the very thing that made the sword come falling.

242
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,179
What do you mean?

243
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:11,279
This horrible trap...

244
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,079
was set up by setting the sword in the middle of the long string,

245
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,879
then gathering both sides of the string,

246
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,579
pulling them through the metal faster of the chandelier

247
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,879
using the railing of the spiral corridor as support,

248
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,579
one side is wound once around the large sofa

249
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,179
then the tip of the string is hooked on to the tuning fork.

250
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:31,079
The other end of the string is left outside the window,

251
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,579
with a weight attached to it.

252
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:34,779
All that's left to do next

253
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,279
is for Mr. Tenma to pull it out from under the chair.

254
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,979
The string that was hooked on to the tuning fork is released

255
00:15:41,979 --> 00:15:43,579
by the weight of the sword,

256
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:46,979
And the heavy sword probably came falling in an instant.

257
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:52,979
On the other hand, the fishing gut that was holding the sword in place,

258
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:57,879
was pulled by the weight that was suspended outside the window

259
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,179
and dropped into the ocean below.

260
00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:02,779
I see.

261
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:04,979
And, who is the one who set all this up?

262
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,879
Please recall.

263
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,879
The trick is using the fishing gut.

264
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,979
The method of throwing the evidence into the sea by using heavy weight,

265
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,679
is exactly like the one that used with the caped monster

266
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,879
that was just demonstrated, is it not?

267
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,179
Misaki?

268
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,779
Yes, the killer is you, Misaki.

269
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,179
After we all drank the wine,

270
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:34,779
you pretend to go to the kitchen and set your trap up here, didn't you?

271
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:38,279
By rolling the chandelier to the very top,

272
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,079
you made it harder to find the sword,

273
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,079
as well as heightened the power of it to kill, right?

274
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,479
I thought you were a renown detective

275
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,479
but I guess I was wrong.

276
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,979
Do you have proof that I did it?

277
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,779
I'd like you to take a look at the lid of the top of the piano

278
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,679
and the stains inside it.

279
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,279
This is wine?

280
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,579
Judging from the place where it is spilled,

281
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,479
it must've dripped when she opened the lid.

282
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:16,279
The one who spilled the wine is the killer.

283
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,579
How can you be so sure?

284
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,579
Because the wine is what Michelle brought from France

285
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,179
and one that is not sold in Japan.

286
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:30,179
Yes, this is unmistakably the wine that I brought.

287
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,779
We were all drinking that wine.

288
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,979
Misaki is the only one who didn't drink it.

289
00:17:37,979 --> 00:17:41,579
When I bumped into her and the wine spilled,

290
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:45,879
the wine that was probably left in the gap of her brooch spilled out

291
00:17:45,879 --> 00:17:50,179
when she opened the lid on top of the piano.

292
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:54,379
You not only made it look like you were attacked by Mr. Tenma,

293
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:57,479
you set it up so that the picture of you two in the past would be found,

294
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:01,079
and tried to frame Yoshinori who you knew would be enraged

295
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,579
as the one who killed Mr. Tenma, isn't that right?

296
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:06,379
Misaki, is that true?

297
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:10,179
How are you going to explain the stalker incidents before all this.

298
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,279
She probably acted it out herself.

299
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,979
The crank call that came a while ago

300
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:21,679
was probably made by Misaki herself, using her cellular.

301
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,079
Why would Misaki want to kill Mr. Tenma?

302
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:29,379
The date of the picture that was found of Misaki and Mr. Tenma

303
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:32,379
was only six months before her marriage, wasn't it?

304
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,079
It can't be?

305
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:38,779
And the "Nocturne of Red Love"

306
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:44,079
was a song that was written for you, 10 year ago.

307
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,379
Really?

308
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:48,779
The song at first glance looks to be a love song.

309
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:51,779
But the passions that the flowers stand for are,

310
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,279
Red roses symbolize passion,

311
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,279
marigolds hopelessness, roberias evil,

312
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:59,279
and dahlias betrayal.

313
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,479
In other words, this was a song of hate written

314
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:05,479
for someone who had betrayed one's lover.

315
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,279
Is that true, Misaki?

316
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,379
Yes.

317
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:13,079
10 years ago on that day...

318
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,079
He insisted on not leaving me,

319
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,779
so I called him out to a nearby beach

320
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:22,779
and pushed him over the cliff.

321
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:32,279
Then, you married Yoshinori.

322
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,879
However, Mr. Tenma miraculously made it out alive,

323
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:39,779
and achieved his fame abroad.

324
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,879
When you found out Gerald Tenma's true identity,

325
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:46,579
you figured you had no choice but to kill Tenma again,

326
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:51,479
in order to keep your previous crime from being revealed.

327
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:57,479
But, why did you try to frame your husband as the killer?

328
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,779
Because of Masayo!

329
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,279
If I get caught,

330
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:04,979
my husband as well as the company will be taken away.

331
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:08,379
But a man who is in prison cannot be taken away from me.

332
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:12,279
I was planning to take over the company until he came back.

333
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,179
Misaki.

334
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,279
When Mr. Tenma's body wasn't found 10 years ago,

335
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:22,679
I was always in fear that he may be alive.

336
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,779
Because I also knew the meaning of that song.

337
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:31,279
Well, the fact is, whenever Gerald sang this song at his concert,

338
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,679
he would whisper the following phrase without fail.

339
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,879
"Pour compenser ton coeur blesse."

340
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,279
In Japanese it means,

341
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,979
"To compensate your heart that is hurt."

342
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:48,379
The new arrangement had new lyrics,

343
00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:50,579
but most probably...

344
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,879
Yes! Except for red roses,

345
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:56,279
the flowers have all been changed to, hyacinth, laurel tree and olive.

346
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:01,779
The flowers stand for sadness, peace and glory.

347
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:06,279
I see.

348
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,779
Mr. Tenma having realized that he had cornered Misaki

349
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,679
into committing murder,

350
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,079
continued singing this song with feelings of compensation,

351
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,079
and probably deliberately decided to sign a contract with the Kana Group.

352
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,079
Yes, he once fell to the pits of grief,

353
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,879
but he no longer hated Misaki

354
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,679
and having achieved success and happiness himself,

355
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,979
he probably wanted her to hear the real "Nocturne of Red Love."

356
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:12,579
"Mouri Detective Agency" -That's right.

357
00:23:12,579 --> 00:23:15,279
I've been hooked on what flowers stand for since then.

358
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,679
Okay then, Sonoko, bye-bye.

359
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:21,879
Conan, you're back.

360
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:25,579
Here, I saw this at the flower shop, so I bought it.

361
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,779
You, Conan? For me?

362
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,179
Thank you.

363
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,879
What beautiful peach blossoms.

364
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:38,079
This flower stands for...

365
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,879
To be unrivaled in the world.

366
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:46,179
Conan, just what do you mean by this?

367
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:48,779
Well, you see...

368
00:23:48,779 --> 00:23:51,179
Just what do you mean-to be unrivaled in the world?

369
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:53,579
Just that...

370
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:02,779
"Next Episode"

371
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:12,279
Hurry, let's get outside before they get into the elevator.

372
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:17,979
No use fleeing.

373
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:19,979
What I want to say is,

374
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,179
you're not Misato, but an impostor.

375
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,479
Next Conan,

376
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:28,300
"The Great Search-Nine Doors"

377
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:31,497
Next Conan's Hint:

378
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:33,197
"Alphabet"

379
00:24:33,197 --> 00:24:34,897
Next time is a nine story building.

380
00:24:34,897 --> 00:24:36,297
Lots of the Youth Detective Squad.

381
00:24:36,297 --> 00:24:38,297
What about my appearance?
