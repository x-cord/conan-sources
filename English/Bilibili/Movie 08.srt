1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,100
Damn, where did he go?

2
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,200
Over there.

3
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,700
Time to end this game, right?

4
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,000
Mr. Thief.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,500
Yeah.

6
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,200
It's already too dark to play hide-and-seek.

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,100
Great detective.

8
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:10,100
(Detective Conan  Magician of the Silver Sky)

9
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
I am a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

10
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,600
When I went to the amusement park
with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,

11
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,600
I witnessed a suspicious transaction made by a man in black.

12
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,400
I was too preoccupied with watching at that time,

13
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,400
and didn't notice another accomplice approaching from behind.

14
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,400
He made me take the poison by force.

15
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,000
When I woke up,

16
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,000
my body became smaller.

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,200
If those guys knew that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

18
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,900
they would definitely come after me,

19
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,000
even the people around me would get involved.

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
At the suggestion of Professor Agasa,
I concealed my true identity.

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,100
When Ran asked for my name,

22
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,900
without time to think it over,

23
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,700
I took the name of Conan Edogawa.

24
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,900
In order to collect information about those guys,

25
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,900
I moved in with Ran whose father is a detective.

26
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,100
The culprit is you!

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,900
This middle-aged man is Kogoro Mouri,

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,300
Ran's father.

29
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,800
He is now a famous detective
who scares the hell out of the bad guys,

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,900
known as Sleeping Kogoro.

31
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,900
If you ask me why...

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
I guess I don't even need to tell you.

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
(Stun-Gun Wristwatch) (Voice-Changing Bowtie)
These two gadgets are invented by Professor Agasa.

34
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,500
In order to help the smaller me,

35
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,900
Professor Agasa invented many interesting gadgets
one after another.

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Especially this belt that can shoot a soccer ball
no matter where I am.

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,900
Just press the button on the belt buckle,

38
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,300
the soccer ball will expand and shoot out.
It's absolutely a superb invention.

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,500
But then again,

40
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
Other than Professor Agasa,

41
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,600
there are others who know my true identity.

42
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,800
My father and mother.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,300
Heiji Hattori, a high school detective from Kansai,

44
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,500
and Ai Haibara, who goes to the same elementary school as me.

45
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,100
She and her sister Akemi Miyano

46
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,200
used to work with those men in black.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
But the Black Organization killed Akemi Miyano.

48
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,200
This made Ai Haibara determined to resist.

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,100
When she escaped from the organization,

50
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,400
she took the same drug as me.

51
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
After that, her body has also become smaller.

52
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
There is another person,

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,200
Kaitou Kid.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,300
There is not yet a clear winner between us.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
I swear on my honor as a detective

56
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,200
that I will definitely bring him to justice this time.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
Although my body is smaller, my mind is still flexible.

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,100
I am the famous omniscient detective.

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,900
Only one truth will prevail!

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
(10 days ago)

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,500
I see.

62
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,200
So this is the advanced notice sent by Kiddo?

63
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,500
Yes.

64
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,200
This morning, I found it on the balcony of my apartment

65
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,000
along with a large bouquet of roses.

66
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,500
The guy is still as pretentious as usual.

67
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,600
Romeo, Juliet,

68
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Victor, Bravo.

69
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,900
While the 26 letters soar around,

70
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,500
I am going to steal your Jewel of Destiny

71
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Kaitou Kid.

72
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,500
And there is a playing card cut in half.

73
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
Please enjoy it.

74
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,800
Thank you.

75
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,500
What do you think, Mr. Mouri?

76
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Well...

77
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,100
What is the Jewel of Destiny?

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,300
He means this one.

79
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,800
It's beautiful.

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
This is the star sapphire, right?

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Yes.

82
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,700
The three crisscrossing streaks on the surface

83
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,900
represent faith, hope and fate.

84
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,700
It's called the Jewel of Destiny.

85
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,500
Oh, I see.

86
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,100
It really lives up to its name.

87
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,000
It comes from Josephine, who loved sapphires deeply.

88
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,500
That's why I used this sapphire for this play.

89
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,700
Play?

90
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
I know it.

91
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,900
The newly opened Universal Theater in Shiodome

92
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,300
is now staging the theater play "Josephine".

93
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,100
Josephine?

94
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,700
She was the first wife of Napoleon.

95
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,000
She was also known for her love of collecting roses.

96
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
So that's it.

97
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,400
That's why he sent roses.

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,100
That's right, little kid.

99
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,300
You do know a lot.

100
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,100
He knows a lot of this kind of boring stuff.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Romeo, Juliet,

102
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Victor, Bravo.

103
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,200
Romeo, Juliet.

104
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,600
Juri-san.

105
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
What?

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,100
Is Romeo and Juliet being staged

107
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,800
in the theater where you are performing?

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,700
Yes.

109
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,600
I didn't perform in that play,

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,500
but that was the first play staged when the theater opened.

111
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,000
Is there a problem?

112
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,500
I figured it out.

113
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,700
Really?

114
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,300
This advanced notice from Kiddo

115
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,300
contains 3 Ws and 1 H.

116
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,200
That means:

117
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,100
Who, When, Where, and How.

118
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,300
It implies these four elements

119
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,700
I see.

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,800
Are you sure?

121
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
First is who.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
An idiot can see that it's Kiddo.

123
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,500
Then where?

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,600
The theater where Romeo and Juliet are staged,

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,500
that is, the Universal Theater.

126
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,100
And then, when?

127
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,700
The advanced notice mentioned Bravo,

128
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,500
so it should be when the audience is cheering.

129
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,400
And finally, how?

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
The letter mentioned the Victor,

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,400
which refers to Napoleon,

132
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,200
that is, the character that Kiddo is going to dress up as.

133
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,000
And the playing card on the advanced notice.

134
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,900
The card cut in half represents the V of victory.

135
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,600
So, when your theater play "Josephine" ends

136
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,000
and the audience cheers for it,

137
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,100
Kaitou Kid will suddenly appear
in the guise of Napoleon and steal the ring.

138
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Bravo!

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,100
Bravo, Mouri-san!

140
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,000
No wonder they call you the famous detective!

141
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,700
You flatter me.

142
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,300
Uncle Mouri!

143
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,600
What does he mean by the 26 letters soar around?

144
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
Idiot, why don't you count the letters of the alphabet?

145
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,700
Romeo, Juliet, Victor, Bravo.

146
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,300
26 letters in total, right?

147
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Oh, I see.

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
By the way, Juri-san,

149
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,800
when is the "Josephine" going to end?

150
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
Today is the last day.

151
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,100
So Kiddo will be in...

152
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
What's wrong with you this time, little brat?

153
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,200
But it's strange.

154
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,200
Look, there are only 22 letters here.

155
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,300
How can it be?

156
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
It's true. I counted it too.

157
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,400
Including the exclamation point,
there are still 3 letters missing.

158
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Then Kiddo must have made a mistake.

159
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Anyway,

160
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,100
Kiddo will definitely come to steal the jewel tonight.

161
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes, I see.

162
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,000
Then there is something I need to ask you.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Although I'll contact the police afterwards.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,900
Could you please come to the theater tonight

165
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,800
to stop Kiddo from stealing the jewel?

166
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
No problem.

167
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,800
I, Kogoro Mouri,

168
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,400
never turn down a request from a beauty.

169
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Thank you.

170
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,600
Hey, Masayo-san, bring it out.

171
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,500
Okay.

172
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,400
Here are the tickets for tonight.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,500
Welcome to our theater with your friends.

174
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,700
Thank you.

175
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,600
The 26 letters soar around?

176
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,300
I think 26 letters refer to the English alphabet.

177
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,300
And this playing card.

178
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,000
It doesn't look like the V of victory.

179
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,200
It's about to begin. Please stay tuned. Universal.

180
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
I'm so excited!

181
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,800
Me too.

182
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,800
Actually, I've been wanting to see this play for a long time.

183
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,200
Hey, Conan.

184
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,500
Why are you carrying a schoolbag?

185
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,800
Looks weird.

186
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,800
Ah, just a little something in there.

187
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,600
A little? What is it?

188
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,400
Did you sneak some snacks in?

189
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,300
I'm not you!

190
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,500
Hey, you kids!

191
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,700
I'm making an exception to bring you here.

192
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,300
Behave yourself.

193
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,800
Okay!

194
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,600
Sorry, we came along with you too.

195
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
It's okay.

196
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
Mr. Mouri!

197
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,600
Hello, Yaguchi-san.

199
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,800
It's Yaguchi. Mouri-san is here.

200
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,700
Please come in.

201
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,400
Please come in.

202
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,600
Thank you.

203
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,900
Welcome, Mouri-san.

204
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,200
Hello.

205
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,500
Sorry I'm not dressed properly now.

206
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,600
Natsuki-chan,

207
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
This is the famed detective, Mr. Kogoro Mouri-san.

208
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,900
You must have heard of him, right?

209
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,300
My name is Natsuki Sakai.

210
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,400
Hello.

211
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
It's so big here.

212
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,600
There are so many flowers.

213
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Awesome!

214
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,200
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,300
I brought the kids here with me.

216
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,200
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Juri-san, are you interested in diving?

218
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,900
Yes, I just started learning that recently.

219
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,900
Want to go with me some day?

220
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,100
Sure, anytime.

221
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,900
I remember you've never dived before.

222
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Ran-kun, what did you say?

223
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,100
Nothing.

224
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,100
There are so many cosmetics.

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,700
Yeah.

226
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,200
This is called foundation, right?

227
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,100
There are...

228
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
1, 2, 3, 4...

229
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,800
5 types of foundations.

230
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,900
5 types... So many?

231
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,700
Hey!

232
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,900
Little girls.

233
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,800
It's a little too early for you
to be interested in makeup, isn't it?

234
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
Kids should behave like kids.

235
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,000
Got it?

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
Alright.

237
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,200
Coming.

238
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,700
Masayo-chan.

239
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,800
Narusawa-san!

240
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
I heard Mouri-san is here.

241
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,600
Mouri-san?

242
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,700
You are the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, right?

243
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,800
My family name is Narusawa. I admire you very much.

244
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
You flatter me.

245
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,100
Are you playing Napoleon in this play?

246
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,800
Yeah. Sorry I came here in costume.

247
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,400
Anyway, let me introduce you.

248
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,900
This is Tenko Tajima who plays Josephine's best friend,
Theresa Tallien.

249
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,200
Nice to meet you.

250
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,800
This is Isao Shinjo who plays Josephine's lover,
Hippolyte Charles.

251
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,300
Hello.

252
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,900
And then this is the stage manager
who also plays Josephine's patron

253
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,600
Barras de Boer...

254
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,400
My name is Toru Ban. Nice to see you.

255
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,600
Me too.

256
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Now everyone's here, right?

257
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,400
Inspector Nakamori.

258
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,300
Hello, Mouri-san.

259
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,900
It's been a long time...

260
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,300
Thank you so much for last time...

261
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,500
You're too polite. I'm the one who should thank you.

262
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,500
Are they really themselves?

263
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,200
I mean them.

264
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
Indeed.

265
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,900
Kiddo often gets in by pretending to be a relevant person.

266
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,800
Maybe he's already among them.

267
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,800
I almost forgot.

268
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,500
This time I brought a person to assist with the investigation

269
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,300
Actually, I said I wouldn't need him,

270
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,700
but that stupid Megure...

271
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,000
No, I mean Inspector Megure... He strongly recommended him.

272
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,500
Come on in.

273
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
Hello, everyone, I'm Shinichi Kudo.

274
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Shinichi?

275
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,600
Kudo-kun?

276
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,200
Kai... Kai...

277
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,000
So it's this brat.

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,900
Isn't Shinichi Kudo...

279
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,100
that famous high school detective?

280
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,700
Kai... Kai...

281
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
Who is he?

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
What are you talking about?

283
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,000
He's Ran-onee-san's boyfriend.

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,300
No such thing.

285
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,500
It's her husband.

286
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,100
Sonoko!

287
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,300
He is Kaitou Kid!

288
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,400
This guy is not Shinichi-ni-chan!

289
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,200
He's Kiddo in disguise!

290
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,400
Kiddo in disguise?

291
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,500
How can you be so sure?

292
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,000
Because I'm the real...

293
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,300
The real what?

294
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,500
Nothing.

295
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,300
I see. That's not impossible.

296
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,400
It hurts.

297
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,100
Inspector Nakamori, please stop it.

298
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
What's going on here?

299
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know either.

300
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Maybe it's because Kiddo looks like me.

301
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,700
Or perhaps...

302
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,400
You're the fake.

303
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,600
Come on.

304
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
I can be sure that he is real.

305
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,600
I think we should try to pull each other's face together,
just to be safe.

306
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
I don't think it's necessary.

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,300
My gut is telling me that Kiddo isn't among us.

308
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,300
But he really is.

309
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,700
And I've already had a good idea to catch Kiddo.

310
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Then, please let me hear your "good idea".

311
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,400
Maki-san.

312
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,500
If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you all
to leave us alone for a moment.

313
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,900
It's okay, inspector.

314
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,100
I've finished my makeup.

315
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,900
I'm sorry.

316
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,600
I gotta do things my own way.

317
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,800
What did you say?

318
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,000
Fine, I don't need a little brat like you to make trouble for me.

319
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,700
Then we're leaving now.

320
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,900
I look forward to your performance.

321
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,500
Hey...

322
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,500
At least you should tell me first
when you're back, shouldn't you?

323
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,700
Sorry, sorry.

324
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,100
It's because I wanted to see your cute, surprised face.

325
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,000
Cute...

326
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,500
How come you've suddenly become so direct?

327
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, I think I'll go check out the roof.

328
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,000
Do you want to come with me?

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,100
There seems to be an observation deck on the top floor.

330
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,200
Ran, just go with him.

331
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,600
I'm going too!

332
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,900
You stay here.

333
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,100
No! I'm going too. Let me go!

334
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,400
Hey, you little brat!

335
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm going too! Take me!

336
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
All right, then. Let's all go.

337
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,500
Great!

338
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
Do you feel that Conan...

339
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,400
Seems to be a different person in front of Ran-san...

340
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,800
It must be because...

341
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,000
he is at that age where he's spoiled.

342
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,300
I see.

343
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,900
So he's still a little kid.

344
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,400
Aren't you all?

345
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,100
How can I leave Kiddo alone with Ran?

346
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,500
Alright, this door is locked too.

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,800
How's it going?

348
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The doors to the roof are all locked.

349
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,400
That means if what I reasoned is correct,

350
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,900
Kiddo must not come from the roof.

351
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,200
You have a point.

352
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,400
But you're already here.

353
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I'll take care of Conan-kun.

354
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,900
How about you two go out for a walk?

355
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,200
No, thanks.

356
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,900
Besides,

357
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,300
I feel that Shinichi is kind of strange.

358
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,000
He didn't say that kind of thing in the past.

359
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,400
That kind of thing?

360
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,900
Like I'm...cute or something.

361
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,100
That means he's more direct now.

362
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
You should be more direct too.

363
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,400
If you like him, just tell him.

364
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,700
You idiot!

365
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,400
That's not what I meant.

366
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Awesome! Awesome!

367
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,700
Genta-kun, you've been saying "awesome" since we came up here.

368
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,500
I can't help it.

369
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,900
Because this place is really awesome.

370
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,100
What a great view.

371
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I just want to say, "it's awesome."

372
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
Look.

373
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Yeah, it's really beautiful.

374
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,500
He's got some nerve

375
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,200
to disguise himself as Shinichi.

376
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,400
Because it will be easier to act as me.

377
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,300
At least it saves us the time to find him.

378
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,500
Do you know who Napoleon was?

379
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,500
I know that he was a French hero who conquered Europe.

380
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,600
Good.

381
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Consider this a warm-up.

382
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,400
I'll give you a riddle related to Napoleon.

383
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,200
Shinichi oni-san, you'll give us a riddle?

384
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
You're just like Professor Agasa.

385
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Don't tell me it's a boring riddle.

386
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,200
My riddle is about history. You can learn something from it!

387
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,300
Do you wanna try, kid?

388
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,600
Annoying.

389
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,400
Listen up.

390
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,200
In the land of Napoleon,

391
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,100
it is said that two Japanese built a house.

392
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,200
Which of the following two people were they?

393
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,100
1, Huyuno.

394
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,100
2, Huruno.

395
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,100
3, Hukano.

396
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,400
Huyuno, Huruno, Hukano.

397
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,700
Everyone has a "hu" and a "no"

398
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,600
I see.

399
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,700
Shh, don't say it!

400
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,800
The difference between the three of them
is their middle parts, "yu", "ru" and "ka".

401
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,900
I see.

402
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
It's Huyuno and Huruno.

403
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,600
Only Hukano has "ka" in the middle.

404
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,700
The middle part "ka" represents China,

405
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
so Hukano is Chinese.

406
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,500
What?

407
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,400
Did I guess wrong?

408
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,600
Your answer is correct, but there is
a little problem with your explanation.

409
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,600
Do you know there's a famous quote by Napoleon, which goes,

410
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,400
"Impossible (hakano) is a word
not to be found in my dictionary (jisho)."

411
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,300
I've heard it before.

412
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,900
That's where this riddle comes from.

413
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Land could also be pronounced "jisho".

414
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,100
The "word (ji)" refers to the name on the door signboard.

415
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,700
That is, Hakano is a name not to be found in my land.

416
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,800
So that's why.

417
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,700
Actually, what Napoleon said is

418
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,800
"Impossible" is a word to be found
only in the dictionary of fools.

419
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,400
That seems to be the correct one.

420
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,400
Not bad, Haibara-san.

421
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,600
But it's still a boring riddle.

422
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,500
And...

423
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,200
I don't think I've learned anything from it.

424
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,800
Is that so?

425
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Josephine, Theresa.

426
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
Barras, what can I do for you?

427
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,900
General, may I introduce to you

428
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,400
Theresa and Josephine.

429
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,300
And this is...

430
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,000
I know who you are.

431
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,100
You're General Napoleon Bonaparte.

432
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,100
I hear you're very brave.

433
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,400
You do me too much honour.

434
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,600
General.

435
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,100
Would you like to dance with me?

436
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,300
With pleasure.

437
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,700
I still can't forget

438
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,300
those glorious days.

439
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
Bonaparte,

440
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Elba Island.

441
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,700
King of Rome.

442
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,200
Ran.

443
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,300
Is the man next to the Pope your father?

444
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
So this is what he called the good idea to catch Kiddo.

445
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,000
Haibara.

446
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,900
Take care of things here.

447
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay, just go ahead.

448
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,500
In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit,

449
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,300
I take the crown of the Emperor of France...

450
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,500
From now on, I am the Emperor of France, Napoleon I...

451
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,100
Are you okay, kid?

452
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,200
This is dangerous.

453
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,900
I'm fine.

454
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,000
By the way...

455
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,800
What's going on here?

456
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,100
This child suddenly ran out from behind the wall

457
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,100
and fell down after hitting me.

458
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,800
Are you alright, little kid?

459
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,800
I'm fine.

460
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,300
But your police baton is really handsome

461
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,000
It's much longer than his.

462
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,100
Indeed, it's really long.

463
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,900
There are many types of police batons.

464
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,500
Under 60 cm in length.

465
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,100
Under 3 cm in diameter.

466
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,800
Under 320 grams in weight.

467
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,100
Public security committee has strict rules for police batons.

468
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,600
Isn't your baton a little too long?

469
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,900
Why?

470
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,300
Why is it this long?

471
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Because...

472
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
It's not a police baton!

473
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,700
I won't let you run away!

474
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,700
Don't run!

475
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,600
Damn it!

476
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,700
Everything in this world,

477
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,200
the glory, the victory,

478
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,900
and the future, is all mine.

479
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,400
Everything belongs to us!

480
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,500
Go into action as soon as the curtain goes completely down.

481
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,600
Got it.

482
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,000
Right now!

483
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,100
Everyone, catch Kiddo!

484
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,800
He's pretending to be Napoleon.

485
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,500
What is this?

486
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,000
You didn't think of that, did you, Kiddo?

487
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,400
Your stupid code

488
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,900
has already been seen through by me, Kogoro Mouri.

489
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,000
It's not like that.

490
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,200
I'm not Kiddo!

491
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,100
Cut the crap. Just show me your face.

492
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,400
Kaitou Kid.

493
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,900
It hurts...

494
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,800
He's not Kiddo.

495
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,300
Then where is Kiddo?

496
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,100
Time to end this game, right?

497
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,300
Mr. Thief.

498
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Yeah.

499
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,200
It's already too dark to play hide-and-seek.

500
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,000
Great Detective.

501
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,200
You still love to talk nonsense as before.

502
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,400
It's long overdue for us to have a showdown.

503
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,400
Because your girl is waiting for you to go back and eat dinner.

504
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,100
Conan-kun!

505
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,200
Dinner is ready!

506
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,600
If you don't hurry, I'll eat it all.

507
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,600
Looks like we'll have a winner today.

508
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,100
Great detective.

509
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,100
Indeed.

510
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,500
Oh, no.

511
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,800
Oh, I see.

512
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,200
Hang glider versus paraglider?

513
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,500
You do have some chops.

514
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,600
Is that paraglider

515
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,100
also the work of Professor Agasa?

516
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,900
You have no place to run.

517
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,900
If you can't fly,

518
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,300
you're just an ordinary thief.

519
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,900
If you say so, then I'll turn back into the Kaito Kiddo again.

520
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
What's that sound?

521
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Shit!

522
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,600
Bye!

523
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
Damn it!

524
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,700
Next up is the weather around the airport.

525
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,100
First, Hokkaido.

526
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,300
The weather in Hakodate tonight is rainy.

527
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,300
Some areas has heavy thunderstorms.

528
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,600
Hakodate is having a heavy thunderstorm.

529
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,500
This weather is really a bummer.

530
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,300
What if the plane is struck by lightning?

531
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,700
Don't be afraid.

532
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,700
The plane will fly above the clouds.

533
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,300
But when it lands, it still have to fly under the clouds, right?

534
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,000
Too bad it is raining when I am so beautifully dressed.

535
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,300
My grandmother said that if you wear this kind of clothes,

536
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,600
when it thunders, your belly button
will be stolen by the Thunder God.

537
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,200
Really?

538
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,900
Then he can just come to steal it, if he wants.

539
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Thank you so much

540
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,800
for inviting us to your celebration party.

541
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Thanks to your help, the jewel is safe.

542
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,800
That's what we should do.

543
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,300
She's right.

544
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,400
Don't be too polite. Just go to Hakodate with us.

545
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,500
But why isn't Juri here yet?

546
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,300
Really.

547
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,400
Sorry about that.

548
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,300
Natsuki-san is doing her makeup right now

549
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,400
in the car parked in the parking lot.

550
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,000
Doing makeup?

551
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,800
It's really hard being a superstar.

552
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,300
It's Natsuki-chan who does all the hard work.

553
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,100
Juri can't leave her for a moment.

554
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,500
She's pretty much her personal assistant nowadays.

555
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,800
I see.

556
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

557
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,100
You look gorgeous today.

558
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,000
Thank you, Mouri-san.

559
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,100
Seems like everyone has arrived.

560
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,400
Shinjo-kun is not here yet.

561
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
Shinjo-san is not feeling well.

562
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,100
He called this morning and said he couldn't make it.

563
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,600
Oh, is that so?

564
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,700
It's a pity, isn't it, Juri?

565
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,800
What do you mean?

566
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,900
Nothing.

567
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,000
Aren't the other cast members coming?

568
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,100
Of course not.

569
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,500
What is the use of having those supporting actors here?

570
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,500
What was that just now?

571
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
If my intuitions are correct,

572
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,500
that guy will definitely show up here.

573
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,900
Inspector Nakamori, all personnel are present.

574
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,500
Good.

575
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,500
Team A, take the front.

576
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,600
Team B, take the rear.

577
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,400
Team C, patrol the vicinity.

578
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,100
Yes, sir!

579
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Inspector Nakamori.

580
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,800
What is it?

581
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,600
There are lights inside the villa.

582
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,400
What?

583
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,900
That's...

584
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,100
Sky Japan Airlines, leaving for Hakodate.

585
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,500
Flight 865 departing at 18:15

586
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,100
is now commencing with boarding procedures.

587
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,200
All Flight 865 passengers headed for Hakodate...

588
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,200
Wow!

589
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,300
It's soft and fluffy.

590
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
Not bad, huh?

591
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,600
I feel like a big boss.

592
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,900
As far as domestic flights,
having a First Class on the second floor

593
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,600
is exclusive to Sky Japan Airlines.

594
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,300
Hello?

595
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,600
Ran, what's wrong?

596
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,700
You've been looking behind you ever since we got on.

597
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,800
Nothing.

598
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,600
Welcome aboard.

599
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,700
Thank you.

600
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,100
She's here.

601
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,100
Who's here?

602
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,300
Shh, be quite.

603
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,000
Is the seat next to you occupied?

604
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,800
Go ahead.

605
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,800
Eri?

606
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,600
It's you.

607
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,500
Auntie?

608
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,300
Ah-le-le? Don't tell me you're going to Hakodate too?

609
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,200
What a beautiful coincidence?

610
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,800
It's definitely fate that brought you and Dad together again.

611
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,200
What are you talking about?

612
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,600
You were the one who said you were invited
by Juri-san to Hakodate

613
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
and asked me to accompany you
due to your father being busy, weren't you?

614
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Ran, here you go again!

615
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,100
Anyway, why don't you two have a seat?

616
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,500
Are you kidding me?

617
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,800
Why do I have to sit next to this person?

618
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,100
You two...

619
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,400
Dad!

620
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,800
Excuse me, Juri-san.

621
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,400
May I sit next to you?

622
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,200
Sure, please.

623
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,700
Geez!

624
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,200
Wait, Mom.

625
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,100
Excuse me.

626
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,900
Are you Juri-san Maki?

627
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,200
I'm Eri Kisaki.

628
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,900
Thank you for inviting me here.

629
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
You're welcome.

630
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, right...

631
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,100
If the vulgar man sitting next to you

632
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
troubles you with his speech or conduct,

633
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,100
you can ask for my consultation anytime.

634
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,700
So you're a lawyer?

635
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,500
I shall be at your service.

636
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,200
Sure.

637
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,200
How did things end up being like this?

638
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Of course they would.

639
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
I knew it.

640
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,700
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

641
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,100
Shinjo-san?

642
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,000
Didn't you say you weren't coming
because you were feeling ill today?

643
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,000
Now I feel much better.

644
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,800
And it's too boring to stay by myself.

645
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,900
So I figured I would join you.

646
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,400
Sorry I'm late.

647
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,800
Princess Josephine.

648
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,900
Why haven't you done as I said?

649
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,400
It's okay.

650
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,200
There will be more than enough time once we get there.

651
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,900
Well, have a nice trip.

652
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,400
We're going.

653
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,500
Attention, flight attendants.

654
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,300
Please prepare the cabin for departure.

655
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,000
What are you thinking about?

656
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,600
I bet it has something to do with Kiddo.

657
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Did he really intend to steal the jewel yesterday?

658
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,900
It's already too dark to play hide-and-seek.

659
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,400
Great detective.

660
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,300
Besides, he had an overly long police baton.

661
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,200
It's too careless a mistake for Kiddo.

662
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,700
My seat number is 4K.

663
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,200
K for Kid.

664
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,800
Mine is 4J.

665
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,400
J for Jumbo, right?

666
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,200
And mine is 4B.

667
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,500
That means...

668
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,100
So that's it.

669
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,900
The four words that Kiddo wrote on his advanced notice...

670
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,000
are phonetic codes!

671
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:35,100
Phonetic codes?

672
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,700
Yeah.

673
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,100
They're codes used over wireless communication
in order to prevent miscommunication.

674
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,800
R is for Romeo.

675
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
J is for Juliet.

676
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,900
V is for Victor.

677
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,200
B is for Bravo.

678
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,300
And they're also used in the aircraft radio communications.

679
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,000
SKJ865.

680
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,900
Runway, 16 Left.

681
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,100
Taxi in.

682
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,800
Juliet10, Echo10, Charlie10.

683
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,800
SKJ865, Juliet10, Echo10, Charlie10.

684
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,600
In other words, the "26 letters soar around" part

685
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,400
means that he will commit the crime aboard the plane,

686
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,300
where those phonetic codes fly about over the airwaves.

687
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,200
And it will take place on this flight from Tokyo to Hakodate

688
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,100
Why?

689
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100
It could be on the return flight too.

690
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,000
Because of the picture of that playing card?

691
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,700
Yeah.

692
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,500
The two of spades card was split in half,

693
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,800
which indicates an odd number that is not divisible by 2.

694
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,100
Flights from Tokyo to Hakodate,

695
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,100
like this flight numbered 865,
must be given odd number designations.

696
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,000
And the return flights are designated even numbers.

697
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,800
If we think about it this way,
we can understand what happened last night.

698
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,300
That guy purposely drew my attention to him,

699
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,600
and let me think his plan had failed,

700
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,300
so that he can put everyone off their guard.

701
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,800
If that's the case...

702
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,900
Kiddo must be somewhere on this plane,

703
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,000
waiting for a chance to steal the jewel.

704
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,000
Dear passengers.

705
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,500
Welcome aboard SKJ Airlines.

706
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,800
Is anything wrong?

707
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,900
I'm not feeling too well.

708
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,900
You must be tired.

709
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,900
Here, Juri, give me your hand.

710
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,600
Here are some vitamin pills.

711
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,600
The captain of this flight is Captain Okoshi.

712
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,400
I am your chief cabin attendant, Kondo.

713
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,600
SKJ865. Winds 160 and 10. Clear for takeoff.

714
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,300
SKJ865. Clear for takeoff.

715
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,400
Runway, 16 Left.

716
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,900
Take off.

717
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,100
80.

718
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,200
Check.

719
00:45:58,900 --> 00:45:59,700
V1.

720
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,800
VR.

721
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,400
V2.

722
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,000
Positive.

723
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,000
Gear up.

724
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,300
Gear up.

725
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,600
My ears feel weird.

726
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,700
Me too.

727
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,400
It's because of the change in air pressure.

728
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,600
Just swallow and it'll be fine.

729
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,100
Still weird.

730
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,900
It didn't work.

731
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:50,400
Then hold your nose and blow.

732
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,900
But don't do it too hard.

733
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,900
You might get dizzy.

734
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,600
It worked.

735
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,800
Awesome, something came out.

736
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,600
Conan-kun, face forward, all right?

737
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
You were right! It worked!

738
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,900
I guess girls will be girls.

739
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:23,000
It doesn't look good when you blow your nose, right?

740
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
So she wouldn't do that

741
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,100
in front of someone of the opposite gender.
Especially someone she likes.

742
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,200
Excuse me, Juri-san.

743
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,700
Could you please sign this for me as a commemoration?

744
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,500
Sure.

745
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Oh no, I forgot my pen

746
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,800
Maki-san.

747
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,100
Please use this one.

748
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,200
Thank you.

749
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,900
You can see why I can never live without her.

750
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,000
What's Dad doing?

751
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,100
Don't worry about that superficial man.

752
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,400
How about taking this time to introduce me who everyone is?

753
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,200
Okay.

754
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,800
I'm sorry.

755
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,900
Are you alright?

756
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,700
Here.

757
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,300
Thank you so much.

758
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,100
Would you like Western or Japanese snacks?

759
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,600
No, I'm fine.

760
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,600
Western or Japanese snacks?

761
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,900
Neither.

762
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,600
Nor any drinks.

763
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,200
I'll take a beer and a snack.

764
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,100
One moment, please.

765
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,900
Drinking beer in first class is the best...

766
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,500
This rain is horrible.

767
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,600
Indeed.

768
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,100
Hopefully everything will be fine.

769
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,600
SKJ865, contact Tokyo Control. 118.90.

770
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:54,500
SKJ865, 118.90.

771
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,200
Tokyo Control.

772
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,600
SKJ865. Flight level, 390.

773
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,100
SKJ865, Tokyo Control. Roger.

774
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,900
Are you all right, captain?

775
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,200
It's okay.

776
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,000
My kid had a fever last night,

777
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,300
So I didn't really sleep much.

778
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,700
Should I request some coffee for you?

779
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,400
Please, if you would.

780
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,200
Is the ring okay?

781
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,000
Yeah.

782
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,600
But I can't let my guard down yet.

783
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,200
Why did she get out this quickly?

784
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,600
Hey, Masayo-san.

785
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,500
Give me chocolates.

786
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,600
Service for the cockpit?

787
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,800
Very rare for domestic flights.

788
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,200
It's Misawa.

789
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,000
I've brought the coffee.

790
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,100
Please come in.

791
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,400
Sorry for the intrusion.

792
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,600
Miss, you can't come in.

793
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,200
It's okay, Misawa.

794
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
She's your senior.

795
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,800
It's been a long time, Captain!

796
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,200
It's been almost five years since you resigned, right?

797
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,600
Seven years.

798
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,400
Has it been that long?

799
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,600
You too, Nakaya-san. Long time no see.

800
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,400
Hi.

801
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,000
I went to see "Josephine".

802
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,200
Really? I'm glad.

803
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,700
It was wonderful.

804
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,300
Really? Thank you.

805
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,000
We'll always come in support of you

806
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,600
Well then, Captain, I'll see you later.

807
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,200
Maki-san.

808
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,700
Here's chocolate.

809
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,500
Thank you.

810
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,000
Mouri-sensei, would you like one too?

811
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,400
Oh, thank you.

812
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,900
Delicious!

813
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,800
How could it be?

814
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,500
Uncle Mouri, there's an almond scent.

815
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,000
Yeah, it's cyanide poisoning.

816
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,400
It's the chocolate. There was poison in them!

817
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,900
The chocolates?

818
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:12,900
Dad!

819
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,300
It's okay.

820
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,600
If the chocolate you ate was poisoned,

821
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,800
the symptoms would have already manifested.

822
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,600
But why did Juri-san get poisoned?

823
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,600
The captain asked me to tell you,

824
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,100
in order not to alarm the other passengers,

825
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,900
please keep it a secret until we arrive at the airport.

826
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
Understood.

827
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,400
But how did the culprit manage to poison Juri-san?

828
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,900
It must have been in the chocolates.

829
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,700
Because she collapsed right after eating it.

830
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,700
I think the same way.

831
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
No way!

832
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,400
I don't know anything about it.

833
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:11,200
I bought this box of chocolates this afternoon
from a store in Ginza where we always get them.

834
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,100
I just opened it!

835
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,600
Right, Natsuki-san?

836
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,600
Sorry,

837
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,200
I wasn't watching clearly.

838
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,300
Natsuki-sun!

839
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,400
But you ate one too and nothing happened.

840
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,700
That means only a portion of the chocolate was poisoned, right?

841
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,200
If that's the case,

842
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,200
then how did the murderer manage to
make Juri-san choose the poisoned chocolates?

843
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,700
As for which chocolate Juri would choose first,

844
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,100
I think it's natural that her manager would know.

845
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,500
I didn't do it.

846
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,000
Besides, she chooses chocolate randomly every time!

847
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,500
I remember Juri-san did hesitate over which chocolate to choose.

848
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,600
Shut up! It's none of your business, kid!

849
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,400
Anyway, I'll take possession of those chocolates.

850
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,100
Okay.

851
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,100
As for the rest, we can only wait until we get to the airport
and let the police deal with it.

852
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:05,000
In order to preserve the crime scene,
please move to the seats at the back, everyone!

853
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,400
And the front lavatory is now off limits as well.

854
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,800
Apart from the chocolate,

855
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,200
all the things Juri-san ate since she boarded were

856
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,100
vitamin pills.

857
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,000
But it wasn't sure that Juri-san
would need to take vitamin pills.

858
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,300
I got it!

859
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,200
I know who the culprit is!

860
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,900
Dad!

861
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,700
Who? Who is the culprit?

862
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,100
After the deceased Juri-san boarded the plane,

863
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,800
she only ate two types of things.

864
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,700
These two type of things were

865
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:58,700
the suspicious chocolates and Tenko-san's vitamin pills.

866
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,700
You?

867
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,200
I'm sure you all understand now.

868
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,600
The culprit who killed Juri-san Maki on this plane...

869
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,800
is you, Tenko-san!

870
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,500
You must be kidding!

871
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,800
This is complete nonsense!

872
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,200
First of all, I don't even have a motive!

873
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,500
Are you sure?

874
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,000
Everyone here has a motive to kill Juri-san, right?

875
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,900
What are you talking about?

876
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,600
You're the make-up artist Natsuki-san Sakai, right?

877
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,200
Can you explain it?

878
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,300
I've been with Juri-san for the longest time.

879
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,500
So I believe I'm the one
most familiar with her relationships with others.

880
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,100
First of all, Ban-san.

881
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,900
He is the stage manager in this play,

882
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,400
but in fact, it had been our chairman Juri-san
doing all this job.

883
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:06,690
Originally, he was the one
who trained Juri-san to become an actress.

884
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,590
But now, it all reversed.

885
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:10,990
He didn't even dare to oppose Juri-san.

886
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:17,590
I've seen him getting reprimanded by his wife Tenko-san
for this matter several times.

887
00:57:19,990 --> 00:57:24,990
Narusawa-san agreed to divorce Juri-san three years ago.

888
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,490
But it seems he still has feelings for her now.

889
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:30,990
No matter how many times he begged her
for reconciliation, he was rejected.

890
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:38,490
Juri-san seems to be getting tired of
her young lover, Shinjo-san.

891
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:42,190
She even asked me to introduce her to someone cuter.

892
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,990
Then there is her manager, Masayo-san.

893
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:50,490
Juri-san always criticized her as dull and not smart enough,

894
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,290
and always insulted her in front of everyone.

895
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:58,390
And myself. I was always being abused by Juri-san,
who was very selfish.

896
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:02,790
I wanted to change jobs, but she interfered me every time.

897
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,890
I was happy that she liked me, but I also resented her.

898
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:10,090
Right? It's wouldn't be surprising
if any one of us wanted to kill her.

899
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,290
Wait, Genta-kun.

900
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,990
How can you eat at a time like this?

901
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,890
It's a shame to waste it.

902
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:22,990
Yummy.

903
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,990
If there was poison on her fingers...

904
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,890
Shinjo-san was the first one who touched Juri-san's hand.

905
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,490
Could it be that he poisoned it at that time?

906
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,490
No.

907
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,890
There were other possibilities.

908
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,390
What if the poison was on that signature pen?

909
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,790
Maybe the poison was on the switch for the reading light.

910
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:53,400
Or perhaps, the poison was placed on areas in the lavatory

911
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,490
Juri-san would have been likely to touch...

912
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:02,890
That's right, after Juri-san went into the lavatory,
she came out very quickly.

913
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:04,590
Wait a minute.

914
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,590
Before that...

915
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:11,490
I see.

916
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,590
So that's what happened.

917
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:15,090
That's why at that time...

918
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,590
I'm not feeling very well.

919
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:20,690
I've figured out this trick,

920
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,290
and the culprit who did it!

921
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:33,290
Hey, Uncle Mouri!

922
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:34,890
What's that?

923
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:35,990
What is it?

924
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:37,790
There's nothing there.

925
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:39,390
What?

926
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,390
Okay, right now.

927
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,290
Oh no!

928
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,490
What is it?

929
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,790
I thought there was something.

930
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,290
I gotta go to the toilet!

931
00:59:58,890 --> 01:00:00,490
What's wrong with this kid?

932
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,190
No choice.

933
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:04,590
Although this will be the first time...

934
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,690
You...

935
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:08,590
Stop putting on airs.

936
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:10,990
Oh no, I made a mistake.

937
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:11,990
Sonoko?

938
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,990
Me?

939
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,190
That's enough.

940
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,190
It's about time to tell the truth.

941
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,290
What?

942
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:18,990
Forget it.

943
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,490
It's not like this case is of a caliber
that requires "Sleeping Kogoro" to solve it.

944
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,890
Okay, then I'll tell the truth.

945
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,390
No way.

946
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:28,390
Great!

947
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,490
It's Auntie's show of deduction today!

948
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:34,690
Let's begin with the method the culprit used to
let Juri-san touch the poison.

949
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,090
That was not some great trick.

950
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,590
I'll talk about it now.

951
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:42,190
Right.

952
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:43,790
It was ear clearing.

953
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,190
Ear clearing?

954
01:00:45,790 --> 01:00:48,270
The culprit knew that Juri-san would definitely clear her ears

955
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,590
after she boarded the plane.

956
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:56,890
That is, using her thumb and forefinger
to pinch her nose and blow.

957
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,490
And the culprit knew she would use her right hand.

958
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,390
Perhaps some of you know that

959
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,390
this method of ear clearing
is among the first things taught to new divers.

960
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:10,490
The advanced diver might be able to clear ears
without pinching nose,

961
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,590
but Juri-san was just a beginner.

962
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,890
Nine times out of ten, she would have done it.

963
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:17,290
Is that right, dear?

964
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:20,990
Wait.

965
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:22,890
Why would you know this?

966
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,290
This method of ear clearing
is just like how Ayumi-chan just felt.

967
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:31,290
It's kind of embarrassing for a female to do
in front of someone of the opposite gender.

968
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,290
Besides, Juri-san was an actress.

969
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,090
And you were sitting next to her.

970
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:38,990
Although you're just a fool, you're still of the opposite gender.

971
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:40,490
Fool?

972
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,490
That was why Juri-san

973
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:45,490
went to the bathroom to clear her ears in private.

974
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:47,490
Then she returned to her seat,

975
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,680
picked up the chocolate with her right thumb and forefinger,

976
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,290
which touched her nose, and ate it.

977
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:56,090
And then, she licked the cocoa powder off her hand as usual.

978
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:59,190
It was because of this habit,

979
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:04,790
the poison entered her body without she knowing it.

980
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:08,090
What do you mean?

981
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,790
Where exactly was the poison?

982
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:16,190
It's kind of hard to breathe, isn't it?

983
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:18,790
Strange.

984
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:26,490
Actually, the poison had already slowly entered Juri-san's body.

985
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:27,690
So

986
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:30,290
the reason why she wasn't feeling well

987
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:33,090
was because the poison was being absorbed through her skin.

988
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,490
Skin?

989
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,690
If so, could it be...

990
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,590
Right.

991
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:41,790
Inside the car in the parking lot at Haneda Airport,

992
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:46,190
the culprit who applied the poisoned foundation

993
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,790
to both sides of Juri-san's nose to kill Juri-san

994
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,390
was Natsuki-san Sakai.

995
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:53,990
It was you.

996
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,190
That's impossible.

997
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,990
Although it was an interesting deduction.

998
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:09,890
Conan-kun told me

999
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:15,390
that you once scolded the kids who played with the foundation.

1000
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,090
It was the day you committed the murder.

1001
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,090
Although these kids were just playing with it,

1002
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,790
as a precaution against the possibility of their touching it,

1003
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:25,890
you still hid the foundation properly, right?

1004
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:30,090
Then, show me the evidence!

1005
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:31,590
Indeed.

1006
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:34,790
If we could find poison and foundation mixture

1007
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,890
on Juri-san's thumb and forefinger,

1008
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,290
it would have served as an evidence.

1009
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,090
But given that Juri-san licked her fingers,

1010
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,390
this evidence has disappeared.

1011
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:49,190
But there is other evidence.

1012
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:53,590
The poisoned foundation and the sponge.

1013
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:57,790
Smart as you are, you wouldn't have brought them aboard.

1014
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:02,990
It would also be dangerous
if you threw them in the airport trash cans.

1015
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:06,190
So if it were me, I would have sent them out,

1016
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,290
addressed back to my own home,

1017
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:09,490
via the mail.

1018
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,190
If we contact the post office at the airport

1019
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,890
and check her mail parcel, we'll know.

1020
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:20,090
Okay, can you tell us now?

1021
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,690
Your own house address.

1022
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:42,790
That woman destroyed my dream.

1023
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,490
Dream?

1024
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,290
I've always dreamed

1025
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:50,890
to become a great make-up artist in Hollywood.

1026
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,890
To fulfill my dream,

1027
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,290
I studied abroad at a makeup school in Los Angeles

1028
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,790
and learned to speak conversational English.

1029
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:02,890
Upon my return to Japan,

1030
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,090
while doing makeup for that woman,

1031
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,990
I continued to write letters to Hollywood seeking employment.

1032
01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:10,490
Then, one month ago,

1033
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,990
a Hollywood actress came to Japan.

1034
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:17,090
She recognized my make-up skill and aesthetic intelligence.

1035
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:19,990
Her agent asked me if I wanted to work with her.

1036
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,990
To me,

1037
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:24,490
it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

1038
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,090
But...

1039
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:31,190
But that woman intervened and destroyed this chance in secret!

1040
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,990
Maybe she really liked you and didn't want you to go.

1041
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:37,490
If she really needed me because of my make-up skills,

1042
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:38,790
then I could have forgiven her!

1043
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:41,990
But it was not like that.

1044
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:48,090
That woman just used me as a servant to her whims.

1045
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:51,990
After knowing this,

1046
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,190
I realized I had no choice but to do this.

1047
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:59,090
That woman had destroyed my pride as a make-up artist.

1048
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,090
Your pride as a make-up artist?

1049
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:06,890
Don't be ridiculous.

1050
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:12,190
Then why would you use makeup as a murder weapon?

1051
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,090
At this moment,

1052
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:18,290
you are not qualified to talk about pride!

1053
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:22,090
I...

1054
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:24,290
I...

1055
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:28,290
You are still young.

1056
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:32,090
You can start over after you've repaid your debt.

1057
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:45,290
What's going on?

1058
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:46,790
What's this feeling of dread?

1059
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:50,090
The nerves in my head are tingling.

1060
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:56,390
No!

1061
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:59,490
The snacks you just gave them!

1062
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:00,690
Tell them not to eat those snacks!

1063
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:02,890
If you don't hurry,

1064
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,290
the captains will be in danger!

1065
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:05,690
Are you stupid?

1066
01:07:05,790 --> 01:07:07,890
There's no poison in the snacks.

1067
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:08,790
I didn't mean snacks!

1068
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,890
The captains' fingers might have gotten poison on them!

1069
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,090
What?

1070
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:14,590
What's going on?

1071
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:15,790
Tell me what's going on!

1072
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:17,790
Yes, I'll be right there.

1073
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:22,290
Sorry for the intrusion.

1074
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:24,990
As expected.

1075
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:26,190
Captain!

1076
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:29,090
Captain, what happened?

1077
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:30,190
Are you all right?

1078
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:31,790
What's going on?

1079
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:32,890
Nakaya-san!

1080
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,190
Are you all right?

1081
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:34,890
Captain!

1082
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,890
No!

1083
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,490
The auto-pilot mode has been disengaged!

1084
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,490
Captain, pull yourself together!

1085
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:56,090
Captain!

1086
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:57,090
Get him up!

1087
01:07:57,090 --> 01:07:58,290
Move the seat out of the way!

1088
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:03,590
Captain!

1089
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:21,990
All right, the auto-pilot switch is...

1090
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:24,790
Shinjo-san.

1091
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:26,190
Good job, kid.

1092
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:27,890
Everything is all right now.

1093
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:29,090
Get a doctor over here right away!

1094
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:29,890
Got it.

1095
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:34,090
We're currently having a medical emergency on board.

1096
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:39,290
If there's a doctor on board,
please contact to the nearest flight attendant.

1097
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:51,290
Indeed, they've been poisoned by a fast-acting poison.

1098
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,290
I will administer first-aid now.

1099
01:08:53,290 --> 01:08:54,990
Please move them into the passenger cabin.

1100
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:55,690
Okay.

1101
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,390
Narusawa-san! Ban-san!

1102
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,490
Please give us a hand!

1103
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:58,990
Okay.

1104
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:01,590
Get the medical kit!

1105
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,190
Okay.

1106
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:07,190
Conan-kun, why would the captains also get poisoned?

1107
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:10,690
Just now, Juri-san went to the cockpit.

1108
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:15,990
At that time, the captain and co-pilot kissed Juri-san's hand.

1109
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,990
Oh, I see.

1110
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:19,990
So they touched the poison on her hand.

1111
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:22,190
How unlucky.

1112
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:24,590
If it was just a normal handshake,

1113
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:27,090
the poison would have only gotten on their palms,

1114
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:28,890
but wouldn't have gotten into their mouths.

1115
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:45,590
How is it going, doctor?

1116
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,990
Fortunately, they only ingested a small amount of poison.

1117
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,990
Their lives are not in danger.

1118
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:56,890
But they're both too unconscious to operate the plane.

1119
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,290
What?

1120
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:05,490
The captain and the co-pilot are unconscious?

1121
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:09,090
Excuse me, could I have your name?

1122
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:10,990
I'm a passenger, Shinjo.

1123
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:12,590
Shinjo-san.

1124
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:15,490
Do you know the current flight situation?

1125
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:20,190
The current altitude is 12,000 feet. Current speed is 280 knots.

1126
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:24,190
Fortunately, the ILS for landing has already been inputted.

1127
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:26,510
I have some experience operating the flaps and landing gears,

1128
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,490
so I can help operate it.

1129
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,590
Now I need instructions with regards to the timing.

1130
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:31,590
Got it.

1131
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:34,690
We have cleared all other landings and takeoffs,

1132
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,890
and put in immediate requests for other captains
to stand by at the tower.

1133
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:42,090
The current weather around Hakodate is unstable.

1134
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:47,890
All incoming and outbound flights have been suspended.

1135
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,890
We appreciate your patience during this period.

1136
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:51,990
Ladies and gentlemen.

1137
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:54,090
So...

1138
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,290
I'll take over the captain's seat.

1139
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:58,590
As for the co-pilot's seat...

1140
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:01,390
That's right, you'll take that seat, okay?

1141
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,990
You did a great job pulling up that control yoke just now.

1142
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:12,990
I've done it many times in the arcade center!

1143
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:16,790
Conan-kun! It's unfair!

1144
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:18,490
I want to sit there too!

1145
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:19,790
Me too!

1146
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:21,390
This is not a game.

1147
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:25,790
In addition, there is no need to operate now.

1148
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,390
Just during the landing,

1149
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,090
I may need to do a few things to operate.

1150
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:33,790
That's why I asked him to assist.

1151
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:34,690
Even so,

1152
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,190
why such a little kid?

1153
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:38,390
Just leave it to me.

1154
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,190
All right, we'll be landing in 15 minutes.

1155
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:43,390
Please return to the passenger cabin, everyone.

1156
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:51,790
Shinjo said he had some experience in this field.

1157
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:54,790
Maybe he has a license to fly some small plane like a Cessna.

1158
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:59,090
Dad, Mom seems to be asleep.

1159
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,590
What?

1160
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:08,590
Everyone, please hurry back to your seats
and fasten your seat belts tightly immediately.

1161
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:11,290
Dad.

1162
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,190
Just sit next to Mom, okay?

1163
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,390
Geez!

1164
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:15,890
Fine, I guess I have no choice.

1165
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,790
Hey, wake up!

1166
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:25,490
Hey!

1167
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:27,790
What the...

1168
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,390
You're Kiddo, right?

1169
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:44,190
What did you say?

1170
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,490
Stop playing dumb, asshole.

1171
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:48,510
How could there be any normal human being

1172
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,690
who'd let an elementary school student take the co-pilot's seat?

1173
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:53,490
So I'm exposed.

1174
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,290
Now the real Shinjo...

1175
01:12:56,290 --> 01:13:00,190
He's dressed up as Kiddo at Juri-san's villa in Hakodate.

1176
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:01,090
Right?

1177
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:04,490
When you appeared,

1178
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:06,290
Juri-san was not very happy.

1179
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,190
I guess she told Shinjo to be a fake Kiddo

1180
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,890
as entertainment for the party, right?

1181
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,390
You're really great!

1182
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:17,090
But there's another person
who thought Kiddo wouldn't give up just like that,

1183
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:18,790
and also went to Hakodate.

1184
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:23,090
He's probably chasing after the fake Kiddo right now.

1185
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:45,590
By the way, when are you planning to take the Jewel of Destiny?

1186
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:47,590
I don't want it anymore.

1187
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:50,290
You should know about it, right?

1188
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:54,090
The real star sapphire is supposed to be cold
when it touches your mouth.

1189
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:56,190
That's a fake.

1190
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:01,190
So you did that just to ascertain it.

1191
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:07,090
I guess it was to attract playgoers to see "Josephine"

1192
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:11,090
that they publicized that fake as the real one.

1193
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,390
What are you gonna do?

1194
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:13,990
Arrest me?

1195
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:15,390
Great Detective?

1196
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:16,590
Of course.

1197
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:20,290
After this giant mental bird returns to its nest.

1198
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,390
Flight SKJ865.

1199
01:14:23,390 --> 01:14:25,890
The Hakodate Tower is now taking over.

1200
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,290
Please change the frequency to 118.35.

1201
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,190
118.35, got it.

1202
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:38,190
This is Hakodate Tower. I'm the control chief, Uesugi.

1203
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:40,690
Captain Shimaoka will be in charge now.

1204
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,190
This is Shimaoka.

1205
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:46,490
Can you see the MCP, mode control panel?

1206
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:47,890
Yes, I saw it.

1207
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:51,890
Then please press the APP button on that.

1208
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:55,690
Then the plane will automatically lower itself onto the runway.

1209
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:56,690
Understood.

1210
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:58,290
APP.

1211
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:59,690
That one.

1212
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,390
Pressed!

1213
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:03,990
Who are you?

1214
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:05,890
I'm Conan Edogawa.

1215
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,290
Shinjo-san's assistant.

1216
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,590
Assistant? Is there a child sitting next to you?

1217
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:14,790
Kid, don't touch the control yoke or any of the other switches!

1218
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:15,490
Understand?

1219
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:18,990
We can relax for now.

1220
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:21,990
Do you know how to operate the flaps and landing gear?

1221
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,390
I do.

1222
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:27,790
My dad taught me how to fly a Cessna in Hawaii.

1223
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:28,790
I see.

1224
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,490
I knew I chose the right person.

1225
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,290
But I just learned the theory about it.

1226
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,490
I've never actually flown one.

1227
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:42,890
This weather is horrible.

1228
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:44,890
But I think they'll be able to land. Right?

1229
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,390
Heavy rain, huh?

1230
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,990
The wind is pretty strong too.

1231
01:16:07,590 --> 01:16:09,790
Don't fall, plane!

1232
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,190
It's the airport.

1233
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,590
Here it comes.

1234
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:30,990
Flight 865.

1235
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:32,190
Flaps to 1.

1236
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:37,990
Flaps to 5.

1237
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:41,390
Flaps to 10.

1238
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:46,490
Lower the landing gears. Flaps to 20.

1239
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:59,190
It's finally time to land.

1240
01:17:19,290 --> 01:17:19,990
What was that?

1241
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:21,290
It was the lightning.

1242
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,690
The plane has been struck by lightning.

1243
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:24,690
This is Flight 865

1244
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:27,890
The plane was struck by lightning
and all the displays have turned off!

1245
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:31,690
Calm down. Turn the white knob next to the instrument panel.

1246
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:36,090
They're on.

1247
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:36,690
Not yet.

1248
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,390
The auto-pilot light is not on!

1249
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,390
What?

1250
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:43,990
Abort the landing!

1251
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:46,490
Pull up on the control yoke as hard as you can!

1252
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:56,590
All right. Retract the landing gears.

1253
01:17:58,890 --> 01:17:59,790
Done.

1254
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:01,090
Good, just keep climbing up.

1255
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:05,590
No, the wind is blowing it off course!

1256
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:08,190
Turn right! Turn right!

1257
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:13,990
It'll hit the terminal building!

1258
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:15,290
Bring up the nose!

1259
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,390
Oh...no.

1260
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:54,790
Awesome!

1261
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:01,690
Are the airport and the cathetometer okay?

1262
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:03,890
Flight 865, can you hear me?

1263
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,590
Yes, I can hear you.

1264
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:07,190
What's the status of the damage?

1265
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:09,590
No injuries in the tower.

1266
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:11,590
But I'm afraid the runway can't be used for now.

1267
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:12,490
How is it going with your side?

1268
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,690
We've lost Engine Number 2.

1269
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,290
It's okay.

1270
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:18,690
The remaining three will be sufficient to make a landing.

1271
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:20,390
How about the balance?

1272
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,090
Balance is fine.

1273
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:24,990
We've adjusted the rudder
and cut the throttle down to position three.

1274
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:27,490
Good, tell me your current altitude and speed.

1275
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:29,790
3,000 feet and 200 knots.

1276
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:31,990
Adjust the flaps to 5.

1277
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,490
Level out.

1278
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,490
Turn the nose to 180 degrees.

1279
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:42,490
Ascend to 4500 feet.

1280
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:43,290
Got it.

1281
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:46,490
So now we gotta circle around and wait for the order, right?

1282
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:48,990
As long as the auto-pilot function is back,

1283
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,290
and the runway is restored to its original state,

1284
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,890
we'll be able to use the ILS to land again.

1285
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:58,590
Idiot! Didn't I tell you there aren't enough fire trucks?

1286
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:05,390
Put out the fire on the runway!

1287
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:13,890
Conan-kun, it's not good!

1288
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:15,790
One of the engines fell off!

1289
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:17,790
I know that, don't worry about it.

1290
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:21,390
The remaining three engines is enough to make a landing.

1291
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,590
And there's plenty of fuel...

1292
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:25,090
What's wrong?

1293
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:27,290
There's not much fuel left.

1294
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:27,790
What?

1295
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:31,490
Not much fuel?

1296
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:33,290
We're out of fuel?

1297
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,890
What's going on?

1298
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:37,690
Is it because the engine fell off?

1299
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:38,590
No.

1300
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:43,190
Generally, all four engines are supplied by different fuel tanks.

1301
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:45,490
The fuel valve is open.

1302
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,690
What's that thing called the fuel something?

1303
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:50,990
It's the fuel valve.

1304
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,890
If that switch is pressed,

1305
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,590
those valves that separate the fuel tanks will be opened,

1306
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,390
making it all one big fuel tank.

1307
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:00,590
Damn, how could this happen?

1308
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:08,190
It's all that old geezer's fault.

1309
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,490
We can't delay any longer.

1310
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:11,690
Yeah.

1311
01:21:11,890 --> 01:21:11,990
There should be a map over there.

1312
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,290
-Hakodate Tower.
-There should be a map over there.

1313
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:14,090
-This is Flight 865.
-There should be a map over there.

1314
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:14,690
-Someone bring it here.
-This is Flight 865.

1315
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:14,990
Someone bring it here.

1316
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:16,290
Mayday!

1317
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,490
Hakodate Tower! Please respond!

1318
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:20,090
Flight 865...

1319
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:23,190
This is Hakodate Tower. I can't hear you clearly.
Please speak louder.

1320
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,790
It's too noisy. I can't hear you clearly.

1321
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,690
What's going on exactly?

1322
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:28,390
Professor!

1323
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,090
We lost an engine.

1324
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,090
And the fuel is running out!

1325
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:33,390
What did you say?

1326
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:35,490
Map, map, map...

1327
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:37,090
That red one, right?

1328
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:38,390
Found it.

1329
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,290
Damn it!

1330
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:41,990
The auto-pilot, the runway, the fuel...

1331
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:44,290
Now even the radio is gone too!

1332
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,090
Are you saying the auto-pilot system is gone?

1333
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,790
So, are you piloting manually right now?

1334
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,690
Conan-kun, here's the map.

1335
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:52,490
Thank you.

1336
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:55,290
There's about 3,000 pounds of fuel left.

1337
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,590
If it needs 300 pounds per minute,

1338
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:59,490
we can only have 10 minutes of flight time left.

1339
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,790
We must find somewhere to land within that time.

1340
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:04,790
What do you mean by "somewhere"?

1341
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,490
It is impossible to recover the runway in 10 minutes.

1342
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,990
Chitose? How about the New Chitose Airport?

1343
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:13,590
It's a bit risky.

1344
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:15,990
We'll probably run out of fuel before we get there.

1345
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:17,690
What about other airports?

1346
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:19,390
Aren't there any other airports around here?

1347
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:20,290
There aren't.

1348
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:25,490
There might be an agricultural takeoff
and landing strip or a Self Defense Force base.

1349
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:28,190
But the length of the runway is not long enough.

1350
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:33,390
Then how about we try to land on the road instead?

1351
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:36,490
Hokkaido has many wide and straight roads.

1352
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:37,890
It's not possible.

1353
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:41,390
The span between the wheels on this plane is 11 meters.

1354
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:44,090
All roads spanning 12 or more meters across

1355
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:47,690
are required to have a central divider
as well as traffic signboards.

1356
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:50,590
And there would likely be houses and power lines around.

1357
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:52,090
How about a ranch?

1358
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:52,990
No way.

1359
01:22:53,690 --> 01:22:55,390
The ground would be too soft.

1360
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:58,390
It would be better to try a water landing in the sea nearby.

1361
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:02,290
No, the waves would overturn the plane.

1362
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:07,890
Where is it? Where is it?

1363
01:23:08,990 --> 01:23:11,690
There must be somewhere we can land.

1364
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:15,790
Somewhere long, straight and clear.

1365
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:22,990
What will happen if we can't land?

1366
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:23,990
If so...

1367
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:26,790
the plane would crash, right?

1368
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:29,190
But I don't want to die yet.

1369
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:31,490
Conan-kun, I know a place.

1370
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:35,190
A place that is long, straight and clear!

1371
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:41,490
It was showed on TV last time
when we were watching dolphins and whales.

1372
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:44,190
When we were watching dolphins and whales?

1373
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:45,390
Was it Murolan?

1374
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,390
The piers!

1375
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:53,690
Nippon Steel Pier.

1376
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:54,990
Nakau Pier.

1377
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:56,390
Motowanishi Pier

1378
01:23:56,390 --> 01:23:57,590
Muroran Pier.

1379
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,390
Nisseki Pier.

1380
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:00,490
Found it.

1381
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:01,890
Sakimori Pier!

1382
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:09,390
The length is about 1400 meters,
and the width is about 30 meters.

1383
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:11,490
But the width of this plane is...

1384
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,890
About 60 meters.

1385
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:17,690
But if we can let one side of the wings
hover over the sea, maybe...

1386
01:24:17,690 --> 01:24:18,390
Not possible.

1387
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:19,690
The distance is not long enough.

1388
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:24,590
The stopping distance of this plane
should be more than 2000 meters.

1389
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:27,790
And there is the problem
with the integrity of the ground surface.

1390
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:29,390
I don't know if it's lucky or unlucky,

1391
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:30,790
there is not much fuel left,

1392
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,090
and there are not many passengers.

1393
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:36,490
The lighter the weight,
the shorter the stopping distance will be.

1394
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:39,590
If the wind direction is good, it may be even shorter.

1395
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:42,490
I remember the weather report at Haneda said

1396
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:45,490
there will be strong winds from the west throughout the night!

1397
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,590
Are you sure, Mitsuhiko?

1398
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,390
Yes!

1399
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:50,290
This pier stretches east to west.

1400
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,690
If we land from the east against the west wind,

1401
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,990
we may be able to land safely.

1402
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:55,890
No way!

1403
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,790
When we collided with the control tower,

1404
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:00,690
my left hand was badly injured.

1405
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:03,890
I've been piloting the plane with my right hand alone.

1406
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:07,390
If we land manually,

1407
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:10,390
I'll have to hold the control yoke with both hands.

1408
01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:16,490
How is your vision?

1409
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:19,590
1.5 in both eyes.

1410
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:21,090
Do you have any disease?

1411
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:22,990
No.

1412
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,990
Your bust, waist and hip sizes?

1413
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:26,890
Well, my bust is...

1414
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:29,890
What?

1415
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,590
Good answer. You're passed.

1416
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:34,290
Sit here instead of me.

1417
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:35,890
What are you talking about?

1418
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:38,090
How can you let me fly a plane?

1419
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:41,290
Don't be nervous, I'll teach you how to operate it behind you.

1420
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:44,390
All you have to do is to hold the control yoke tightly.

1421
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,890
No, I can't do that!

1422
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,390
The plane!

1423
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:54,290
The plane is falling down!

1424
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:55,590
It's going to crash!

1425
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:57,290
Ran-nee-chan, sit down quickly!

1426
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,790
Now, slowly pull up the control yoke.

1427
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:07,090
Calm down.

1428
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,090
Good job!

1429
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:16,490
Easy, huh?

1430
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:17,590
What?

1431
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:19,790
What direction to Muroran?

1432
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:20,990
I'm looking for it.

1433
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:23,190
Found it.

1434
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:27,590
The flight path from Hakodate to Sapporo
happens to pass near Muroran.

1435
01:26:28,590 --> 01:26:30,490
The bearing is 023 degrees.

1436
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:32,190
023, right?

1437
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:39,790
We'll pass over a mountain.

1438
01:26:39,790 --> 01:26:41,490
The altitude must be more than 5,000 feet.

1439
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,190
Understood.

1440
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:43,690
Excuse me.

1441
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:46,790
Please tell the passengers that we are flying to Chitose.

1442
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:47,390
Yes, sir.

1443
01:26:47,790 --> 01:26:50,890
Besides, please transfer all the first-class passengers
on the second floor downstairs.

1444
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,290
If they find out that a high school girl is flying the plane,

1445
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:56,090
they will panic.

1446
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:59,190
You guys should go back to the cabin too.

1447
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:04,590
There's nothing else you can do here.

1448
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:10,090
I'd like for you to calm the other kids down.

1449
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,290
This is very important.

1450
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:15,790
If you can't do it, I'll ask someone else.

1451
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:17,890
How about it? Can you do it?

1452
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:19,090
Understood.

1453
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:20,290
We'll try.

1454
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:21,490
We'll take care of it!

1455
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:23,490
Very well. Then I'm counting on you.

1456
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:24,390
Yes, sir!

1457
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:28,590
I'm staying here.

1458
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:29,590
If anything happens...

1459
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:32,090
I'm the only one who can help Ran.

1460
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:38,990
Okay, then.

1461
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:42,690
I'll come back later to explain the other controls en route.

1462
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:44,090
There's not much time left.

1463
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:45,490
Let's go.

1464
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:54,990
Flight SKJ865.

1465
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:56,590
This is Hakodate Tower.

1466
01:27:56,590 --> 01:27:57,690
Do you copy?

1467
01:27:58,090 --> 01:27:59,290
Please respond!

1468
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:00,890
It's no use.

1469
01:28:01,290 --> 01:28:03,390
They're not even responding on the emergency line.

1470
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:04,890
Look!

1471
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:07,790
Flight 865 is flying away.

1472
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:10,490
Where are they going?

1473
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:24,490
That's the Great Shiratori Bridge, right?

1474
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:26,890
It's quite impressive.

1475
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:28,190
Isn't it, Shiratori-kun?

1476
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:30,290
No, Inspector.

1477
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:32,190
It should be the Hakucho Bridge.

1478
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:35,090
Coming to Muroran as you proposed on the way

1479
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,390
back from our business trip to Sapporo was well worth it.

1480
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:40,990
The Great Shiratori Bridge is so beautiful.

1481
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,090
I wish I could come here with Miwako-san one day.

1482
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:50,090
This is definitely not on my list.

1483
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:59,490
There are so many patrol cars.

1484
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:02,590
They're probably chasing after a vicious criminal.

1485
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:04,790
Well, let's take a look.

1486
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:10,590
Attention, all passengers.

1487
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:11,190
I'm scared.

1488
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:12,590
-There has been a small accident on the plane.
-I'm scared.

1489
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:13,290
There has been a small accident on the plane.

1490
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:13,990
-We'll be fine, right?
-There has been a small accident on the plane.

1491
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:14,690
-We are currently heading to New Chitose Airport.
-We'll be fine, right?

1492
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:18,290
We are currently heading to New Chitose Airport.

1493
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:19,890
The flight is normal.

1494
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,090
We are sorry for the inconvenience.

1495
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:21,790
-We're actually going to Muroran, right?
-We are sorry for the inconvenience,

1496
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:22,490
-and thank you for your understanding.
-We're actually going to Muroran, right?

1497
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,790
and thank you for your understanding.

1498
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:30,490
We're approaching Muroran.

1499
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:32,990
Lower the altitude to 2,000 feet.

1500
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:33,790
All right.

1501
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:44,790
I see it! There's a light!

1502
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:46,290
It's Muroran Port!

1503
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:48,690
Sakimori Pier is more to the left!

1504
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:50,490
It's on the other side of the Hakucho Bridge.

1505
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:52,990
It's bad!

1506
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:58,290
It's so dark ahead. I can't see anything.

1507
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:01,590
Hey, do we really have to land here?

1508
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:02,990
What now?

1509
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:04,990
There's no turning back.

1510
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:08,490
Is there really no problem, Conan-kun?

1511
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:15,990
What do you want?

1512
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:19,290
Looks like it's not good. I'm bailing.

1513
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:20,390
Good luck.

1514
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:22,190
Wait!

1515
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:22,790
Hey, don't go!

1516
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:27,690
Ran-nee-chan, lower the nose!

1517
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:40,190
Wait, what are you doing, exactly?

1518
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:41,990
Grab onto something!

1519
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:48,390
What? What's going on?

1520
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:50,490
It's okay. Don't worry.

1521
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:52,690
Hold the plane steady.

1522
01:30:59,590 --> 01:31:01,590
Kai... Kai...

1523
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:03,890
Kaitou Kid!

1524
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:06,690
See you later, young lady.

1525
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:11,490
I hope we'll meet again under the bright moonlight next time.

1526
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:13,490
Okay.

1527
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:14,390
Bye.

1528
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:27,690
He jumped off?

1529
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:30,390
Right, Shinjo-san was Kiddo.

1530
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:33,490
I see. That's why he pressed the depressurization button.

1531
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:36,690
He must have been afraid that the plane would crash, so he fled.

1532
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:38,690
I used to admire him that much!
It turns out that he's just a coward.

1533
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:42,790
Sonoko-nee-chan, it's a little early to say
that the plane is gonna crash, isn't it?

1534
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:44,090
But Conan-kun.

1535
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:46,290
What should we do now?

1536
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:51,490
Now it's up to us to land the plane, Ran-nee-chan.

1537
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:54,890
Don't worry, Ran.

1538
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:58,590
They always say that the wisdom of three fools
catches up with one pearl, right?

1539
01:31:58,590 --> 01:31:59,790
Believe me, we'll find a way!

1540
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:02,390
Come on, the saying goes...

1541
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:06,990
The saying goes, the wisdom of three fools
catches up with one wise man.

1542
01:32:06,990 --> 01:32:07,790
Was I wrong?

1543
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:15,590
Anyway, let's circle around the pier and see the situation.

1544
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:22,790
Help!

1545
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,890
Help me!

1546
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:28,790
I'm not Kiddo! You've got the wrong person!

1547
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:30,790
Then why were you running away?

1548
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:34,190
Because I stole a clock.

1549
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:36,890
That's right, then you must be Kiddo!

1550
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:38,490
Inspector Nakamori!

1551
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:39,390
What?

1552
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:41,090
What's that?

1553
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:46,890
Isn't it obvious? It's Kiddo.

1554
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:49,790
Kiddo?

1555
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:55,190
Then who are you?

1556
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,290
I told you you've got the wrong person.

1557
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:02,290
Sonoko-nee-chan, what's the situation?

1558
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:03,990
Not good at all.

1559
01:33:03,990 --> 01:33:06,290
There are some places with lights,

1560
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,190
but most of the place is pitch-black and I can't see anything.

1561
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:08,990
Damn it!

1562
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,490
Ran-nee-chan, are you all right?

1563
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:16,190
Ran, what's wrong?

1564
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:19,790
I don't know, I suddenly feel...

1565
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:22,690
Conan-kun.

1566
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,690
I can't do it after all.

1567
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:25,790
No way.

1568
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:27,290
You can do it, Ran-nee-chan!

1569
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:31,190
Not good. It's too dangerous with her like this.

1570
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:34,690
Sonoko-nee-chan, switch me for a moment.

1571
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:35,890
I need to go to the toilet.

1572
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,090
Toilet?

1573
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:38,590
I'll be right back.

1574
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:40,790
In case the radio comes back on,

1575
01:33:40,790 --> 01:33:42,690
put on your headsets!

1576
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:44,090
Wait a minute.

1577
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:49,390
Geez, how can you go to the toilet at a time like this?

1578
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,690
That's why I dislike that little brat.

1579
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:55,790
Hello?

1580
01:33:56,190 --> 01:33:56,990
Ran!

1581
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:58,590
Can you hear me, Ran?

1582
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:02,490
Shinichi?

1583
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:06,290
I'm calling from the control tower in Sapporo.

1584
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:09,490
It seems that you are in danger now.

1585
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:12,890
But it will be okay.

1586
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:16,990
As long as you follow my instructions, you'll land safely.

1587
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:20,990
I will protect you. Don't worry.

1588
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,090
Ran, are you there?

1589
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:27,490
Ran, answer him!

1590
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:30,490
What is this?

1591
01:34:30,890 --> 01:34:32,390
You're always saying such nice things.

1592
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:34,190
Do you know that?

1593
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:37,690
The lives of all the passengers are in my hands!

1594
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:39,890
Please don't talk like everything is fine!

1595
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:43,490
You're never here when I need you.

1596
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:45,290
All I get is a phone call.

1597
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:49,690
Even when you come back, you disappear again in the next moment.

1598
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:55,090
Every time.

1599
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,190
Every time.

1600
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:05,490
I've had enough. I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1601
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:07,390
Shinichi-ni-chan said...

1602
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:08,990
Ran, wait for me.

1603
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:10,490
Don't run away.

1604
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:12,090
I'll be back soon.

1605
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:15,090
You always leave me alone.

1606
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:18,590
He said he hopes you'll wait for him to come back.

1607
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:21,390
What do you take me for?

1608
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:30,490
I...

1609
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:41,990
I like you.

1610
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,190
Shinichi.

1611
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:50,190
Ran.

1612
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:51,590
Lights!

1613
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:53,090
I see lights!

1614
01:35:53,890 --> 01:35:56,090
Red lights are moving like a ribbon!

1615
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:56,790
What?

1616
01:36:03,390 --> 01:36:04,790
So that's it!

1617
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:13,790
Damn it, that bastard Kiddo!

1618
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:14,890
I won't let you escape!

1619
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:19,690
Kiddo is heading toward the pier!

1620
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,690
Got it.

1621
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:22,490
Kiddo is heading toward the pier!

1622
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:24,990
Team A and B, take opposite sides and wrap around!

1623
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:27,190
Line up the patrol cars along the edges of the pier!

1624
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:29,690
Team C, follow my lead.

1625
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,690
We'll besiege Kiddo!

1626
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:39,990
Grandpa, there are so many patrol cars.

1627
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:41,990
Something must have happened.

1628
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:44,090
It looks like they're coming this way.

1629
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:58,190
Ran, begin landing preparations!

1630
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:02,690
Those lights must be the patrol cars that Kiddo lured there.

1631
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:05,090
So, that's why Kiddo jumped...

1632
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:08,190
It was to use the lights from the patrol cars
as a guide light for the runway.

1633
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,990
That's my Kiddo-sama!

1634
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:12,890
I knew it!

1635
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:17,190
Ran, turn left and circle around once more.

1636
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:18,590
Got it!

1637
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:38,290
Kiddo, find Kiddo!

1638
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:40,290
He must be around here!

1639
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:41,290
Find him!

1640
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:45,890
Did you find him?

1641
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,790
I didn't.

1642
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:47,790
How's it going over there?

1643
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:52,290
The rest is up to you, Great Detective.

1644
01:37:54,190 --> 01:37:55,290
All passengers.

1645
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:58,090
This plane is going to make an emergency landing.

1646
01:37:58,490 --> 01:37:59,890
Please fasten your seat belts.

1647
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:01,990
Follow the flight attendant's directions.

1648
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,390
Please take off your pens and eyeglasses.

1649
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:06,590
Place your high heeled shoes in your seatback pocket.

1650
01:38:06,790 --> 01:38:07,790
Lean forward.

1651
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:10,190
Place your head in between your legs.

1652
01:38:12,790 --> 01:38:13,690
Ran, be ready.

1653
01:38:13,990 --> 01:38:15,390
Time to land.

1654
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,490
What's the current altitude and speed?

1655
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:21,090
Altitude: 700 feet. Speed: 140 knots.

1656
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:24,990
Good. Keep the descent rate at 3 degrees.

1657
01:38:25,090 --> 01:38:25,790
Sonoko.

1658
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,690
Lower the landing gear lever, pull the flap lever.

1659
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:31,690
Landing gear? Flap?

1660
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,090
The landing gear lever is that one.

1661
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:34,290
The flap lever is over there.

1662
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:35,290
Got it.

1663
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:37,290
Lower the landing gear lever.

1664
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:39,190
Pull up the flap lever.

1665
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:42,590
What?

1666
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:43,290
What's wrong?

1667
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:46,890
Shinichi, I think we've run out of fuel.

1668
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:48,290
Got it

1669
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:49,790
There is not a second chance.

1670
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,190
We must make it this time.

1671
01:39:07,790 --> 01:39:09,290
Inspector Megure...

1672
01:39:10,490 --> 01:39:12,190
That plane seems to be...

1673
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:14,290
It seems to be coming our way.

1674
01:39:15,790 --> 01:39:16,690
Why?

1675
01:39:16,690 --> 01:39:17,490
50.

1676
01:39:17,890 --> 01:39:20,590
Pull up the nose, and pull the thrust lever to the end!

1677
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:26,390
30.

1678
01:39:27,790 --> 01:39:28,490
20.

1679
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:30,490
Everybody out of the way!

1680
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:31,090
10.

1681
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:35,890
Bring the nose down!

1682
01:39:39,290 --> 01:39:39,990
Reverse thrust!

1683
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:54,190
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1684
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:56,190
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1685
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:01,990
Shinichi, there's a crane ahead!

1686
01:40:01,990 --> 01:40:03,290
We're going to hit it!

1687
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:03,890
Damn it!

1688
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:06,590
Rudder! Use your right foot to press the pedal!

1689
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:31,790
It stopped.

1690
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:33,190
The plane has stopped!

1691
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:33,990
Great!

1692
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:41,590
Kudo-kun.

1693
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:45,190
I guess you don't have it in your dictionary either, right?

1694
01:40:46,190 --> 01:40:47,890
The word, impossible.

1695
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:50,790
That's great, Ran-chan!

1696
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:54,990
Ran-nee-chan!

1697
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:56,890
Ran!

1698
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,990
Ran, hang in there!

1699
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:01,490
Sonoko?

1700
01:41:04,790 --> 01:41:07,090
So they just passed out.

1701
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:08,990
Not surprising.

1702
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:11,490
It was really hard for you two this time.

1703
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:17,390
Well done, Ran.

1704
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:53,590
Blood pressure and pulse are normal.

1705
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:55,790
You should be fine for now.

1706
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:57,990
But just in case, you should go to the hospital for a checkup.

1707
01:45:57,990 --> 01:45:59,490
Thank you.

1708
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:02,190
Is Sonoko okay?

1709
01:46:02,190 --> 01:46:05,490
She doesn't have any injuries.

1710
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:08,590
I think she fainted due to the shock.

1711
01:46:09,390 --> 01:46:10,790
I'm glad.

1712
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:14,990
Please write down your name and address here.

1713
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:15,890
Okay.

1714
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:19,890
And your bust, waist and hip sizes.

1715
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:25,490
That was really a beautiful landing.

1716
01:46:26,190 --> 01:46:27,090
Kai... Kai...

1717
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:29,690
Well then, see you later.

1718
01:46:30,090 --> 01:46:32,490
Tell me your three sizes next time.

1719
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:34,890
Kai... Kai...

1720
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:53,890
Hello?

1721
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:55,890
Ran, it's me.

1722
01:46:55,990 --> 01:46:57,190
Shinichi?

1723
01:46:57,790 --> 01:46:58,890
Hey...

1724
01:46:59,090 --> 01:47:01,390
It wasn't you who called earlier, right?

1725
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:03,690
I knew it.

1726
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:05,990
The Shinichi who called earlier was Kiddo.

1727
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:08,790
I thought it was weird.

1728
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,090
It was as if you were watching over me.

1729
01:47:11,090 --> 01:47:14,390
Plus, in the middle of it, I heard Conan-kun's shout like "whoa'.

1730
01:47:14,490 --> 01:47:15,090
Oh no.

1731
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:19,990
But at that point, Sonoko said that Kiddo had jumped off.

1732
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:22,690
In fact, I was quietly...

1733
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:23,690
I got it!

1734
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:25,890
So the one who jumped was Kiddo's assistant!

1735
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:26,890
What?

1736
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:30,090
Kiddo must have disguised himself
as someone and remained on the plane!

1737
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:31,490
That's good!

1738
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:33,090
That Shinichi is not you.

1739
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:34,690
Not good at all.

1740
01:47:34,990 --> 01:47:37,390
That was close. It almost got out.

1741
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:39,290
What is it?

1742
01:47:39,490 --> 01:47:42,190
It's a secret between me and Kiddo.

1743
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:43,690
Tell me!

1744
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,790
No way!

1745
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:47,290
Why don't you deduce it? You're a detective, aren't you?

1746
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:49,190
How can I possibly deduce that?

1747
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:51,590
Then wait until you arrest Kiddo and ask him.

1748
01:47:51,790 --> 01:47:53,190
You little...
