1
00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.930
A racing second hand,
a shooting comet!

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.330
Conan's logic will moisten
hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.040
Today's proof is quite unique!
Let's change our way of thinking!

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.090
He sees the
single truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.800
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:38.939
The 3rd Set of Fingerprints Murder Case.

7
00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.689
I'm done with my bath,
Ran-neechan!

8
00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.819
Are you busy tomorrow,
Conan-kun?

9
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.019
No, I have no plans. Why?

10
00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:55.789
One of Dad's friends just called

11
00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.999
and invited us over for
a BBQ tomorrow afternoon!

12
00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:03.589
He's a friend of yours?

13
00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.559
His name's Teraoka-san.

14
00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:10.899
He really watched over me
when I was a police detective.

15
00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.389
Now he's chief inspector of
Investigation Section â™ª4.

16
00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:20.059
That's the group in charge
of handling gangs! I'll come!

17
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:24.229
Real police detectives have
lots of interesting stories!

18
00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.899
I can't wait!

19
00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.529
Teraoka

20
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:36.059
You'd always say
my logic was wrong,

21
00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:40.249
but then you'd wind up
being wrong yourself!

22
00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.169
He's still like that.

23
00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:48.879
Now you're a famous detective!
To be honest, it's hard to believe!

24
00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.339
Please give me some credit...

25
00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.809
Here, have some-- Huh?

26
00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.139
You haven't had a drop to drink!
That's not like you!

27
00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.109
I'm off duty, but there's
no telling what might come up.

28
00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.659
This is an awesome car!
It must be expensive!

29
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:19.199
Cars are my only hobby,
so I spend my money on them.

30
00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.149
Say, Ran-chan. Did you have
something to do today?

31
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:25.679
Nothing at all!

32
00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:28.359
I'm sorry for calling out of the blue!

33
00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.649
He suddenly decided
last night and all...

34
00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:36.129
At 9:00, he left his room and said,
"I'm bringing Mori over tomorrow!"

35
00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.899
He normally plans things
out well in advance...

36
00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:45.109
I just thought it would be nice...

37
00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:56.159
Hello?

38
00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.579
Maybe something happened?

39
00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:02.659
What?!

40
00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:07.529
Where are you?!

41
00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.419
Alright! I'll be right there!

42
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.859
I won't tell anyone!
I'll come alone! Alright?!

43
00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.239
I'll be waiting!

44
00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.659
Sorry. I'll be back soon.

45
00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.349
Did something happen?

46
00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:29.519
That was Matsuyama, a gang leader.

47
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.819
Apparently, he accidentally
killed someone last night.

48
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.359
What?!

49
00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:39.059
He's wanted to change his ways,
and I've been giving him advice.

50
00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.699
I'm going to convince
him to turn himself in.

51
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.729
All by yourself?
That's not a good idea.

52
00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.859
If he were to run away,
you'd be held responsible!

53
00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.679
And it's dangerous!
You should contact HQ and--

54
00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:59.139
I can't! I promised I would
go alone and tell no one!

55
00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:01.969
But you're off duty,
and without a gun--

56
00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:06.859
I don't need a gun!
He called me out of trust!

57
00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:09.819
I can't betray that!

58
00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.149
Then I'm coming with you!

59
00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:13.029
What?!

60
00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:16.359
Otherwise, I'll call Inspector Megure!

61
00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:17.319
Why, you...

62
00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:24.499
Alright, fine. But only
I'll meet him! Got that?!

63
00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.859
Yes. So where is he?

64
00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:30.399
Kowan Wharf, Warehouse 13.

65
00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.809
I'll get my jacket. Wait by the car.

66
00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:35.169
I'll get your jacket!

67
00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:37.759
No! You just stay here!

68
00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:51.109
What's taking him so long?

69
00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:01.369
Sorry. It took a while to find the key.

70
00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.419
What was that sound?

71
00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.269
What was that sound?
Could it have been?!

72
00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:30.729
Will Dad be all right after
having all that alcohol?!

73
00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:33.479
Ran-neechan! Let's go
to Kowan Wharf too!

74
00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.229
You're worried about him,
aren't you?! I'll get a taxi!

75
00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.149
Conan-kun!

76
00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:42.119
Dad...

77
00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:45.579
Kowan Wharf

78
00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.679
What are you doing here?!

79
00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:58.979
Sorry! We were worried about you!

80
00:06:58.979 --> 00:06:59.929
Where's Teraoka-san?

81
00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:02.309
Back there.

82
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:04.889
He told me to wait here.

83
00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.849
Let's check it out, too!

84
00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:12.729
What are you saying?!
That would put him in--

85
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.859
Dad!

86
00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.649
He doesn't have a gun!

87
00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:19.069
Meaning the other guy does!

88
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:21.819
Wait, Conan!

89
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:36.749
Senpai...

90
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:45.809
So when you tried to get
him to turn himself in,

91
00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:49.849
he pulled out a gun and demanded
your money and credit cards?

92
00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:53.459
Yes. It seems he planned
to skip the country...

93
00:07:56.809 --> 00:08:01.359
I told him he'd never get away,
and that we should talk it over.

94
00:08:01.359 --> 00:08:05.269
I put my hands up and
walked slowly toward him.

95
00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:11.189
I jumped at him and tried
to snatch the gun away--

96
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.169
--when it went off.

97
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:22.309
It was just an unfortunate
accident, Inspector Megure!

98
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:25.089
Who exactly did Matsuyama kill?

99
00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:29.059
I don't know his name,
but he said he was a gambling client.

100
00:08:29.359 --> 00:08:32.399
And your relation with Matsuyama?

101
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:37.359
They had talked about
him getting out of a life of crime!

102
00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:40.149
That's why he
came alone to meet him!

103
00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:45.229
That was another mistake.
I take full responsibility.

104
00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:47.119
My judgment was too weak!

105
00:08:47.119 --> 00:08:48.779
Senpai...

106
00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:55.479
If my theory is correct, this was
no accident. It was a murder!

107
00:08:55.479 --> 00:08:57.669
Teraoka-san is the killer!

108
00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:03.469
But there's no proof of it!

109
00:09:05.859 --> 00:09:06.839
Here you are.

110
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:08.729
Thank you.

111
00:09:11.359 --> 00:09:15.309
You've probably already
seen on TV or in the papers,

112
00:09:15.309 --> 00:09:18.269
but Matsuyama's victim was
indeed a gambling client.

113
00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:21.979
The murder happened
around 8:00, two nights ago,

114
00:09:21.979 --> 00:09:25.109
and the weapon was a knife, not a gun...

115
00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:31.189
That's right. We still don't
know why he didn't use a gun,

116
00:09:31.189 --> 00:09:36.459
but it looks like a gambling
debt was at the root of it all.

117
00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:40.169
What about Teraoka-senpai's involvement?

118
00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:46.519
A formal decision is forthcoming,
but he did go alone

119
00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:50.179
and allowed Matsuyama to die,
accident or not...

120
00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:52.969
He'll probably lose a few months' pay.

121
00:09:52.969 --> 00:09:54.729
I see...

122
00:09:54.729 --> 00:09:59.689
Which means nobody doubts
Teraoka-san's testimony...

123
00:09:59.939 --> 00:10:05.019
Oh, there is one thing
we've kept from the media--

124
00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:07.649
we found three sets of
fingerprints on the gun.

125
00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:09.159
Three sets?!

126
00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:13.729
One is Matsuyama's,
and another is Inspector Teraoka's.

127
00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:20.359
We've determined that his prints
got there during the struggle,

128
00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:22.629
but we don't know who
the others belong to.

129
00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:26.519
Maybe from someone
in Matsuyama's gang?

130
00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:31.339
No. We got all their prints,
but none matched up.

131
00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:34.509
Maybe an unrelated arms dealer?

132
00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:40.479
We've considered that too,
but we don't have any leads.

133
00:10:40.989 --> 00:10:48.239
Who does the third set belong to?
If that gun's owner is who I suspect it is...

134
00:10:49.439 --> 00:10:53.899
Inspector! You told Teraoka-san
about those fingerprints, right?!

135
00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.119
How did he look at the time?!

136
00:10:56.119 --> 00:11:01.579
Now that you mention it,
he seemed extremely shocked.

137
00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:07.729
No doubt about it!
Matsuyama was shot by Teraoka-san!

138
00:11:07.729 --> 00:11:10.219
The third set of prints is the proof!

139
00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:20.662
Teraoka residence.

140
00:11:21.722 --> 00:11:23.392
Oh, Inspector Megure!

141
00:11:23.722 --> 00:11:27.352
I'd like to discuss
yesterday's incident.

142
00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:33.802
That was weird for Inspector
Megure to ask me

143
00:11:33.802 --> 00:11:37.222
to come to Teraoka-senpai's
house at this hour!

144
00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:42.032
And me and Conan-kun!
I wonder if something happened...

145
00:11:42.512 --> 00:11:45.682
And I called the inspector
using the old man's voice!

146
00:11:45.682 --> 00:11:48.002
Everything's all set!

147
00:11:50.512 --> 00:11:54.892
I didn't know the inspector
had called you here too...

148
00:11:54.892 --> 00:11:56.642
Please have a seat.

149
00:11:56.642 --> 00:12:00.972
To be honest, I don't know
why he called us here, either.

150
00:12:01.552 --> 00:12:03.432
Say, Miss.

151
00:12:03.802 --> 00:12:06.012
There's a show I wanna see...

152
00:12:06.222 --> 00:12:10.932
There's a TV you can watch
in the spare room upstairs.

153
00:12:10.932 --> 00:12:12.902
Yaiba Punch!

154
00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:17.362
This room is for when
we have guests over.

155
00:12:17.762 --> 00:12:20.822
You and Ran should come
spend the night sometime.

156
00:12:20.822 --> 00:12:21.952
Yeah!

157
00:12:41.012 --> 00:12:43.182
So this is Teraoka-san's room.

158
00:12:58.142 --> 00:13:00.682
There's only one missing...

159
00:13:02.392 --> 00:13:03.452
It's in the trash?!

160
00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:09.702
A felt rag?

161
00:13:12.142 --> 00:13:16.102
Smells of oil. Did he use
the inside of this to--

162
00:13:23.682 --> 00:13:26.682
So what did you have to say, Mori-kun?

163
00:13:26.682 --> 00:13:29.182
You're the one who
had something to say...

164
00:13:29.182 --> 00:13:34.392
What?! You called me and said
you had something to say!

165
00:13:34.802 --> 00:13:37.652
But the one who called me was--

166
00:13:38.932 --> 00:13:40.982
Here we go again...

167
00:13:41.392 --> 00:13:48.852
Very well. Let us forget the
details and get down to business.

168
00:13:48.852 --> 00:13:53.412
But first, please have a
seat, madam. You too, Ran.

169
00:13:55.972 --> 00:14:00.592
Teraoka-senpai. You killed
Matsuyama, didn't you?

170
00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:08.682
I never expected you to say that!
I see you haven't changed one bit!

171
00:14:09.012 --> 00:14:14.932
When you met Matsuyama,
you hit him with a knockout blow,

172
00:14:14.932 --> 00:14:20.422
put the gun in his hand, aimed it
at his chest, and pulled the trigger.

173
00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:24.352
Am I wrong?

174
00:14:24.352 --> 00:14:28.322
Ridiculous! What kind
of joke is this, Mori?

175
00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:32.742
First, when you invited
us to the BBQ yesterday,

176
00:14:33.302 --> 00:14:35.752
you didn't take even
a single sip of beer.

177
00:14:37.472 --> 00:14:39.212
I already told you--

178
00:14:39.472 --> 00:14:44.142
Yes. Just as you said,
even off-duty officers don't know

179
00:14:44.142 --> 00:14:46.642
when they might be called in.

180
00:14:46.642 --> 00:14:51.092
So you refrained from drinking.
I thought so, too.

181
00:14:51.892 --> 00:14:57.062
However, you were very
intent on checking the time.

182
00:14:57.602 --> 00:15:03.472
Perhaps because you knew when
Matsuyama would call you?

183
00:15:03.472 --> 00:15:07.572
That's why you left your phone
on your belt and didn't drink.

184
00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:13.532
I always have my phone on me!
In case I get an emergency call!

185
00:15:13.532 --> 00:15:15.492
Do you have it now?

186
00:15:16.352 --> 00:15:19.472
It's in my room now,
but normally it's--

187
00:15:19.472 --> 00:15:22.382
Next, when you spoke with
Matsuyama on the phone,

188
00:15:22.802 --> 00:15:27.972
you whispered at first but
then started to shout!

189
00:15:27.972 --> 00:15:29.172
What?!

190
00:15:32.642 --> 00:15:36.932
Where are you?! Alright!
I'll be right there!

191
00:15:36.932 --> 00:15:41.852
Almost as if to let us hear
what was being discussed.

192
00:15:42.642 --> 00:15:47.862
Then, even though you were in
a hurry, when I asked you about it,

193
00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:54.512
you purposely stopped and
explained the call in great detail.

194
00:15:54.512 --> 00:15:58.442
That was Matsuyama, a gang leader.

195
00:15:58.442 --> 00:16:01.542
Apparently, he accidentally
killed someone last night.

196
00:16:02.182 --> 00:16:07.682
But half of what you said was a lie.

197
00:16:07.682 --> 00:16:14.472
I think he really called you about
his murder the night before.

198
00:16:14.472 --> 00:16:18.352
You then made arrangements with him.

199
00:16:18.852 --> 00:16:25.312
One was to call you at
12:00 the following day.

200
00:16:25.682 --> 00:16:29.282
So the person he talked to was...

201
00:16:29.862 --> 00:16:32.142
Actually him, during the whispering.

202
00:16:32.142 --> 00:16:34.892
He acted the rest out by himself.

203
00:16:34.892 --> 00:16:37.242
The caller had
probably hung up by then.

204
00:16:37.722 --> 00:16:42.642
Then, anticipating I would
suggest going together,

205
00:16:42.642 --> 00:16:45.722
he said he would
meet Matsuyama alone.

206
00:16:46.642 --> 00:16:47.672
What for?

207
00:16:48.142 --> 00:16:54.472
So that I would vouch
that you met him unarmed.

208
00:16:56.182 --> 00:17:02.852
That's why you needed me
near you when he called.

209
00:17:03.352 --> 00:17:06.552
He suddenly decided
last night and all...

210
00:17:06.552 --> 00:17:10.862
At 9:00, he left his room and said,
"I'm bringing Mori over tomorrow!"

211
00:17:11.352 --> 00:17:16.912
In other words,
I was used as part of your plan.

212
00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:20.852
But Mori-kun! He didn't have the gun

213
00:17:20.852 --> 00:17:25.872
when he got out of the car
at Kowan Wharf, right?

214
00:17:26.142 --> 00:17:29.222
It seemed that way to me, at least.

215
00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:33.802
He purposely didn't wear his
jacket to make it seem that way,

216
00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:39.052
despite having gone through the
trouble of getting it before leaving.

217
00:17:40.972 --> 00:17:42.722
So where was the gun?

218
00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:45.692
Attached to his right ankle.

219
00:17:48.972 --> 00:17:53.182
He had hidden the gun in his room.

220
00:17:53.182 --> 00:17:59.072
That's why he ardently refused when
his wife offered to get his jacket.

221
00:17:59.512 --> 00:18:01.832
No! You just stay here!

222
00:18:02.472 --> 00:18:04.912
Well? Am I wrong?

223
00:18:05.472 --> 00:18:08.552
This is all speculation;
you have no proof.

224
00:18:08.552 --> 00:18:11.012
It won't hold up in court.

225
00:18:11.012 --> 00:18:17.842
No, there is proof. The third
set of fingerprints on the gun.

226
00:18:18.222 --> 00:18:20.012
The third set of fingerprints?

227
00:18:20.012 --> 00:18:23.932
As we waited for you to
come back out yesterday,

228
00:18:24.512 --> 00:18:28.272
your wife looked uneasily
up at the upstairs room.

229
00:18:29.892 --> 00:18:34.392
At the time, I thought
she was just worried

230
00:18:34.392 --> 00:18:40.052
because you were going to
meet Matsuyama without a gun.

231
00:18:40.052 --> 00:18:42.222
But I was wrong.

232
00:18:42.222 --> 00:18:50.002
She was worried because you
were going to meet him with a gun.

233
00:18:50.642 --> 00:18:56.512
In other words, she knew you
had a gun hidden in your room!

234
00:18:58.102 --> 00:19:03.862
Most likely, she found
your gun by accident

235
00:19:03.862 --> 00:19:07.512
and picked it up without thinking.

236
00:19:07.512 --> 00:19:09.882
Then she quickly put it back.

237
00:19:11.352 --> 00:19:15.352
She probably wanted to ask
about it but was too afraid to

238
00:19:15.352 --> 00:19:18.712
and continued to live
in constant uneasiness.

239
00:19:21.012 --> 00:19:27.432
Clueless about this, you took
the gun and killed Matsuyama

240
00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:29.552
in a fake accident.

241
00:19:29.552 --> 00:19:36.512
The third set of fingerprints
belonged to her.

242
00:19:36.512 --> 00:19:39.722
Is this true?

243
00:19:39.722 --> 00:19:41.682
Mori-san is exactly right!

244
00:19:42.242 --> 00:19:43.432
Misako!

245
00:19:50.892 --> 00:19:55.802
Would you care to explain your
motive for killing Matsuyama?

246
00:19:55.802 --> 00:19:58.112
Don't tell me he was--

247
00:19:58.472 --> 00:20:03.572
--paying me off. I leaked police
info to him in exchange for money.

248
00:20:03.892 --> 00:20:05.032
Come again?!

249
00:20:05.512 --> 00:20:10.142
It was just pocket change
and unimportant info at first!

250
00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:14.052
I grew more and more numb to it all,
and before I realized it,

251
00:20:14.052 --> 00:20:17.802
I had gone beyond
the point of no return.

252
00:20:17.802 --> 00:20:21.772
Then I got a call from him
at around 8:00 two nights ago!

253
00:20:23.052 --> 00:20:27.932
He had killed someone.
He wanted money to skip the country;

254
00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:31.892
he said if he got caught,
I would go down too!

255
00:20:32.552 --> 00:20:35.762
I decided to kill him then.

256
00:20:35.762 --> 00:20:41.862
I told him I'd have the money
the next day and to call me at 12:00.

257
00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:49.662
I had secretly kept the gun
should any such situation come up.

258
00:20:50.722 --> 00:20:53.332
The rest was all as Mori said.

259
00:20:54.602 --> 00:20:57.292
I apologize for my treachery.

260
00:22:32.052 --> 00:22:37.442
People sure do change.
Like Teraoka-senpai...

261
00:22:40.552 --> 00:22:43.402
But you heard what he said...

262
00:22:43.722 --> 00:22:46.952
You really have become
a great detective!

263
00:22:47.352 --> 00:22:50.282
He looked kind of happy!

264
00:22:50.682 --> 00:22:52.412
I see...

265
00:22:53.642 --> 00:22:55.602
I guess he's really--

266
00:22:55.602 --> 00:23:01.602
You know how Teraoka-san
hid the gun in a video case?

267
00:23:01.602 --> 00:23:04.712
You don't have any dangerous
stuff hidden, do you?

268
00:23:10.602 --> 00:23:11.932
Huh?

269
00:23:14.182 --> 00:23:14.852
That's--

270
00:23:15.102 --> 00:23:17.312
There's something else inside it...

271
00:23:23.182 --> 00:23:24.522
Wait, Ran!

272
00:23:27.972 --> 00:23:28.952
Dad!

273
00:23:28.952 --> 00:23:32.372
Blame them, not me!

274
00:23:33.302 --> 00:23:36.052
This is all your fault!

275
00:23:36.052 --> 00:23:37.532
Dad!

276
00:23:37.532 --> 00:23:40.482
Don't hide those there!

277
00:23:45.042 --> 00:23:47.572
Was this man's kid abducted?!

278
00:23:48.252 --> 00:23:51.032
Dad! You have a clue
about the kidnapper?!

279
00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:55.872
Keita-kun is by lots of crabs
and a bubble-spouting whale!

280
00:23:56.582 --> 00:23:58.582
This license plate is fake?!

281
00:23:59.662 --> 00:24:02.962
Oh no! Once the kidnapper
gets the money, Keita-kun is--

282
00:24:05.002 --> 00:24:07.632
That's it! The crabs and the whale!

283
00:24:08.622 --> 00:24:10.002
On the next Conan--

284
00:24:10.002 --> 00:24:12.252
"The Crabs and Whale Kidnapping Case."

285
00:24:14.189 --> 00:24:16.547
Next Conan's Hint:

286
00:24:16.547 --> 00:24:16.553
Next Conan's Hint:
Chairs and Tables.

287
00:24:16.553 --> 00:24:18.728
Chairs and Tables.
