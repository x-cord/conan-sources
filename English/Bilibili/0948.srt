00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,970
Welcome to...

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,270
"Tatsuki Naito (29), Host" -the Beika Dinosaur Museum show.

3
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,470
Today's performance features two stars of the Cretaceous era:

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,470
Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops.

5
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,670
Enjoy the show, everyone.

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,770
Here you go.

7
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,170
We give these out to everyone who attends the show.

8
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,170
Thank you.

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,970
"Nobuhisa Shida (55), Director" -It's only once a day,

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,070
so enjoy yourselves.

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,470
Here you go.

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,670
Thank you.

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,470
Oh, no!

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,270
Tyrannosaurus is on a rampage!

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,270
Be careful, everyone!

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,070
-Ayumi! -Ayumi!

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,570
Looks like Triceratops has come to stop him!

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,370
Are you okay?

19
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,770
Are you hurt?

20
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,370
-I'm fine. -Sorry for scaring you.

21
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,570
It's okay.

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,870
The eternal rivals, Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops!

23
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,570
Who will win?

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,370
It's the showdown of the century!

25
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,870
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,970
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,770
An intense battle between two dinosaurs.

28
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,770
What will happen at the end of their fight?

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

30
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

31
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,970
His name is Detective Conan!

32
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:45,827
"The Man Crushed by a Dinosaur"

33
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,627
That was so intense.

34
00:03:50,627 --> 00:03:52,727
Yes, it was very exciting.

35
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:54,527
It was scary, though.

36
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,027
Were you hurt?

37
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:59,627
Nope. The host helped me.

38
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:03,527
Anyway, those were rather realistic dinosaurs.

39
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,327
Yeah.

40
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,427
What was that?

41
00:04:06,427 --> 00:04:10,027
It sounded like something rather large collapsing.

42
00:04:13,227 --> 00:04:15,627
Oh, no. What should I do?

43
00:04:15,627 --> 00:04:18,327
Miss, what happened?

44
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:21,127
"Yua Katsuragawa (26), Clerk" -The dinosaur fossil inside...

45
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,327
It's an emergency!

46
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:28,127
The dinosaur bones fell apart!

47
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:30,227
Get the director!

48
00:04:30,227 --> 00:04:32,327
Got it!

49
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:34,527
"Yoshito Kuchiki (35), Curator" -I don't believe it!

50
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,227
My Brachiosaurus!

51
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,827
Gosh. How did this happen?

52
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:40,227
There's a person!

53
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:42,027
There's someone crushed underneath it!

54
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:44,027
Hurry! We need to get them out quickly!

55
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,527
Yeah...

56
00:04:47,627 --> 00:04:49,127
The director...

57
00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:50,827
That's the director!

58
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,027
What?

59
00:05:03,227 --> 00:05:05,127
What's this?

60
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:10,527
"Beika Dinosaur Museum"

61
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:14,327
He was crushed by a dinosaur.

62
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,427
It's hard to believe.

63
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:19,827
Stay away from the crime scene, kids.

64
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:22,627
Officer Takagi, was this an accident?

65
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,627
Oh, actually...

66
00:05:24,627 --> 00:05:26,527
We don't know anything yet.

67
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:31,527
You're saying this second exhibition hall was closed the whole time?

68
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:32,927
Yes.

69
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,927
The exhibition isn't for a while.

70
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:38,427
All the exhibits were under construction.

71
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:42,427
We were in the middle of temporarily assembling this Brachiosaurus.

72
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:46,727
The director was just assigned to this museum last month.

73
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:48,827
He was rather excited about it.

74
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:51,827
It's possible he came to check on the exhibits.

75
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:54,727
I can't believe he got caught in this accident.

76
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,927
Actually, about that...

77
00:05:56,927 --> 00:06:01,127
We determined the wires supporting the fossil

78
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,927
were cut by someone.

79
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,427
-What? -They were cut?

80
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:10,327
You're right.

81
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,727
So were these. And these.

82
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:16,427
But it would take a lot of time to cut all these wires.

83
00:06:16,427 --> 00:06:19,227
Yes. That's why we believe

84
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:21,927
the culprit cut most of the wires beforehand,

85
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:26,827
and cut the last one when the director arrived.

86
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,027
The tool we believe was used to cut the wires

87
00:06:29,027 --> 00:06:32,527
was right next to the collapsed fossil.

88
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:35,527
According to reception and security,

89
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:40,427
nobody entered or exited the building or grounds

90
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:42,427
before or after the fossil collapsed.

91
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:46,627
Which means one of us...

92
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:48,827
Murdered Director Shida?

93
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,727
Murdered?

94
00:06:52,727 --> 00:06:55,827
Agasa, take those children somewhere else.

95
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:58,227
Sorry. Come on, let's go.

96
00:06:58,227 --> 00:07:00,827
-We shouldn't get in the way of the police. -What?

97
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:04,627
What were each of you doing when the fossil collapsed?

98
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:07,227
The host had nothing to do with it.

99
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,827
He was onstage the whole time.

100
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:12,627
Yeah. Thanks, miss.

101
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:15,727
"Beika Dinosaur Museum"

102
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:23,527
Isn't this...

103
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:28,827
I see.

104
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:34,527
Yua Katsuragawa, you were alone in the office the whole time?

105
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:35,727
Yes.

106
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:37,227
And Kuchiki?

107
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:40,127
I was in the museum's prep room.

108
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,827
I was preparing the fossils for display... alone.

109
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:49,127
Which means the two of you don't have alibis.

110
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:54,127
Inspector, I think I know who the culprit is.

111
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,627
What?

112
00:07:56,627 --> 00:08:00,227
Kuchiki, are you saying I did it?

113
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:02,327
Yeah, that's right. You did it.

114
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:04,127
It was obviously you.

115
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:07,627
Hold on. Why do you think she did it?

116
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:10,327
-Because Director Shida... -Kuchiki!

117
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:13,827
Some things shouldn't be said.

118
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,327
The police will find out during their investigation anyway.

119
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:20,527
The director was trying to make her his.

120
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,127
Katsuragawa, is that true?

121
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:29,927
It's true. My mother's been ill.

122
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:33,827
When I talked to the director about it,

123
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:37,327
he said he'd pay her medical bills if I became his girlfriend.

124
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:41,327
Director Shida was an awful person.

125
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:45,127
But I didn't do it!

126
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:49,727
Besides, I'm not the only one who wanted to kill him!

127
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:52,727
Kuchiki, you hated the director!

128
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,627
Naito, you knew, didn't you?

129
00:08:55,627 --> 00:08:58,727
I... Well, yeah.

130
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:00,427
That's right.

131
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:06,227
That man... When Shida became the director the museum...

132
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,827
Fossil exhibits?

133
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:14,327
We need flashier events that will attract more guests.

134
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:17,327
We're going to put on a show that will draw tons of kids.

135
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:18,827
But, sir,

136
00:09:18,827 --> 00:09:21,727
these plesiosaur fossils are academically significant...

137
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,327
Shut up!

138
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:25,627
It's just worthless garbage!

139
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,227
Throw it all away!

140
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,827
Yeah, I hated him.

141
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:37,227
But it wasn't me!

142
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:39,627
Let's all calm down.

143
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:42,927
We'll talk to each of you in greater detail.

144
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:44,427
Katsuragawa, you're first.

145
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,627
-This way. -Okay.

146
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:56,827
Kuchiki, I'm sorry about your fossils.

147
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:58,127
Don't touch me!

148
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,227
That hurts!

149
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,727
"Beika Dinosaur Museum"

150
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:18,027
I was so close to showing everyone.

151
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:20,127
Mister.

152
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:21,927
Oh, it's you kids.

153
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:24,027
You really like dinosaurs.

154
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:29,827
I've thought about them my whole life.

155
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:33,227
I understand how you feel.

156
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:37,027
Just imagining these incredible animals

157
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:41,927
walking the earth millions of years ago excites me.

158
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:47,427
Yeah. Long before we were born,

159
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,827
these guys were really walking around.

160
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,527
It's nice, isn't it?

161
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,327
They're not like your show!

162
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:58,927
It's true. My show just uses costumes.

163
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:02,927
But like you, I wanted everyone to enjoy them.

164
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:06,527
It's just a sham.

165
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:08,627
I want people to see the real thing.

166
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,427
I take pride in my work.

167
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:15,227
That's no reason to accuse someone of murder.

168
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,727
Yua, did it go okay?

169
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:21,627
Yes. The office Katsuragawa

170
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:23,627
was in the back of the staff room.

171
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,827
We learned it would've been impossible

172
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,727
for her to leave around the time of the incident

173
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:30,427
without being noticed by the other staff.

174
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:32,827
That's right, I'm innocent.

175
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:37,127
Which means the only suspicious person is you, Kuchiki.

176
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:40,827
Me? That's enough!

177
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,327
Now, now.

178
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:46,527
Kuchiki, we found several pieces of evidence.

179
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,027
Evidence?

180
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:06,394
"Director's Office" -This was inside...

181
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:09,494
the trash can.

182
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:10,994
"We need to talk.

183
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:16,094
Come to the Brachiosaurus in exhibition hall 2. From Kuchiki."

184
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:21,894
See, Kuchiki? It was you.

185
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:25,094
I've never seen that. I didn't send that letter.

186
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,694
Stop making excuses!

187
00:12:26,694 --> 00:12:28,594
Yua, calm down.

188
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:31,294
You've done enough. I'll take over.

189
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:36,794
Kuchiki, you cut several of the wires beforehand.

190
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:40,794
You went to get the director when the show started.

191
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:45,894
Then you went to the exhibition hall and cut the last wire.

192
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:49,394
No! I didn't do it!

193
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:53,894
Do you know what this is?

194
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:56,494
That's a fossil coating agent.

195
00:12:56,494 --> 00:12:58,494
A coating agent?

196
00:12:58,494 --> 00:13:02,694
Yes. According to forensics, it's a type of resin.

197
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:08,494
It's used to preserve fossils because it's highly transparent.

198
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:12,194
See? Like this.

199
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:15,194
Hey, that's the same as the ones we got.

200
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,194
-Yes. -Yeah.

201
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:19,294
This was spilled on the floor of the crime scene.

202
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:20,494
What?

203
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:24,694
According to forensics, it was spilled rather recently.

204
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:28,994
Kuchiki, you use this liquid regularly, don't you?

205
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:31,294
Yes, but...

206
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:34,694
You can tell us more in another room.

207
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:40,794
I can't believe he did it.

208
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:42,094
It's a shame.

209
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:45,494
I thought only good people liked dinosaurs.

210
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,394
What's this?

211
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:57,394
The director's office...

212
00:13:57,394 --> 00:13:59,694
Exhibition hall 2...

213
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:01,594
The central event hall...

214
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:14,394
What's going on with Conan?

215
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:19,594
He's probably thinking about that dinosaur show.

216
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:23,794
Him, too? It was really intense.

217
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,694
They're the same.

218
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:29,494
Huh? Ayumi, your clothes are dirty.

219
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,794
Huh?

220
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:33,094
You're right. When did that happen?

221
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:36,994
Let's see...

222
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:40,194
I found it.

223
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:42,594
Conan, is this it?

224
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:44,194
I knew it.

225
00:14:44,194 --> 00:14:46,494
Nice work, Genta.

226
00:14:46,494 --> 00:14:47,994
No problem.

227
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:54,794
Agasa, again?

228
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:59,394
Inspector Megure, are you sure Kuchiki is the culprit?

229
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:01,594
Yes. He has no alibi,

230
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:03,494
and he left something at the crime scene.

231
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:08,394
The thing is, I find that hard to believe.

232
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:12,094
Kuchiki has spent his life researching dinosaurs,

233
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:15,294
and loves them from the bottom of his heart.

234
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:18,794
I can't imagine him destroying that.

235
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:22,394
So you're saying someone else did it.

236
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:27,094
But everyone else in the museum has an alibi.

237
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,694
Yes, especially the show's host Naito.

238
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:34,294
You could say your alibi is perfect.

239
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:39,694
The dinosaur show was really fun.

240
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:40,894
Thanks.

241
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:43,994
You were onstage the whole time.

242
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,894
Huh? Yeah.

243
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:50,394
But you were only seen onstage

244
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:52,694
for a few seconds, right?

245
00:15:56,494 --> 00:16:00,894
Naito was first seen at the start of the show.

246
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:06,894
Welcome to the Beika Dinosaur Museum show.

247
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:11,294
What if he had exited the stage immediately afterwards

248
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,794
and gone to the director's office?

249
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,994
You mean you think I did it?

250
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:23,394
But I was commentating the whole time.

251
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:26,194
Your headset is wireless.

252
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:30,294
You could've gone to the director's office while speaking.

253
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:33,094
These two truly are eternal rivals!

254
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:36,294
Tyrannosaurus rex, king of the carnivores!

255
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:39,694
Triceratops, behemoth of the herbivores!

256
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:47,694
Please! I didn't go to the director's office.

257
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:51,094
Isn't there only one show a day?

258
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,494
What?

259
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,594
There was a lot of confetti.

260
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:59,394
We found one piece in the hallway in front of the director's office.

261
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:04,294
Maybe it fell after getting stuck to you.

262
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:09,694
You returned to the stage shortly afterwards.

263
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:17,194
By briefly showing yourself,

264
00:17:17,194 --> 00:17:19,494
you gave the audience the impression

265
00:17:19,494 --> 00:17:22,494
that you were onstage the whole time.

266
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:24,994
You disappeared into the smoke

267
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,994
and exited the stage once again.

268
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:29,094
This time you went outside

269
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,394
and headed to the rear entrance of exhibition hall 2,

270
00:17:31,394 --> 00:17:33,794
where the fossils were kept.

271
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:42,094
Naito, aren't you in the middle of a show?

272
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,994
Oh, no! Triceratops is in trouble!

273
00:17:45,994 --> 00:17:50,294
Everyone, grant him your strength!

274
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:53,394
Cheer for him as loudly as you can!

275
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,294
You can do it!

276
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:56,594
Triceratops!

277
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,194
Don't let him beat you!

278
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,594
You used the sound effects of the dinosaur show

279
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:13,094
to mask the sound of the falling fossil.

280
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:16,194
After spilling the coating agent on the floor,

281
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:19,494
you returned to the stage and ended the show.

282
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:21,894
You're making it up.

283
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,994
There were pieces of fossil

284
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:27,294
near the rear entrance of the exhibition hall.

285
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:32,894
They must've stuck to the bottom of your shoe

286
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,894
when you stepped on them before falling there.

287
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:41,294
You're the one who used my dinosaurs to kill the director?

288
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,894
No! I didn't do it.

289
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:47,294
The fossils collapsed after the show ended.

290
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,194
Right, kids?

291
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:55,494
See? It's just his imagination that I killed him.

292
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:58,894
Hey, isn't this your show costume?

293
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:04,394
There was a sound system remote in the pocket.

294
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:06,394
You used this to play the sound of it falling

295
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:08,894
after the show ended.

296
00:19:10,094 --> 00:19:11,294
What was that?

297
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:14,794
It sounded like something rather large collapsing.

298
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:19,294
To make us think the fossil had fallen in that moment.

299
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:20,694
I see.

300
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:22,494
Call forensics.

301
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,894
Have them examine the director's office

302
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,194
and the rear entrance to the exhibition hall.

303
00:19:26,194 --> 00:19:28,794
-Yes, sir! -Naito.

304
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:32,294
We're going to examine the bottoms of your shoes.

305
00:19:33,294 --> 00:19:34,994
It was perfect.

306
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:36,794
Perfect.

307
00:19:36,794 --> 00:19:38,494
So why?

308
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:40,694
Because...

309
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:43,294
you were acting a little weird.

310
00:19:43,294 --> 00:19:44,294
What?

311
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,394
You suddenly defended the clerk

312
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,094
and explained Kuchiki's actions.

313
00:19:49,094 --> 00:19:50,894
It's because you were eager

314
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:54,894
to frame Kuchiki according to your plan, right?

315
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,394
One other thing.

316
00:19:58,394 --> 00:20:01,994
There's a stain on your costume's pocket.

317
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:05,994
You kept the coating agent in your pocket.

318
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:09,794
For whatever reason, it leaked.

319
00:20:09,794 --> 00:20:14,794
When you helped Ayumi up during the show,

320
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:17,994
you created a stain on her clothes, too.

321
00:20:21,794 --> 00:20:24,594
I see. So that's how it is.

322
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:29,294
Naito, why?

323
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,294
Why did you do this?

324
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:43,594
Director Shida was going to kill me.

325
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:49,094
Shida and I were actually working together.

326
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:53,994
I used the money I had to help him acquire this museum.

327
00:20:53,994 --> 00:20:57,194
But once he became director,

328
00:20:57,194 --> 00:21:00,094
he said he wouldn't pay me back.

329
00:21:00,794 --> 00:21:02,394
On top of that...

330
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:14,994
You hurt your right arm then.

331
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:16,294
Yeah.

332
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:20,194
So I killed him before he could kill me!

333
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:24,394
Then this museum would become mine!

334
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:26,894
Then...

335
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:28,194
Darn it!

336
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:30,794
Darn it!

337
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:56,494
What an awful case.

338
00:22:56,494 --> 00:23:00,294
They were fighting over the same prey,

339
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:03,094
like a couple of savage dinosaurs.

340
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:05,194
-You're wrong. -What?

341
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:07,194
Not even the most savage dinosaur

342
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:09,794
would pursue its prey so recklessly.

343
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:12,094
They attack when they're hungry.

344
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:15,694
They attack in order to survive.

345
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:19,494
Only humans attack others for their own gain.

346
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:25,094
-Hey. -Ai.

347
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:28,294
Just kidding. I saw it on TV yesterday.

348
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:35,894
I feel hungry all of a sudden.

349
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:37,994
Doc, buy me a hamburger.

350
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:40,594
What a good idea! I'd like sushi.

351
00:23:40,594 --> 00:23:42,294
I want a chocolate parfait.

352
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:44,894
Wait, wait. I never said I'd buy anything.

353
00:23:44,894 --> 00:23:47,394
-What? -I'm not buying you anything no matter what you say.

354
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,694
They certainly have the appetites of dinosaurs.

355
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,794
Gonna eat ya.

356
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:57,694
"Next Episode" -I hope they decide to use it.

357
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:59,894
Just kidding.

"Challenging All Cops and Detectives"

359
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:05,294
Throw it back on the balcony!

360
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:07,194
Including the food scraps!

361
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:10,894
That's how he made someone else do the killing.

362
00:24:10,894 --> 00:24:13,794
Manipulating another so he wouldn't get his own hands dirty!

363
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:18,194
You have to save me, Mouri!

364
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:20,594
