1
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:19,582
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:23,582
Next, we'll be performing a song with a lot of beat.

3
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:24,882
"Everlasting Luv"!

4
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:28,182
Love is eternal. Labyrinths are mysterious.

5
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:30,682
Saturday nights are for mystery.

6
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:32,482
Solve the locked dressing room trick

7
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:35,082
and disclose the mixing noise in the band.

8
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:36,682
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:36,682 --> 00:00:38,482
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

10
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:40,382
His name is Detective Conan.

11
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,785
"The Hand that Plays in Dissonance"

12
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:36,685
"Yukiko Watanbe (24), Vocalist"

13
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:41,285
"Makoto Nishimoto (25), Guitarist"

14
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:45,985
"Shota Aoki (27), Bass Player"

15
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:50,685
"Risako Tanaka (22), Keyboard Player"

16
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:54,985
"Yusuke Nakamura (30), Drummist"

17
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:02,685
"Yuuki Sakamoto (38), Music Producer"

18
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:11,585
Conan, eat to your heart's content. No need to hold back!

19
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:14,785
Don't worry about a thing! It's my treat!

20
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:19,785
I can have anything I like? But all there is here are soy beans, sausage

21
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,385
and finger food you eat with alcoholic drinks.

22
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,785
What's wrong? Soy beans and sausages for dinner.

23
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:26,285
Isn't it great?

24
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,085
One more glass of beer!

25
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,785
Dad, don't drink too much.

26
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:32,385
What are you talking about?

27
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:36,785
I wasted half a day shopping with you since you wanted to buy clothes.

28
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:38,685
Stop nagging me about drinking beer.

29
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,485
But still...

30
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,285
I don't know any of the songs.

31
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:52,385
We'll play something different now.

32
00:03:52,385 --> 00:03:55,185
It's a song that I'm sure you've all heard.

33
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:58,085
Play Yoko Okino's "Moon Lady"!

34
00:03:58,085 --> 00:04:00,285
Don't tell me you can't play it!

35
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:01,685
Hey, dad!

36
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,385
I'm going to the washroom.

37
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:07,585
Next, we'd like to play S&G's masterpiece for you.

38
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:10,485
They can't play Yoko's song.

39
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:14,785
"8th Floor"

40
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:16,385
Drawings?

41
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:19,385
We had to draw in class the other day.

42
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,585
It wasn't easy trying to draw like a kid.

43
00:04:25,285 --> 00:04:29,385
Excuse me. I'm sorry if I'm mistaken.

44
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:34,185
Are you the famed Detective Kogoro Mouri?

45
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:38,985
I am indeed Detective Kogoro Mouri.

46
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:40,685
Just as I thought!

47
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:43,585
Since you were saying, "Play Yoko Okino's song",

48
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:45,585
I thought that it could be you.

49
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,485
I saw you on air together with her.

50
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,685
My name is Yusuke Nakamura.

51
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:52,985
You saw me on television?

52
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:55,585
Hey, give me two glasses of beer!

53
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:56,885
No thanks.

54
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,385
I just thought that if you were him in person,

55
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:01,285
I'd like to have your autograph here.

56
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:02,785
No need to be hesitant.

57
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:06,185
Hey, Conan. Go and buy more snacks!

58
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:08,185
Okay.

59
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:10,185
You want my autograph? No problem.

60
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,185
"Stem beans and popcorn, Fried potato, Fried chicken, French sausage"

61
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,385
I'm sick of all these food already.

62
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:23,585
Huh? Where's Ran?

63
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:26,085
The guy just now seems to have the CD

64
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,685
that Ran's been looking for since some time ago,

65
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:29,585
so she followed him to the dressing room to borrow it.

66
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:30,685
I see.

67
00:05:30,685 --> 00:05:33,185
"Basement, 1st floor"

68
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:36,085
Is the dressing room still open?

69
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,085
No, the key has been returned.

70
00:05:39,085 --> 00:05:40,285
Here.

71
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:47,685
"Dressing Room, Non-personnel Are Prohibited"

72
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:50,285
I'm sorry, but could you wait for a while here?

73
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,385
Sure.

74
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:58,385
So this is how the musical instruments are stored away.

75
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,985
Huh? What's this?

76
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:05,885
Somebody!

77
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:09,485
What's the matter?

78
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:12,985
That...

79
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:22,285
I flipped that blanket over...

80
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:24,585
and found Yukiko...

81
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,685
She seems to be dead.

82
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,385
Hurry and get Mr. Mouri!

83
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:29,585
Okay!

84
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:38,885
A person was found dead?

85
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,485
Mr. Mouri.

86
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:41,785
Yukiko is...

87
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,785
She has been choked to death.

88
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:02,785
Ran, call the police!

89
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:03,985
Okay.

90
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:07,185
This is...

91
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:08,285
What is it?

92
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:15,685
So the band members are the victim, Ms. Yukiko Watanabe,

93
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,485
you and three other people?

94
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,085
-Yes, sir. -Inspector.

95
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,585
According to the security guard,

96
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,385
the only people who borrowed the key to this room

97
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:25,885
are the members of the band.

98
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:28,585
Mr. Nakamura.

99
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:30,385
Could you contact the other three members

100
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:33,485
and ask them to come back to the department store?

101
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:34,585
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:36,185 --> 00:07:38,785
Excuse me. There are green stains

103
00:07:38,785 --> 00:07:41,185
on both shoulders of Ms. Yukiko.

104
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:42,585
Yeah.

105
00:07:42,585 --> 00:07:46,285
Inspector, there is something around her shoulders.

106
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:49,585
Please go and check what it is right away.

107
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:50,585
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,085
What's wrong?

109
00:07:56,585 --> 00:08:00,685
I can't help feeling that it looks different from when I first saw it.

110
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:02,085
What do you mean?

111
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:04,485
I don't really know.

112
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,885
The performance at the beer garden on the roof ended at 8.30 pm.

113
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:15,185
Ms. Yukiko's dead body was found at around 9.15 pm.

114
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:19,385
Will you each tell me what you were doing at that time?

115
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:22,585
I'd like to also know when you all last met Ms. Yukiko.

116
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,685
After I left the stage, I went to the dressing room

117
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:28,085
to store the instruments with the department store staff.

118
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:31,385
About 20 minutes later, I went to Mr. Mouri's table

119
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,985
and talked to him for about 15 minutes.

120
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:35,485
Then, I went to the dressing room with Ran.

121
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,385
The last time I saw Yukiko

122
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,785
was when she came down from the stage and left.

123
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,585
What about the rest of you?

124
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:44,985
I used the elevator to go down to the dressing room

125
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:46,885
together with Shota and Makoto,

126
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:49,985
and left for home with Shota about 5 minutes later.

127
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:53,985
According to the security guard's log, it was at 8.40 pm.

128
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:58,285
The last I saw Yukiko was in front of the elevator.

129
00:08:58,285 --> 00:08:59,685
Go on without me.

130
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:02,785
That's what she said.

131
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,785
Me, too.

132
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:05,885
Same here.

133
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:08,885
What did you do after you left the department store?

134
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:11,685
Since Shota said he had something to do,

135
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:13,785
we parted right outside the department store.

136
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,285
What about you, Mr. Nishimoto?

137
00:09:15,285 --> 00:09:17,785
About 5 minutes after they both left,

138
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:20,785
I returned the dressing room's key to the security guard and went home.

139
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:25,585
The log says the key was returned at 8.45 pm.

140
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:28,685
What about you, Mr. Aoki?

141
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,885
I waited for Yukiko for some time

142
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:34,885
in the car parked in the parking lot.

143
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:37,685
Why were you waiting for Yukiko?

144
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:41,185
I thought you were dating with Risako.

145
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:44,885
I wasn't dating Yukiko.

146
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,785
Then, why were you with Yukiko yesterday?

147
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:49,785
You told me you were busy!

148
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:52,085
So, you were seeing Yukiko after all!

149
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:54,685
Cut it out. This isn't the place to talk about it.

150
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:58,685
Before Mr. Nakamura and Ran came to borrow the dressing room's key,

151
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:03,985
someone else came at 8.55 pm to borrow the key.

152
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,285
Mr. Shota Aoki.

153
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,485
It was you, wasn't it?

154
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:12,585
Yes.

155
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,685
Shota, don't tell me...

156
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,185
No.

157
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:20,085
Yukiko didn't show up for a while, so I went to check the dressing room.

158
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,885
But she wasn't there.

159
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:24,685
I waited for a while, but she didn't come.

160
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:27,485
So I had no choice but to return the key and left for home.

161
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:31,185
It was when the department staff were storing the musical instruments.

162
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:38,285
The security guard did say that the key was returned in about 5 minutes.

163
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,885
By the way, why were you waiting

164
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:44,185
for the victim, Ms. Yukiko Watanabe?

165
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,785
From what you told us,

166
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:48,885
it seems that you two weren't dating each other either.

167
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:56,085
Yukiko and I were invited to join another band.

168
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:57,385
What?

169
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:58,685
We were asked by TMS Record

170
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:01,885
if we wanted to make a major debut with that band.

171
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:04,385
Is... Is that so?

172
00:11:19,585 --> 00:11:22,185
What's this mark?

173
00:11:23,785 --> 00:11:24,985
Inspector.

174
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,785
I've checked the footage of the surveillance camera in the elevator.

175
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,185
There isn't any footage showing Ms. Yukiko

176
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:31,485
going from the roof to the basement.

177
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:32,785
What?

178
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:36,085
Are you saying that Ms. Yukiko used the stairs

179
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:39,085
to go from the roof to the basement, then?

180
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:41,285
That's possible.

181
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,685
What makes you think so?

182
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:48,085
Mr. Sakamoto from TMS Record was at the beer garden tonight.

183
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,985
Mr. Sakamoto walked towards the stairs

184
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:53,685
when we were taking the elevator.

185
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:59,185
Could you please get in contact with that Mr. Sakamoto?

186
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,385
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:10,285
Yes. After the performance ended,

188
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:14,385
I did see Yukiko at the landing between the roof and 8th floor.

189
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,885
You killed Yukiko!

190
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:19,985
No! I...

191
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:23,185
told her how I felt about her performance and left right afterwards.

192
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:27,485
She said she didn't want the other members to see me with her.

193
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:29,585
Liar!

194
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:32,785
He's not the one who did it.

195
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:37,785
Neither he nor Yukiko had the key to the dressing room,

196
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,385
so they couldn't have gotten in.

197
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:41,285
You're getting so worked up.

198
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:44,585
Makoto, aren't you the one who killed Yukiko?

199
00:12:44,585 --> 00:12:46,685
-What? -I already know

200
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:48,685
that Yukiko brushed you off.

201
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,085
I bet Yukiko came back before you returned the key, right?

202
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:53,185
And that's when you...

203
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:55,485
According to Shota, when he came back from the dressing room,

204
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:58,085
there was nobody there, right?

205
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:02,685
You were the one who had the key all afternoon, weren't you?

206
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:05,585
Maybe you made a spare key back then?

207
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:06,885
Don't be ridiculous!

208
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:09,985
You thought that Yukiko took Shota away from you, right?

209
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:11,485
Stop, everyone!

210
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:13,385
It's a shame to be fighting among ourselves!

211
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:16,985
If we straighten the story out, it should be like this.

212
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:20,285
Ms. Yukiko who parted with Mr. Sakamoto

213
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:23,285
took the stairs and returned to the dressing room on Floor B1.

214
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:25,885
But since she didn't have the key,

215
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:29,385
the killer had to be the one who unlocked the door to the dressing room.

216
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:32,885
So it's either Mr. Nishimoto, before he returned the key,

217
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:35,485
Mr. Aoki who went back there once

218
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:40,185
or Ms. Ritsuko who could've secretly made a spare key.

219
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,885
The killer is among the three of you.

220
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:49,185
The landing of the stairs between the roof and 8th floor...

221
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:53,285
Yukiko was talking to Mr. Sakamoto over here.

222
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:57,385
After that, Yukiko took the stairs all the way down to B1.

223
00:13:57,385 --> 00:13:59,985
Why didn't she use the elevator?

224
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,785
Oh, no.

225
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,885
I came all the way here while being lost in thought.

226
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,585
This drawing... Could it be...

227
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:17,785
Is this it?

228
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:22,885
Could I be wrong?

229
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:25,885
Kid, what are you doing here?

230
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,985
It's nothing.

231
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:32,485
Come to think of it, the security guard's room is just nearby.

232
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:34,285
Yet, why did Ran...

233
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:35,985
Ran!

234
00:14:35,985 --> 00:14:37,285
Conan.

235
00:14:37,285 --> 00:14:39,485
When you saw Ms. Yukiko's body,

236
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:41,285
why did you come all the way to the roof to get us

237
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:44,085
instead of calling the security guard room that's close by?

238
00:14:44,085 --> 00:14:48,885
Because Mr. Nakamura told me to go and get Mr. Mouri.

239
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:50,885
Oh, right. Conan.

240
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:54,485
I realized something strange.

241
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:56,685
The big drum.

242
00:14:56,685 --> 00:15:01,185
When I first saw it, the drum was on top of this case.

243
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:03,485
But now it's gone.

244
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:13,485
I see.

245
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:17,085
Mr. Tome.

246
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:20,585
About the green stuff that was on Ms. Yukiko's shoulders...

247
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,785
That's right. It's amazing you figured it out.

248
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:28,985
All right. Everything's fallen into place now.

249
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:31,785
That's the killer.

250
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:40,982
Okay, everyone.

251
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,982
I need you all to tell me the details at the station.

252
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,382
No way. Do I have to go too?

253
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:49,382
I didn't kill her!

254
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:53,482
Mouri!

255
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:56,282
Don't tell me... Is this position...

256
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:59,482
Yes. It's nearing nightfall,

257
00:15:59,482 --> 00:16:01,982
so it's about time we end all this

258
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:03,982
and solve this case.

259
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:12,082
Inspector, Conan was told by the forensic officer

260
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:16,582
that the green thing on the victim's shoulders was crayon.

261
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:17,982
Crayon?

262
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,682
I wonder where it got onto her.

263
00:16:20,682 --> 00:16:25,382
There are no crayons in the dressing room.

264
00:16:25,382 --> 00:16:27,082
Where on earth could it be?

265
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:28,882
It's the 8th floor.

266
00:16:28,882 --> 00:16:30,082
The 8th floor?

267
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:34,482
Children's drawings are exhibited on the 8th floor.

268
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:36,282
According to Conan,

269
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:41,582
there seems to be a scrape mark on one of the drawings.

270
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:45,282
I'm sure that Ms. Yukiko was attacked on the 8th floor.

271
00:16:45,282 --> 00:16:48,182
She was probably pushed against the drawing then,

272
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:50,382
and that's when the crayon scraped off onto her clothes.

273
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,482
-What? -In other words,

274
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:55,882
she wasn't killed in the dressing room, but on the 8th floor.

275
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:59,282
But the body was found in the dressing room.

276
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,782
Her body was moved there.

277
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:03,282
Officer Takagi.

278
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:07,882
Was there a rectangular mark near her neck?

279
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:10,482
Yes, there was.

280
00:17:15,482 --> 00:17:17,782
Dad, I brought it with me.

281
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:19,382
What's that?

282
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:21,682
The case for the bass drum.

283
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,882
Ran, can you open the lid?

284
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:24,982
All right.

285
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:26,982
Inspector.

286
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:31,282
There's a metal piece in there for fixing the handle in place, right?

287
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:32,982
The mark on her leg that you saw

288
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:36,482
was left behind by the metal piece pushed against it.

289
00:17:36,482 --> 00:17:37,782
What?

290
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:41,782
Ms. Yukiko's body was put inside that bass drum case

291
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:44,482
and carried to where she was found.

292
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:47,882
Isn't that right, Mr. Nakamura?

293
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:53,482
Why are you asking me?

294
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,782
You're the only one to ask.

295
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:59,082
You're the only one who helped put away the musical instruments,

296
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:03,582
so only you had the chance to put Yukiko's body inside.

297
00:18:04,882 --> 00:18:08,282
But when I unlocked the door and went into the dressing room,

298
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,982
Yukiko's body was already inside the room.

299
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:13,182
Ms. Ran saw that too.

300
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:15,482
After I finished cleaning up the dressing room,

301
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:18,782
I was with you and Ms. Ran the whole time.

302
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:22,982
How on earth would I have time to carry the body to the dressing room?

303
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:25,182
Unfortunately, the body that Ran saw

304
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:29,082
was not Ms. Yukiko's body.

305
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:32,182
What do you mean, Mouri?

306
00:18:32,182 --> 00:18:35,482
Mr. Mouri, I brought what you asked for.

307
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,682
-Isn't that a mannequin? -Yes.

308
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:41,282
It was in the sports clothing store on the 8th floor.

309
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:45,282
As you can see, the left hand has been removed.

310
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:46,682
The hand that Ran saw

311
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:50,382
was the left hand of this mannequin.

312
00:18:50,382 --> 00:18:51,582
I see.

313
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,782
If it's only the hand of a mannequin, he could carry it in easily.

314
00:18:54,782 --> 00:18:59,582
But back then, I wasn't carrying the hand of a mannequin, was I?

315
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,382
Mr. Nakamura.

316
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:04,382
Will you please sound your guitar?

317
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:09,582
Officer Takagi, will you please sound the guitar?

318
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,782
Yes, sir.

319
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:20,582
Huh? It's out of tune.

320
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:24,382
Mr. Nakamura, you were carrying that guitar

321
00:19:24,382 --> 00:19:27,382
when you entered the dressing room, weren't you?

322
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:31,782
The hand of that mannequin was hidden inside your guitar.

323
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:36,282
After you hid Ms. Yukiko's body into the drum case,

324
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:38,782
you removed the left hand of that mannequin,

325
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:41,782
then put Yukiko's glove onto it,

326
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:44,782
and hid it inside the guitar.

327
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:48,182
You probably used masking tape to stick it on.

328
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:51,582
When he asked me to sign on the guitar,

329
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:54,482
he really got me.

330
00:19:54,482 --> 00:19:58,982
Then, you made Ran wait in the corridor and went into the dressing room,

331
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:02,182
and took out the mannequin's hand that you had hidden in your guitar.

332
00:20:02,182 --> 00:20:04,482
You set it up using a cushion and blanket,

333
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,182
making it look like a person was there,

334
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,482
and placed the mannequin's hand there.

335
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:12,882
Then, you made Ran think that Ms. Yukiko was lying on the ground.

336
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,482
No way.

337
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,682
Leader...

338
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:21,982
After you told Ran to go and get me,

339
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:25,682
you carried the drum case containing Ms. Yukiko's body

340
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,282
into the dressing room.

341
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:33,382
Then, you took the body out of the case, put the glove on her left hand,

342
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:36,382
and lay her down under the blanket.

343
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:42,182
After that, you most likely hid the mannequin's hand into your guitar.

344
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:46,082
But you didn't have time to tune the guitar.

345
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:49,182
This is the truth.

346
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:51,282
Leader...

347
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,282
Why did you do that?

348
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:57,682
This band is my life.

349
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:01,082
I thought all of you felt the same.

350
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:03,782
I'll call you again.

351
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:04,982
Okay.

352
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:08,682
Leader.

353
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:10,382
It was rumoured that you and Shota

354
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:14,582
were going to join the new band that's going to be formed.

355
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:16,182
Looks like it's true.

356
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,682
That's right. Is there a problem?

357
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:20,782
You were ousted by the previous band you were in

358
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:24,482
because you promoted yourself to a record company, weren't you?

359
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:28,182
You're able to sing now thanks to us. Don't you think so?

360
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:30,682
-What a joke. -What?

361
00:21:30,682 --> 00:21:34,582
You guys made it this far because I joined you.

362
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:38,982
Without me, a lowly band like yours would've fallen apart long ago.

363
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,782
What did you say?

364
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:44,882
You should be thankful for the fact that you served as a stepping stone

365
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:46,982
for me to make my major debut.

366
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,182
I really believed...

367
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:02,682
that everyone else felt the same.

368
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:04,982
I really believed that.

369
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:09,182
Mr. Nakamura.

370
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:13,082
Please give us the details at the station.

371
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:40,182
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:40,182 --> 00:23:44,582
Looks like the beer kicked in after he solved the case.

373
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:46,582
Don't mention it. No problem at all.

374
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:48,082
"Mouri's Detective Agency"

375
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:52,782
Okay, we're here. Don't forget to take your things.

376
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:56,782
Ran, where are the things you bought?

377
00:23:56,782 --> 00:24:00,682
I forgot about them! The clothes I bought!

378
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:02,682
I'll head back to Beika Department Store.

379
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,182
-Thank you so much. -Thank you so much.
