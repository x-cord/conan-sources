1
00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:20.732
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:22.332
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:23.932
Today the mermaid case is solved.

4
00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:25.932
Approaching the truth with hard-headed deduction.

5
00:00:25.932 --> 00:00:27.332
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:29.032
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:31.532
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:58.291
Heiji Hattori receives a strange letter

9
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.491
that prompts us to come to Bikuni Island.

10
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:03.291
What awaited us was

11
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.591
a series of murders revolving around some Dugong Arrows

12
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.991
that are said to grant the bearer eternal youth.

13
00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:13.191
Saori Kadowaki, the girl who wrote the letter is missing,

14
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:18.691
and her childhood friends Toshimi Ebihara and Nahoko Kuroe

15
00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:21.091
are murdered one after the other,

16
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:22.791
and on top of that, the warehouse belonging to the shrine

17
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.291
goes up in flames,

18
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:28.591
and the body of Kimie Shimabukuro is discovered in the rubble.

19
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:31.491
Is Saori responsible for the murders?

20
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:35.791
We go to search her room for clues

21
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:38.391
and make a startling discovery.

22
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.891
It's like Kudo said after all,

23
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:45.291
so the murderers who he said it is...

24
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:51.791
Kazuha!

25
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:59.491
"The Mermaid Disappears (The Conclusion)"

26
00:03:19.791 --> 00:03:20.991
Heiji.

27
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.391
Hang on, Kazuha.

28
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.591
I'm going to start pulling you up.

29
00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:35.291
Oh, no. The branch...

30
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.291
It's going to break.

31
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:39.191
We'll both fall at this rate.

32
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.891
Forgive me, Heiji.

33
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.191
Live a long life for me too.

34
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:51.691
Kazuha?

35
00:03:51.691 --> 00:03:53.091
Goodbye.

36
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:54.991
You fool!

37
00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:03.791
"Rokuro Fukuyama (28), Saori's childhood friend, fisherman"

38
00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:13.291
Okay, Mr. Detective.

39
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.091
I brought him here just like you told me to.

40
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.091
This guy's been running all over the forest.

41
00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:25.091
So where's that kid who speaks with the Osaka accent?

42
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.891
Oh, yeah. I haven't seen him since we got separated in the forest.

43
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.191
Heiji.

44
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.791
I don't understand.

45
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:39.791
Why didn't you let go?

46
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.391
We'll both die if we stay like this.

47
00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:46.491
Let go of my hand.

48
00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:49.091
Kazuha!

49
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:51.191
Don't move.

50
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:54.491
I'll kill you if you move, you nut case!

51
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:55.891
Heiji.

52
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.191
Hattori, where are you?

53
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.891
Why aren't you here? What're you doing?

54
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:04.291
Come on already, how long do we have to wait?

55
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:07.291
We police officers have a lot of work to do.

56
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.291
"Mikoto Shimabukuro (130), Kimie's great-grandmother, the Holy Person"

57
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:18.091
It's the Holy Person.

58
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:20.491
Why is she here?

59
00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:28.691
Now that all the actors are present, let me begin explaining.

60
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:29.691
I'm going to give you

61
00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:33.391
the truth behind the 3 murders that occurred on this island.

62
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:35.991
The first murder which involved Toshimi being hung

63
00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:37.991
in the Mermaid's Waterfall.

64
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:43.391
And the second, of Nahoko being strangled in in the nets

65
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:49.591
and lastly, the murder of Kimie who was burned in the warehouse.

66
00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:52.691
The important issue here is the second murder.

67
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:54.391
Judging from the evidence,

68
00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:58.091
it appeared as though the killer walked along the shoreline

69
00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:01.591
to get to and from the scene of the murder, but...

70
00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:04.091
That kid from Osaka explained that already...

71
00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:07.391
Yes, he told me too.

72
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:10.091
Those footprints were put there by the killer before the murder

73
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:11.491
to throw us off track,

74
00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:17.191
the killer actually went to the scene during the wake.

75
00:06:17.191 --> 00:06:20.891
Those fish scales really had me fooled.

76
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:23.691
The killer dropped the scales around the footprints

77
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.591
then on Nahoko's clothes after killing her, that way,

78
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.091
with the scales leading to the water,

79
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:32.591
the killer made it look like a mermaid was responsible

80
00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:34.891
and that it escaped into the ocean.

81
00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:39.291
And, the only ones who could have left the wake that night,

82
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:42.391
were Rokuro and Benzo, you're the only ones.

83
00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:44.191
What...

84
00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:47.791
By the way, Benzo, I have a question for you.

85
00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:49.491
On the morning of the festival,

86
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:51.991
you're the one who sold a Dugong Arrow for 1,000,000

87
00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:54.091
to an elderly couple, aren't you?

88
00:06:54.091 --> 00:06:55.291
Yeah.

89
00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:58.491
That's the arrow my daughter Saori won the year before.

90
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:01.091
I'm her father, I had a right.

91
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:04.991
All that money must've made you greedier

92
00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:08.891
so when you saw that Toshimi won one this year,

93
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:11.591
you told her to meet you by the waterfall and then you stole her platelet,

94
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:13.591
set her afloat on the swim ring

95
00:07:13.591 --> 00:07:14.991
so that her neck would get caught.

96
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:19.291
And as for Nahoko who also won an arrow,

97
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:22.091
you called her out on the night of the wake, killed her

98
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:23.991
and took her arrow.

99
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:26.991
But if the list of names were checked,

100
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:29.891
everyone would know Toshimi's platelet was stolen.

101
00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:32.491
So you went to Kimie's home before we got there

102
00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:36.991
to steal the registry, but Kimie saw you

103
00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:39.891
so you locked her in the warehouse and set fire to it.

104
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:42.591
This registry that you had in your possession

105
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:44.991
when you were arrested proves your guilt.

106
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:46.491
And we've also found your fingerprints

107
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:48.091
on the swim ring used in Toshimi's case.

108
00:07:48.091 --> 00:07:52.091
You're mistaken, Benzo's not the killer.

109
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:54.191
If Benzo was the killer,

110
00:07:54.191 --> 00:07:57.591
he would have burned the registry along with the warehouse.

111
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:59.291
Besides, everyone who lived on this island

112
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:01.791
knew where the registry was kept,

113
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:04.791
I don't think he'd have to rush over to steal it.

114
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:08.091
Another thing, it would have been very hard for him

115
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:09.391
to call Nahoko out.

116
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:15.191
Nahoko noticed that Toshimi won an arrow at the festival too,

117
00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:20.491
and she was suspicious of Benzo who had that winning number.

118
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.991
Alright then, what about the fingerprints on the swim ring?

119
00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:25.291
I'm pretty sure he touched it

120
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:29.291
when he found it along with the winning platelet

121
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:31.491
which was snagged somewhere on the river.

122
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:34.291
Yeah, the detective's right.

123
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:35.691
I didn't want people to think I was the killer

124
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:37.791
just because I just happened to find the winning platelet,

125
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.391
that's why I stole the registry.

126
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.991
Then Rokuro Fukuyama, you must be the killer.

127
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.591
That's ridiculous.

128
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:49.291
Toshimi was your fiancee, wasn't she?

129
00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:51.991
She would have gone to meet you at the waterfall with no suspicions.

130
00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:54.591
No, he's not the killer either.

131
00:08:54.591 --> 00:08:55.891
What?

132
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.491
The killer used a swim ring to kill Toshimi

133
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:01.891
so that she'd float down the waterfall

134
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:04.191
without getting caught on anything,

135
00:09:04.191 --> 00:09:06.691
that way, it would look like an accident,

136
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.591
but being a fisherman, Rokuro has very strong arms

137
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.791
and Toshimi wasn't very heavy

138
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:15.191
so it would have very easy for him to just toss her into the river.

139
00:09:15.191 --> 00:09:16.691
He wouldn't have had to use a swim ring

140
00:09:16.691 --> 00:09:19.791
which would only be left behind as evidence.

141
00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:23.691
But if neither of them is the killer, then who is?

142
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:24.791
The killer

143
00:09:24.791 --> 00:09:29.091
made it look like Toshimi's death was an accident

144
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:33.091
but made no attempt to hide the fact that Nahoko was murdered.

145
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:37.091
Do you know what that means?

146
00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:38.591
Well...

147
00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:40.791
No, I don't.

148
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:42.691
When Toshimi was killed,

149
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:46.991
the police didn't arrive right away because the sea was too rough.

150
00:09:46.991 --> 00:09:50.891
Normally, the police would have arrived sometime that night.

151
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:52.391
And since it was a case of murder,

152
00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:53.991
the investigation would have been intense,

153
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:56.291
the killer wouldn't have been able to move around freely.

154
00:09:56.291 --> 00:09:57.691
The killer didn't want that to happen,

155
00:09:57.691 --> 00:09:59.591
that's why it had to look like an accident.

156
00:09:59.591 --> 00:10:04.291
Which means, the killer planned to kill Nahoko after Toshimi

157
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.391
from the very start.

158
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:10.491
But no one would have known Nahoko had won an arrow

159
00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:12.191
until she came forward.

160
00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:13.491
That's right.

161
00:10:13.491 --> 00:10:17.091
The killer's motive wasn't to steal an arrow

162
00:10:17.091 --> 00:10:20.291
nor was it to kill whoever won it.

163
00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:26.891
It was only made to look that way to mislead the investigation.

164
00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:28.391
That's...

165
00:10:28.391 --> 00:10:30.691
The reason why the killer made it obvious

166
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:32.891
that Nahoko was murdered so that

167
00:10:32.891 --> 00:10:36.491
everyone's attention was on the scene of the crime,

168
00:10:36.491 --> 00:10:41.391
the killer used that time to carry out the third murder.

169
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:46.391
The killer planned and executed each crime very carefully.

170
00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:50.691
It wasn't on a whim.

171
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.191
The only person who could have prepared everything

172
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:55.491
before the festival is...

173
00:10:55.491 --> 00:10:57.191
No, you don't mean?

174
00:10:57.191 --> 00:11:03.791
Someone who knew beforehand that Toshimi and Nahoko had won arrows.

175
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:05.291
That's right.

176
00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:07.991
You are the killer.

177
00:11:15.299 --> 00:11:16.599
That's right.

178
00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:19.599
The killer is the Holy Person.

179
00:11:19.599 --> 00:11:21.299
Yes, you.

180
00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.999
You've got to be kidding.

181
00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:31.399
How can a 130-year-old lady do those things?

182
00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.899
What if she had an accomplice?

183
00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:35.199
Accomplice?

184
00:11:35.199 --> 00:11:39.999
If neither Rokuro nor Benzo could have killed killed Nahoko,

185
00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:43.299
then the only other person who could have done it is...

186
00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:45.099
Kimie.

187
00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.899
That's nonsense!

188
00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:51.699
Kimie was the third victim!

189
00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:55.299
But what if it wasn't Kimie that was in the warehouse?

190
00:11:55.299 --> 00:11:56.499
What?

191
00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:58.599
Kimie's dental records

192
00:11:58.599 --> 00:12:01.199
and the burn victim's dental records were identical.

193
00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:02.899
Don't you remember?

194
00:12:02.899 --> 00:12:04.699
Dad, you were there too, weren't you?

195
00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:07.599
When she said she'd gone to the dentist.

196
00:12:07.599 --> 00:12:11.399
Yes, I heard. She said she went with Saori.

197
00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:13.499
You don't mean?

198
00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:14.799
That's right.

199
00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:18.499
It was Saori's teeth that got worked on.

200
00:12:18.499 --> 00:12:23.099
Kimie went with Saori to see the dentist on the main land

201
00:12:23.099 --> 00:12:27.799
and when Saori wasn't looking, she took her insurance I.D.

202
00:12:27.799 --> 00:12:32.399
then she insisted Saori use her I.D. instead.

203
00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:37.799
That's how Saori got her teeth fixed as Kimie.

204
00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:42.299
Then she killed Saori in the warehouse,

205
00:12:42.299 --> 00:12:44.199
and set it on fire with the body inside,

206
00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:48.899
the dental records led us all to believe it was Kimie who died.

207
00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:53.599
Then the brown-haired girl with glasses we saw in the garden was...

208
00:12:53.599 --> 00:12:56.199
It was Kimie in disguise,

209
00:12:56.199 --> 00:12:59.899
that's who the witnesses saw on the morning of the festival too.

210
00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:01.999
It was to make us suspicious about the body found in the warehouse

211
00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:04.899
and to make Saori look guilty.

212
00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:07.999
But all this is just your theory.

213
00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:10.799
I called the dentist and got verification.

214
00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:16.099
The worked on had brown hair and wore glasses.

215
00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:17.999
Which means, Kimie Shimabukuro

216
00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:19.899
is still hiding somewhere on this island,

217
00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.599
waiting for an opportunity to escape.

218
00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:23.599
Alright then,

219
00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:24.999
I'll have this entire island searched from top to bottom!

220
00:13:24.999 --> 00:13:26.999
There's no need for that.

221
00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:28.399
What?

222
00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:31.399
Kimie is right here in this room.

223
00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:34.399
What did you say? Where? Where is she?

224
00:13:37.699 --> 00:13:39.399
That can't be.

225
00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:41.699
I don't see her anywhere.

226
00:13:41.699 --> 00:13:43.499
Rokuro told us that

227
00:13:43.499 --> 00:13:48.199
Kimie's talent as a make-up artist is outstanding.

228
00:13:48.199 --> 00:13:49.999
Yes, that's right.

229
00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:52.799
Are you saying she's disguised herself as somebody?

230
00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.299
This isn't a movie, it wouldn't work.

231
00:13:55.299 --> 00:13:56.599
You're right,

232
00:13:56.599 --> 00:13:59.899
it would be impossible to disguise herself perfectly,

233
00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:01.899
but what if it's someone

234
00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:05.599
who doesn't show herself to others very much?

235
00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:07.499
And what if the only time everyone sees her

236
00:14:07.499 --> 00:14:10.899
is at the festival when she has on very heavy make-up?

237
00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:13.799
Now your choices have been narrowed down significantly.

238
00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:17.599
That's impossible.

239
00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:20.999
But, how do you account for the height difference?

240
00:14:20.999 --> 00:14:22.899
Think back.

241
00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:24.899
Remember the strange corpse you found

242
00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:27.999
when the warehouse burned down 3 years ago?

243
00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:31.499
There were no leg bones where there should have been

244
00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:36.599
and the locals said it was a mermaid's body, yes, that case.

245
00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:37.999
It was probably

246
00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:40.799
the body of a woman who died in the fire

247
00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:44.499
with her legs bent and tied with rope made of paper or something.

248
00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:48.899
If my theory is right, that woman was Kimie's...

249
00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:50.599
It was my mother.

250
00:14:51.999 --> 00:14:55.399
She carried out the Holy Person's role that was grandmother's.

251
00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.399
It was for all the people on the island,

252
00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:58.699
she put her heart into the role.

253
00:14:58.699 --> 00:15:03.299
I feel so sorry for her, look what it got her.

254
00:15:03.299 --> 00:15:05.199
Kimie?

255
00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:22.099
You're pretty good, Mr. Detective.

256
00:15:22.099 --> 00:15:25.299
I was pretty confident nobody'd see through this disguise.

257
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:29.099
It was that time when we found that the register was missing.

258
00:15:29.099 --> 00:15:31.499
Maybe that old lady took it?

259
00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:33.499
She'd never do that.

260
00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:37.799
I was suspicious about how quickly and confidently you replied.

261
00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:39.199
I see.

262
00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:41.999
But while we were talking to the Holy Person,

263
00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:43.699
we heard Kimie's voice.

264
00:15:43.699 --> 00:15:47.499
Great-grandmother. Your bath is ready.

265
00:15:47.499 --> 00:15:50.799
Oh that, I recorded that on a cassette tape

266
00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:52.299
and then replayed it.

267
00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:54.599
But why, Kimie?

268
00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:57.899
You four were close friends since you were kids!

269
00:15:57.899 --> 00:15:59.699
The words childhood friends mean nothing

270
00:15:59.699 --> 00:16:01.899
when it comes to avenging my own mother's death.

271
00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:03.799
Do you mean those three are the ones who set fire

272
00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:06.199
to the warehouse 3 years ago?

273
00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:07.199
Yes.

274
00:16:07.199 --> 00:16:10.099
They were angry that they didn't win arrows at the festival

275
00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:13.299
and then they got drunk and set it on fire.

276
00:16:13.299 --> 00:16:14.999
Mother was disguised as the Holy Person

277
00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:16.799
and when they saw her go into the warehouse,

278
00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:20.799
they decided they wanted to see if she really had eternal life.

279
00:16:20.799 --> 00:16:22.699
I didn't find out until a week ago when Saori told me,

280
00:16:22.699 --> 00:16:24.899
she was in a panic because she lost her arrow,

281
00:16:24.899 --> 00:16:28.399
I never dreamed they could do anything like that.

282
00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:29.999
But I thought your mother

283
00:16:29.999 --> 00:16:32.799
disappeared 5 years ago while she was out fishing.

284
00:16:32.799 --> 00:16:34.399
Mother said it would be easier

285
00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:35.999
to play just the Holy Person's role all through

286
00:16:35.999 --> 00:16:39.199
instead of playing 2 roles at the same time.

287
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.599
Then why didn't you admit the truth after the fire?

288
00:16:41.599 --> 00:16:44.399
Why didn't you tell everyone the body was your mother?

289
00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:47.499
Mother called me on her cellular phone

290
00:16:47.499 --> 00:16:49.899
while the flames burned around her.

291
00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.799
Kimie. The rest is up to you.

292
00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:56.699
I loved this island, that's why I played the Holy Person.

293
00:16:56.699 --> 00:17:00.199
Don't let the Holy Person die, that was what she said

294
00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:03.599
and yet all of mother's devotion meant nothing to them.

295
00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:07.499
After Saori lost her arrow, she had the nerve to say.

296
00:17:07.499 --> 00:17:09.299
If you won't give me another arrow,

297
00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:12.799
then tell me where the mermaid's grave is.

298
00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.699
The mermaid bones that the Holy Person

299
00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:17.199
had hidden in the warehouse, where are they buried.

300
00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:20.999
I want to be like her too, like the Holy Person.

301
00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.799
To be in perfect condition after being engulfed in all those flames.

302
00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:26.199
I want to live forever!

303
00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:29.999
I couldn't forgive her, nor Toshimi, nor Nahoko.

304
00:17:31.699 --> 00:17:34.199
Getting them to meet me was easy

305
00:17:34.199 --> 00:17:35.999
when I told them I'd tell where the grave was

306
00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:38.399
after they won the arrows at the festival,

307
00:17:38.399 --> 00:17:41.599
the eyes of those two lit up with excitement.

308
00:17:41.599 --> 00:17:43.599
It was mother's grave.

309
00:17:43.599 --> 00:17:48.399
My mother and I worked so hard for everyone.

310
00:17:48.399 --> 00:17:50.299
But you two weren't alone.

311
00:17:54.599 --> 00:17:55.899
Hattori?

312
00:17:55.899 --> 00:17:58.799
I'm pretty sure there were others who knew

313
00:17:58.799 --> 00:18:02.099
what the Holy Person was up to, isn't that so?

314
00:18:02.099 --> 00:18:05.299
You, old man. I heard you say that now that Kimie was dead,

315
00:18:05.299 --> 00:18:07.199
there would be no more festivals.

316
00:18:07.199 --> 00:18:09.199
I meant...

317
00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:10.999
I'm sorry, Kimie.

318
00:18:10.999 --> 00:18:14.499
Everyone on the island knew, except for the younger people.

319
00:18:14.499 --> 00:18:16.699
I don't believe it.

320
00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:19.599
We also knew that it was your mother

321
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.699
who died in that fire 3 years ago.

322
00:18:22.699 --> 00:18:24.399
After the fire,

323
00:18:24.399 --> 00:18:28.799
we went to tell you that the festival could be ended, but...

324
00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:32.999
when you came out dressed like the Holy Person,

325
00:18:32.999 --> 00:18:35.899
we just bring ourselves to tell you.

326
00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:40.399
This is the mermaid's island

327
00:18:40.399 --> 00:18:43.699
and if you decided you carry out the role...

328
00:18:43.699 --> 00:18:48.199
We decided to keep quiet about it and help you whenever we could.

329
00:18:48.199 --> 00:18:51.299
We thought were doing it for the island, forgive us.

330
00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:53.899
Forgive us, Kimie.

331
00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:56.099
-We're sorry. -Forgive us.

332
00:18:56.099 --> 00:18:57.299
No...

333
00:18:57.299 --> 00:19:02.699
Why didn't you say something sooner?

334
00:19:02.699 --> 00:19:04.099
That's right.

335
00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:07.699
You should all have awaken from this dream sooner.

336
00:19:07.699 --> 00:19:10.799
This dream of gaining eternal life, it was just a nightmare.

337
00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:15.999
Life comes to an end, that's why it's so precious.

338
00:19:15.999 --> 00:19:19.999
Knowing it has an end makes us work harder to make a good life.

339
00:19:19.999 --> 00:19:22.399
Isn't that right, Kazuha?

340
00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:30.899
The next morning,

341
00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:34.499
all the people on the island went to the pier to see Kimie off

342
00:19:34.499 --> 00:19:37.299
as the Fukui Police were taking her to main island,

343
00:19:37.299 --> 00:19:39.099
but the sea was rough once again

344
00:19:39.099 --> 00:19:42.299
and the ship took a long time to leave the port.

345
00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:44.199
It was as if the sea was unwilling to let go of the young girl

346
00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:46.999
who tried singlehandedly to protect the ways of her people

347
00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:48.899
for 3 years.

348
00:19:52.699 --> 00:19:55.299
When I called Saori the first time,

349
00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:57.999
that moan I heard,

350
00:19:57.999 --> 00:20:01.099
that was probably Kimie crying.

351
00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:02.899
She was probably crying

352
00:20:02.899 --> 00:20:06.199
while looking at Saori's body in the warehouse.

353
00:20:06.199 --> 00:20:07.699
But what I don't understand is

354
00:20:07.699 --> 00:20:13.099
why Saori sent you letter addressed to me.

355
00:20:13.099 --> 00:20:14.999
Maybe it was just coincidence.

356
00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:18.499
Why, Mr. Mouri and Hattori.

357
00:20:18.499 --> 00:20:21.299
I know you, aren't you?

358
00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:22.799
That's how we met for the first time,

359
00:20:22.799 --> 00:20:25.699
on that diplomat, Mr. Tsujimura's murder case.

360
00:20:25.699 --> 00:20:30.199
That's the victim's son, Takayoshi and his girlfriend, Yukiko.

361
00:20:30.199 --> 00:20:31.799
Long time no see.

362
00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:32.899
Did you by chance,

363
00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:36.799
go to Bikuni Island because Saori contacted you?

364
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:39.099
How did you know that?

365
00:20:39.099 --> 00:20:42.999
Yukiko's from that island and Saori used to live next door,

366
00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:44.999
she asked Yukiko for some advice.

367
00:20:44.999 --> 00:20:47.399
I see Kudo didn't come with you, how disappointing,

368
00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:51.199
after I told her he was the most reliable one.

369
00:20:51.199 --> 00:20:54.799
So it was you. You were behind that misleading letter.

370
00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.299
Now I remember,

371
00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:59.899
I did change back into Shinichi that one time.

372
00:20:59.899 --> 00:21:02.799
By the way, did something happen on the island?

373
00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:05.399
We arrived on the island today

374
00:21:05.399 --> 00:21:06.999
but everyone seemed to be in such a rush,

375
00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:10.199
we just decided to take the next ship back.

376
00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:13.399
Well... maybe it's better if you didn't know.

377
00:21:13.399 --> 00:21:15.799
Why'd you pick to come today?

378
00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:17.999
The festival was two days ago.

379
00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:20.299
We didn't come for the festival,

380
00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:22.799
we came for the seafood on this island.

381
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:25.199
It's cheap, delicious and the scenery's great.

382
00:21:25.199 --> 00:21:27.499
People are starting to talk about it.

383
00:21:27.499 --> 00:21:28.799
I see.

384
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:31.099
Even without the Dugong Festival,

385
00:21:31.099 --> 00:21:33.699
the island will still attract tourists then.

386
00:21:33.699 --> 00:21:38.599
Guess so. I just hope their wounds heal quickly.

387
00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:07.099
Hattori, let me see your scar.

388
00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:08.999
What for?

389
00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:11.099
You know why, come on.

390
00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:14.399
That's the wound of love Kazuha marked you with.

391
00:23:14.399 --> 00:23:16.399
Ran, what are you saying?

392
00:23:16.399 --> 00:23:18.199
Oh, that.

393
00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:19.299
When I got up this morning,

394
00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:23.099
the scar had come off and it had already healed.

395
00:23:23.099 --> 00:23:25.199
I don't believe it.

396
00:23:25.199 --> 00:23:28.099
I should have stabbed you deeper.

397
00:23:28.099 --> 00:23:29.799
Why you...

398
00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:32.799
But I'm glad it's healed.

399
00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:36.799
Now I won't have to hear you say that I almost killed you.

400
00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:39.899
Kazuha, wait up.

401
00:23:41.099 --> 00:23:44.799
Fool, you've just made me more fired up.

402
00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:47.199
I'm never...

403
00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:51.999
going to let anything happen to that girl. Never.

404
00:23:55.799 --> 00:23:58.299
What an actor.

405
00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:04.799
I see, if the shop is doing good business,

406
00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:08.699
then the people running it have to be there all day working

407
00:24:08.699 --> 00:24:10.399
and during that time, the one we're looking for

408
00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:13.199
would be alone in the house, hiding.

409
00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:17.499
This sure sounds like the pattern of The Red-Headed League?

410
00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:21.499
I came here to see the palm of the God of Fortune.

411
00:24:21.499 --> 00:24:23.399
What is this?

412
00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:24.899
I don't believe it...

413
00:24:25.699 --> 00:24:26.999
Next Conan,

414
00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:30.720
"The Secret To A Successful Business"

415
00:24:31.317 --> 00:24:33.517
Next Conan's Hint:

416
00:24:33.517 --> 00:24:35.217
"Palm reading"

417
00:24:35.817 --> 00:24:38.117
The next episode is truly a unique mystery.

418
00:24:38.117 --> 00:24:40.517
Your presence itself is most unique.
