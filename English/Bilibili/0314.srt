Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,940
A hike to the scenic viewpoint

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,940
reveals the hidden truth behind an unfortunate accident.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,640
His name is Detective Conan!

Who said there are lots of girls up here?

13
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:30,167
Not a soul, as far as I can see, man.

14
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,367
Well, the guidebook says

15
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:36,067
this place is quite popular among school girls.

16
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:39,667
Those reporters are so irresponsible and disgusting.

17
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,767
Sure, man. Sure thing.

18
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,767
You want me to go? Okay, I will.

19
00:02:48,767 --> 00:02:50,267
Wait a minute, Hirai!

20
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:51,667
What's up?

21
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:53,267
The place is tricky.

22
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:55,767
You need to be very careful when you work.

23
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:56,967
You're quite right.

24
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,467
We may have another fatal accident, right?

25
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:04,967
Well, I'll bet you'd rather like to see me get into an accident.

26
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,667
Hold it there.

27
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,067
See you guys.

28
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,367
What's wrong with him?

29
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,567
Good morning, everybody.

30
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:19,567
There is a broken fence at the scenic view point.

31
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,467
Please be careful.

32
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,067
All right.

33
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,467
Thank you.

"The View Point With A Broken Fence"

35
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,867
Hold it. Wait for me, guys.

36
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,867
Why? So soon again?

37
00:03:47,867 --> 00:03:50,167
We took a rest just a while ago.

38
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,867
Be nice, guys. We're not in a hurry.

39
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,867
Like we said, it's too much for you, old man, wasn't it?

40
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:57,867
Thanks for nothing.

41
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:00,667
I just worked too much lately and worked myself out.

42
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,367
Sure!

43
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,867
Well, Ran, let's leave the old man alone and go, shall we?

44
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,567
A good idea.

45
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,967
No, you don't! Hey.

46
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,467
Wow. What a beautiful sight.

47
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,667
Yeah.

48
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,567
He's the man we saw down there.

49
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,667
Right. What is he doing, there?

50
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,267
They said there's a broken fence.

51
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,467
He's probably working on it.

52
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:33,967
You're right.

53
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,667
Finally.

54
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,267
Oh. Hi, Pops.

55
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:40,167
You finally made it, dad.

56
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,267
He fell off.

57
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,167
Darn it!

58
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,167
Conan!

59
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,767
Watch out! What're you trying to do?

60
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,367
You want to fall off the cliff?

61
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:55,467
But...

62
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,867
Go down to the office and tell them about this, Ran.

63
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:58,967
Yes, dad.

64
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,067
Is anyone there?

65
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:06,867
What's the matter?

66
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:09,167
A man fell down the cliff.

67
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,967
What? Could it be Hirai?

68
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:14,067
Could be.

69
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:17,167
Anyway, how do we get below the view point?

70
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:18,467
This... this way.

71
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:21,167
Ran, call an ambulance and the police.

72
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,467
Sure, dad.

73
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:30,167
No good. He's already dead.

74
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:34,367
Hirai...

75
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,167
It's all my fault. My fault.

76
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,067
What do you mean, may I ask?

77
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,867
I asked him...

78
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:47,367
I asked him to fix the broken fence at the view point.

79
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:50,567
I should have gone...

80
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:53,667
If I do it myself, then this wouldn't have happened.

81
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,367
Why is it?

82
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,167
The two ropes that were left here are twisted

83
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:17,267
as if they had been tied to something for a long time.

84
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:27,267
Dad.

85
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:29,767
The police and ambulance will be here soon, they say.

86
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:30,967
Good.

87
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,767
Anyway, this seems to be an accident.

88
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,467
Let's leave everything here as is,

89
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:38,567
go back to the office and wait for the police to come.

90
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,667
Okay.

91
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,567
Conan, we are going back to the office.

92
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,667
Yeah.

93
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,367
What's this?

94
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:00,467
This...

95
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,567
is a spider's web and threads.

96
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,067
Why on earth is it here?

97
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:09,067
And where did he get it?

98
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,967
Just as I thought.

99
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:22,267
There was no spider's web around here and...

100
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,367
At the place where Mr. Hirai fell,

101
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:27,667
there are no traces of slip marks made by his boots.

102
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,367
It's as if he had jumped off the cliff.

103
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,067
Another thing puzzles me.

104
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,867
The ropes that were left beside the body

105
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:40,467
were twisted at both ends as if they had been tied to something.

106
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:47,067
If the rope was tied, then why Mr. Hirai fall to the ground?

107
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,767
And the way the ropes are twisted...

108
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:54,467
As if they have been tied in a knot for many hours.

109
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:58,767
Why did Mr. Hirai use that kind of rope?

110
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,967
It's just a hare.

111
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,367
An animal trail?

112
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:21,767
Conan is still out somewhere, dad.

113
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,967
Don't bother.

114
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,967
He is playing around somewhere nearby.

115
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:27,067
But...

116
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:29,667
Well, I'll go look for him.

117
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:33,167
There could've been an accident or something.

118
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,467
But...

119
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:38,067
Please stay here and wait for the police.

120
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,067
Don't worry. I'll be back with him soon.

121
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,967
Thank you.

122
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:45,567
He's a nice person.

123
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,167
Oh, dad!

124
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,767
This tree is...

125
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:02,267
the one that is sticking out from beneath the view point.

126
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,267
What's that?

127
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,067
A piton and a ring.

128
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:17,767
It's a mountain climber's piton and a snap ring.

129
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,267
Something strange is going on.

130
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,267
It's White-Eyes.

131
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,767
What's that?

132
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,667
Darn! I can't see clearly.

133
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,967
What're these?

134
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,867
Traces of spikes.

135
00:09:40,867 --> 00:09:42,667
They're still new.

136
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:55,367
A rope can leave traces of scratch marks like this.

137
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,367
So it comes up to...

138
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:59,167
Hey. Conan!

139
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,967
What are you doing up there? It's not safe up there.

140
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,067
I was looking at the nest of White-Eyes.

141
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,167
Oh, you were...

142
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:09,367
The White-Eyes are protected birds,

143
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,967
it's better if you leave them alone.

144
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,467
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,467
You'd better come down right away.

146
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,267
I will, right now.

147
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,767
They are worried about you at the office.

148
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,267
Say, Mr. Kondou.

149
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:27,267
Your boots look very old, how come?

150
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,367
Oh, you mean these?

151
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,567
I got these when I was in college.

152
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:33,567
These are so comfortable

153
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,367
so I don't want to change them for new ones.

154
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:38,967
The only thing is that they're heavy.

155
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,067
Now I see it.

156
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,767
Just as I thought. This is a murder case.

157
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:52,267
And the culprit is this man, Mr. Eiichiro Kondou.

158
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,867
He pushed Mr. Hirai off the cliff

159
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:57,167
and made it look as if he fell off by accident.

160
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,567
He used these tricks.

161
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,030
I see.

162
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,930
Since there are eyewitnesses to this incident,

163
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:18,030
we can assume, as Mr. Mouri says, that this is an accident.

164
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,030
Yes, officer.

165
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,130
But if people keep falling off by accident,

166
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,430
you could be held responsible for the safety of the park, Mr. Kondou.

167
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,630
I have the responsibility, yes.

168
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,330
What are you talking about, may I ask?

169
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,930
Well, about a month ago, another worker of this office had an accident.

170
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,030
She fell off the cliff and died.

171
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,630
Oh, she did.

172
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,430
Excuse us.

173
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,830
We want to move and carry the body out, if you don't mind.

174
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,430
Sure, guys.

175
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,030
Well, everybody,

176
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,830
we need to draw up a report at the police station,

177
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,130
so please come with us.

178
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,830
Yes, officer.

179
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,430
Wait a while, everybody.

180
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,830
Dad?

181
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,330
What's the matter, Mr. Mouri?

182
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,230
There is some doubt about Mr. Hirai's death being an accident.

183
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,930
What's that, Mr. Mouri?

184
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:29,930
Ran, when the man fell off the cliff, did you see his face?

185
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,930
No. I didn't, dad.

186
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,530
You didn't. Conan says he didn't either.

187
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,330
And I didn't either.

188
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:45,330
That is, the man that fell off may not have been Mr. Hirai.

189
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,830
But if he was not Mr. Hirai,

190
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,930
where did he disappear to?

191
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,130
Mr. Kondou, you probably know that

192
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,430
there is a tree sticking out just below the view point.

193
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,030
-Is that right? -Yes, there is a tree

194
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,530
but it's not a large one

195
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,030
and I don't think it can hold a falling man by any chance.

196
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:16,330
True. It's unlikely that the man got stuck to the tree by chance.

197
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,230
If that someone actually fell off...

198
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,430
What do you mean by that?

199
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,430
The man at the view point did not fall off,

200
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,130
he jumped off deliberately,

201
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,830
so he could make the people who witnessed the fall,

202
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,230
think that they saw Mr. Hirai fall to his death.

203
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,530
So, this is a homicide.

204
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,830
Right.

205
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,130
This is not an accident, but a case of murder.

206
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,430
Then, who on earth is the culprit?

207
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,630
The culprit is the person who knew that Mr. Hirai

208
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,430
was expected to go repair the fence.

209
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,330
He is also someone who could prepare

210
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:07,130
the same clothing that Mr. Hirai wore.

211
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,530
In other words...

212
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,430
It's...

213
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:14,430
none other than you, Mr. Kondou.

214
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,630
Then it's like this,

215
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,730
Mr. Kondou pushed Mr. Hirai off the cliff,

216
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,430
then waited for Mr. Mouri and the others to arrive,

217
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,730
which after he jumped down on to the tree.

218
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,130
No, that way the time that Mr. Kondou jumped off

219
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,930
would be different from the time Mr. Hirai fell off.

220
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,730
Since we came up here as tourists,

221
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,630
we approached the view point completely

222
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,530
irrelevant of what Mr. Kondou had in mind.

223
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,530
That is, we could've arrived five minutes

224
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,630
after Mr. Kondou pushed Mr. Hirai over the cliff,

225
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,430
or it could've been one hour later.

226
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:04,530
Then, how on earth was he able to do that?

227
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,230
The tree.

228
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,330
The tree?

229
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,130
Yes. Mr. Kondou jumped onto the tree,

230
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,630
where Mr. Hirai was already was.

231
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,730
Mr. Kondou jumped down onto the tree

232
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,130
and pushed Mr. Hirai off the tree.

233
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,130
That explains it.

234
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,030
That way, there would be practically no time difference what so ever.

235
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,130
But how could he dare do something like

236
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,530
risk his life jumping off the view point like that?

237
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,830
Well...

238
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,130
I wouldn't say it was such a great risk.

239
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,430
Conan found a mountain climber's piton with a snap ring

240
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,030
driven into the rock above the tree,

241
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,030
just below the edge of the cliff at the view point.

242
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:55,030
Probably, early this morning or last night,

243
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,130
Mr. Kondou prepared two ropes and tied them to the snap ring.

244
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,630
He put one of the ropes through the tree below

245
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,930
and fastened the rope in place,

246
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,430
then he wound the other rope to the pole of the fence

247
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,830
and tied it in place.

248
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:16,330
When he saw us coming to the park, he chose us to be witnesses.

249
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,430
And told Mr. Hirai to go repair the fence.

250
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,730
Mr. Kondou saw us go, and then,

251
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,730
he ran into the path in the back of the office to short cut us.

252
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,230
The climbers' path to the view point is the long way around,

253
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,730
so it wouldn't have been difficult for him to get there before us

254
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,930
if he ran straight through the mountain.

255
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,130
Then he ambushed Mr. Hirai, knocked him out,

256
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,230
and put him on the tree beneath the view point.

257
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,230
He waited for us to arrive,

258
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,230
then took the rope that he had tied onto the fence,

259
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,330
tied it around his body as his lifeline, and jumped off.

260
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:03,430
Mr. Kondou who was suspended in air with the lifeline,

261
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,030
took the rope that was tied onto the tree,

262
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,830
untied the lifeline, let go of it,

263
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,130
then climbed up the rope he was holding and landed on the tree.

264
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,530
He then untied the rope as he previously did with the other rope

265
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,130
and let go of it.

266
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,630
In the end, he pushed Mr. Hirai off the tree.

267
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,830
You're talking nonsense!

268
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,430
It's a whole lot of nonsense!

269
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,530
Everything is your imagination! There's no proof!

270
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,030
I passed him out and kept him on the tree, you say?

271
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,630
You're talking nonsense.

272
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,530
If you have any proof, show me!

273
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,030
The nest of the White-Eyes.

274
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,230
You know that there's a nest of White-Eyes, don't you, Mr. Kondou?

275
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,230
Wha... what about it?

276
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,830
When the White-Eyes make their nest,

277
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,630
they collect twigs and weeds and bind them using spiders' webs.

278
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,430
There was a web on the right side of Mr. Hirai's body.

279
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,630
I saw a spider's web.

280
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,630
So, it's there, but what does it have to do with me?

281
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,830
I said, show me proof that I did it!

282
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,330
There were traces of metal spikes on the trunk of the tree.

283
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,330
The spikes of mountain climbing boots.

284
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,730
I've heard that because of improved quality,

285
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,730
mountain climbers' boots nowadays have no metal spikes

286
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,630
since they are slip-proof even without them.

287
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,130
Mr. Kondou, you've been using your boots since your college days.

288
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,730
Why?

289
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,330
Are your boots spiked, Mr. Kondou?

290
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,630
Darn it!

291
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,630
That Hirai, he kept on picking alpine plants

292
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,630
and capturing the protected animals

293
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,830
to sell them at premier prices.

294
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,130
She... I mean the worker who died, and I were after him

295
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,930
wanting evidence of what he was doing.

296
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,330
And that evening, we caught him in the act.

297
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,930
But, while I was struggling with him,

298
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,630
my arm hit her and...

299
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,230
She fell off the cliff.

300
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,330
Since then, Hirai has been blackmailing me.

301
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,630
I couldn't put up with him any longer.

302
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,330
But maybe this was all for the better.

303
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:26,730
I can finally amends for what I did to her.

304
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,830
I thought he had enough sleep already.

305
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,330
Apparently not.

306
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,030
What's the matter, dad?

307
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,030
Let me have them.

308
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,930
Hey, don't. You can't.

309
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,430
No, it's not what you think.

310
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,130
Just what're you peeking at, dad?

311
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,730
Well, it just so happens that...

312
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,230
You're looking through the binoculars of your own initiative

313
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,230
and you dare say it just so happens that!

314
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,730
Like I said, it just so happens that I...

315
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,330
What're you going to do if Conan gets interested

316
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,330
and tries to take a look?

317
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,730
I told you, it just happened to come into view!

318
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,530
-My. You dirty old man. -You obstinate dumbbell of a girl.

319
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,630
-I'm telling mum about this! -What?

320
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,530
Hey! This is none of her business, is it?

321
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,930
Don't blame me for what happens to you after she finds out!

322
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,930
Hey, you wait.

323
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,730
-No way! -Please. Ran, dear.

324
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,330
Pops, just what did you happen to see?

325
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,930
It's a nightingale.

326
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,630
It's on this way.

327
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,430
This is Mr. Seizan's studio, I guess.

328
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,330
I've got it. This could explain it.

329
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,530
Next Conan, "A Place in the Sun"

330
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:16,798
Next Conan's Hint:

331
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,598
"A nightingale"

332
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:20,998
On April 7th, it's the movie 'The Ghost on Baker Street'.

333
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:23,544
And the TV series starts on April 14th.
