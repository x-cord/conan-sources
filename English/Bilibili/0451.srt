1
00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:03.807
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:05.607
Turns out to a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05.607 --> 00:00:07.107
The truth behind the murder committed behind illusion.

4
00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.707
Is it a cleverly devised trick or blinding magic?

5
00:00:09.707 --> 00:00:11.207
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:12.807
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.807 --> 00:00:14.707
His name is Detective Conan!

"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

9
00:01:56.726 --> 00:01:59.626
Pops received a call from the famous magician, Mr. Genyo Fuyuki,

10
00:01:59.626 --> 00:02:02.326
saying that he wants to meet Pops right away.

11
00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:04.826
"Genyo Fuyuki (35)" -Mr. Fuyuki says

12
00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:08.026
that someone in the troupe is after his life,

13
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.426
so Pops has to find out who it is.

14
00:02:12.126 --> 00:02:13.526
There are five members in his troupe.

15
00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:17.426
"Misa Uehara (26)" -His assistant, Ms. Misa Uehara.

16
00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:19.726
"Chiaki Nakagawa (24)" -Likewise, Ms. Chiaki Nakagawa.

17
00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:23.026
"Kazuma Ishida (19)" -Mr. Kazuma Ishida, who is in charge of taking videos.

18
00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:26.226
"Shingo Shoji (37)" -Mr. Shingo Shoji, in charge of stage performance.

19
00:02:27.526 --> 00:02:28.626
"Minoru Hasegawa (45)" -And Mr. Minoru Hasegawa,

20
00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:30.626
who is in charge of operating the crane.

21
00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:33.326
Afterwards, soon after conducting investigations,

22
00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:34.826
the magic show began.

23
00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:37.826
And...

24
00:02:48.726 --> 00:02:49.726
What the...

25
00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:51.026
Shoots!

26
00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:57.026

Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

30
00:03:24.426 --> 00:03:25.726
Just what are you doing?

31
00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.126
Hurry and unlock the lid!

32
00:03:31.726 --> 00:03:33.926
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

33
00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:36.126
Hasegawa, pull up the lid!

34
00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:48.626
Did something happen?

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:51.026

36
00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:52.926
-Call the ambulance! -Yes, sir!

-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

39
00:04:01.826 --> 00:04:04.226
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

Get a hold of yourself, Fuyuki!

00:04:17.126 --> 00:04:18.426
-Leader! -Mr. Fuyuki...

45
00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.526
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:22.926
Mr. Fuyuki.

00:04:24.926 --> 00:04:26.126
No good.

49
00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:29.726
Leader.

50
00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:35.726
This is all I filmed.

51
00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:37.926
We got absorbed watching it.

52
00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:39.926
It's a valuable film though.

53
00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:43.026
It's amazing how you kept on filming.

54
00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:44.026
It's nothing.

55
00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:47.426
Thanks to these videos,

56
00:04:47.426 --> 00:04:49.726
we have more or less an idea of what took place.

57
00:04:49.726 --> 00:04:53.826
But how was this magic supposed to work out in the first place?

58
00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:57.626
Mr. Fuyuki was supposed to be standing on top of the aquarium

59
00:04:57.626 --> 00:04:58.926
when the curtains were raised.

60
00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:02.026
How was he supposed to escape from the aquarium?

61
00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:05.226
Well...

62
00:05:05.226 --> 00:05:08.226
We can't tell you from our side.

63
00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:10.726
Why not? This is for investigation...

64
00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:12.426
Inspector.

65
00:05:12.426 --> 00:05:14.526
It doesn't matter if it's for investigation purposes,

66
00:05:14.526 --> 00:05:17.426
we can't reveal how the magic is performed.

67
00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:18.626
I know how!

68
00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:23.926
The secret is on the lid of the aquarium, isn't it?

69
00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:27.026
Just as I thought.

70
00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.826
Hey, what do you mean by that?

71
00:05:29.826 --> 00:05:31.426
See, look at this.

72
00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:33.526
Huh?

73
00:05:33.526 --> 00:05:36.726
This latch doesn't have the pin that holds it in place.

74
00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:42.826
That's right, when the assistants put shackles on Mr. Fuyuki's legs,

75
00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:47.126
they locked the latch on the lid and also the padlock, right?

76
00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:50.926
They're both real, but they removed the pin holding the latch in place.

77
00:05:52.626 --> 00:05:55.126
That way, the lid comes off easily, right?

78
00:05:56.526 --> 00:05:59.326
Then, Mr. Fuyuki was put in the aquarium

79
00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:00.926
and was later covered with the curtains.

80
00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:04.226
He used his abdominal muscles and got up

81
00:06:04.226 --> 00:06:06.626
and grabbed the handle that was hidden in back of the lid,

82
00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:09.726
stuck his head out of the lid and took a breath.

83
00:06:09.726 --> 00:06:11.926
There's really a handle.

84
00:06:11.926 --> 00:06:14.026
So this is how it was.

85
00:06:15.126 --> 00:06:18.526
Mr. Fuyuki immersed his body back into the water

86
00:06:18.526 --> 00:06:22.526
and showed that he was struggling in water after the curtains were raised.

87
00:06:23.626 --> 00:06:24.626
Dad.

88
00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:26.426
No, that's his performance.

89
00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:28.126
He's not giving any signal.

90
00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:30.926
And when the curtains were lowered again,

91
00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:35.026
he removed the handcuff that was rigged earlier so it'll come off easily,

92
00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:38.526
and used his abdominal muscles again to get up.

93
00:06:38.526 --> 00:06:41.126
He grabbed the handle that was hidden in back of the lid

94
00:06:41.126 --> 00:06:43.226
and escaped from the aquarium.

95
00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:44.626
I see.

96
00:06:44.626 --> 00:06:46.526
Fantastic, Conan.

97
00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:50.326
I saw it on television before.

98
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.226
Was what he said just now correct?

99
00:06:53.226 --> 00:06:54.326
Yes.

100
00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:56.726
Well, I guess so.

101
00:06:56.726 --> 00:06:58.826
According to the report,

102
00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:03.226
it is 10 to 1 that Mr. Fuyuki drowned to death.

103
00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:07.826
The question is whether this is just an accident or rigged by someone.

104
00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:09.626
I know who did it, Inspector.

105
00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:11.026
What?

106
00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:14.026
This is homicide and the murderers are...

107
00:07:14.026 --> 00:07:17.626
Ms. Misa Uehara and Ms. Chiaki Nakagawa!

108
00:07:17.626 --> 00:07:18.726
What?

109
00:07:18.726 --> 00:07:21.126
-Hey! -How can you say that?

110
00:07:21.126 --> 00:07:25.526
You both conspired to kill Mr. Fuyuki

111
00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:30.026
and pretended to remove the pin from the lid of the aquarium but didn't.

112
00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:31.626
You've got to be kidding!

113
00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:33.926
We removed the pin like we were supposed to!

114
00:07:33.926 --> 00:07:35.926
-See! -See it for yourself!

115
00:07:37.026 --> 00:07:40.226
Besides, the lid was opened like it's supposed to be, isn't it?

116
00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:41.226
Look.

117
00:07:45.026 --> 00:07:49.526
You could've gotten the pins back when you were trying to save Mr. Fuyuki.

118
00:07:49.526 --> 00:07:51.126
Just what do you think you're saying?

119
00:07:51.126 --> 00:07:54.726
Chiaki and I were holding Mr. Fuyuki's body, you know.

120
00:07:54.726 --> 00:07:56.726
You were the one that was holding the lid!

121
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.126
Oh, that's right.

122
00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:00.126
Pops.

123
00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:04.226
Wasn't the lid opened then?

124
00:08:04.226 --> 00:08:06.226
I wonder if that's true.

125
00:08:07.426 --> 00:08:09.626
I was also thinking about that,

126
00:08:09.626 --> 00:08:15.026
but it was easy to open the lid when we were trying to save Mr. Fuyuki.

127
00:08:15.026 --> 00:08:17.926
Which means that the pins were removed.

128
00:08:19.326 --> 00:08:22.726
Let's watch the video Mr. Kazuma recorded one more time.

129
00:08:26.126 --> 00:08:27.126
After this.

130
00:08:37.526 --> 00:08:39.426
Why did you pan it?

131
00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:41.126
Because I didn't want to reveal the trick.

132
00:08:41.126 --> 00:08:43.326
You can't possibly reveal it by filming it.

133
00:08:43.326 --> 00:08:45.426
Well, it's fine.

134
00:08:45.426 --> 00:08:46.426
Please show us the part

135
00:08:46.426 --> 00:08:50.626
where Mr. Shoji said he removed Mr. Fuyuki's feet from the lid.

136
00:08:50.626 --> 00:08:51.626
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:55.726
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

138
00:08:55.726 --> 00:08:57.126
-It's after here. -Mr. Fuyuki!

139
00:08:57.126 --> 00:08:58.926
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

140
00:08:58.926 --> 00:09:01.926
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

141
00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:08.026
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

142
00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:14.626
Leader...

143
00:09:14.626 --> 00:09:16.426
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

144
00:09:16.426 --> 00:09:18.126
Mr. Fuyuki.

145
00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:19.926
-Stop the video. -Yes, sir.

146
00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:22.426
Why did you pan it?

147
00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:25.426
I already told you to film the necessary parts.

148
00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:27.026
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:28.826
Too bad, isn't it, Inspector?

150
00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:34.626
It is unlikely that Misa or Chiaki had anything to do with the murder.

151
00:09:38.526 --> 00:09:39.926
Kazuma.

152
00:09:39.926 --> 00:09:41.326
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:47.826
Come to think of it, Mr. Kazuma,

154
00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:51.226
you gave something to Mr. Fuyuki during break, didn't you?

155
00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.026
Oh, it was medicine.

156
00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.526
Medicine? What medicine?

157
00:09:55.526 --> 00:09:57.926
A beta blocker.

158
00:09:57.926 --> 00:09:59.926
Beta blocker?

159
00:09:59.926 --> 00:10:01.326
It's a blocker drug.

160
00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:04.526
It lowers his heart rate.

161
00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:07.026
He always drinks it about 15 minutes before performing

162
00:10:07.026 --> 00:10:09.926
the "escape from underwater" magic

163
00:10:09.926 --> 00:10:12.626
that requires him to stop his breath for a long time.

164
00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:15.026
Is it under Mr. Fuyuki's orders?

165
00:10:15.026 --> 00:10:16.926
Of course.

166
00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:18.026
I got it!

167
00:10:18.026 --> 00:10:22.026
You switched that drug to a drug for hypomyotonia.

168
00:10:22.926 --> 00:10:25.026
"Kinchikannzai (Forbidden pervert crime)" -Forbidden pervert crime?

169
00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:28.226
"Kinchikannzai (Forbidden pervert crime)" -Just what're you talking about?

170
00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:30.026
It's a drug for hypomyotonia.

171
00:10:30.026 --> 00:10:31.626
Taking this drug causes a condition similar to adynamia,

172
00:10:31.626 --> 00:10:34.226
in which the hands and legs muscles lose strength

173
00:10:34.226 --> 00:10:38.626
and it becomes impossible to get up using one's muscles, too.

174
00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:41.026
But when the curtains went up once,

175
00:10:41.026 --> 00:10:43.726
although Mr. Fuyuki looked like he was struggling,

176
00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.126
he didn't send out any signal.

177
00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:50.326
Well, at that time, the drug was still not working.

178
00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:53.226
It started working when he tried to get up the second time

179
00:10:53.226 --> 00:10:54.726
using his abdominal muscle.

180
00:10:54.726 --> 00:10:56.226
Please wait.

181
00:10:56.226 --> 00:10:58.426
I respect Mr. Fuyuki, so why would I do something like that?

182
00:10:58.426 --> 00:11:01.926
Deep down in your heart, didn't you have a grudge against Mr. Fuyuki?

183
00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:05.926
He wouldn't let you be on stage as a magician for such a long time.

184
00:11:08.226 --> 00:11:09.426
That can't be.

185
00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:10.826
As proof of that,

186
00:11:10.826 --> 00:11:14.026
when everyone was trying to save Mr. Fuyuki,

187
00:11:14.026 --> 00:11:16.626
you alone kept filming the scenes.

188
00:11:16.626 --> 00:11:19.326
If you really respected your master,

189
00:11:19.326 --> 00:11:21.626
when the situation calls for life or death,

190
00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:24.026
you couldn't possibly be filming the scene.

191
00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:27.226
That's because...

192
00:11:27.226 --> 00:11:28.826
Mr. Fuyuki kept telling me

193
00:11:28.826 --> 00:11:32.526
to always keep a record of everything that happens, even accidents.

194
00:11:32.526 --> 00:11:34.626
He said that it would serve as proof

195
00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:36.626
that Genyo Fuyuki has always been a professional magician.

196
00:11:36.626 --> 00:11:37.626
Forensic officer.

197
00:11:37.626 --> 00:11:38.926
Yes, sir. What is it?

198
00:11:38.926 --> 00:11:41.726
Then, did you really switch the drugs?

199
00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:43.726
Of course I didn't do it.

200
00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:46.026
An analysis of the corpse's blood?

201
00:11:46.026 --> 00:11:47.026
I understand, sir.

202
00:11:47.026 --> 00:11:48.326
I'll be waiting.

203
00:11:48.326 --> 00:11:51.926
It's going to take some time before we get the results of the analysis,

204
00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:55.326
so I'd like everyone to wait in the waiting room till then.

205
00:11:56.526 --> 00:11:59.026
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

206
00:12:06.026 --> 00:12:07.326
What's the matter, Conan?

207
00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:09.926
I need to go to the restroom.

208
00:12:11.826 --> 00:12:12.826
Gosh.

209
00:12:15.926 --> 00:12:18.726
Try to remember that magic.

210
00:12:18.726 --> 00:12:20.326
Where is it?

211
00:12:20.326 --> 00:12:23.126
I'm sure that somewhere, the murderer's trick is hidden.

212
00:12:27.526 --> 00:12:31.226
Back then, the chain was lowered completely.

213
00:12:34.026 --> 00:12:35.626
Come to think of it, back then...

214
00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:40.626
Maybe...

215
00:12:41.826 --> 00:12:44.526
Let's take another look at the video.

216
00:12:44.526 --> 00:12:45.526
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

217
00:12:55.326 --> 00:12:56.326
Officer Takagi!

218
00:12:56.326 --> 00:12:58.226
Just what do you think you're doing, Takagi?

219
00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:01.826
I am sorry, I did it unintentionally.

220
00:13:03.126 --> 00:13:05.326
-What's the matter with you, clinging on like that? -Give me a break.

221
00:13:07.226 --> 00:13:09.026
Come to think of it,

222
00:13:09.026 --> 00:13:11.026
after the curtains went down for the third time,

223
00:13:11.026 --> 00:13:12.726
it became pitch dark once.

224
00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.526
This latch...

225
00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:25.926
Huh? Did you find something again?

226
00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:29.726
Doesn't this latch look strange?

227
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:33.026
Isn't the middle part of the latch usually long?

228
00:13:33.026 --> 00:13:34.526
That's right.

229
00:13:34.526 --> 00:13:35.926
It's surprising that you noticed.

230
00:13:35.926 --> 00:13:38.626
Besides, I wonder what this hole is.

231
00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:40.526
I was concerned about it, too.

232
00:13:40.526 --> 00:13:43.126
It looks like someone tried to open it later after that.

233
00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.426
Later?

234
00:13:51.926 --> 00:13:53.226
Conan.

235
00:13:53.226 --> 00:13:55.726
You sure took your time in the restroom.

236
00:13:55.726 --> 00:13:57.726
I had a stomachache.

237
00:13:57.726 --> 00:13:59.426
Oh, well.

238
00:13:59.426 --> 00:14:00.726
Hey.

239
00:14:00.726 --> 00:14:04.726
Have you been using the same latch on the lid from before?

240
00:14:04.726 --> 00:14:05.926
The latch?

241
00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:07.226
No.

242
00:14:07.226 --> 00:14:09.726
It got old so it was recently changed to a new one.

243
00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:13.026
And who changed it?

244
00:14:14.426 --> 00:14:15.626
I need to go to the restroom again!

245
00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:18.126
I got it.

246
00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:19.226
All I need now is proof!

247
00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:25.326
Watch closely. We may have overlooked something.

248
00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:30.626
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

249
00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:35.026
I've found the proof.

250
00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:37.226
The murderer is him after all!

251
00:14:48.535 --> 00:14:49.935
Nothing was detected?

252
00:14:49.935 --> 00:14:53.035
Yes, we got report from the lab

253
00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:54.535
that no traces of a drug for hypomyotonia

254
00:14:54.535 --> 00:14:57.735
was detected in Mr. Fuyuki's blood.

255
00:14:57.735 --> 00:14:59.835
So Mr. Kazuma is cleared.

256
00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:04.435
We can't really get anything out of the video either,

257
00:15:04.435 --> 00:15:07.035
so I guess we can't keep them here any longer.

258
00:15:09.535 --> 00:15:12.435
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

259
00:15:12.435 --> 00:15:16.235
Darn it! I was pretty sure I was right and yet...

260
00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:18.035
Hey, Pops.

261
00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:19.235
What is it, kid?

262
00:15:22.135 --> 00:15:24.035
This way.

263
00:15:24.035 --> 00:15:26.635
What is this strange thing you're telling me about?

264
00:15:28.335 --> 00:15:30.535
There's nothing here.

265
00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:31.835
Hey, kid!

266
00:15:43.535 --> 00:15:45.835
Huh? Mr. Mouri said so?

267
00:15:45.835 --> 00:15:48.735
Yeah, he told me to get everyone to gather at the stage.

268
00:15:49.735 --> 00:15:51.135
Inspector, maybe...

269
00:15:51.135 --> 00:15:53.035
He's here! Now, we will know the truth.

270
00:15:55.335 --> 00:15:56.735
Hey, Officer Chiba.

271
00:16:01.735 --> 00:16:04.135
Pops! Everybody's gathered!

272
00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:12.335
Everyone, this case was indeed very peculiar.

273
00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:13.835
What I mean

274
00:16:13.835 --> 00:16:18.335
is the magic that was performed on stage itself was rigged beforehand.

275
00:16:18.335 --> 00:16:19.635
The murderer rigged the magic

276
00:16:19.635 --> 00:16:22.335
that was already rigged with his own devised trick.

277
00:16:22.335 --> 00:16:26.835
This ended up in a double and triple trick.

278
00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:31.135
But it is my mistake for not being able to see through it beforehand.

279
00:16:31.135 --> 00:16:34.135
Although it's delayed, I'd like to point out the murderer

280
00:16:34.135 --> 00:16:40.135
who killed Mr. Fuyuki with his cleverly thought out trick.

281
00:16:44.435 --> 00:16:48.935
It's you, Mr. Shingo Shoji, the stage director!

282
00:16:48.935 --> 00:16:50.135
What?

283
00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:53.435
During the time the "escape from underwater" magic was being performed,

284
00:16:53.435 --> 00:16:55.535
you, who were supposed to be watching the monitor

285
00:16:55.535 --> 00:16:57.635
was in fact, not there.

286
00:16:57.635 --> 00:17:00.335
You were on the beam right above the aquarium.

287
00:17:02.835 --> 00:17:04.835
But if he were there,

288
00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:08.335
wouldn't he be seen by the audience, Misa and the others who were on stage?

289
00:17:08.335 --> 00:17:11.135
No, he couldn't be seen from the audience.

290
00:17:11.135 --> 00:17:15.235
It was dark on top of the aquarium since the light did not reach there.

291
00:17:15.235 --> 00:17:18.135
Of course, Misa and Chiaki who were on stage

292
00:17:18.135 --> 00:17:20.235
and Mr. Hasegawa who was behind the stage, couldn't see him either.

293
00:17:20.235 --> 00:17:22.035
No, we couldn't see him.

294
00:17:22.035 --> 00:17:23.335
True.

295
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:26.335
Let's say the murderer was hiding on the beam,

296
00:17:26.335 --> 00:17:28.935
then how did he kill Mr. Fuyuki?

297
00:17:28.935 --> 00:17:30.535
From the camera shot taken from the audience,

298
00:17:30.535 --> 00:17:33.835
there were no signs of anyone approaching the aquarium.

299
00:17:33.835 --> 00:17:35.535
That's right.

300
00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:37.135
It's impossible to approach the aquarium

301
00:17:37.135 --> 00:17:40.435
without being seen by the audience or being filmed by the camera.

302
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:41.735
Impossible?

303
00:17:41.735 --> 00:17:44.035
No, it's not impossible.

304
00:17:44.035 --> 00:17:50.835
When the curtains were raised showing Mr. Fuyuki struggling in agony,

305
00:17:50.835 --> 00:17:54.135
you, who were on the beam, used the chain from the crane

306
00:17:54.135 --> 00:17:56.535
and landed on top of the lid.

307
00:18:02.835 --> 00:18:04.135
The technique is possible

308
00:18:04.135 --> 00:18:07.735
because of Mr. Shoji's experience of being a magician in the past.

309
00:18:07.735 --> 00:18:09.535
After he landed on the lid,

310
00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:13.535
he stuck the pin in the connecting part of the latch in question.

311
00:18:13.535 --> 00:18:16.835
But how did he get back up on the beam of the ceiling?

312
00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:20.235
Mr. Shoji did not go back to the beam of the ceiling.

313
00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:22.835
He came out of the bottom of the aquarium.

314
00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.135
Bottom of the aquarium?

315
00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:26.735
After the curtain was lowered,

316
00:18:26.735 --> 00:18:28.335
he jumped down from the top of the lid.

317
00:18:29.435 --> 00:18:31.535
When the stage went dark for an instant,

318
00:18:31.535 --> 00:18:34.535
he swiftly came out from under the curtain

319
00:18:34.535 --> 00:18:37.235
and ran over backstage.

320
00:18:37.235 --> 00:18:40.135
And when everyone realized that something was wrong,

321
00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:41.935
he made everyone bring Mr. Fuyuki down,

322
00:18:41.935 --> 00:18:44.935
distracting everyone from the video and all.

323
00:18:44.935 --> 00:18:47.335
So he should have the pins on him, right?

324
00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:49.535
Takagi, search his body!

325
00:18:49.535 --> 00:18:50.935
Yes. Please excuse me.

326
00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:52.035
Go ahead.

327
00:18:54.335 --> 00:18:56.235
Please check very carefully

328
00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:59.635
because I can't take being accused as the murderer anymore.

329
00:18:59.635 --> 00:19:01.235
Inspector, he doesn't have it on him.

330
00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:02.935
Did you check thoroughly?

331
00:19:02.935 --> 00:19:06.535
The pin is small, so he could've thrown it out somewhere.

332
00:19:08.735 --> 00:19:10.435
According to reports from the forensic officer,

333
00:19:10.435 --> 00:19:13.335
there were no pins found on stage.

334
00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:15.735
Maybe it's in the aisles or waiting room?

335
00:19:15.735 --> 00:19:19.235
Chiba was with them right through in the waiting room.

336
00:19:19.235 --> 00:19:24.735
Even if we did find the pin, we have no proof that he threw it out.

337
00:19:24.735 --> 00:19:26.335
There is proof.

338
00:19:27.635 --> 00:19:30.335
Mr. Shoji didn't use a pin.

339
00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.535
He used a ring instead.

340
00:19:32.535 --> 00:19:33.535
A ring?

341
00:19:34.635 --> 00:19:36.535
Inspector!

342
00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:39.435
Please look at the latch on the lid of the aquarium.

343
00:19:39.435 --> 00:19:40.735
The latch on the lid?

344
00:19:40.735 --> 00:19:43.935
There should be a hole that shouldn't be on the latch's connector.

345
00:19:44.735 --> 00:19:45.835
This?

346
00:19:45.835 --> 00:19:49.835
He pulled a ring that could be opened through the hole of the connector

347
00:19:49.835 --> 00:19:52.735
and stuck it and rigged it so that the lid wouldn't open.

348
00:19:52.735 --> 00:19:55.035
And that ring...

349
00:19:55.035 --> 00:19:59.435
Mr. Shoji, you're wearing it on your middle finger.

350
00:19:59.435 --> 00:20:00.435
Excuse me.

351
00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:04.335
I found it. It's a two strand ring.

352
00:20:04.335 --> 00:20:09.335
There is a slit in that two strand ring so they can easily be separated.

353
00:20:15.435 --> 00:20:18.735
I'm sure it's rigged so that it can be twisted and opened even more.

354
00:20:18.735 --> 00:20:20.435
It's true.

355
00:20:20.435 --> 00:20:22.135
What's the meaning of this?

356
00:20:22.135 --> 00:20:26.835
Being a magician, I can work out one or two tricks.

357
00:20:26.835 --> 00:20:31.235
First of all, you've got no proof that I used that ring.

358
00:20:31.235 --> 00:20:34.035
Let's not be so unrelenting.

359
00:20:34.035 --> 00:20:38.735
Let's take a look at the video Mr. Kazuma took one more time, then.

360
00:20:38.735 --> 00:20:39.735
Officer Chiba!

361
00:20:42.535 --> 00:20:45.035
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

362
00:20:48.435 --> 00:20:49.435
Stop!

363
00:20:51.435 --> 00:20:52.535
It's the ring!

364
00:20:53.535 --> 00:20:55.335
Which means...

365
00:20:55.335 --> 00:20:58.735
It means I had the ring on all the time.

366
00:20:58.735 --> 00:21:01.535
Please look a little before this image.

367
00:21:03.035 --> 00:21:04.135
The ambulance!

368
00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:06.935
The ring is not there.

369
00:21:11.235 --> 00:21:15.235
After he pulled me away from the lid,

370
00:21:15.235 --> 00:21:18.435
he removed the ring that was put through the hole of the latch's connector

371
00:21:18.435 --> 00:21:21.335
and took off the feet shackles from Mr. Fuyuki.

372
00:21:23.935 --> 00:21:27.235
Mr. Shoji, do you admit to committing the crime?

373
00:21:29.035 --> 00:21:30.935
I have no regrets.

374
00:21:38.035 --> 00:21:41.735
Because I got to perform the magic of my lifetime.

375
00:21:43.035 --> 00:21:44.235
What did you say?

376
00:21:47.735 --> 00:21:51.735
Mr. Shoji, isn't magic supposed to entertain people?

377
00:21:51.735 --> 00:21:54.835
How could you think of using it as a tool to commit murder?

378
00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:58.635
You're not only disqualified to be a magician,

379
00:21:58.635 --> 00:22:00.835
but you're a failure as a human being as well!

380
00:23:34.135 --> 00:23:36.435
It's gotten so late.

381
00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:39.935
But your deduction was great again, Dad.

382
00:23:39.935 --> 00:23:41.435
Well...

383
00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:44.735
But I don't remember a thing.

384
00:23:44.735 --> 00:23:48.235
Hold it! This may be the ultimate magic.

385
00:23:49.235 --> 00:23:50.935
What's the matter?

386
00:23:50.935 --> 00:23:54.035
Ran, from now on, I'm making a change from the Sleeping Kogoro

387
00:23:54.035 --> 00:23:56.135
to Magician Kogoro.

388
00:23:58.135 --> 00:23:59.135
Huh?

389
00:24:00.235 --> 00:24:02.535
Shall I make you sleep again?

390
00:24:03.635 --> 00:24:06.135
"Next Episode"

391
00:24:06.135 --> 00:24:10.135
It's the last of a popular movie that's been playing for 20 years.

392
00:24:10.135 --> 00:24:12.535
"Film content" -Strange.

393
00:24:12.535 --> 00:24:16.135
See, there are two tickets for the preview of this movie three years ago,

394
00:24:16.135 --> 00:24:18.535
unused in between the pages of his pocketbook.

395
00:24:19.435 --> 00:24:20.835
Maybe he has no intention...

396
00:24:24.435 --> 00:24:27.235
of coming back here.

397
00:24:28.335 --> 00:24:33.635
Next Conan, "Preview of Karma and Friendship"

398
00:24:49.435 --> 00:24:51.335
Next Conan's Hint:

399
00:24:51.335 --> 00:24:53.635
"Stage actor"

400
00:24:53.635 --> 00:24:55.435
In the next episode, the troupe in Konpira is in trouble!

401
00:24:55.435 --> 00:24:57.335
I can make kinpira too, you know.

402
00:24:57.335 --> 00:24:58.748
She's cracking an hour special joke.
