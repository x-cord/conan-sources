1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:03,682
Alibis, secret codes, tricks and deals.

2
00:00:03,682 --> 00:00:05,882
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:07,682
Today's stage is really a stage.

4
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:09,782
Behind the act is the scenario of a murder.

5
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,282
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,182
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,382
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:57,895
"The Strolling Players Troupe (Part 1)"

9
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:03,795
What? The leader of a strolling players troupe?

10
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:06,795
Yes. "The Tamanosuke Troupe.

11
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,395
A special stage performance in announcement

12
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,495
of the succession of the professional name." It says.

13
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,795
So, are you acting out a woman's part too?

14
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,395
Well, I guess so.

15
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:16,795
Before the main stage today,

16
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,895
I'm planning to dance three songs,

17
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:20,395
while switching costumes in the wink of an eye.

18
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:23,095
I'll go see you! I promise!

19
00:02:23,095 --> 00:02:24,995
What shall I do?

20
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,095
How fantastic.

21
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:35,195
How lucky because a strolling players troupe

22
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,595
can travel throughout the country.

23
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:41,895
Yes. We make our annual or 2 year rounds

24
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,895
and perform for our fans.

25
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:47,595
Huh? Then, have you come to Beika Theater before?

26
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,595
Yes, 2 years ago.

27
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,795
But back then, my father was the troupe leader,

28
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,995
and I was just an ordinary actor.

29
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:55,995
So, we didn't advertise ourselves like this.

30
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:58,795
Did your father pass away?

31
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:01,595
A year ago, because of an illness.

32
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:02,595
After that, the members of our troupe

33
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,195
decreased to half of what it used to be.

34
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:08,095
It's quite embarrassing, but the going's quite tough.

35
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:09,895
I see.

36
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:13,095
Don't worry! I'll go and pass all this out for you.

37
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:15,195
You can count on me to do things like this.

38
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,795
You go ahead and practice all you like.

39
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,895
Thank you. I'll do my best.

40
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:23,295
So, that's the story.

41
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:26,595
I know he's going to be going to another school in a month,

42
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:28,595
but I'd like to help him while he's here.

43
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,695
I'll bet that's how he deceives people

44
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:33,495
into passing out leaflets for him, isn't it?

45
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:37,195
No! Passing out leaflets is just an excuse.

46
00:03:37,195 --> 00:03:39,995
What I really want to do is go see his dressing room.

47
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:41,395
You idiot!

48
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:44,495
If you have such time, go do your studies!

49
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:47,195
I'm sorry! So, I'm taking Ran with me.

50
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:49,195
-Let's go. -Hey!

51
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,595
Don't worry!

52
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,395
Tamanosuke is a weak handsome guy,

53
00:03:53,395 --> 00:03:54,995
so he can't possibly be a bad person, right?

54
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:56,295
Yes.

55
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:57,795
And besides, if worse comes to worse,

56
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:00,695
strike out a kick for me, honey.

57
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:01,795
What's that supposed to mean?

58
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:04,195
I'm not your bodyguard, you know.

59
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,995
Sorry, sorry. Let's hurry and go.

60
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,395
-Hey, Ran. -Huh?

61
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:09,795
It's you again.

62
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:12,195
May I go too?

63
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:14,295
-We'll go too. -Yes!

64
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,795
No! We'll be a nuisance going in a big group!

65
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:20,195
I promise I'll take you when the stage performance begins.

66
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:21,895
So, you all stay put.

67
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,695
I'll be back by dinner time.

68
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:31,195
He said to come in from the dressing room entrance

69
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:33,495
but the main entrance is open.

70
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:34,695
Yes.

71
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:35,895
"Beika Theater" -Let's go in from here.

72
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,995
-What? -They may be practicing.

73
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:41,895
-Wait, Sonoko. -No sweat, no sweat.

74
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:46,895
They're practicing!

75
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,495
Fantastic!

76
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:59,895
-Hi! Thanks for coming. -Hello.

77
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,395
Sorry to intrude on you...

78
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:03,495
We're sorry for intruding on you...

79
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:04,795
What?

80
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:07,995
Hello! Little ones, thanks for coming.

81
00:05:07,995 --> 00:05:10,895
I told you guys not to come!

82
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:12,395
It's okay.

83
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,995
I'm glad you came in a group.

84
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:18,195
Really? Tamanosuke, you're kind, aren't you?

85
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,795
Let me introduce you.

86
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:21,595
This is Ryuichi Muraki,

87
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:23,795
the star of our troupe, who can handle anything.

88
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:25,995
Hi there!

89
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:28,195
This is Yuri Shirai. She plays the role of the young lady.

90
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,695
Nice to meet you.

91
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:31,495
I am Sonoko and this is Ran,

92
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,095
who will be helping pass out the leaflets.

93
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:36,595
Your actions are really neat.

94
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:39,795
Nowadays, unless you possess some special characteristic,

95
00:05:39,795 --> 00:05:42,395
-the audience do not catch on. -True.

96
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:43,995
We were hired here

97
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:47,895
because we belonged to the gymnastics club in our school days.

98
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:50,495
Not really. Just do your best.

99
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:52,295
Well, we're going to the dressing room,

100
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,895
so I'll leave the rest up to all of you.

101
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,995
Come. Will you climb up from here?

102
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:00,495
Okay...

103
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:01,495
Leader!

104
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:05,095
Will you hurry it up with the scripts while you're at it?

105
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:08,695
I got it. I'm sorry, but wait just a little while more.

106
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,695
Gosh.

107
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:15,095
I'm glad the theater is closed tomorrow.

108
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:18,195
We'll leave as soon as we receive the leaflets.

109
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:19,795
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:25,595
Don't let him bother you.

111
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:28,995
All that's left to do is to get the scripts for the new play.

112
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:32,395
But, isn't your performance going to start day after tomorrow?

113
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:35,795
We can't afford to completely rent the theater and practice,

114
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,495
so it's always like this.

115
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,095
You're really busy, aren't you?

116
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:46,095
Why aren't we doing the same play as we did before

117
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:47,595
and doing a new play instead?

118
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:50,295
Megumi.

119
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:51,795
She's my younger sister, Megumi.

120
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,295
Hello.

121
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,095
I'm his younger sister Megumi,

122
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:58,095
who has become like a mother to him because he's unreliable.

123
00:06:58,095 --> 00:06:59,195
Nice to meet you.

124
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:00,895
Hey.

125
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:02,195
At any rate!

126
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:05,895
Everybody's upset over your selfishness!

127
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:09,795
You have no time to be having a good time with girls, do you?

128
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:11,295
Hey, Megumi.

129
00:07:11,295 --> 00:07:14,095
We just happened to pop in without an invitation.

130
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:16,895
I'll take care of them,

131
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,995
so you go and get the scripts ready, leader.

132
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,295
Okay.

133
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,395
Hurry on!

134
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,995
Please enjoy your tour around the dressing room.

135
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,495
I'll see you later.

136
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,695
Gosh.

137
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:32,495
He says he's having a tough time after his father's death,

138
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,895
but he's the one who's giving himself a tough time.

139
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:40,595
You're Conan! Thanks for coming!

140
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:43,895
Hey, how come you know Conan's name?

141
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:48,195
Because I just started going to Teitan Elementary from today.

142
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,795
You're not in our class, are you?

143
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:52,695
I'm in class C.

144
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:56,495
But Conan looked so much like my brother when he was young

145
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:59,495
that I asked one of the girls in my class his name.

146
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:04,495
I'm so happy that we got to be friends so soon!

147
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:08,895
Okay, I'll show you the leader

148
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:12,695
and my scene dressing room first.

149
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,595
You can all come along, too!

150
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,895
What's with her?

151
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,995
How cute. He's so quite popular, isn't he?

152
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,495
Please wait a while

153
00:08:22,495 --> 00:08:25,895
because I haven't unpacked all my things yet.

154
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,995
Hey.

155
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:30,295
Here it is!

156
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,895
See, look.

157
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:36,495
They look alike, don't they?

158
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,495
How cute!

159
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:42,695
Hey, which part of him looks like me?

160
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:44,895
Come on, he's a fag.

161
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:47,495
He plays the star female role in the troupe.

162
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,495
Let's see.

163
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,895
Tamanosuke is so cute!

164
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:54,495
Really. He looks just like Conan.

165
00:08:54,495 --> 00:08:57,195
You may become cute if you put on make-up too, Conan.

166
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,395
Right?

167
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:01,195
I'll take you to everybody else's dressing room, then.

168
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:05,095
Please come this way.

169
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:08,095
Children are so innocent.

170
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,295
-Huh? -Please let us take a look around, Itoe.

171
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:15,295
She is Itoe Ogiwara, an accountant.

172
00:09:15,295 --> 00:09:18,295
But she is also an actress.

173
00:09:18,295 --> 00:09:20,295
They are Conan Edogawa,

174
00:09:20,295 --> 00:09:22,895
his friends and his older sister and her friend.

175
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,195
Nice to meet you all. Please come in.

176
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:29,895
Since my costume is ready, I'm going over to the office.

177
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,895
Is he your boyfriend, Megumi?

178
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,295
No, he isn't!

179
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:41,095
I'm sorry, so he's your boyfriend?

180
00:09:41,095 --> 00:09:43,395
Wrong again.

181
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,095
I am a princess.

182
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:51,595
This is funny!

183
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:53,695
Conan, let's join them too.

184
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:57,695
Ran, let's go home. Please!

185
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:02,195
Experience makes perfect! Try it.

186
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:03,695
Cut it out!

187
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:06,995
What was that?

188
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,795
Shut up, I'm telling you!

189
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:13,095
What's up? Leader!

190
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:17,895
Hey you! Just what do you think you're doing?

191
00:10:17,895 --> 00:10:21,195
It's just a slight difference in opinion.

192
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:23,495
Tamanosuke!

193
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,795
Are you all right?

194
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:28,895
Yeah, I'm fine.

195
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,695
Tamanosuke!

196
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:37,395
What about the scripts, Mr. Chikaishi?

197
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:41,095
It's done. I'm printing it out now.

198
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:43,495
He told me to rewrite the last part

199
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:45,795
so I gave him a licking.

200
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:48,295
You've got teach him the ways of the world while he's young,

201
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:50,895
or he'll grow up to be a good-for-nothing adult.

202
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:53,495
Don't you agree, Mr. Tajima?

203
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:57,795
Knowing the ways, we can all live happily, right?

204
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:00,195
Oops, I'm out of tobbaco.

205
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:03,495
Mr. Tajima. Go get the same type of tobbaco for me, will you?

206
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,395
Mr. Tajima, I'll go buy the tobbaco.

207
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:09,895
No, it's okay.

208
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,195
Mr. Tajima.

209
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:19,895
I won't forgive you, Chikaishi Sensei!

210
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:21,995
Megumi, don't...

211
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,895
Mr. Chikaishi.

212
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:26,495
Why did you change it from how we had it arranged to begin with?

213
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:29,495
Fact is fact, and a drama is drama.

214
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,295
That's all I can say.

215
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:35,495
Okay, we'll go with that.

216
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,095
We've got to start reading practice right away,

217
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:38,395
so please hurry.

218
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,395
I'm all right.

219
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:43,195
When he finishes printing the script out,

220
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:45,295
please make copies.

221
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:48,295
I'll go and rest in my room till then.

222
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:50,295
Tamanosuke...

223
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:54,595
What's with him?

224
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:56,295
No matter how young the troupe leader is,

225
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,495
how dare he get that violent.

226
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:00,895
What's with this strolling players troupe anyway?

227
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:16,384
Wow. It's being printed and coming out one after the other.

228
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,184
All done!

229
00:12:21,184 --> 00:12:24,584
You've finally finished.

230
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,484
"Memoirs of Itaro, the Detective"

231
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,784
Episode of "Edo Kid, the Thief".

232
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:32,284
Huh? "Edo Kid, the Thief"?

233
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:36,684
Yeah. It's the Edo Kid the thief.

234
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:38,884
He's the model of this story.

235
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:42,084
Okay, sonny. Give that to me.

236
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:44,384
Thank you, Sensei.

237
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:47,384
-I'll go make copies. -Yeah.

238
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,684
Well, I'm finally finished.

239
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:53,584
I guess I'll go take a snooze.

240
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:56,184
Hey, what're you guys doing?

241
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:58,584
This is the document for the Edo Kid, isn't it?

242
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:00,784
What's this Edo Kid all about?

243
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:03,984
He's a thief that ransacked a vast area of throughout Japan

244
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:08,184
starting with the Tokyo area.

245
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,584
He flees just like a thief in the days of the samurai,

246
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:14,884
running along roofs and somersaulting backwards.

247
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:18,084
He used to be called by the alias, "The Oedo Kid".

248
00:13:18,084 --> 00:13:19,384
After the mass media broadcasted him,

249
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,384
he became known as the Edo Kid.

250
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,784
I see.

251
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:27,484
Did you use the Edo Kid as a model

252
00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:29,784
because there are people in this troupe who can perform acrobatics?

253
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:33,784
Yeah. We travel all throughout Japan too.

254
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:36,684
There were times when we were suspected by the police.

255
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:39,484
The two over there were even summoned by them.

256
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:44,784
I don't know what he was thinking,

257
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:47,984
but the leader wanted to create a new version of the Edo Kid.

258
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:50,584
That's why you researched in such detail?

259
00:13:50,584 --> 00:13:51,684
Sort of.

260
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:53,784
When I input this into the computer,

261
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:56,784
I'll get to see the picture.

262
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:59,484
Conan, come here a minute.

263
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,584
Your cute sister is here to come get you.

264
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:05,584
You better go on home before I punch you.

265
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,084
We're sorry to have intruded on you.

266
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:16,984
Gosh. What do you think you're doing

267
00:14:16,984 --> 00:14:18,284
with somebody who beat Tamanosuke up so bad?

268
00:14:18,284 --> 00:14:20,784
Where is Tamanosuke?

269
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,384
He's resting.

270
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:24,484
I guess he's really shocked.

271
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,684
So, we're leaving now.

272
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:28,384
We've got to pass these leaflets out too,

273
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:30,184
so follow me.

274
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:33,484
What? I don't want to go home yet!

275
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:34,784
Since you barged in here,

276
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:37,584
you're helping me pass out leaflets.

277
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,384
Okay.

278
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:42,784
But the man we met a while ago, left from this side.

279
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:46,284
It's much closer to go to the stage from this side, too.

280
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:49,684
This exit is closer to the station.

281
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:50,884
Hurry.

282
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:53,184
Is she going to treat us something at the station building?

283
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:56,484
No, we're going to help pass out leaflets at the station.

284
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:59,484
-Bummers. -I'll treat you so hurry up.

285
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:02,084
All right!

286
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:08,884
Please drop by to see them.

287
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:11,484
Please go see them.

288
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:13,984
Please go see them.

289
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,484
I'm sure there's something behind those people.

290
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:34,884
I told you not to sneak out on us like that, Conan.

291
00:15:34,884 --> 00:15:39,084
Gosh! What about passing out the leaflets?

292
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:40,484
A lady who is a member of the community committee

293
00:15:40,484 --> 00:15:43,884
happened to pass by, and she took all the leaflets.

294
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:47,284
We don't cheat as much as you do, Conan.

295
00:15:47,284 --> 00:15:49,084
We saw you.

296
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:51,184
I'll bet you're thinking of going back to the theater?

297
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,684
Right. Just as would be expected of the Youth Detective Squad.

298
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:54,884
Right.

299
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:08,784
I'm glad to see you, because I thought you all went home.

300
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,184
Look! Do I look good in this outfit?

301
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:11,484
We're going to start practice.

302
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:12,984
Wish me luck, okay?

303
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:16,684
Sure! How's the troupe leader?

304
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,884
I'm fine.

305
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,584
I'm sorry about what happened a while ago.

306
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,584
Tamanosuke, you're so good looking!

307
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:23,984
Look, he's Itaro!

308
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,984
Yes! It's a short play,

309
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,784
so if it's okay with you, please watch it.

310
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:31,084
Okay, thank you.

311
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:38,984
Look, there's a house!

312
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:41,784
It's just like the samurai movies on TV.

313
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,384
Watch out! Don't move!

314
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:53,584
Why is there a hole here?

315
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,884
I'm sorry. That's call a pit.

316
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:58,984
Please be careful!

317
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,184
This pit is very deep!

318
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:03,084
You don't want to fall in there!

319
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:05,284
-I'm sorry. -I'm sorry.

320
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:09,584
There's Mr. Thief! He's so neat!

321
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:15,084
1 minute 40 seconds.

322
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,684
It's taking up too much time.

323
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,184
If he goes into the sleeve of the stage,

324
00:17:19,184 --> 00:17:20,884
go down the stairs while changing clothes,

325
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:23,384
and if the time that it takes for him to rise upis done in a short time,

326
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:26,184
it looks neat and like magic!

327
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:27,784
But it's taking him a while

328
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:30,584
because there's nobody to help him change clothes.

329
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:33,584
Hey! Cut out all that embarrassing talk

330
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:36,284
and show your friends to their seats.

331
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,884
Okay.

332
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:43,084
This seat is in the center and gives you the best view.

333
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:46,384
Don't you have to practice too, Megumi?

334
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:49,084
Oh, no. Don't go home and watch, okay?

335
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,584
-Promise, promise. -Do your best!

336
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:52,484
I will. See you later.

337
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:57,084
I wonder how Mr. Chikaishi change the last scene of the script.

338
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:00,184
After reading practice,

339
00:18:00,184 --> 00:18:02,784
they continued on to rehearsing the play.

340
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,984
The story is about Itaro, a detective of the city of Edo,

341
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,684
and Okei, his younger sister, as well as his assistant,

342
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:11,084
who deduce the identity of a great thief called the Edo Kid,

343
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:14,284
who ransacks each and every district of Japan.

344
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:18,084
They suspect one of the members of the troupe as being the Edo Kid.

345
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:19,584
However, after arresting him,

346
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:21,884
they find out that the Edo Kid is a different person.

347
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,784
It turns out that they mistakenly arrest his twin brother

348
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:26,184
who is a member of the troupe.

349
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:30,984
The troupe set off again on a journey to a new place.

350
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:34,884
The title of this story is "Memoirs of Itaro the Detective".

351
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:36,084
So it's strange that the main character Itaro

352
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:39,284
would make a false arrest.

353
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,184
Conan, how did you like it?

354
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,384
-You were fantastic! -Just great!

355
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:48,684
Aren't you lucky, Megumi?

356
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,984
May I go give my friends juice?

357
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:52,284
Yeah! Do that.

358
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:55,184
Wait here, everybody.

359
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,984
Oh, Megumi.

360
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:58,384
We're going to be doing the finishing up soon,

361
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:00,684
so can you go get Chikaishi Sensei?

362
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:02,484
Okay!

363
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:09,984
Sensei...

364
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,684
Are you still asleep?

365
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,384
I'm coming in!

366
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:16,184
Please get up, Sensei!

367
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,084
Megumi!

368
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:27,784
Megumi! What's up?

369
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:32,584
Tamanosuke!

370
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:35,484
Chikaishi Sensei is dead!

371
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:42,984
He was hit on the back of the head.

372
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:45,484
So, this empty vase is the murder weapon.

373
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:50,184
Somebody, please call the police!

374
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:51,784
Okay.

375
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:58,084
Why is he so nervous?

376
00:19:58,084 --> 00:19:59,984
Could it be that he's just very timid?

377
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:01,484
Or, is it because...

378
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:25,484
The floppy is gone?

379
00:20:25,484 --> 00:20:28,484
What's the matter, Tamanosuke? Are you all right?

380
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:31,784
No, it's nothing.

381
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:33,584
Is anything missing?

382
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:35,684
The room looks to have been ransacked.

383
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:38,184
It's nothing.

384
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:39,984
What's with him?

385
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:42,584
Why doesn't he say that the floppy is missing?

386
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:52,284
The victim is the playwrighter for this troupe,

387
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,384
Mr. Tetsuo Chikaishi, 35 years old. Is that right?

388
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:59,084
Yes, that's correct.

389
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,084
Conan!

390
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:03,584
I didn't see you anywhere, so I came to look if you were here,

391
00:21:03,584 --> 00:21:06,084
and bull's eye.

392
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:07,884
I'm sorry.

393
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:10,484
Gosh, you never learn.

394
00:21:10,484 --> 00:21:12,384
Hello, Inspector.

395
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,584
Hello, Mr. Mouri, what do you think?

396
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:17,884
He died approximately an hour ago.

397
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:20,684
There is a possibility that this is an inside job.

398
00:21:20,684 --> 00:21:25,184
Yeah. Where were you all an hour ago?

399
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:28,284
Well...

400
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:30,984
We were all practicing the play.

401
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:34,184
That's right. We were all in the audience

402
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:36,784
so we watched everyone acting.

403
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:37,884
Since it was practice,

404
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:40,684
even those who didn't have a role to play then, were by the sleeve.

405
00:21:40,684 --> 00:21:43,184
The only time anyone was closed off from view

406
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:45,384
was when the outfits were switched and...

407
00:21:45,384 --> 00:21:48,984
Then, when the pit was used there was only one person?

408
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,184
Yeah.

409
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:55,084
He's the only theater staff that came for rehearsal today, too.

410
00:21:55,084 --> 00:21:57,884
Yes, that's right.

411
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,184
A person who can kill Mr. Chikaishi by hitting him,

412
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:03,684
steal the floppy, hide it and return to stage...

413
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:06,184
That's right!

414
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:10,084
Inspector, please look for the floppy disc.

415
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:13,584
The one that Mr. Chikaishi put on the table.

416
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,984
Right, troupe leader?

417
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,784
Why is he hiding the fact?

418
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:21,184
Could he have committed the murder

419
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,684
while somebody else stole the floppy?

420
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:26,984
Or, is he protecting the killer?

421
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:30,884
Either way, the killer is among the people here!

00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,284

424
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:09,784
I'm okay.

425
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:12,584
Itoe!

426
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:15,984
The note was analyzed for its handwriting

427
00:24:15,984 --> 00:24:19,984
and was found to be written by Tamanosuke.

428
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,984
What?

429
00:24:21,984 --> 00:24:25,284
-Tamanosuke is in danger! -What?

430
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:27,184
The killer is another person!
