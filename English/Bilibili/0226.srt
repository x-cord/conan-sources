1
00:00:18,932 --> 00:00:20,732
A strong heart along with deduction and power.

2
00:00:20,732 --> 00:00:22,532
And step into the essence with a strong rhythm.

3
00:00:22,532 --> 00:00:24,232
Today we visit the game center.

4
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,332
We'll be playing a case.

5
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:28,032
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:30,032
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,232
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:02,668
"Battle Game Trap (Part 1)"

9
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:06,168
Oh, no!

10
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,068
This is great!

11
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,768
Now I know why this one's your favourite, Sonoko!

12
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:13,268
Right?

13
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:17,768
And it's far from our school, so nobody knows about it.

14
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:19,368
Look!

15
00:02:19,368 --> 00:02:22,468
There's a wedding version too!

16
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:25,968
I don't believe it. It wasn't here yesterday.

17
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:27,768
Let's have a look.

18
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:30,968
I think this one's so cute!

19
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:33,768
Why don't the three of us get our pictures taken here?

20
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,768
Wait... Just wait a minute!

21
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:41,568
Maybe it would be better to take separate pictures sometimes,

22
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:44,168
you know, for a change of pace.

23
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:45,968
Sonoko.

24
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,268
Confess, Sonoko.

25
00:02:50,268 --> 00:02:52,268
You're going to write a letter to Mr. Kyogoku

26
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:54,268
and stick your picture on it, aren't you?

27
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:57,868
Just a few days ago,

28
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:01,168
Mr. Arade was reading a fan letter from one of the girls

29
00:03:01,168 --> 00:03:04,468
and he asked if sticking your photo onto the letters

30
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:06,168
was the current trend.

31
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,368
Listen, Ran.

32
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,968
I think you're about the only one who isn't doing it.

33
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,168
Really?

34
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:15,468
Well, Mr. Arade has it rough, doesn't he?

35
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:16,568
He thought he could relax

36
00:03:16,568 --> 00:03:18,168
when he was relieved as coach for basketball team

37
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,068
but now he's in charge of the drama club.

38
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:23,268
But I guess that can't be helped

39
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:25,368
since that handsome Shinichi's not around anymore,

40
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:26,768
all the girls are chasing Mr. Arade.

41
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:28,868
That's not completely true.

42
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:33,368
Miss Jody, the new English teacher is pretty popular too!

43
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:36,168
Only among the guys though!

44
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:39,868
She's always wearing such sexy clothes and excreting pheromone,

45
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:43,168
I think she thinks Japanese men are idiots!

46
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:47,468
Look who's talking, you always wear clothes that show your belly button.

47
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:50,568
But she explains everything simply and she is easy to understand!

48
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:52,668
She is just too serious, she has no fun!

49
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:55,068
She is always so quiet and proper.

50
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,068
She always refused us when we asked her for tea after class.

51
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:03,168
She acts like she is a very well-bred daughter of some blue blood family.

52
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,868
It's rare to have an American at school,

53
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:07,968
I expected her to be more outgoing and...

54
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:10,168
Hey! Come on!

55
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:17,768
Now!

56
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,768
Perfect!

57
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:49,868
Miss... Miss Jody.

58
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:53,868
What are you doing in a place like this?

59
00:04:53,868 --> 00:04:56,068
Mouri and Suzuki!

60
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,868
What? A teacher?

61
00:04:57,868 --> 00:05:00,768
Hey! Isn't that Teitan High's uniform?

62
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,768
Which means you're a high school teacher?

63
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:04,268
For goodness sakes!

64
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:06,868
No... you've made a mistake!

65
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,168
What?

66
00:05:09,568 --> 00:05:14,068
What? You've been coming here every day after school?

67
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:16,268
You? Miss Jody?

68
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:21,368
Yes! The games here in Japan are very beautiful and exciting!

69
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:23,168
"Jody Santemillion (28)" -Of course, the games that come to the America

70
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:25,568
"English Teacher" -from Japan are very popular too!

71
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,368
There's always such a long line,

72
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,668
I never get to play!

73
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:33,568
That's why I became an English teacher.

74
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:37,768
That way, I can play the newest games every day!

75
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:40,368
She... she's a gamer.

76
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,268
You... you mean...

77
00:05:42,268 --> 00:05:44,568
Your lessons are so serious is because...

78
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:48,568
Yes! If I make a mistake and get fired, it'd be "The End"!

79
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:54,268
It's very hard for foreigners to get jobs in Japan.

80
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:58,368
That's why you must not tell anyone I was here!

81
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:00,568
Please keep it our secret!

82
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,068
But you sure looked good!

83
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,868
That's right! You reminded me of Billy, the Kid!

84
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:10,568
If you think that was neat, do you want to try another great game?

85
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:13,668
It's the most popular fighting game in town now!

86
00:06:16,268 --> 00:06:18,868
Great Fighter Spirit?

87
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:21,568
I've never heard of this one.

88
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:24,368
Just sit, go on!

89
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:27,168
First, put the headgear on,

90
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:29,768
insert coin and standby!

91
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:33,268
Play character is beginner level.

92
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,568
Are you ready?

93
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:52,268
When the right punch comes in lightly, go! Okay?

94
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:54,068
Okay!

95
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:56,168
Ready go!

96
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01,868
-That hurt! -Ran?

97
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:05,568
That's right, this is a virtual reality fighting game,

98
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:07,868
the player actually feels the damage!

99
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:11,068
Is it too much for a girl to handle?

100
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:13,268
Hey... Ran, it's coming...

101
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,168
Hey...

102
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:39,068
You Win!

103
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:40,468
You did it.

104
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:42,768
She may not look it, but Ran won first place

105
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:44,168
in the State of Karate Championship Tournament!

106
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:47,468
Champion.

107
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,568
I'll kill you!

108
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:52,468
What is this? Someone's entered the game.

109
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:53,968
Why?

110
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:55,568
There's another player.

111
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:59,168
Another player is challenging you.

112
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:00,968
I don't believe it.

113
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:02,568
Be careful.

114
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:04,868
He is terrific.

115
00:08:04,868 --> 00:08:06,868
He is beatable.

116
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:12,768
Fight!

117
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:36,768
You lose!

118
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:39,068
You are defeated.

119
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,068
This is so frustrating.

120
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:46,268
Now that you've lost, why don't you just get out of chair, young lady?

121
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:50,268
"Kengo Bito (21), Unemployed" -That gold seat is reserved for me.

122
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,868
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:56,568
Ran! Stay in that seat and try again,

124
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:57,868
it's payback time!

125
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,568
You're just wasting your time.

126
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:04,568
Besides the punch and kick mode,

127
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:07,168
he can manipulate all four control buttons

128
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:09,968
and create an undefeatable attack.

129
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:12,968
"Hitoshi Dejima (22)" -Today's the first time you've ever tried the game,

130
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,968
"Store Worker" -you don't stand a chance of winning.

131
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,268
Hey!

132
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,568
What's taking you so long!

133
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:27,568
This seat's built just for me.

134
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,168
What a creep. Who is he anyway?

135
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:32,968
He's known as "The Shisa of Beika" and it's gone to his head

136
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,468
but he's just your neighbourhood hoodlum.

137
00:09:34,468 --> 00:09:35,968
What?

138
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:38,368
"Toshitsugu Emori (41)" -He's been getting cockier lately

139
00:09:38,368 --> 00:09:40,768
"Taxi Driver" -and making things hard for the rest of us.

140
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,568
By the way, miss.

141
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:45,168
Your moves are big.

142
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,568
It may be called fighting, but it's only a game,

143
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,168
you don't need strength.

144
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:52,468
See? Watch him!

145
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,868
His movements are small,

146
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:58,268
he doesn't even look like he's fighting, does he?

147
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:01,968
You were watching? You watched us fight?

148
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,468
That's right, on that big monitor.

149
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,268
There's usually a tape playing on it

150
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:12,668
but when there's a challenge is made, the game's shown.

151
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:16,868
I figure the only person who can beat him. Haido City's invincible.

152
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:20,568
"Lutus from Haido".

153
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:24,468
"Takayasu Shimizu (30), Game Magazine Writer" -I'm the only one, right?

154
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,468
I've been waiting for you!

155
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:27,968
Let's continue our fight.

156
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:30,968
Give me a second. Let me smoke a cigarette first.

157
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:43,268
Miss Jody, let's get out of this place.

158
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,268
-Why? -She's right,

159
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:48,568
this isn't the only game arcade.

160
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:53,568
All right, please let me play this racing game one more time!

161
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:56,068
-Good grief! -Goodness!

162
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:00,868
You're good.

163
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,168
Do it!

164
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:05,168
I bet you're going to be the high scorer!

165
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:09,468
She's a true blue gamer.

166
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,868
Fight!

167
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:13,668
Those two have started to fight!

168
00:11:13,668 --> 00:11:16,268
Forget about those two.

169
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:18,768
But it looks...

170
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:23,468
What a barrage.

171
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:29,668
Who's winning?

172
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:32,868
There's no hit point gauge on that thing.

173
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:37,268
I think the more damage you suffer, the bluer your face gets.

174
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:41,068
The guy who beat me is winning so far.

175
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:45,968
Again.

176
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:47,368
It's amazing.

177
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:53,068
Down!

178
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:58,468
That special combination really did the job.

179
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:01,768
That "Lutus from Haido" is not so hot.

180
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:03,768
I don't think he can get up.

181
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:07,868
No, he is going to deliver the finishing touch before he gets up.

182
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:09,768
Hey, what's he doing?

183
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:12,768
He's got to finish him off quick, time's running out.

184
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:15,468
Draw!

185
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:21,068
Gosh, what a dummy.

186
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:24,768
It would've been an easy win if he'd finished him off right then.

187
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:30,568
Hey, something's wrong.

188
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:39,768
He's...

189
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:41,268
He's dead.

190
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:54,576
-Seriously? -He died while playing a game?

191
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:56,276
Are you sure about that?

192
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,776
Yes.

193
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:02,176
We were all watching their game on the monitor.

194
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:04,876
He was on the verge of winning,

195
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:08,176
but he stopped attacking all of a sudden.

196
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:09,876
When we looked...

197
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:13,876
The man working the character had stopped too.

198
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:18,476
The deceased is Kengo Bito, 21 years old,

199
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:20,376
presently unemployed.

200
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:22,476
He is quite rude by nature

201
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:26,276
and his reputation at this arcade isn't good.

202
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:30,176
I see, so he was a man with many enemies.

203
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,876
Mouri, do you know this man?

204
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:37,276
Yes, he's my father's former boss.

205
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:42,076
This is our school's English teacher!

206
00:13:42,076 --> 00:13:43,876
English teacher?

207
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:45,076
Yes!

208
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:48,476
My name is Jody Santemillion!

209
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,976
I'm pleased to meet you!

210
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:54,076
My name is Juzo Megure!

211
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:57,476
I am a Japanese policyman!

212
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:58,576
Policy?

213
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:04,076
Not policyman! Policeman!

214
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,876
Policyman?

215
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:07,476
No...

216
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:09,476
Policeman, okay?

217
00:14:09,476 --> 00:14:11,876
Policeman?

218
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:14,576
Inspector.

219
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:18,376
Yes, the question is why he died during the game.

220
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,376
Yes.

221
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,676
We questioned the other customers,

222
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:27,276
no one noticed anyone suspicious wandering around.

223
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:32,476
And it doesn't appear Mr. Bito drank or ate anything while he was playing

224
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:36,076
so that rules out suicide.

225
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:39,076
What's with this get-up anyway?

226
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:42,876
It looks like something from a Science Fiction movie.

227
00:14:42,876 --> 00:14:46,276
It's a virtual reality game.

228
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:50,876
The damage inflicted by your opponent shows on screen

229
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:53,876
and at the same time, the player feels it too.

230
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:56,276
The player feels the damage?

231
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:58,576
Yes, on top of that,

232
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:02,476
if your opponent hits or kicks you from over the guards,

233
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:07,176
the feels a slight sensation in the arm or leg

234
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:10,276
so it seems like you're actually in a fight.

235
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,176
Hey, you don't mean...

236
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:18,476
the cause of his death is because the damage was too much.

237
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:19,476
No.

238
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:22,876
That would never happen.

239
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:26,876
All you feel is a light vibration.

240
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:30,276
You know, like the vibration mode on those cellular phones.

241
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,476
You can't kill someone with only that much, can you?

242
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:34,876
And who are you?

243
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:37,876
I'm the guy that fellow was playing against

244
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:39,876
just before he died.

245
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:43,876
I thought I'd better come over before you make me out to be the murderer.

246
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,476
Besides, I don't like to admit this

247
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:48,476
but I'm the one who was taking the beating.

248
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:52,776
I only got a couple of punches in.

249
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,676
And I was even chewing gum to help my rhythm,

250
00:15:57,676 --> 00:15:59,476
but it didn't help.

251
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:01,376
Is that true?

252
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,076
Yes.

253
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:06,776
It did seem like he was taking the brunt of beating.

254
00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:11,176
Then what could have killed him?

255
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,876
Yes, and there doesn't seem to any wound.

256
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,176
Maybe it was poison.

257
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,476
What?

258
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,576
See? This man looks like he died of suffocation

259
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:23,876
but it doesn't look like he was strangled!

260
00:16:23,876 --> 00:16:26,176
It would have to be poison, wouldn't it?

261
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:32,176
But Conan, this man died while he was playing a game.

262
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:35,776
And there's no indication he ate or drank anything,

263
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,776
if he had been poisoned before the game,

264
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,576
he would have looked sick

265
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:44,376
or at least felt sick, isn't that right?

266
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:47,376
Did you notice anything like that?

267
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:49,576
No, I didn't notice anything.

268
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,276
Just before that game,

269
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,176
he was very actively giving Ran a good beating.

270
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:58,476
But if you put the poison in a syringe and injected...

271
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,176
If someone tried to do that,

272
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:03,776
he would have gotten angry and yelled.

273
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:07,576
And the other customers would have heard that.

274
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:09,076
Really?

275
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,876
Yes...

276
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:14,876
But Inspector, have you forgotten?

277
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:16,976
This is a game arcade, isn't it?

278
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:20,176
All the machines are off now and everything's quiet,

279
00:17:20,176 --> 00:17:21,976
but usually, the place is filled with all kinds of sounds,

280
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:24,476
it's so noisy, you can't even hear yourself talk!

281
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:28,676
And this man's arms and legs are attached to the machine,

282
00:17:28,676 --> 00:17:31,476
I don't think he could have moved very well.

283
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:34,276
And these arcades are kept kind of dark

284
00:17:34,276 --> 00:17:36,776
so that the screens are easier to see.

285
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:41,676
I see, the victim was practically unprotected

286
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:43,476
and even if he yelled,

287
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:46,476
all the noise would have drowned out his voice.

288
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:48,276
And in the dark room,

289
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:52,076
with most of the other customers watching the monitor,

290
00:17:52,076 --> 00:17:55,276
is would be possible to poison him.

291
00:17:55,276 --> 00:17:58,976
All right, let's have the body taken to the coroner's for an autopsy!

292
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:01,476
Our first objective is to determine the cause of death!

293
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:02,576
Yes, sir...

294
00:18:08,576 --> 00:18:11,376
Now to narrow down the list of suspects.

295
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:14,576
It's going to be quite a job,

296
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:17,676
finding the killer among the nearly 30 people who were here.

297
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:21,576
I know who went close to the man who died!

298
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:25,776
-What? -Just until before he died,

299
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:30,876
we were watching Miss Jody playing that racing game there!

300
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,876
Right?

301
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:37,076
And then? Who went close to him?

302
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:40,076
That man who works here

303
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:42,676
and that tall man!

304
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:46,576
And including the four of us, that makes six.

305
00:18:46,576 --> 00:18:49,576
Isn't that right, Miss Jody?

306
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:50,576
Yes!

307
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:54,276
But this little boy isn't the only one who was watching everything!

308
00:18:54,276 --> 00:18:56,676
What...

309
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,676
He's the other one.

310
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,576
A security camera!

311
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:09,576
By chance, would everything be on that camera?

312
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:10,876
Sure.

313
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:16,276
Then can we view it right away along with the six others?

314
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:18,276
Of course.

315
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:20,876
This way. Follow me.

316
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:23,276
Will you all please come along?

317
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,076
What's that?

318
00:19:29,076 --> 00:19:31,776
What's making this sound?

319
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:34,776
It sounds like something metal is hitting something.

320
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,276
Like it's rubbing something.

321
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:41,176
What is it?

322
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:45,076
Here it is! Around here.

323
00:19:45,076 --> 00:19:49,376
The victim took his seat about.

324
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:53,076
See? There we are getting chased out of our seats.

325
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,576
Isn't that you, Mr. Dejima?

326
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,476
What were you doing?

327
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:02,876
I was collecting the money in the machines.

328
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,576
Now it's Mr. Shimizu.

329
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:09,576
You seem to be having a conversation.

330
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,976
What were you talking about?

331
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,576
I was trying to get him to tell me his strategy before the game,

332
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:18,476
but it was no use.

333
00:20:18,476 --> 00:20:21,576
What's this? What did you crouch and pick up?

334
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:25,376
I dropped my lighter and was just picking it up.

335
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,776
And then the game started.

336
00:20:27,776 --> 00:20:29,676
Inspector!

337
00:20:29,676 --> 00:20:31,176
Mr. Dejima is...

338
00:20:31,176 --> 00:20:33,276
He's holding something in his hand?

339
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,276
A video recorder?

340
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,476
Yes, it was such a great game, I thought I'd tape it.

341
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:42,676
Hey, do I know you from someplace?

342
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,576
No, you're probably mistaken.

343
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:48,376
You're right, it really is something.

344
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:51,576
The blows keep coming.

345
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:56,276
Ran, you and your friends left the racing game partway through.

346
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:58,876
Yes, the fight was so exciting,

347
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,276
we started to watch that.

348
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:07,276
That means Miss Jody and the victim were left alone.

349
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:10,776
But I was very busy playing the game,

350
00:21:10,776 --> 00:21:13,576
I didn't even notice everybody left!

351
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:17,576
But still, you need someone to verified your story.

352
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,876
It's true, Miss Jody never left her game!

353
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:24,876
When we ran up to the body, she had just reached the goal

354
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:27,776
and her score was the highest scored ever!

355
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:30,176
Then she's in the clear.

356
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:31,776
No one can score the highest score unless they concentrate

357
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,576
and keep their hands on the wheel,

358
00:21:33,576 --> 00:21:37,976
that racing game's not easy.

359
00:21:37,976 --> 00:21:41,576
Then who killed him?

360
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:44,576
Hey!

361
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,576
This man who just came out from behind the victim.

362
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:51,576
Who in the world is that guy?

363
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,776
Isn't that the man who was playing mahjong?

364
00:21:54,776 --> 00:21:58,576
That's the man who was bad mouthing the man who died!

365
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:01,576
What? Bring this man here right now!

366
00:22:01,576 --> 00:22:02,776
Yes, sir!

367
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:07,076
Judging from the condition of the body,

368
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,676
I'm positive he was poisoned.

369
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:14,476
Which means, that person is the most suspicious

370
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:17,476
and the evidence is probably in there.

371
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:20,676
All that leaves are the needle or hypodermic syringe,

372
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:24,276
nothing like that was on the floor.

373
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:28,376
I doubt the killer would still be holding on to it.

374
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:32,476
The killer...

375
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,776
Where did the killer hide the weapon?

376
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:06,176
"Next Episode" -The poison was injected

377
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:08,276
under Bito's arm, right?

378
00:24:08,276 --> 00:24:10,576
I don't think he'd let me stick him.

379
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,176
That was a great story

380
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:16,076
but it's a trap, little lady.

381
00:24:16,076 --> 00:24:17,676
That woman playing the racing game

382
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:21,076
next to Bito was the only one, wasn't she?

383
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,476
Inspector, haven't you noticed?

384
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:27,276
That strange sound he makes when he walks.

385
00:24:28,476 --> 00:24:29,976
Next Conan,

386
00:24:29,976 --> 00:24:33,597
"Battle Game Trap (Part 2)"

387
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:36,594
Next Conan's hint:

388
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:38,694
"Shoe"

389
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:39,894
In next week's episode, the crime is solved!

390
00:24:39,894 --> 00:24:40,894
Does that mean...

391
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:43,394
Could it be I'm a brilliant detective?
