1
00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.515
The haunted storeroom where anything you put inside it

2
00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:07.115
disappears in no time at all.

3
00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:10.115
We, the detective squad, revealed the secret and found the thief

4
00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:12.515
who was hiding in the hidden room.

5
00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:13.815
I couldn't help wondering why the deductions of Mitsuhiko and the others

6
00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:15.715
were right to the point.

7
00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.615
But it turned out that they were getting hints from Heiji Hattori

8
00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:21.615
who just happened to stop by at the detective agency.

9
00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:25.315
What on earth brought him here?

10
00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:29.115
Flowers dance to the rhythm of the piano.

11
00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:31.315
The two who confront each other is a mystery.

12
00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:33.315
Kazuha's lucky charm that she put her hidden feelings into

13
00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:35.415
and that she is keeping a secret from Heiji has disappeared?

14
00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:37.215
He sees through the one and only truth.

15
00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:39.115
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

16
00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:41.115
His name is Detective Conan!

17
00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:30.278
"The Whereabouts of the Embarrassing Lucky Charm (Part 1)".

18
00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:34.878
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Huh? You're searching for somebody?

19
00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:38.578
You mean you came all the way to Tokyo just to look for somebody?

20
00:02:38.578 --> 00:02:39.978
Right!

21
00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:41.878
The person I'm looking for

22
00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:46.678
is a junior at Teitan University, called Teruaki Kunimatsu.

23
00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:47.878
It seems that his parents' house

24
00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:50.978
is next door to Kazuha's house, so...

25
00:02:50.978 --> 00:02:54.478
-Really? -Yep.

26
00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:56.678
Why are you looking for him?

27
00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:59.878
You see, he plays tennis.

28
00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:04.578
But when Mr. Kunimatsu came back to Osaka last holiday...

29
00:03:05.478 --> 00:03:06.978
Huh? A lucky charm?

30
00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:07.978
Yeah!

31
00:03:07.978 --> 00:03:11.578
Will you make one for me so that I can win the next tennis tournament?

32
00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:14.878
Why don't you ask your mother to make it for you?

33
00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:17.178
"Teruaki Kunimatsu (20)" -I want yours, Kazuha.

34
00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:18.578
"Teitan University second-year student" -Your lucky charms

35
00:03:18.578 --> 00:03:20.978
are rumored to be very effective.

36
00:03:20.978 --> 00:03:23.778
I really don't want to lose the tournament that's coming up!

37
00:03:23.778 --> 00:03:26.978
So, please! I beg you!

38
00:03:29.178 --> 00:03:34.278
And? You missed giving the lucky charm to that guy?

39
00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:37.878
No, I did get to give it to him,

40
00:03:37.878 --> 00:03:39.478
but there was a mistake.

41
00:03:40.478 --> 00:03:41.878
You see, this idiot!

42
00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:43.178
Watch your mouth!

43
00:03:43.178 --> 00:03:45.078
A mistake?

44
00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:48.278
Yeah, the thing is...

45
00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:52.578
The guy was in front of the Akido practice hall that Kazuha goes to,

46
00:03:52.578 --> 00:03:54.978
and staring through the window of the hall.

47
00:03:54.978 --> 00:03:56.778
I thought he was a lewd guy waiting to attack girls,

48
00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:57.978
I was going to get him.

49
00:03:59.878 --> 00:04:01.678
You asked Kazuha to make you a lucky charm?

50
00:04:01.678 --> 00:04:05.578
Yeah, she promised to give it to me today, but...

51
00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.378
I don't think she can give it to you yet, for sometime.

52
00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:11.578
Kazuha's got an Akido level up test coming up,

53
00:04:11.578 --> 00:04:14.678
so she said she'd be staying till late for practice today.

54
00:04:14.678 --> 00:04:17.078
That's why her mother asked me to bring this thermos to her,

55
00:04:17.078 --> 00:04:19.278
so here I am.

56
00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:21.878
Sometime ago, that dork over practiced

57
00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:25.978
and collapsed from dehydration, you see.

58
00:04:25.978 --> 00:04:28.278
But, that puts me in a fix.

59
00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:32.378
It's about time I have to board the bullet train back.

60
00:04:32.378 --> 00:04:35.178
I'll go get it for you, then.

61
00:04:35.178 --> 00:04:36.678
If she meant to give it to you,

62
00:04:36.678 --> 00:04:39.278
I'm sure it's in her bag.

63
00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:40.678
"Dressing room"

64
00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:42.578
Here it is!

65
00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:43.778
This must be it!

66
00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:47.078
"Lucky charm" -Don't tell me...

67
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.178
that the lucky charm was the one that you really cherished?

68
00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:52.578
Right! It's the lucky charm that I also made for Heiji

69
00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:55.878
with the piece of chain from a handcuff inside it!

70
00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.778
And this idiot mistakenly gave that lucky charm away!

71
00:04:58.778 --> 00:04:59.978
I couldn't help, could I?

72
00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:01.978
I didn't know anything about the lucky charm, you know.

73
00:05:01.978 --> 00:05:03.678
You don't have to know a thing about it!

74
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:04.778
Who on earth would attach a lucky charm

75
00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:07.278
meant to be given away to the handle of the school bag?

76
00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:09.278
What the fuss!

77
00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:11.578
You made that lucky charm too, didn't you?

78
00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:12.978
It probably doesn't bring that much good lucky anyway.

79
00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:14.778
Just what're you talking about?

80
00:05:14.778 --> 00:05:16.178
I always had it on me,

81
00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:17.778
so nothing bad happened to me,

82
00:05:17.778 --> 00:05:20.378
but when you lent that lucky charm to Conan,

83
00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:22.878
you were shot and went through hell, didn't you?

84
00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:25.678
Well, thanks to that lucky charm,

85
00:05:25.678 --> 00:05:29.078
I was saved despite being stabbed with a knife.

86
00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.878
Even the time you fell into the ocean!

87
00:05:30.878 --> 00:05:34.378
Wasn't it thanks to the power of the lucky charm that you were saved?

88
00:05:34.378 --> 00:05:35.678
That lucky charm could've been responsible

89
00:05:35.678 --> 00:05:37.978
for my falling into the ocean to begin with.

90
00:05:37.978 --> 00:05:38.978
At any rate,

91
00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:41.178
if something happens to me because I lost that lucky charm...

92
00:05:41.178 --> 00:05:43.778
Heiji! I'm going to curse you for life!

93
00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:46.278
That's why I told you that I'd come to look for that guy alone

94
00:05:46.278 --> 00:05:48.578
and get the lucky charm back,

95
00:05:48.578 --> 00:05:51.178
so I don't see why you had to come along.

96
00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:56.678
Well, so you see, that's because... Well...

97
00:05:56.678 --> 00:06:00.478
Okay, okay. We'll all go to look for him tomorrow.

98
00:06:00.478 --> 00:06:02.978
But why do you have to look for him?

99
00:06:02.978 --> 00:06:06.278
You already know where his university is and where he lives, don't you?

100
00:06:06.278 --> 00:06:07.878
Well, the thing is,

101
00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:11.978
we haven't been able to get in touch with him since a few days ago.

102
00:06:11.978 --> 00:06:14.378
He's absent from class at the university, too.

103
00:06:14.378 --> 00:06:17.678
And it seems that he hasn't come back to his apartment for a while too.

104
00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:21.978
In other words, his whereabouts are unknown.

105
00:06:21.978 --> 00:06:24.978
I hope he hasn't gotten involved in some strange incident or something.

106
00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:29.578
Well, you guys go over to his university tomorrow then.

107
00:06:33.578 --> 00:06:35.878
"Teitan University"

108
00:06:38.478 --> 00:06:41.578
"Tennis Club" -Kunimatsu?

109
00:06:41.578 --> 00:06:45.078
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him around lately.

110
00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:47.578
And haven't you heard of why he hasn't been around lately?

111
00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:49.478
He was hurt.

112
00:06:49.478 --> 00:06:51.978
He broke his right hand during practice

113
00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:54.278
before the tournament.

114
00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:56.578
Broke a bone?

115
00:06:56.578 --> 00:06:59.078
Maybe he tried too hard and got hurt?

116
00:06:59.078 --> 00:07:00.678
Just the opposite!

117
00:07:00.678 --> 00:07:02.278
He was acting absentminded

118
00:07:02.278 --> 00:07:03.678
and didn't seem to be concentrating much.

119
00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:07.178
He was so out to get before the holidays and yet...

120
00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:09.678
Which means that Mr. Kunimatsu's been hospitalized?

121
00:07:09.678 --> 00:07:12.678
No, his wound wasn't that bad.

122
00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:13.778
But he couldn't manage to take care of things at home,

123
00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:17.778
so he said that he'd be staying over at the place of a friend.

124
00:07:18.878 --> 00:07:22.878
Yeah, I'm letting Kunimatsu stay over at my place.

125
00:07:22.878 --> 00:07:25.178
I was telling him to get out of here as soon as he could,

126
00:07:25.178 --> 00:07:27.278
though because the room is too small to accommodate both of us.

127
00:07:27.278 --> 00:07:30.478
Then, is Mr. Kunimatsu inside?

128
00:07:30.478 --> 00:07:31.478
No.

129
00:07:31.478 --> 00:07:34.478
I told him that it's no use staying confined to the room all afternoon,

130
00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:37.178
so to go someplace.

131
00:07:37.178 --> 00:07:38.878
Then, he went out.

132
00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:40.978
-Where to? -Beats me.

133
00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:43.778
He used to like sports,

134
00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:46.078
so maybe he's watching a match somewhere?

135
00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:48.478
He seemed really excited when he called a while ago too.

136
00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:49.978
-What? -He called?

137
00:07:49.978 --> 00:07:52.878
This is just great! Luck has come my way at last!

138
00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:55.678
I'll show you proof from now.

139
00:07:55.678 --> 00:07:59.378
He told me to come to a sports cafe in Shibuya.

140
00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:01.178
If you came to see him,

141
00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:02.778
would you like to come along with me?

142
00:08:02.778 --> 00:08:04.278
You don't mind?

143
00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:05.978
Please take us with you!

144
00:08:05.978 --> 00:08:08.678
And didn't that Mr. Kunimatsu

145
00:08:08.678 --> 00:08:11.278
mention anything about a lucky charm?

146
00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:15.378
Yeah, he said he had a girl who lives in his hometown make it for him

147
00:08:15.378 --> 00:08:17.678
and he's been keeping it in his wallet ever since.

148
00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:18.778
Really?

149
00:08:18.778 --> 00:08:21.278
Then, you can get it back from him right away.

150
00:08:21.278 --> 00:08:23.778
I'll go get ready then, so can you wait a while?

151
00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:25.278
-Okay. -Okay.

152
00:08:27.078 --> 00:08:29.078
Talk about a fast solution.

153
00:08:29.078 --> 00:08:32.578
It's a bit too bad that we found him so soon.

154
00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:33.678
Huh?

155
00:08:33.678 --> 00:08:36.978
You came along because you wanted to stay with Heiji, right?

156
00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:37.978
No, no!

157
00:08:37.978 --> 00:08:40.178
Huh? That's not it?

158
00:08:40.178 --> 00:08:45.178
Well, I guess there was a little bit of that too, but...

159
00:08:45.178 --> 00:08:47.278
The real reason is that

160
00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:49.078
inside the lucky charm...

161
00:08:50.178 --> 00:08:52.278
What?

162
00:08:52.278 --> 00:08:54.078
You had a picture inside it?

163
00:08:56.078 --> 00:08:58.678
What about a picture?

164
00:08:58.678 --> 00:09:00.278
I was just saying that this picture of Mr. Kunimatsu

165
00:09:00.278 --> 00:09:03.078
looks quite handsome.

166
00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:07.478
If I let him go alone and get the lucky charm back,

167
00:09:07.478 --> 00:09:09.478
he'd confirm it by looking inside, wouldn't he?

168
00:09:09.478 --> 00:09:12.178
To be sure that it was really mine.

169
00:09:12.178 --> 00:09:14.478
Then, he'll find out

170
00:09:14.478 --> 00:09:18.478
that I secretly have a picture of him inside the lucky charm.

171
00:09:18.478 --> 00:09:21.378
I came along to prevent that from happening.

172
00:09:21.378 --> 00:09:22.778
If I check inside it myself,

173
00:09:22.778 --> 00:09:24.678
Heiji wouldn't have to see it.

174
00:09:24.678 --> 00:09:28.978
Okay! If Mr. Kunimatsu tries to give the lucky charm to Heiji,

175
00:09:28.978 --> 00:09:30.878
I'll try to somehow get in the way.

176
00:09:30.878 --> 00:09:31.978
Thank you!

177
00:09:31.978 --> 00:09:33.378
But...

178
00:09:33.378 --> 00:09:36.078
I might get flustered and give it to Heiji.

179
00:09:36.078 --> 00:09:37.478
What?

180
00:09:37.478 --> 00:09:38.578
Just joking.

181
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:41.278
Come on, stop being like that, Ran!

182
00:09:41.278 --> 00:09:43.478
What's she getting all carried away about?

183
00:09:43.478 --> 00:09:46.878
Maybe she's just happy that she's getting her cherished lucky charm back?

184
00:09:50.078 --> 00:09:52.278
I can't figure out what's so good

185
00:09:52.278 --> 00:09:54.878
about a lucky charm like this.

186
00:09:54.878 --> 00:09:57.278
Talking of lucky charms...

187
00:09:57.278 --> 00:10:02.278
Did Shinichi ever touch Heiji's lucky charm?

188
00:10:02.278 --> 00:10:04.978
Remember, during the incident that involved the messenger of Death,

189
00:10:04.978 --> 00:10:07.978
Heiji said that he checked Shinichi's fingerprints

190
00:10:07.978 --> 00:10:10.978
that were on the piece of chain that was inside the lucky charm,

191
00:10:10.978 --> 00:10:15.178
against the fingerprints of the culprit,

192
00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:18.178
who pretended to be him.

193
00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:22.578
But the one who touched the piece of chain that was inside

194
00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:24.378
was Conan, wasn't it?

195
00:10:24.378 --> 00:10:27.678
I'm sure he lent it to Kudo along the way, don't you?

196
00:10:27.678 --> 00:10:29.578
It would be strange otherwise, wouldn't it?

197
00:10:31.278 --> 00:10:32.778
True.

198
00:10:35.678 --> 00:10:38.478
I'm sure it was a little bit up ahead.

199
00:10:40.778 --> 00:10:42.178
There it is, over there.

200
00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:43.778
That sports cafe.

201
00:10:43.778 --> 00:10:46.578
What's up? Police cars are parked there.

202
00:10:46.578 --> 00:10:47.878
Make sure no one intrudes on the scene.

203
00:10:47.878 --> 00:10:49.878
Officer Takagi!

204
00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:51.378
Conan!

205
00:10:51.378 --> 00:10:53.478
Heiji too.

206
00:10:53.478 --> 00:10:54.778
Is something wrong?

207
00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:56.578
It's a case of assault and battery.

208
00:10:56.578 --> 00:10:57.778
A man wearing a cast on his arm

209
00:10:57.778 --> 00:10:59.578
was found beaten in the toilet compartment.

210
00:10:59.578 --> 00:11:02.278
A man wearing a cast on his arm?

211
00:11:02.278 --> 00:11:03.878
Don't tell me it's him.

212
00:11:04.578 --> 00:11:08.178
Right, right. He looks like this.

213
00:11:08.178 --> 00:11:09.378
Why?

214
00:11:09.378 --> 00:11:11.978
If so, we're not outsiders.

215
00:11:11.978 --> 00:11:13.878
Let me go check the site.

216
00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:22.878
So, Mr. Kunimatsu was seated on the toilet seat?

217
00:11:22.878 --> 00:11:24.378
Yeah.

218
00:11:24.378 --> 00:11:27.778
It seems that he was bleeding from the head and slack.

219
00:11:28.778 --> 00:11:32.378
And, is Mr. Kunimatsu alright?

220
00:11:32.378 --> 00:11:34.078
He was taken to the hospital

221
00:11:34.078 --> 00:11:35.578
and is unconscious in critical condition.

222
00:11:35.578 --> 00:11:36.778
Oh, no.

223
00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:39.078
Why Mr. Kunimatsu...

224
00:11:39.078 --> 00:11:42.778
We don't know who and why he was beaten

225
00:11:42.778 --> 00:11:47.178
but the time he was beaten was between 19:55 to 20:05,

226
00:11:47.178 --> 00:11:48.978
during a period of 10 minutes.

227
00:11:48.978 --> 00:11:50.578
Talk about precise.

228
00:11:50.578 --> 00:11:53.478
Since today just happened to be the first anniversary of the shop,

229
00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:56.178
party crackers were handed out to all the customers who came

230
00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:57.378
and at 20:00 sharp,

231
00:11:57.378 --> 00:11:59.778
they seemed to have held a simple celebration party.

232
00:11:59.778 --> 00:12:03.678
The employee began passing out the crackers five minutes before 20:00.

233
00:12:03.678 --> 00:12:05.578
A party cracker was given to the victim who was drinking at the counter

234
00:12:05.578 --> 00:12:08.578
and then was told about the 1st anniversary of the shop.

235
00:12:08.578 --> 00:12:11.278
It seems he stood up to go to the men's room,

236
00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:12.978
leaving the party cracker as is on the counter.

237
00:12:13.778 --> 00:12:16.078
And, since even after letting off the party crackers,

238
00:12:16.078 --> 00:12:18.078
he didn't come back from the men's room,

239
00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:20.078
they went to check on him,

240
00:12:20.078 --> 00:12:22.378
found a blood-smeared Mr. Kunimatsu

241
00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:24.278
and called the police?

242
00:12:25.278 --> 00:12:27.778
Yeah, it seems that the employee heard strange sounds

243
00:12:27.778 --> 00:12:30.678
and groaning mixed with the sound of the crackers

244
00:12:30.678 --> 00:12:32.878
coming from the men's room too.

245
00:12:32.878 --> 00:12:34.978
Then, why didn't the employee who heard it

246
00:12:34.978 --> 00:12:37.078
go to the men's room right away?

247
00:12:37.078 --> 00:12:41.078
It seems he was busy retrieving the used crackers.

248
00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:45.378
Then, were there any customers who left the shop during the ten minutes?

249
00:12:45.378 --> 00:12:47.578
No.

250
00:12:47.578 --> 00:12:48.578
Because it seems that

251
00:12:48.578 --> 00:12:50.378
the cash register wasn't working well since before 20:00,

252
00:12:50.378 --> 00:12:53.078
so the customers seem to have been stuck.

253
00:12:54.378 --> 00:12:59.078
Which means that the culprit is still inside?

254
00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:03.278
Yeah, that's why we're going to talk to each and every person here and...

255
00:13:03.278 --> 00:13:05.478
There's no need to do so!

256
00:13:05.478 --> 00:13:10.478
Maybe we'll be able to figure out who the culprit is right away.

257
00:13:10.478 --> 00:13:11.978
How?

258
00:13:11.978 --> 00:13:13.978
First...

259
00:13:13.978 --> 00:13:16.178
Make the customers...

260
00:13:18.778 --> 00:13:20.478
This is Officer Takagi from the Metropolitan Police Department.

261
00:13:20.478 --> 00:13:22.278
You already know that just a while ago,

262
00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:26.378
a case of assault and battery occurred here, don't you?

263
00:13:26.378 --> 00:13:27.678
Before I start an investigation,

264
00:13:27.678 --> 00:13:29.378
I would like to ask you a simple question,

265
00:13:29.378 --> 00:13:32.278
so please close your eyes and listen well.

266
00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:34.278
It seems that a small party was held

267
00:13:34.278 --> 00:13:37.378
at this shop tonight at around 20:00.

268
00:13:37.378 --> 00:13:39.678
Please bring me some evidence showing that such a party was held.

269
00:13:39.678 --> 00:13:41.278
After I count to three,

270
00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:44.778
please bring the evidence quickly and show it to me.

271
00:13:44.778 --> 00:13:46.378
Are you ready?

272
00:13:46.378 --> 00:13:49.678
One, two, three.

273
00:13:51.678 --> 00:13:53.578
What the...

274
00:13:53.578 --> 00:13:57.178
I see, three people.

275
00:13:57.178 --> 00:13:59.878
Well, we sort of narrowed the suspect down, I guess?

276
00:14:12.067 --> 00:14:16.667
Then, I will ask all three of you some questions standing up,

277
00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:18.367
so please come this way.

278
00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:19.967
Questions?

279
00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:22.367
Why just the three of us?

280
00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:24.767
Please explain, will you?

281
00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:29.067
Mr. Kunimatsu went to the men's room at five minutes before 8:00.

282
00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:31.567
After that, the employee here hears a strange sound

283
00:14:31.567 --> 00:14:34.667
and groaning comes from the men's room.

284
00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:37.667
Ten minutes later when he goes to check the men's room,

285
00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:41.367
it seems he found Mr. Kunimatsu bleeding from the head.

286
00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:45.767
Therefore, the crime happened at 20:00 sharp.

287
00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:48.367
And so, what does that have to do with us?

288
00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:50.967
Officer Takagi mentioned just a while ago, didn't he?

289
00:14:50.967 --> 00:14:54.767
That a simple party was held at this shop at 20:00 sharp,

290
00:14:54.767 --> 00:14:57.167
and to show him evidence of it.

291
00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:58.567
To show him the piece of evidence

292
00:14:58.567 --> 00:15:01.567
that everyone celebrated the first anniversary of this shop.

293
00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:03.867
First anniversary?

294
00:15:03.867 --> 00:15:05.967
The party crackers went off, right?

295
00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:07.967
Because the employee was handing them out.

296
00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:11.067
That's why I tried to show him the cracker that I got,

297
00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:12.767
but it wasn't on the counter.

298
00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:15.167
Of course you couldn't find it there.

299
00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:19.767
Because the employee retrieved it right after the crackers were set off.

300
00:15:19.767 --> 00:15:21.867
If you're a customer that set off the cracker,

301
00:15:21.867 --> 00:15:24.767
you would know that the crackers were retrieved, wouldn't you?

302
00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:27.767
That's why you tried to show the tape or pieces of paper

303
00:15:27.767 --> 00:15:31.467
that were scattered over the floor, right?

304
00:15:31.467 --> 00:15:32.867
Yeah.

305
00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.967
The three of you who are standing here

306
00:15:35.967 --> 00:15:39.967
didn't set off the crackers at 20:00 sharp with everyone else,

307
00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:42.067
but for some unknown reason, are here,

308
00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:44.567
making you suspicious customers.

309
00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:48.567
These three are the suspects.

310
00:15:48.567 --> 00:15:51.367
All the customers are free to go

311
00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:53.567
after getting their names and addresses.

312
00:15:53.567 --> 00:15:54.667
Yeah.

313
00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:58.667
Then, get the names and addresses of the people who are bent over.

314
00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.967
Yes, sir!

315
00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:01.367
As for the three of you,

316
00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:04.067
please wait at the table as you are.

317
00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:08.467
By the way, was the weapon that Mr. Kunimatsu was hit with, found?

318
00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:09.767
Yeah.

319
00:16:09.767 --> 00:16:13.167
It's the mop that was found in the tool closet in the men's room.

320
00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:15.467
So, I think that it wasn't a planned act,

321
00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:19.267
but rather, an impulsive one.

322
00:16:19.267 --> 00:16:21.567
May I ask a question?

323
00:16:21.567 --> 00:16:24.667
Didn't Mr. Kunimatsu have a lucky charm on him?

324
00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:27.667
I'm sure he had it in his wallet.

325
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:30.567
Yeah. There was one, a lucky charm.

326
00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:31.567
Really?

327
00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:33.767
That's Kazuha's lucky charm,

328
00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:35.867
so could you give it back to her?

329
00:16:35.867 --> 00:16:38.267
No. Since it's evidence,

330
00:16:38.267 --> 00:16:41.267
we'll have to check it thoroughly first.

331
00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:42.467
If they check it,

332
00:16:42.467 --> 00:16:45.167
they'll find the Heiji's picture inside.

333
00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:47.267
No! Don't check it!

334
00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:49.767
Hey! Enough already!

335
00:16:49.767 --> 00:16:51.567
Mr. Kunimatsu is in the hospital right now

336
00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:55.067
after being beaten and is in a life or death situation.

337
00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:57.967
Who cares about the lucky charm at a time like this?

338
00:16:57.967 --> 00:17:01.467
I guess so.

339
00:17:01.467 --> 00:17:05.567
Talking of lucky charms... There's something strange.

340
00:17:05.567 --> 00:17:08.467
The wallet that the lucky charm was inside

341
00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:12.667
was found in the right back pocket of the jeans the victim was wearing

342
00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:16.367
but his cell phone and cigarettes were also inside the same pocket

343
00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:19.567
that was bloated to the fullest.

344
00:17:19.567 --> 00:17:20.967
I was wondering

345
00:17:20.967 --> 00:17:24.467
if anyone would put so many things like that in one pocket.

346
00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:26.967
Maybe it's because his left hand was in a cast?

347
00:17:26.967 --> 00:17:29.467
Since Mr. Kunimatsu broke the wrist of his left hand,

348
00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:32.567
he could probably only use his right hand.

349
00:17:32.567 --> 00:17:37.567
I see. That's why he could use only the pocket to the right.

350
00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:42.167
But the right pocket of his top was empty.

351
00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:44.967
Are you sure about Mr. Kunimatsu having gone

352
00:17:44.967 --> 00:17:47.667
to watch a tournament this afternoon?

353
00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:50.967
Yeah, because the night before, while going through the internet,

354
00:17:50.967 --> 00:17:54.467
remarked, "I've decided on this tournament".

355
00:17:54.467 --> 00:17:57.467
Then,

356
00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:58.967
we may find out whether it's was so or not

357
00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:01.167
if we ask those three.

358
00:18:02.367 --> 00:18:04.767
If it wasn't a planned crime,

359
00:18:04.767 --> 00:18:06.167
the culprit would've had to most likely

360
00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:08.867
start holding a grudge against Mr. Kunimatsu today.

361
00:18:08.867 --> 00:18:11.167
It's most likely that something happened

362
00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:14.367
at the tournament that Mr. Kunimatsu was watching.

363
00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:17.967
Besides, after watching the tournament,

364
00:18:17.967 --> 00:18:21.367
an excited Mr. Kunimatsu called you, didn't he?

365
00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:22.767
Yeah.

366
00:18:22.767 --> 00:18:25.467
He said, "This is just great! Luck has come my way at last!

367
00:18:25.467 --> 00:18:28.067
I'll show you proof from now.".

368
00:18:28.067 --> 00:18:30.867
So, you were waiting for him at this sports cafe.

369
00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:34.467
Yes, Kunimatsu told me to come here at around 20:00.

370
00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:35.767
In other words,

371
00:18:35.767 --> 00:18:39.567
the one who beat Mr. Kunimatsu up, likewise,

372
00:18:39.567 --> 00:18:44.167
probably watched a very interesting tournament.

373
00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:47.467
So, please give me your name

374
00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:51.867
and why you weren't at your seat at around 20:00.

375
00:18:51.867 --> 00:18:56.267
Then, let's start with you with the glasses on.

376
00:18:57.267 --> 00:19:00.267
Yes. My name is Kazuo Satsuma.

377
00:19:00.267 --> 00:19:04.067
"Kazuo Satsuma (51)" -I got to this shop a little after 20:00,

378
00:19:04.067 --> 00:19:07.667
and didn't know they were celebrating its first anniversary.

379
00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:11.467
-Really? -I'm not lying.

380
00:19:11.467 --> 00:19:12.567
When I came into the shop,

381
00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:15.267
the customers were clapping and excitedly making noise

382
00:19:15.267 --> 00:19:18.067
that I figured something must be going on.

383
00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:20.467
Since you came here,

384
00:19:20.467 --> 00:19:21.967
I guess you like sports?

385
00:19:21.967 --> 00:19:23.367
Yeah.

386
00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:25.867
I like Sumo wrestling, so I went to watch today too.

387
00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:31.467
See, that match!

388
00:19:31.467 --> 00:19:34.067
Well, it was a good match,

389
00:19:34.067 --> 00:19:37.067
but I'm a fan of Akashoryu, who lost,

390
00:19:37.067 --> 00:19:39.167
so I was vexed.

391
00:19:39.167 --> 00:19:43.067
So, you saw Mr. Kunimatsu who looked delighted watching the match

392
00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:44.767
and held a grudge against him?

393
00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:47.067
No, I didn't.

394
00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:50.367
Did Mr. Kunimatsu like Sumo wrestling?

395
00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:51.767
Beats me.

396
00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:53.067
There was a time when he was watching

397
00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.267
a live Sumo wrestling broadcast though.

398
00:19:55.267 --> 00:19:57.467
I'm Kengo Haruto.

399
00:19:57.467 --> 00:20:00.567
"Kengo Haruto (44)" -I got a call just before 20:00.

400
00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:04.067
I figured it was going to get noisy with the crackers going off and all,

401
00:20:04.067 --> 00:20:06.567
so I stepped outside the shop a bit.

402
00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:09.167
Who was the call from?

403
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:10.867
I don't know!

404
00:20:10.867 --> 00:20:12.067
It was a solicitor or something,

405
00:20:12.067 --> 00:20:14.467
who went on explaining that I got pissed,

406
00:20:14.467 --> 00:20:16.167
shouted and hung up!

407
00:20:17.167 --> 00:20:18.767
And when I came back inside,

408
00:20:18.767 --> 00:20:21.967
there was this fuss about somebody being beaten.

409
00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:24.267
Since the cash register was out of order too,

410
00:20:24.267 --> 00:20:27.467
I was seated at my seat, then the police got here.

411
00:20:27.467 --> 00:20:30.067
Is the history of that call still there?

412
00:20:30.067 --> 00:20:32.967
Yeah, because it was an unidentifiable call.

413
00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:37.467
And? Did you go to watch any match today?

414
00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:39.967
-Yeah, I did. -What match?

415
00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:42.767
Beach volleyball!

416
00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:45.167
It was a succession of close games and sure was a lot of fun!

417
00:20:45.167 --> 00:20:49.267
Well, I did have my expectations of wardrobe malfunction too!

418
00:20:49.267 --> 00:20:51.667
So you who were watching the players with a lewd look

419
00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.867
got into a fight with Mr. Kunimatsu?

420
00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:57.367
I didn't get into a fight!

421
00:20:57.367 --> 00:20:59.967
Did Mr. Kunimatsu like beach volleyball?

422
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.867
Yeah, he likes it pretty much.

423
00:21:02.867 --> 00:21:05.967
Then, finally, you are?

424
00:21:05.967 --> 00:21:08.667
I'm Takuya Kyuma.

425
00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:11.367
"Takuya Kyuma (26)" -I wasn't at my seat around 20:00

426
00:21:11.367 --> 00:21:13.167
because I ran out of cigarettes

427
00:21:13.167 --> 00:21:14.967
and since the vending machine in the shop

428
00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:17.067
didn't have the brand that I always smoke,

429
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:19.667
I went out to buy it.

430
00:21:19.667 --> 00:21:22.067
And, when you came back after buying your cigarette,

431
00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:24.967
there was a fuss, and the police were here?

432
00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:26.267
Yes.

433
00:21:26.267 --> 00:21:29.267
And? Did you watch any matches today?

434
00:21:29.267 --> 00:21:31.867
Yeah, I did.

435
00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:35.867
I watched the Tokyo Spirits vs. Big Osaka at the Tohto Stadium.

436
00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:38.967
You were watching a soccer game.

437
00:21:38.967 --> 00:21:43.967
Yeah, it was 1-2, an exciting game to the end.

438
00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:48.067
Well, since I'm a fan of the visitor team Big Osaka,

439
00:21:48.067 --> 00:21:51.167
I clapped inconspicuously cheering the teammates of Big Osaka

440
00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:54.567
who were hugging each other on the grounds after winning the game.

441
00:21:55.967 --> 00:21:58.767
If Mr. Kunimatsu were watching that match

442
00:21:58.767 --> 00:22:00.267
and got emotionally carried away,

443
00:22:00.267 --> 00:22:03.267
he would've had to be cheering for the same Big Osaka team.

444
00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:07.067
There seems to have been nothing to cause a grudge here.

445
00:22:07.067 --> 00:22:09.667
Did Mr. Kunimatsu watch soccer?

446
00:22:09.667 --> 00:22:11.867
He used to watch it a lot on TV,

447
00:22:11.867 --> 00:22:14.367
but he didn't have any particular team that he favored.

448
00:22:17.667 --> 00:22:19.767
I see.

449
00:22:19.767 --> 00:22:22.967
What? It seems like you've come to something too.

450
00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:23.967
Yeah.

451
00:22:25.567 --> 00:22:29.167
The assault and battery case that occurred at the sports club.

452
00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:32.567
While the first anniversary of the shop was in progress,

453
00:22:32.567 --> 00:22:35.867
someone beat Mr. Kunimatsu up in the toilet compartment.

454
00:22:36.967 --> 00:22:39.067
The suspects are the three who are in the shop

455
00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:40.867
despite not having set off the crackers.

456
00:22:41.867 --> 00:22:46.167
The answer leading to the real culprit is hidden in their testimonies!

457
00:24:07.267 --> 00:24:09.167
"Next episode" -What's with you,

458
00:24:09.167 --> 00:24:10.567
all hung up on a lucky charm all the while?

459
00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:13.567
That's a lucky charm that's effective only for me!

460
00:24:13.567 --> 00:24:14.567
You don't have proof

461
00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:16.667
and yet you still intend to keep us here?

462
00:24:16.667 --> 00:24:20.567
If you want to go home that badly, just go.

463
00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:24.767
Of course. I'm talking about the two who aren't the culprit, though.

464
00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:29.367
That culprit said something strange

465
00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:32.067
that even a kid like me saw through.

466
00:24:32.067 --> 00:24:33.267
Next Conan,

"Pocket".

470
00:24:56.911 --> 00:24:59.811
Hey, Kudo, is something in the lucky charm? -Beats me.

471
00:24:59.811 --> 00:25:01.611
Kudo? -No, no.
