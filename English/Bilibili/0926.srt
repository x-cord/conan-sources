1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,970
After watching the BIG Osaka versus Tokyo Spirits game,

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,270
we returned to Beika City by train.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,570
Haibara the Higo super-fan was in a great mood

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,370
because she got a phone strap of him.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,970
But when she learned she lost the strap,

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,170
she became extremely disheartened.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,170
Mitsuhiko's phone that was coincidentally recording a video captured

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,370
a man with his son who were riding on the same train

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,970
picking up her strap.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:33,570
Amuro, who was parked in front of Dr. Agasa's house, became involved,

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,170
and together we set out to search for the strap, but...

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,270
"Toto Metro Lost and Found" -Thanks for waiting, kids.

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,870
Here. This is the strap, right?

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,170
What? That's not it!

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,370
That's Sanada.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,370
We lost a Higo strap!

17
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,970
What? This isn't it?

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,270
Was this the man who turned that in?

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,970
No, it was a younger man.

20
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,270
Maybe...

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,770
Maybe?

22
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,170
They could be digging for clams.

23
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,670
You go digging for clams in spring.

24
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,470
We're on summer break.

25
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,370
Actually, you can do it all year round.

26
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,170
What? Really?

27
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,570
Yes.

28
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,070
And low tide at Chiyari Beach

29
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:30,670
is at 5:59 today.

30
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,770
When digging for clams,

31
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,370
it's best to arrive an hour or two before low tide,

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,370
so it makes sense that they took that train.

33
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,970
Really?

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,670
-Then... -If we go to that beach...

35
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,970
We'll be able to retrieve Haibara's strap.

36
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,070
Once that boy realizes the strap his dad picked up isn't his,

37
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,870
I'm sure he'll hand it over.

38
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,070
Yeah. And once we get it,

39
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,670
we won't let anyone else take it until we return it to Ai!

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,770
No matter what!

41
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,170
Yeah!

42
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,770
Yes! Haibara will be so happy!

43
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,370
I'll go settle the bill.

44
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,570
You kids head to the car.

45
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,370
Sure.

46
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,070
Thanks, Amuro.

47
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,170
Thanks for the food...

48
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,270
Kazami.

49
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,970
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

50
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,870
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

51
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,770
It holds the key to my school trip!

52
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,270
Find Haibara's phone strap!

53
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,870
He sees through the one and only truth.

54
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,570
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

55
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,870
His name is Detective Conan.

56
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:46,812
"The Heartfelt Strap (Part 2)"

57
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:53,212
It's raining.

58
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:54,712
Seriously?

59
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,812
Looks like it's showering.

60
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:59,612
Let's hurry up and get inside Amuro's car.

61
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,412
-Okay. -Okay.

62
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:03,212
Gosh.

63
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,312
The rain's gonna soak me to the core.

64
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:08,912
What?

65
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,112
Hey, Genta!

66
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,112
Hurry up, hurry up!

67
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:17,712
You'll catch a cold!

68
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:19,012
Yes.

69
00:05:19,012 --> 00:05:21,312
Give me a minute...

70
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:27,112
I see.

71
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:29,912
She's in that state

72
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,012
because she lost the Higo strap

73
00:05:33,012 --> 00:05:36,512
that he himself touched?

74
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:37,712
Yeah.

75
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,712
Seeing her like that

76
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:42,612
reminds me that even though she normally acts so cool,

77
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:47,212
she's actually an 18 year-old girl on the inside.

78
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:53,112
It's easier for us if she remains a young girl.

79
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:55,412
Yes, you're right.

80
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:59,912
I received a message saying the situation is complicated.

81
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:01,512
I wonder if they'll find it.

82
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:04,312
Don't be silly, Dr. Agasa.

83
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:05,712
Silly?

84
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:09,412
It's less likely that it won't be found.

85
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:14,812
Japan's top two inspectors are on the case.

86
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,912
There are so many people!

87
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:24,212
It's not even clam hunting season.

88
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:27,312
We have to find them among all these people?

89
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:30,112
If only we knew their names...

90
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:35,712
-Are you in? -Yes.

91
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,012
I've boarded the Shonan Shinjuku rapid train

92
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:42,012
that departed Takasaki at 13:14.

93
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:44,712
Third car from the front.

94
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:48,712
It's the center door on the left side facing the direction of travel.

95
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:49,912
Got it.

96
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,312
"Yuya Kazami (30)" -I've arrived.

97
00:07:04,312 --> 00:07:07,912
I'm in front of the center left door of car three.

98
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:11,312
Crouch in front of the door and breathe on it.

99
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:12,512
What?

100
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,012
Hurry up!

101
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:15,312
Okay.

102
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,012
What does it say?

103
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:22,812
It's in hiragana.

104
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:26,012
It says "Yuto Yoshida".

105
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,412
Yuto Yoshida, right?

106
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:31,712
I'm glad you happened to be in Kanagawa.

107
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,812
Hey, Furuya.

108
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:36,012
What exactly are you investigating?

109
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:37,112
Thanks.

110
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:38,812
Hey, wait. Furuya...

111
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,312
"Beach House" -I've got it.

112
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:45,812
His name is Yuto Yoshiya.

113
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,412
Yuto Yoshida?

114
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:50,412
That's the boy's name?

115
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,612
Yes.

116
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:56,012
My friend happened to be on that train.

117
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:58,812
I had him breathe on the window

118
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,212
and check what that boy wrote.

119
00:08:02,212 --> 00:08:03,912
Really?

120
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:06,012
Nice one, Amuro.

121
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,312
Now that we know that,

122
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:13,512
I'll set my bow tie-shaped voice-changer to loudspeaker mode, and...

123
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:18,412
Yuto Yoshida from Tokyo,

124
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:20,412
your friends have arrived.

125
00:08:20,412 --> 00:08:23,812
Please come to the beach house immediately.

126
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:25,212
Once again.

127
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:28,312
Yuto Yoshida from Tokyo,

128
00:08:28,312 --> 00:08:31,612
please come to the beach house immediately.

129
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,012
Hold on, Conan.

130
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:38,412
How do you know that boy's from Tokyo?

131
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:40,612
-Why wouldn't I? -What?

132
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:44,712
That train gets crowded at Shinjuku Station near the Toto Stadium,

133
00:08:44,712 --> 00:08:47,712
the Tokyo Spirits' home stadium.

134
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:50,512
In other words, the station where we got on.

135
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:53,612
But that father and son weren't sitting,

136
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:56,512
which means they either got on

137
00:08:56,512 --> 00:09:00,012
when we did or after that.

138
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:03,112
They could only be from Tokyo.

139
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:04,712
I see.

140
00:09:08,012 --> 00:09:09,512
Excuse me.

141
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:15,712
Yuto Yoshida is my son.

142
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:19,512
Are you looking for someone else by the same name?

143
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:22,412
It's them!

144
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,012
Mister.

145
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:28,812
You picked up a soccer player strap on the train, right?

146
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:31,912
Yeah. I thought it was my son's.

147
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:35,012
But it was of a different player.

148
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:38,212
That's my friend's!

149
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:42,112
Your son's strap was at Chiyari Station!

150
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:43,712
Give it back!

151
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:47,412
Sure. I'm glad you came.

152
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:50,212
Here.

153
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:53,512
Sorry about that, kids.

154
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:55,112
No problem.

155
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:57,912
What?

156
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,212
What?

157
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:04,312
No way!

158
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,112
It was stolen!

159
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:08,312
Who is that?

160
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:10,712
-No! -Conan!

161
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:16,112
Darn!

162
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:17,712
Wait, why?

163
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:20,212
It's just a phone strap!

164
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:23,312
Come to think of it, I recognize that man.

165
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:24,712
What?

166
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:28,512
He was standing near the Chiyari Station lost and found

167
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:30,512
when we went there,

168
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:32,712
and I think he was sitting behind Ayumi

169
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:35,912
at the family restaurant we just visited.

170
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:39,412
Then maybe he's been following us this whole time

171
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:42,612
so he could swipe it!

172
00:10:42,612 --> 00:10:43,912
Seriously?

173
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,512
That's awful!

174
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,812
Yeah, but why?

175
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:50,912
It's just a Higo phone strap!

176
00:10:50,912 --> 00:10:52,612
It's not just a strap!

177
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:55,312
It was really important to Haibara!

178
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:59,112
There's only one strap like it in the whole world!

179
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:03,012
That doesn't answer the question.

180
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:05,812
Maybe...

181
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:09,412
it's because of what was inside the strap.

182
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,212
What?

183
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,712
Yuto, there was something inside it, right?

184
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:15,812
Yeah.

185
00:11:15,812 --> 00:11:18,612
It was hard when I squeezed it.

186
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,912
There was something hard inside?

187
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:23,912
That something...

188
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:29,612
must be a flash drive with top secret data on it.

189
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:30,812
What?

190
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:32,812
That's impossible.

191
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:36,012
We bought it at the stadium store.

192
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,712
Actually, the straps were sold out,

193
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:45,212
and Haibara asked the clerk to sell her the display product.

194
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,912
Really?

195
00:11:46,912 --> 00:11:52,212
Then that's not an impossible scenario.

196
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,012
One person picks up the display product

197
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:57,112
and puts something inside it while pretending to look at it.

198
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:59,312
Once that product sells out,

199
00:11:59,312 --> 00:12:03,412
another person asks to purchase the display product.

200
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:06,912
It's a way to secretly make a deal.

201
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,012
"Player Phone Straps"

202
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:11,812
But your friend bought the display product first.

203
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:14,612
While following her in order to get it back...

204
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:21,012
your friend dropped the strap when the train shook.

205
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,912
He took advantage of the opportunity to pick up the strap,

206
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:25,412
but it was the wrong one.

207
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:30,512
When he went to the station's lost and found to turn in the strap,

208
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,212
you kids appeared.

209
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:35,012
Since it seemed like you'd find the strap he wanted for himself,

210
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:37,712
he resumed following you

211
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:40,712
and waited for an opportunity to steal it.

212
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:44,612
Then once the deal is done...

213
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,912
That strap...

214
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,812
Will be thrown away.

215
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,512
We'll have to split up

216
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:54,312
and find that man!

217
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:55,612
Yeah...

218
00:12:55,612 --> 00:12:59,712
Amuro, watch the exits.

219
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:04,512
He wasn't dressed like someone digging for clams.

220
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:07,312
But, Conan,

221
00:13:07,312 --> 00:13:10,312
there's still a lot of people.

222
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:15,312
People might help us if we were the police.

223
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:19,312
They'd probably get mad at us if we interrupted their digging.

224
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:20,812
Don't worry.

225
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:22,412
We're kids.

226
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:25,012
They'll overlook a minor inconvenience.

227
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,412
Since we're small,

228
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:29,212
we can slip through the crowds to look for him.

229
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:32,312
In this case, we might actually be more effective

230
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,312
than your average police officer.

231
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,312
Okay!

232
00:13:37,312 --> 00:13:39,112
Let's do it!

233
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,512
Yeah!

234
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:43,212
In any case, loudly describe that man's appearance

235
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:46,612
so the people around you can hear you.

236
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,412
Once you find him, don't do anything.

237
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,212
Use your Detective Badge to notify me.

238
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:52,612
Yeah...

239
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:02,112
It's like you're using the Baker Street Irregulars

240
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:04,512
to gather information for you,

241
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:07,112
just like Sherlock Holmes.

242
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,112
I'm surprised, though.

243
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:12,212
I didn't think you'd be so desperate

244
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:15,412
to find the phone strap your friend lost.

245
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,612
Yeah.

246
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,612
There's a reason for that.

247
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,579
Excuse me!

248
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:38,679
Has anyone seen a tall man wearing a flat cap?

249
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:41,579
A man wearing a suit jacket and pants!

250
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,879
Anyone seen him?

251
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,479
Where's the warmly dressed man?

252
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,079
Excuse me!

253
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,279
Have you seen a man wearing a flat cap?

254
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,979
A man wearing a suit jacket and pants!

255
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,179
Our friend is watching the exits,

256
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,179
so you can't escape!

257
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:03,479
Darn!

258
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,679
A man wearing a suit! Where are you?

259
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,379
Have you seen a tall man wearing a suit?

260
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,379
A man wearing a suit jacket and pants!

261
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:16,779
Give yourself up!

262
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:18,679
You can't escape!

263
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,479
"Changing Room and Coin Lockers"

264
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,579
Ayumi here.

265
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,779
I haven't found any sign of that man.

266
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:30,979
Maybe he took off his clothes and hat.

267
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:33,179
The sun's starting to set.

268
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:36,279
Maybe he's planning to blend in with the people leaving.

269
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,979
Or maybe he's already escaped.

270
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,579
He hasn't left. Don't worry.

271
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,479
As long as you guys keep shouting,

272
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,979
eventually...

273
00:15:56,979 --> 00:16:00,479
I've been waiting for you, mister.

274
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,979
Who... who are you, kid?

275
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:08,479
Don't play dumb.

276
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,179
You could immediately remove your hat and jacket,

277
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,679
swap them out for something you bought here,

278
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,679
and stuff them into one of the bags sold at the store,

279
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:22,379
but you can't change your pants without visiting the changing room.

280
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,679
What?

281
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,179
Am I wrong?

282
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:29,079
Listen, I just came to change into shorts

283
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:31,079
so I could go digging for clams.

284
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,179
But look.

285
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,679
It's late in the afternoon.

286
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:39,079
Everyone's getting ready to leave.

287
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,679
You're going to start now?

288
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:45,679
I can do what I want!

289
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,779
And there's a price tag on your hat.

290
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,779
What?

291
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,279
No way.

292
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,779
That proves you hastily put it on as soon as you bought it.

293
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,379
And besides,

294
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:00,679
I can see the head of the strap poking out.

295
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,979
What?

296
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:07,879
You idiot. It's hidden right...

297
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,279
So you are the man

298
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,779
who stole the Higo strap from us.

299
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:19,779
Darn it!

300
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:22,779
Idiot.

301
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,079
You're not getting away!

302
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:30,479
My school trip!

303
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:33,479
This ends now!

304
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,379
Wait!

305
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,779
Darn it!

306
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:56,279
Conan!

307
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,279
Conan!

308
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:14,879
I managed to keep it from getting wet.

309
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,879
All right!

310
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,279
I see.

311
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,879
So those are his Power-Enhancing Shoes.

312
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:23,479
-Impressive, Conan! -Yeah!

313
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,279
You're amazing!

314
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,979
"Beach House" -What?

315
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:30,079
An engagement ring?

316
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,779
That's what you put inside the strap?

317
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,179
Yeah. My girlfriend's a huge Higo fan.

318
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,879
I was going to surprise her tonight.

319
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:45,779
It really was inside.

320
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:47,279
It's so pretty.

321
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,479
It looks expensive.

322
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:52,079
Yeah. I splurged on it,

323
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,279
so I was worried if it was actually still inside there.

324
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,079
While checking it on the train,

325
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,479
I dropped it when the train shook.

326
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:04,379
I went to pick it up right away, but it was a different strap.

327
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:08,779
I saw the father and son standing nearby pick it up.

328
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:12,079
I thought I'd explain the situation when they got off

329
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,879
and exchange straps,

330
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:17,379
but Chiyari Station was full of people there to dig for clams.

331
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,679
I lost sight of them,

332
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:22,979
so I thought if I turned in their strap

333
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:24,779
to the lost and found and waited there,

334
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:27,679
they might show up.

335
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,379
That's when these kids arrived.

336
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:32,779
They seemed to be looking for the same strap for some reason,

337
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:35,279
so I followed them.

338
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,179
Then you should've said so sooner.

339
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,979
If we'd known, we would've helped you look for it.

340
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,579
But that girl...

341
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:44,679
And once we get it,

342
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,479
we won't let anyone else take it until we return it to Ai!

343
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,379
No matter what!

344
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,379
I heard her say that, so...

345
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:58,079
In other words, three people dropped their straps

346
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,979
when the train shook.

347
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:04,779
The father and son picked up his Higo strap,

348
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:09,979
and he picked up the son's Sanada strap.

349
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:12,979
Then where's Ai's strap?

350
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,679
It's a mystery.

351
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,079
I found my Detective Badge, though.

352
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,179
Genta, where did you find it?

353
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,879
What? In the parking lot of the family restaurant.

354
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:28,079
I put on my hood when it started to rain,

355
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,079
and it fell out.

356
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,879
It must have gotten in there when you tripped on the train.

357
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:36,779
Oh, right.

358
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:38,879
Hey, what are you doing?

359
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:41,279
If it's not in here,

360
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,079
then Haibara's strap...

361
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,279
is in the family restaurant parking lot!

362
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,879
Which means...

363
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,979
Haibara's strap

364
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:55,779
was also inside Genta's hood?

365
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,979
Yeah, probably.

366
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,579
It must've fallen with his badge

367
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,979
when Genta put on his hood.

368
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:06,679
So it should be around here where Genta put on his hood.

369
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,579
I found it!

370
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,479
We did it!

371
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,479
-Finally! -Ai will be so happy!

372
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,679
Yeah!

373
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,379
You found Ai's strap?

374
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,279
Yeah, somehow.

375
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,179
Where's the driver of the RX-7?

376
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:54,179
Oh, Amuro?

377
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,579
He said he had something to do and left.

378
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:57,979
I see.

379
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:03,479
Ai!

380
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,879
We found your Higo strap!

381
00:23:05,879 --> 00:23:07,979
Really?

382
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:10,879
Yeah. It wasn't easy,

383
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:12,779
but we found it.

384
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,079
Yeah...

385
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,779
Thank you!

386
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:19,179
Here. It's your long-awaited Higo strap.

387
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,979
A car ran over it.

388
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:26,079
It was really dirty.

389
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,479
So we washed it clean with water.

390
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,179
The left eye had come off,

391
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,179
so we drew it on with a magic marker.

392
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,279
Good work, kids.

393
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:39,879
I'll get you something cold to drink.

394
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:41,479
Hooray!

395
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:46,979
That's not why we did it,

396
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:48,479
but if you don't mind,

397
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,679
the medicine to restore my body...

398
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,779
Absolutely not!

399
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:55,879
"Next Episode" -No...

400
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,679
Give me a break!

401
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,079
Come on. I'll take a romantic photo of you two.

402
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,379
What? Oh, yeah.

403
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:07,579
Didn't we meet on the beach when we were kids?

404
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,479
It's been 10 years, right?

405
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:11,079
10 years?

406
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,779
"Shinichi, hurry! Come to Nishiki's room!"

407
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,179
Next Conan special,

408
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,379
"The Scarlet School Trip (Bright Red Arc)"

409
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:27,522
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:27,522 --> 00:24:29,422
"The Bloody Ceiling"

411
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:32,122
-What was that at the end there? -Absolutely not.

412
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,122
But, Haibara...
