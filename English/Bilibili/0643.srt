1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.240
It's still early in the year and yet I caught a cold.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.940
Geez, talk about bad luck.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.240
We had made plans to play karuta cards at Ayumi's place,

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.040
when a boy named Masao,

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.840
who's living on the same floor in Room 2806,

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.740
and his parents interrupted us.

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.540
After seeing these three via the video call,

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.440
I saw through the fact that they weren't his real parents.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.640
And urged Mitsuhiko and the others

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.040
to contact the police before ending the call.

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.740
Although Conan said so,

12
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.240
is that really the case?

13
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.840
In order to confirm it,

14
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.940
we had no choice but to barge into that family.

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.140
Our excuse was to play karuta cards with Masao.

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.440
However, even though he bragged about being good at grabbing karuta cards,

17
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.040
he couldn't grab any.

18
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.240
He finally grabbed his first card marked with "ni",

19
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.640
but got into a tug of war with Genta,

20
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.440
and insisted that "a hated child thrives better in the world"

21
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340
was his card. How bizarre if that?

22
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.540
Wrong.

23
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.740
He was trying to use the karuta cards

24
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.240
to tell us something.

25
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.440
What might that be?

26
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.940
If all cases were men,

27
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.840
I suppose all hidden mysteries would be women.

28
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.340
A message in the nick of time.

29
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.340
The truth that the karuta cards relay.

30
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.940
He sees through the one and only truth.

31
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.740
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

32
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.940
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

33
00:02:54.135 --> 00:02:59.235
"Grabbing Karuta Cards in Dire Straits (Part 2)"

34
00:03:02.735 --> 00:03:05.235
Now, on to the next one.

35
00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:06.935
Different as chalk and cheese.

36
00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.635
To hide your head but not your rear.

37
00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:13.435
There.

38
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:16.535
-Ogre with an iron club. -Got it.

39
00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:17.635
Next one...

40
00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.535
Heaven knows and earth knows.

41
00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:27.235
A lie which happened to come true.

42
00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:28.335
This is it.

43
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:31.535
Only five cards left.

44
00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.435
Let's move on.

45
00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:35.035
Better dumplings than cherry blossoms.

46
00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:37.135
Got it.

47
00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:38.735
My seventh card.

48
00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.835
There are only four cards left,

49
00:03:42.835 --> 00:03:45.235
and since you only have four cards.

50
00:03:45.235 --> 00:03:48.035
It means you can't beat me.

51
00:03:48.035 --> 00:03:52.035
No, if Masao manages to take all four of the remaining cards,

52
00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:53.635
he'd turn the tables and win.

53
00:03:56.735 --> 00:03:58.435
Mommy, restroom.

54
00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:02.435
The game is about to end, so just hold it.

55
00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:05.935
Restroom. Can't hold it.

56
00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:09.935
It can't be helped.

57
00:04:09.935 --> 00:04:13.535
Fine, I'll go with you, okay?

58
00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:17.935
Masao, you can't go to the restroom on your own?

59
00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:20.935
Yes, my child has claustrophobia,

60
00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:22.435
so he needs me by his side.

61
00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:23.835
Say...

62
00:04:23.835 --> 00:04:25.335
Take out that towel.

63
00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:26.335
What?

64
00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:28.635
The towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa.

65
00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:30.835
I can't do without it.

66
00:04:34.035 --> 00:04:37.535
Geez, stop saying selfish things.

67
00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:41.935
Well, let's get going.

68
00:04:45.135 --> 00:04:47.735
What do you think about that mother and child?

69
00:04:47.735 --> 00:04:49.735
I think they're really related.

70
00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:52.835
Because he said "Mommy, restroom" like a spoiled child.

71
00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:56.235
You wouldn't call a bad person "Mommy", after all.

72
00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:59.935
It could also be that he was forced to call her that.

73
00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:02.735
I do think it's unusual

74
00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:04.735
for that mother stick around Masao non-stop.

75
00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:08.135
Yes, as if she's monitoring his every move

76
00:05:08.135 --> 00:05:10.335
so that he can't try anything funny.

77
00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:11.935
So, were they indeed...

78
00:05:11.935 --> 00:05:16.135
The key to support or reject that theory is what Masao had...

79
00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:18.535
The "ru", "ko", "ni", "te"...

80
00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:21.135
These four cards might be our key.

81
00:05:21.135 --> 00:05:24.835
But what on earth does its mean?

82
00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:28.035
Maybe we should rearrange these to form a word.

83
00:05:28.035 --> 00:05:29.935
I don't think we should.

84
00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:32.635
The first card he took was "ni",

85
00:05:32.635 --> 00:05:35.635
but he deliberately placed it so that it's the third card from the top.

86
00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.335
Then, you mean this is the correct order?

87
00:05:38.335 --> 00:05:39.735
Yeah, I think.

88
00:05:39.735 --> 00:05:41.035
His attempt to go to the restroom,

89
00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:43.635
as well as to evacuate the mother from here,

90
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:45.335
could've been an attempt to buy us time

91
00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:49.335
in order to solve this code.

92
00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:51.435
But I don't understand its meaning.

93
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.435
If we read it backwards, won't work either.

94
00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:59.235
And to begin with, even if the mother and father are fake,

95
00:05:59.235 --> 00:06:00.435
I can't figure out the reason

96
00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:03.235
why they'd be staying here acting as his parents.

97
00:06:03.235 --> 00:06:04.335
If they're kidnappers,

98
00:06:04.335 --> 00:06:07.835
they should've already moved to another place.

99
00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:09.035
If they're robbers,

100
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:12.935
they would've pretended no one's home and not let us in.

101
00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:14.635
In that case,

102
00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:17.035
let's call Conan and ask him about this.

103
00:06:17.035 --> 00:06:19.735
If we do that, wouldn't we be able to know the truth?

104
00:06:19.735 --> 00:06:21.135
But, Conan...

105
00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:23.335
I bet he's asleep because of his cold.

106
00:06:23.335 --> 00:06:26.235
However, if that mother is really a fake,

107
00:06:26.235 --> 00:06:27.635
wouldn't it be dangerous?

108
00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.535
We have no choice.

109
00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:31.735
In that case, let's text him.

110
00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:35.035
If he still has the strength to get up

111
00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:37.635
and read my text he'll reply soon.

112
00:06:37.635 --> 00:06:40.135
And if he doesn't, it means he's still asleep.

113
00:06:40.135 --> 00:06:42.135
What are you going to write in your email?

114
00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:45.335
The sequence of events leading to our visit to Masao's place.

115
00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:48.035
I don't know why, but...

116
00:06:48.035 --> 00:06:51.835
Edogawa suspected that those three people weren't biologically related,

117
00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:53.935
just by watching the video call.

118
00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:56.835
And he told us to call the police.

119
00:06:56.835 --> 00:07:03.835
But we had doubts about that deduction,

120
00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:05.935
so we asked the neighbors of Masao.

121
00:07:05.935 --> 00:07:08.835
The lady in Room 2807 said

122
00:07:08.835 --> 00:07:11.635
Masao's family just moved in

123
00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:15.035
and that she hasn't met his parents, right?

124
00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:18.835
She did say that she knew the previous resident of this room.

125
00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:22.135
Yes, formerly employed by the Isobe Corporation,

126
00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:24.035
which is now under suspicion of tax evasion.

127
00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:27.135
And the name was Mr. Uemura.

128
00:07:27.135 --> 00:07:29.935
The man from Room 2805 also said

129
00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:33.435
he'd never seen Masao's parents.

130
00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:34.435
Come to think of it,

131
00:07:34.435 --> 00:07:37.935
he also said that he saw Producer Hida from Nichiuri TV

132
00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:39.835
about two weeks ago.

133
00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:42.535
He saw the producer going into Room 2806.

134
00:07:42.535 --> 00:07:46.935
But, that producer later had a traffic accident

135
00:07:46.935 --> 00:07:50.035
and was in critical condition until yesterday.

136
00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:53.735
The matching statements of the two neighbors were...

137
00:07:53.735 --> 00:07:56.135
that Masao is a prankster

138
00:07:56.135 --> 00:07:59.435
and a big liar on top of that.

139
00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:03.435
As such, we came to Masao's place to ascertain the truth,

140
00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:06.735
using playing karuta cards as an excuse to get inside.

141
00:08:06.735 --> 00:08:12.735
Then Masao left us the four cards he took "ru, ko, ni, te",

142
00:08:12.735 --> 00:08:14.835
while going to the restroom with the mother,

143
00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:16.935
and here we are now.

144
00:08:16.935 --> 00:08:19.935
Shouldn't we write about the towel as well?

145
00:08:19.935 --> 00:08:21.035
If I recall,

146
00:08:21.035 --> 00:08:23.035
he said, "I can't go to the restroom

147
00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.735
without the towel with a horsehair crab from Lake Suwa on it".

148
00:08:25.735 --> 00:08:28.035
That's right.

149
00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:29.435
Sending.

150
00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:30.435
"Sending"

151
00:08:30.435 --> 00:08:32.435
"Message sent"

152
00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:35.435
However, that was a very mismatched towel.

153
00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:38.635
Because you'll never find horsehair crabs in a lake.

154
00:08:38.635 --> 00:08:40.035
Is that so?

155
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:43.435
Horsehair crabs only live in the sea.

156
00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:45.235
"Su wa ko" (Lake Suwa),

157
00:08:45.235 --> 00:08:46.635
"ke gani" (Horsehair crab),

158
00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:47.835
"ta o ru" (towel).

159
00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:54.635
I can't do without it.

160
00:08:57.335 --> 00:08:58.835
I see.

161
00:08:58.835 --> 00:09:01.935
So that's what he meant.

162
00:09:01.935 --> 00:09:03.535
Haibara.

163
00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:05.135
Don't tell me...

164
00:09:05.135 --> 00:09:08.635
You already figured something out?

165
00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:09.835
How'd you know?

166
00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:13.335
Because you just showed the same expression as Conan.

167
00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:15.535
How rude...

168
00:09:15.535 --> 00:09:18.135
But, it's true that, I've figured it out.

169
00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:22.935
That he was right all along.

170
00:09:26.635 --> 00:09:29.635
Conan was right, you say?

171
00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:34.035
So the man and woman just now really are bad guys?

172
00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:38.235
Yes, pretending to be Masao's real parents,

173
00:09:38.235 --> 00:09:40.335
they're up to no good, don't you think?

174
00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:43.535
But, how did you figure that out?

175
00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:46.135
It's the karuta cards Masao collected.

176
00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:50.135
The four cards told us so.

177
00:09:53.535 --> 00:09:57.535
Which means, in order to only collect those four cards,

178
00:09:57.535 --> 00:09:59.335
he had positioned those cards beforehand

179
00:09:59.335 --> 00:10:03.035
so that they would've been easy for him to grab.

180
00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:05.435
Then he headed to the restroom

181
00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:06.935
with the woman who was faking to be his mother.

182
00:10:06.935 --> 00:10:09.535
It was all to help the rest of us figure it out.

183
00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:14.535
The secret code he had constructed.

184
00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:18.635
Well, unfortunately the first "ni" card he tried to grab.

185
00:10:18.635 --> 00:10:20.335
I was the first to take this.

186
00:10:20.335 --> 00:10:22.835
No way. I'll never let you have it.

187
00:10:22.835 --> 00:10:25.235
Because this "ni" card is my card.

188
00:10:26.235 --> 00:10:28.735
Resulted in a tug-of-war with Genta.

189
00:10:30.135 --> 00:10:32.135
But what does it mean?

190
00:10:32.135 --> 00:10:33.735
The four cards.

191
00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:35.835
Masao told us, didn't he?

192
00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:37.735
The key to solving the code.

193
00:10:37.735 --> 00:10:40.035
By saying, "I can't do it without that."

194
00:10:41.035 --> 00:10:43.135
So... you mean...

195
00:10:43.135 --> 00:10:45.535
The towel with the horsehair crab from Lake Suwa?

196
00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:47.935
Yes, "Su wa ko" (Lake Suwa), "ke ga ni" (horsehair crab)

197
00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:50.335
and "ta o ru" (towel) all have three syllables.

198
00:10:50.335 --> 00:10:54.335
Change the middle syllable of each "wa", "ga" and "o"

199
00:10:54.335 --> 00:10:56.235
into the particles "ha", "go", "wo",

200
00:10:56.235 --> 00:10:58.135
and think along these lines.

201
00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:01.035
What are "party something", anyway?

202
00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:02.935
Do you mean "party girls"?

203
00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:07.335
They are words used between nouns in connective sentences

204
00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:09.735
that show relation or attach meaning.

205
00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:14.335
For example, Genta "wa" otoko da (Genta "is" a boy).

206
00:11:14.335 --> 00:11:16.035
I see.

207
00:11:16.035 --> 00:11:19.235
"Su wa ko" should be "su is ko".

208
00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:22.335
So isn't it telling us "su" is represented by "ko"?

209
00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:25.235
Then "ke ga ni" means

210
00:11:25.235 --> 00:11:28.335
to treat "ke" as if it were "ni", right?

211
00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:30.635
In that case, "ta o ru" means

212
00:11:30.635 --> 00:11:33.435
"ta" is changed into "ru".

213
00:11:33.435 --> 00:11:37.035
Yes, so taking that into account,

214
00:11:37.035 --> 00:11:40.835
try reading the four characters.

215
00:11:40.835 --> 00:11:42.835
Leaving the last "te",

216
00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:45.635
which doesn't fall under any of the rules, as is.

217
00:11:45.635 --> 00:11:48.135
We make the first "ru" into "ta".

218
00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:50.435
And the next "ko" is actually "su".

219
00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:54.435
And if we think of the third card, "ni", as "ke"...

220
00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:01.135
It means "Help"!

221
00:12:01.135 --> 00:12:02.235
That's right.

222
00:12:02.235 --> 00:12:05.535
Those two pretending to be Masao's real parent

223
00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:08.335
are bad guys scheming who-knows-what.

224
00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:12.335
So Masao is pleading to us for help.

225
00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:14.035
But wait...

226
00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:17.035
This isn't another lie again, is it?

227
00:12:17.035 --> 00:12:18.435
He's got a point.

228
00:12:18.435 --> 00:12:20.635
It's possible this could be an elaborate prank.

229
00:12:20.635 --> 00:12:21.935
Fools.

230
00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:24.035
Would he have used a code like this

231
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:27.235
that he couldn't be sure we'd be able to solve as a prank?

232
00:12:27.235 --> 00:12:29.435
This is a secret code made

233
00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:31.935
so that the woman faking as his mother wouldn't catch on.

234
00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:33.235
Plus, that child,

235
00:12:33.235 --> 00:12:37.035
when we were about to be turned away at the door,

236
00:12:37.035 --> 00:12:38.635
he was frightened.

237
00:12:40.435 --> 00:12:45.235
But, where could Masao's real parents be, then?

238
00:12:45.235 --> 00:12:48.135
I don't know about his father, but...

239
00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:49.535
As far as his mother,

240
00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.135
I can make a fair guess.

241
00:12:52.835 --> 00:12:54.135
For real?

242
00:12:54.135 --> 00:12:58.135
Masao, said something odd besides

243
00:12:58.135 --> 00:13:00.435
"the towel of the horsehair crab from Lake Suwa", didn't he?

244
00:13:00.435 --> 00:13:02.035
Something odd?

245
00:13:02.035 --> 00:13:04.935
That's right, didn't he say he was good at karuta cards,

246
00:13:04.935 --> 00:13:06.635
but it turned out he really suck at playing.

247
00:13:06.635 --> 00:13:09.635
The reason for that was just because he had to collect

248
00:13:09.635 --> 00:13:11.435
those four cards above all else.

249
00:13:11.435 --> 00:13:13.835
Could it be, when he was going to the restroom and said,

250
00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:17.435
"Mommy, restroom" in a spoiled tone?

251
00:13:17.435 --> 00:13:18.535
That was also only because

252
00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:20.935
he had wanted to get that woman away from here

253
00:13:20.935 --> 00:13:24.135
and have us solve the code.

254
00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:27.235
But even if he hadn't deliberately said that,

255
00:13:27.235 --> 00:13:30.235
don't you think that woman would've accompanied Masao anyway?

256
00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:32.235
That's true.

257
00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:33.635
If she had let Masao leave by himself,

258
00:13:33.635 --> 00:13:36.235
he might've taken the chance and fled.

259
00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:40.035
So he purposely said "Mommy, restroom"

260
00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:41.735
in order to make us connect that phrase

261
00:13:41.735 --> 00:13:43.835
with the "help" we figured out earlier.

262
00:13:43.835 --> 00:13:46.435
Connect them?

263
00:13:46.435 --> 00:13:50.035
Mommy, restroom.

264
00:13:50.035 --> 00:13:51.035
Help.

265
00:13:52.435 --> 00:13:53.835
Could it be?

266
00:13:53.835 --> 00:13:55.635
That's kid's mother...

267
00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:57.735
They locked her in the restroom?

268
00:13:57.735 --> 00:13:59.135
No way.

269
00:13:59.135 --> 00:14:01.335
Although we lack solid proof,

270
00:14:01.335 --> 00:14:03.435
if we think of it that way,

271
00:14:03.435 --> 00:14:05.435
it'd make sense that the man faking to be his father

272
00:14:05.435 --> 00:14:08.635
has been inside the restroom this whole time.

273
00:14:08.635 --> 00:14:10.235
Then, indeed...

274
00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:13.635
We should've just called Officer Takagi in the first place.

275
00:14:13.635 --> 00:14:19.835
Just as that cold-ridden detective had instructed.

276
00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:22.735
"Mouri Detective Agency"

277
00:14:22.735 --> 00:14:24.335
You must be sweating up a storm.

278
00:14:24.335 --> 00:14:25.635
I brought a change of clothes...

279
00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:28.935
Conan?

280
00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:30.835
But with that fever...

281
00:14:30.835 --> 00:14:32.735
Where could he have gone?

282
00:14:32.735 --> 00:14:35.135
"Sorry, I'll be back soon. From Conan" -Geez.

283
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.840
But then, how are you going to save her,

284
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.040
the mother who is locked in the restroom?

285
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.740
No, before that...

286
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.040
we have to do something about that woman

287
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.340
who's pretending to be his mother.

288
00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.340
Hey, if we don't decide on a strategy soon,

289
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.440
they'll be back before we know it.

290
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.940
It'll be fine.

291
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.040
There's no need to rescue or capture anyone.

292
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040
What?

293
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.340
All we need to do is to finish playing this round of karuta cards

294
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.740
and leave.

295
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.440
So, we won't do anything?

296
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.240
However...

297
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.640
Soon after we leave, we'll call Officer Takagi

298
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.140
and explain the situation.

299
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.040
And get him to come and save her.

300
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.040
Of course, if you all wanted to show Conan

301
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.540
that we can handle without him,

302
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.140
and just the four of us make a reckless gamble,

303
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.540
that's another story altogether.

304
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.440
No, no, no, no,

305
00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.040
Hey.

306
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.140
Whose cell phone is that?

307
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.240
Wonder whose it is?

308
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.840
It's not mine.

309
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.740
It's not mine, either.

310
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.640
Don't tell me...

311
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.640
Very keen.

312
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.740
That's my cell phone.

313
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.440
I left it there while the line was still connected.

314
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:09.940
Of course, I was on the other end of the line.

315
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.240
Thanks to you, now I know full well,

316
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.140
that you aren't just normal brats

317
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.240
but bothersome pets that can't be allowed to leave here.

318
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.540
And where is Masao?

319
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.340
I don't see him.

320
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.040
As far that boy,

321
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.040
he is keeping his mother company

322
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.840
as I tied him up in the restroom as well.

323
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.040
Well, at any rate,

324
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.940
you guys will soon join them in that same restroom.

325
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.440
You, girl, with the hair band.

326
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.640
Tie your friends up with that sticky tape.

327
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.540
After all that's done,

328
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.740
I'll tie you up myself.

329
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.440
Well, if you don't like that idea...

330
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.440
We have other ways of rendering you immobile.

331
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.140
You'll be fine.

332
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.340
As soon as we finish our business,

333
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.540
we'll leave you all alone.

334
00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.840
If you're lucky and the real man of this household

335
00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.640
comes back from his business trip early,

336
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.640
he may be able to help you.

337
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.940
My, what could it be?

338
00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.740
That "business" of yours.

339
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.040
Well, there's no telling, is there?

340
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.740
Hey, hurry and answer it.

341
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.740
Yes, sure.

342
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.740
Hey, could that be...

343
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.940
Conan, right?

344
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.940
Hello.

345
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.740
I'm from the post office.

346
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:42.340
Is this Mr. Uemura from Room 2806?

347
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.040
Yes, it is.

348
00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.440
Regarding a registered mail you sent for delivery,

349
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.240
the addressee was unavailable,

350
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.540
so we were unable to deliver it.

351
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.340
Yes, it seems they've moved.

352
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.940
In that case, since this is registered mail,

353
00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.440
may I have your permission to directly return it to you?

354
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.740
Sure, I'm buzzing you up now.

355
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.440
So it wasn't Conan.

356
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.040
I thought he'd come for us after he read the email we sent.

357
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.740
But, I've finally figured it out

358
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.740
that you two are trying to destroy evidence pertaining to tax evasion.

359
00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.040
The sender of that registered mail

360
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.040
was the previous resident of this apartment, the one named Uemura,

361
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.440
who was a former employee of the Isobe Corporation,

362
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.640
now under suspicion of tax evasion.

363
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.040
The contents of the registered mail

364
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.040
are probably whistle-blower documents,

365
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.240
or account books with evidence of tax evasion.

366
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.440
It was sent approximately two weeks ago,

367
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.440
in exchange for a reward,

368
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.940
to a producer at Nichiuri TV named Hida.

369
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.640
The employee planned to move from here and go into hiding.

370
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.440
But that producer ended up in a car accident

371
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.240
and couldn't receive the registered mail due to being hospitalized.

372
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.640
Since the post office holds on to mail for more or less ten days.

373
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.340
You calculated the time of its return.

374
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.740
And plotted to pose as Uemura who had lived here before,

375
00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.840
and snatch away that registered mail.

376
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.040
Then, what happened to that Mr. Uemura?

377
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.140
Probably confined somewhere else,

378
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.540
or already murdered.

379
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.840
And made to look like an accident,

380
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.840
similar to the Nichiuri TV producer.

381
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.440
My, look at you, so I was right on the mark.

382
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.440
He's at the door.

383
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.440
Take it from him.

384
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.940
Sure.

385
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.040
Anyway, as for what we'll do with you...

386
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.940
I suppose we'll decide after we've checked out the registered mail.

387
00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.440
Did something happen?

388
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440
Hey.

389
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.840
Hey, Conan, don't go in before me...

390
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.740
Cuff that woman, hurry.

391
00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.740
Okay.

392
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.840
Conan!

393
00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.840
Where's the woman that was here?

394
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.440
I put her to sleep with my tranquilizer gun.

395
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.940
And she's being handcuffed right now,

396
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.040
by Officer Takagi who's dressed in that mailman disguise.

397
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.340
By the way, if you're asking

398
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.740
why Officer Takagi is dressed like that...

399
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.140
You read the email I sent and deduced

400
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.940
that they were after the returned registered mail, no?

401
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.740
Never mind that, how did you figure it out?

402
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.740
That those two people weren't really Masao's parents.

403
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.640
Didn't you only see them through the video call?

404
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.440
Yes, it's because...

405
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.340
when I saw their hairlines,

406
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.640
I noticed only Masao has a window's peak.

407
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.740
The window's peak is a dominant trait,

408
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.840
so parents without window's peaks could never have given birth to him.

409
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.740
Are you guys all right?

410
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.840
The bad guys have been caught, so you can relax.

411
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.040
I hope you learn from this

412
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.740
and don't tell pointless lies ever again.

413
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.840
Yes, I'll never tell another lie as long as I live.

414
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.040
Could it be another lie in the same breath?

415
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.440
"Tax Evasion Charges" "Two days later"

416
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.740
So the president was indeed arrested.

417
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.940
Well, since he even went as far as to hire those two

418
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.540
to destroy the evidence, it only stands to reason.

419
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.440
And it looks like Mr. Uemura who had been confined

420
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.340
has also been rescued.

421
00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.540
Isn't this great?

422
00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.340
Don't tell me you guys

423
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.640
all caught a cold from me, did you?

424
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.940
My cold is completely gone, though.

425
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.140
Everyone, take care not to catch a cold.

426
00:23:45.709 --> 00:23:46.909
Cold prevention.

427
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:48.209
-A mask. -Washing hands

428
00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:50.178
-Gargling. -Don't give your cold to others.
