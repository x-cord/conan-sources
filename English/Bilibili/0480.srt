1
00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:03.491
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.691
After the tears is a yellow sunflower.

3
00:00:05.691 --> 00:00:07.291
A sudden sad tragedy.

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:08.691
No matter how well something is hidden,

5
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:10.391
the sunflower witnesses it all.

6
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:11.791
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:13.391
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:15.491
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:02:03.243 --> 00:02:04.343
Inspector!

10
00:02:04.343 --> 00:02:05.443
Mr. Mouri.

11
00:02:09.243 --> 00:02:14.543
I heard that Ms. Hiroko Inoue was murdered.

12
00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:17.043
Is the victim an acquaintance of yours?

13
00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:20.243
Mr. Takaoka.

14
00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:22.843
I don't know what to say.

15
00:02:22.843 --> 00:02:25.743
I wanted her to lead a happy life from now on.

16
00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:29.343
"Akira Takaoka, age 35" -What a thing to happen at such a time.

17
00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:32.143
I understand how you feel.

18
00:02:32.143 --> 00:02:35.843
Who could've done something as ruthless as this?

19
00:02:42.643 --> 00:02:44.543
And, Inspector.

20
00:02:44.543 --> 00:02:46.443
What is the estimated time of death?

21
00:02:46.443 --> 00:02:48.243
According to the coroner,

22
00:02:48.243 --> 00:02:51.043
it seems to be between 11am to 1pm today.

23
00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:09.243
Sunflower...

24
00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:12.043
Hiroko used to like this flower.

25
00:03:12.043 --> 00:03:15.143
Hey, you saw the culprit, didn't you?

26
00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:16.743
Who was it?

27
00:03:16.743 --> 00:03:19.643
The one that did this to her.

28
00:03:19.643 --> 00:03:21.743
Who the heck was it, anyway?

29
00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:33.543
"Yellow Alibi"

30
00:03:34.643 --> 00:03:38.143
Hiroko used to run a bar called Sunflower.

31
00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:40.743
I used to go there too.

32
00:03:40.743 --> 00:03:42.243
Sunflower?

33
00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:45.743
Yes, she used to say that she liked sunflowers,

34
00:03:45.743 --> 00:03:47.243
because they stand tall facing the sun

35
00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:50.643
and watching them gave her courage.

36
00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:53.243
That's why she said she named her shop after them.

37
00:03:53.243 --> 00:03:54.843
"Bar Sunflower"

38
00:03:54.843 --> 00:03:58.043
I visited the shop yesterday too.

39
00:03:58.043 --> 00:03:59.543
And at that time she said that...

40
00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:01.943
"Hiroko Inoue, age 38" -she finally found happiness.

41
00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:04.843
She really looked so happy.

42
00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:06.443
Cheers...

43
00:04:06.443 --> 00:04:08.343
Finally found happiness?

44
00:04:08.343 --> 00:04:09.543
Yes.

45
00:04:09.543 --> 00:04:12.443
She and Mr. Takaoka...

46
00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:14.143
they're going together.

47
00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:15.943
He worked on directing independent films

48
00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.243
for the past seven years.

49
00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:21.143
But just recently, a large movie company...

50
00:04:21.143 --> 00:04:24.843
asked him to direct a film for them.

51
00:04:24.843 --> 00:04:26.143
Oh...

52
00:04:26.143 --> 00:04:27.543
I think it's going to be a movie featuring the crying sand

53
00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:29.843
that's found on White Sand Beach

54
00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:32.943
in his homeland in Fukushima prefecture.

55
00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:34.943
It seems like he went there by himself last night

56
00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:38.343
to do a preliminary inspection of the filming site.

57
00:04:38.343 --> 00:04:40.843
Believing in his talent

58
00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:42.643
and knowing his day would come,

59
00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:46.043
Hiroko supported him all this time.

60
00:04:46.043 --> 00:04:48.443
"Bar Sunflower"

61
00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:50.343
Her long support during tough times

62
00:04:50.343 --> 00:04:53.143
was just about to be rewarded,

63
00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:56.043
so, I feel so vexed.

64
00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:03.043
Yes, this is Megure.

65
00:05:03.043 --> 00:05:05.943
The old lady at the cigarette shop diagonal to the condo

66
00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:08.343
seems to have been at the shop all day,

67
00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:10.143
but didn't witness anybody going in or out of the condo

68
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.543
before or after the estimated time of death.

69
00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:15.043
Only after that...

70
00:05:15.043 --> 00:05:16.243
an employee from an electric appliance shop

71
00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:18.443
carry a large cardboard box and went into the condo,

72
00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.843
but this was just a while ago

73
00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:24.143
at about 4.30pm.

74
00:05:24.143 --> 00:05:27.343
It doesn't seem to have anything to do with this case.

75
00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:29.543
Please continue asking around.

76
00:05:29.543 --> 00:05:31.743
The one who sitting next to Mr. Takaoka?

77
00:05:31.743 --> 00:05:32.943
His name is Mr. Shu Kizuka.

78
00:05:32.943 --> 00:05:35.243
They are both co-workers at a part-time job.

79
00:05:35.243 --> 00:05:37.143
He found the victim

80
00:05:37.143 --> 00:05:38.843
and called police.

81
00:05:38.843 --> 00:05:42.443
Huh? You mean he's the one who found Ms. Hiroko

82
00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:43.943
and not Mr. Takaoka?

83
00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.043
Yes.

84
00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:47.543
He wants to be a script writer.

85
00:05:47.543 --> 00:05:49.043
"Shu Kizuka, age 35" -Since Mr. Takaoka told him

86
00:05:49.043 --> 00:05:51.143
that he wanted to borrow ideas for his story,

87
00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:54.243
they arranged to meet in this room at 5pm.

88
00:05:54.243 --> 00:05:56.843
He says the door wasn't locked.

89
00:05:57.843 --> 00:05:59.043
Hello.

90
00:05:59.043 --> 00:06:00.343
I'm Kizuka.

91
00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:03.843
Hiroko, is Mr. Takaoka back?

92
00:06:06.643 --> 00:06:08.643
Hiroko...

93
00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:13.443
We got his call and arrived here at 5.20pm.

94
00:06:13.443 --> 00:06:16.243
Mr. Takaoka arrived home a little before that.

95
00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:19.243
He seems to have been caught in a traffic jam on his way here

96
00:06:19.243 --> 00:06:22.643
and arrived 15 minutes after the promised time.

97
00:06:24.443 --> 00:06:26.143
Officer Takagi.

98
00:06:26.143 --> 00:06:28.443
And Mr. Kizuka's alibi?

99
00:06:28.443 --> 00:06:30.643
Yes, I've already confirmed it.

100
00:06:30.643 --> 00:06:32.543
He was at his part time job

101
00:06:32.543 --> 00:06:34.643
at a large electric appliance shop

102
00:06:34.643 --> 00:06:36.643
and from 11am to 1pm,

103
00:06:36.643 --> 00:06:39.943
he was taking out merchandise from the warehouse.

104
00:06:39.943 --> 00:06:41.643
Hey, Mr. Kizuka?

105
00:06:41.643 --> 00:06:43.643
When you got here,

106
00:06:43.643 --> 00:06:46.443
the front door wasn't locked, was it?

107
00:06:46.443 --> 00:06:49.043
That... yeah, that's right.

108
00:06:49.043 --> 00:06:52.843
Then, I wonder if Hiroko forgot to lock the door,

109
00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:55.943
because when a woman are home alone,

110
00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:57.943
wouldn't she normally lock the front door to be safe?

111
00:06:57.943 --> 00:07:00.743
She did often forget to lock the door.

112
00:07:00.743 --> 00:07:03.743
If only I had warned her more strongly,

113
00:07:03.743 --> 00:07:05.343
this wouldn't have had to happen.

114
00:07:05.343 --> 00:07:07.243
"Weekly TV Parlor magazine"

115
00:07:10.543 --> 00:07:13.443
Only stand-up comedy shows are circled in red.

116
00:07:13.443 --> 00:07:15.743
I guess, not to forget?

117
00:07:15.743 --> 00:07:18.543
I wonder if she liked to watch programs like these.

118
00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:19.743
I wonder...

119
00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:21.143
I guess so.

120
00:07:21.143 --> 00:07:22.543
"Neta Battle SP. Big Laugh with Comedian in Studio"

121
00:07:25.843 --> 00:07:27.543
It seems that she was planning to watch

122
00:07:27.543 --> 00:07:29.543
from 3pm to 5pm today too.

123
00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:31.043
Sigh...

124
00:07:31.043 --> 00:07:34.143
She couldn't even watch her favorite program.

125
00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:36.543
Is it just plain robbery?

126
00:07:36.543 --> 00:07:39.043
No, something bothers me.

127
00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:42.143
Inspector!

128
00:07:42.143 --> 00:07:44.543
Oh... how was it?

129
00:07:44.543 --> 00:07:47.243
Here. This...

130
00:07:47.243 --> 00:07:49.243
What's this picture?

131
00:07:49.243 --> 00:07:52.643
I was asking trying to get an alibi for Mr. Takaoka

132
00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:55.843
around the time of the crime which was between 11am to 1pm.

133
00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:58.543
He was in Fukushima with the film crew, wasn't he?

134
00:07:58.543 --> 00:08:00.743
Yes, he was at White Sand Beach.

135
00:08:00.743 --> 00:08:04.243
But, didn't seem to meet anyone there.

136
00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:08.143
I see, you can't get proof of his alibi.

137
00:08:08.143 --> 00:08:12.443
Then he says he took money out at a nearby bank.

138
00:08:12.443 --> 00:08:14.843
So, I confirmed with the White Sand Beach prefectural police

139
00:08:14.843 --> 00:08:17.943
and confirmed it in this picture.

140
00:08:20.043 --> 00:08:22.343
I'm on the monitor of the surveillance camera.

141
00:08:23.443 --> 00:08:25.143
Yes, true.

142
00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:26.843
I usually hate to be taken this way,

143
00:08:26.843 --> 00:08:28.743
because I don't like being watched,

144
00:08:28.743 --> 00:08:31.943
but just this time, I'm grateful to the surveillance camera.

145
00:08:31.943 --> 00:08:35.343
Mr. Takaoka, it's not that I suspect you,

146
00:08:35.343 --> 00:08:38.243
but after went back to the hotel last night,

147
00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:39.943
did you meet anyone?

148
00:08:39.943 --> 00:08:41.543
No, I met no one.

149
00:08:41.543 --> 00:08:43.443
You didn't see anyone?

150
00:08:43.443 --> 00:08:45.643
"Hotel White Sand" -Oh, that's right.

151
00:08:45.643 --> 00:08:48.243
I order room service at night

152
00:08:48.243 --> 00:08:51.043
a little after 12am.

153
00:08:51.043 --> 00:08:56.343
Yes, let me explain what I did yesterday in order.

154
00:08:58.643 --> 00:08:59.943
I usually use this

155
00:08:59.943 --> 00:09:02.043
when making arrangements with the cameramen.

156
00:09:05.843 --> 00:09:08.143
Could it just be a passing robbery?

157
00:09:08.143 --> 00:09:10.443
Something's not right to conclude so.

158
00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:11.543
Sunflower...

159
00:09:16.243 --> 00:09:17.643
I see.

160
00:09:17.643 --> 00:09:20.343
This was what was bothering me.

161
00:09:20.343 --> 00:09:21.843
And...

162
00:09:21.843 --> 00:09:23.443
An empty video case...

163
00:09:26.043 --> 00:09:28.343
Yesterday at sundown, at 5pm,

164
00:09:28.343 --> 00:09:30.943
I parted with Hiroko in front of the shop.

165
00:09:30.943 --> 00:09:32.343
Exactly.

166
00:09:32.343 --> 00:09:35.743
It was the time I went to the shop so.

167
00:09:39.343 --> 00:09:42.543
Conan, don't touch stuff here and there now.

168
00:09:42.543 --> 00:09:43.943
Yes, sir.

169
00:09:45.643 --> 00:09:47.543
This plug probably...

170
00:09:52.443 --> 00:09:54.043
I was interviewed by a newspaper agency

171
00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:58.043
in Fukushima after 10pm.

172
00:09:58.043 --> 00:10:00.143
This is the name card of the journalist

173
00:10:00.143 --> 00:10:01.943
and cameraman back then.

174
00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:06.843
It's not how someone would take off their shoes.

175
00:10:06.843 --> 00:10:08.443
Did the culprit kick it?

176
00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:12.443
Or...

177
00:10:13.943 --> 00:10:15.343
What's this?

178
00:10:16.643 --> 00:10:20.643
I checked out of the hotel the following morning after 8am.

179
00:10:20.643 --> 00:10:21.643
This is...

180
00:10:21.643 --> 00:10:24.343
The tab and receipt.

181
00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:27.943
At 2.17am, you ordered curry.

182
00:10:27.943 --> 00:10:30.243
Mr. Takaoka's signature is on it too.

183
00:10:30.243 --> 00:10:32.343
-Yeah. -In other words...

184
00:10:32.343 --> 00:10:36.343
his alibi in the middle of the night is undoubtedly proven.

185
00:10:41.543 --> 00:10:44.143
So that's the story, after all...

186
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:48.143
Then, I was taken by the surveillance camera of the bank after 12pm.

187
00:10:49.043 --> 00:10:53.043
In other words, Mr. Takaoka didn't leave Fukushima at all

188
00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:56.543
from last night till afternoon today.

189
00:10:56.543 --> 00:10:57.643
No.

190
00:10:57.643 --> 00:10:59.143
Perfect.

191
00:10:59.143 --> 00:11:03.143
It's an alibi so perfect that not even an ant can get through it.

192
00:11:04.743 --> 00:11:07.043
Oh, no, Conan!

193
00:11:07.043 --> 00:11:08.243
Don't touch!

194
00:11:08.243 --> 00:11:09.943
Oh, I'm sorry.

195
00:11:09.943 --> 00:11:11.143
But, it's all as well,

196
00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:14.343
because I had forgotten what Pops told me to do.

197
00:11:14.343 --> 00:11:16.243
He wants you to check this.

198
00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:18.443
Check what?

199
00:11:18.443 --> 00:11:21.143
The contents of Hiroko's bag and her shoes?

200
00:11:21.143 --> 00:11:24.243
Yep. He said that it's important to conclude who the culprit is,

201
00:11:24.243 --> 00:11:27.143
so to do it immediately.

202
00:11:39.652 --> 00:11:42.752
Mr. Mouri, this is what you asked me to get.

203
00:11:42.752 --> 00:11:45.452
Huh? I didn't...

204
00:11:45.452 --> 00:11:48.152
Huh? But, Conan just told me...

205
00:11:48.152 --> 00:11:50.652
Officer Takagi, where have you been?

206
00:11:50.652 --> 00:11:53.252
Prepare an investigation team for me.

207
00:11:53.252 --> 00:11:55.752
Check all the robberies there were in the past

208
00:11:55.752 --> 00:11:57.352
and search for eye-witnesses.

209
00:11:57.352 --> 00:11:58.852
Mr. Takaoka.

210
00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:01.052
I understand how depressed you are,

211
00:12:01.052 --> 00:12:03.152
but for Hiroko's sake too,

212
00:12:03.152 --> 00:12:05.152
please make a splendid film

213
00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:06.952
and get back on your feet again as soon as possible.

214
00:12:10.952 --> 00:12:13.952
Mr. Mouri...

215
00:12:13.952 --> 00:12:17.652
Inspector, thanks to Officer Takagi,

216
00:12:17.652 --> 00:12:19.752
we have found many new facts.

217
00:12:19.752 --> 00:12:20.852
New facts?

218
00:12:20.852 --> 00:12:22.052
Yes.

219
00:12:22.052 --> 00:12:24.352
By the way, Mr. Kizuka.

220
00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:28.252
Will you please look inside the video deck, please?

221
00:12:28.252 --> 00:12:29.552
Huh... okay.

222
00:12:33.152 --> 00:12:35.052
There's a tape in there, isn't there?

223
00:12:35.052 --> 00:12:38.452
-Yes. -Let's see what's recorded on it.

224
00:12:38.452 --> 00:12:42.452
Please rewind it a little and play it.

225
00:12:42.652 --> 00:12:44.952
"Bakuhatsu Konto"

226
00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:48.452
Oh, this is a re-run.

227
00:12:48.452 --> 00:12:52.352
I saw this program about a month ago.

228
00:12:52.352 --> 00:12:53.552
What...

229
00:12:53.552 --> 00:12:56.852
The leg of the chair that was knocked over caught on to the cord

230
00:12:56.852 --> 00:12:59.252
and pulled the plug out of the outlet.

231
00:12:59.252 --> 00:13:03.352
Hmm... most probably when Hiroko struggled with the culprit.

232
00:13:03.352 --> 00:13:06.952
But, then why is the program that was recorded then still there?

233
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:11.352
The culprit didn't know that Hiroko was recording the program.

234
00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:14.352
The video that was cut off is the 2-hour special

235
00:13:14.352 --> 00:13:18.052
about 3/4ths through the program.

236
00:13:18.052 --> 00:13:22.452
It started recording at 3pm and is cut off an hour and a half later.

237
00:13:22.452 --> 00:13:25.752
Which means that the room was ransacked about 4.30pm

238
00:13:25.752 --> 00:13:29.152
and not at the same time she was killed.

239
00:13:29.152 --> 00:13:32.152
The culprit killed Hiroko a little afternoon,

240
00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:35.552
then came back here again at sundown and ransacked the room.

241
00:13:35.552 --> 00:13:37.552
It's not likely, is it?

242
00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:41.252
The culprit killed Hiroko between 11am and 1pm at another place

243
00:13:41.252 --> 00:13:43.752
and after bringing her body here,

244
00:13:43.752 --> 00:13:45.552
ransacked the room

245
00:13:45.552 --> 00:13:49.552
to make it look as if a robbery took place.

246
00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:59.352
Officer Takagi, please show the inspector what you checked on.

247
00:13:59.352 --> 00:14:00.352
Oh, yes.

248
00:14:01.552 --> 00:14:02.852
Inspector, here it is.

249
00:14:04.752 --> 00:14:07.852
Plain sand? Is what it looks like.

250
00:14:07.852 --> 00:14:11.952
This is what was found on the insole of Hiroko's shoes.

251
00:14:11.952 --> 00:14:12.952
What?

252
00:14:15.952 --> 00:14:18.552
Forensics checked on it

253
00:14:18.552 --> 00:14:21.352
and found that it's something called crying sand.

254
00:14:21.352 --> 00:14:22.452
Crying sand?

255
00:14:22.452 --> 00:14:24.852
Yes. It is composed of a lot of quartz

256
00:14:24.852 --> 00:14:28.852
and is valuable sand that is found on unpolluted beaches.

257
00:14:28.852 --> 00:14:31.952
There are 20 places with crying sand throughout the nation,

258
00:14:31.952 --> 00:14:35.752
but one of them is White Sand Beach in Fukushima prefecture.

259
00:14:35.752 --> 00:14:37.452
I would like to also add that it is the place

260
00:14:37.452 --> 00:14:40.852
that Mr. Takaoka was yesterday on location.

261
00:14:40.852 --> 00:14:45.652
Mr. Takaoka, I take it that you called Hiroko last night.

262
00:14:45.652 --> 00:14:46.852
You probably told her something like,

263
00:14:46.852 --> 00:14:51.052
why don't you come to Fukushima because I finished work.

264
00:14:51.052 --> 00:14:52.552
"Hotel White Sand"

265
00:14:54.752 --> 00:14:59.752
So, Hiroko recorded the program she wanted to watch

266
00:14:59.752 --> 00:15:02.852
and headed for Fukushima early this morning.

267
00:15:02.852 --> 00:15:05.352
You made plans to meet her after 12pm.

268
00:15:05.352 --> 00:15:07.452
That's right after your image was taken

269
00:15:07.452 --> 00:15:09.252
by the surveillance camera of the bank.

270
00:15:14.852 --> 00:15:18.552
Hiroko arrived at the beach earlier than you.

271
00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:20.852
After all, it's the beach that is the stage

272
00:15:20.852 --> 00:15:23.752
for the movie her lover is going to be directing.

273
00:15:23.752 --> 00:15:27.252
So, I'm sure she had special feelings dancing inside her.

274
00:15:27.252 --> 00:15:28.352
But...

275
00:15:35.152 --> 00:15:38.652
White Sand Beach is your hometown.

276
00:15:38.652 --> 00:15:42.652
You knew when the place would be empty without people.

277
00:15:45.452 --> 00:15:48.252
Right after that, you drove your car

278
00:15:48.252 --> 00:15:51.652
and rushed over near here to this condo.

279
00:15:51.652 --> 00:15:54.352
You parked your car in an inconspicuous place.

280
00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:57.252
Under the disguise of a deliveryman of an electric appliance store,

281
00:15:57.252 --> 00:15:59.252
you brought the cardboard box with Hiroko's dead body inside

282
00:15:59.252 --> 00:16:02.252
up to this room.

283
00:16:03.952 --> 00:16:05.752
In other words, the electric appliance shop deliveryman

284
00:16:05.752 --> 00:16:08.252
that was witness after 4.30pm was...

285
00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:09.652
Mr. Takaoka.

286
00:16:09.652 --> 00:16:11.552
You disguised yourself using the clothes and cap of the place

287
00:16:11.552 --> 00:16:14.552
where you work part-time for, didn't you?

288
00:16:14.552 --> 00:16:17.852
Mr. Mouri, please stop.

289
00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.652
I've been listening to you silently for a while,

290
00:16:19.652 --> 00:16:22.452
but you're making me sound like I'm the one who killed her.

291
00:16:22.452 --> 00:16:24.052
Huh...

292
00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.152
"Check the car, from Mr. Mouri"

293
00:16:29.152 --> 00:16:30.152
Excuse me.

294
00:16:30.152 --> 00:16:32.052
Hey, Officer Takagi, where are you going?

295
00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:34.852
It seems he just remembered something else

296
00:16:34.852 --> 00:16:36.752
that I asked him to check for me.

297
00:16:36.752 --> 00:16:40.752
Let me continue then.

298
00:16:40.752 --> 00:16:43.052
After carrying Hiroko up here,

299
00:16:43.052 --> 00:16:45.552
you in order to make this place look as if a robber had broken in,

300
00:16:45.552 --> 00:16:48.652
struggled with her and killed her, messed the room up

301
00:16:48.652 --> 00:16:51.652
and thought you successfully carried out your trick of deception.

302
00:16:51.652 --> 00:16:54.552
Then, you got rid of the cardboard box, clothes and cap

303
00:16:54.552 --> 00:16:58.252
that you used to disguise yourself somewhere.

304
00:16:58.252 --> 00:17:00.552
Then finally told probably told Mr. Kizuka that you got caught in traffic

305
00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:05.352
and deliberately appeared later than the time you promised.

306
00:17:05.352 --> 00:17:07.252
Hiroko.

307
00:17:07.252 --> 00:17:09.152
Hiroko!

308
00:17:09.152 --> 00:17:11.852
This is the way you made it look as

309
00:17:11.852 --> 00:17:14.052
if Hiroko was killed in this room

310
00:17:14.052 --> 00:17:18.052
while you were in Fukushima at the time of the crime

311
00:17:18.052 --> 00:17:20.452
and created a fake alibi.

312
00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:21.952
Ridiculous.

313
00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:24.252
Mr. Mouri, your deduction is based on the grounds

314
00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:26.152
that Hiroko was called by me

315
00:17:26.152 --> 00:17:28.152
and came to White Sand Beach

316
00:17:28.152 --> 00:17:32.052
after which I killed her between 11am to 1pm.

317
00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:34.552
You seem to be under the impression that's right.

318
00:17:34.552 --> 00:17:39.252
But, do you have proof that Hiroko actually came to White Sand Beach?

319
00:17:39.252 --> 00:17:40.552
I do.

320
00:17:40.552 --> 00:17:43.752
Inspector, will you please look inside the envelope

321
00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:45.652
that Officer Takagi brought a while ago?

322
00:17:47.352 --> 00:17:48.352
This is...

323
00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:49.452
"Director Debut in Hometown"

324
00:17:49.452 --> 00:17:52.152
This is an article in Fukushima Nippo's morning paper today.

325
00:17:52.152 --> 00:17:55.052
It was probably written at yesterday's interview.

326
00:17:55.052 --> 00:17:59.052
That clipping was in the pocket of Hiroko's bag.

327
00:18:00.452 --> 00:18:03.952
After arriving in Fukushima, Hiroko bought a newspaper

328
00:18:03.952 --> 00:18:08.252
because she knew that you were interviewed yesterday.

329
00:18:08.252 --> 00:18:10.952
Although it is a small article, it was about you.

330
00:18:10.952 --> 00:18:12.452
For Hiroko, it was top news...

331
00:18:12.452 --> 00:18:15.952
more important than any other news.

332
00:18:15.952 --> 00:18:18.752
The support she gave you all this time everything was worthwhile.

333
00:18:18.752 --> 00:18:21.252
The time when her efforts were to be rewarded has come.

334
00:18:21.252 --> 00:18:23.252
I'm sure she put the precious article in her bag

335
00:18:23.252 --> 00:18:25.052
with a dancing heart thinking the bud has finally bloomed.

336
00:18:25.052 --> 00:18:30.052
A large sunflower has grown.

337
00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:32.452
No, you're wrong. Hiroko never came!

338
00:18:32.452 --> 00:18:35.852
I bought the newspaper.

339
00:18:35.852 --> 00:18:39.152
And I cut it out and put it in her bag.

340
00:18:39.152 --> 00:18:40.852
Mr. Takaoka.

341
00:18:40.852 --> 00:18:42.652
Have you ever taken a good look

342
00:18:42.652 --> 00:18:46.352
at the words written on the wall panel?

343
00:18:46.352 --> 00:18:48.852
Watching only you.

344
00:18:48.852 --> 00:18:51.652
It seems to be the feeling that the sunflower symbolizes.

345
00:18:51.652 --> 00:18:54.552
It meant everything to Hiroko.

346
00:18:54.552 --> 00:18:57.352
Mr. Takaoka, shouldn't you admit to your crime

347
00:18:57.352 --> 00:18:58.952
and atone for the wrong you did?

348
00:19:00.252 --> 00:19:01.652
That's absurd!

349
00:19:01.652 --> 00:19:03.952
I didn't kill Hiroko!

350
00:19:08.452 --> 00:19:11.052
Oh, Officer Takagi, how was it?

351
00:19:11.052 --> 00:19:12.752
Yes, what?

352
00:19:14.352 --> 00:19:15.352
Huh?

353
00:19:16.552 --> 00:19:17.852
Inspector, please take a look.

354
00:19:17.852 --> 00:19:20.152
I'm sending you the image.

355
00:19:20.152 --> 00:19:21.752
It seems to be sand.

356
00:19:21.752 --> 00:19:23.652
Yeah, white sand...

357
00:19:23.652 --> 00:19:24.952
It's a lie.

358
00:19:24.952 --> 00:19:26.852
There's no way something like that would be there.

359
00:19:26.852 --> 00:19:28.152
Because I've made sure the blanket...

360
00:19:30.052 --> 00:19:33.652
The blanket... what about it?

361
00:19:33.652 --> 00:19:35.652
Shook all the sand off the blanket?

362
00:19:35.652 --> 00:19:38.652
Although a very slight amount, there's some left under the blanket.

363
00:19:38.652 --> 00:19:43.652
Mr. Takaoka, I'm sure that the sand is crying sand.

364
00:19:43.652 --> 00:19:45.352
Will you please explain?

365
00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:49.052
Why was crying sand found in the trunk of your car?

366
00:19:50.552 --> 00:19:52.152
You're still talking like that?

367
00:19:52.152 --> 00:19:54.952
You really want to end our relationship?

368
00:19:54.952 --> 00:19:57.752
Just because a little luck seems to have turned your way,

369
00:19:57.752 --> 00:20:00.252
don't say such things so easily.

370
00:20:00.252 --> 00:20:02.252
I feel bad.

371
00:20:02.252 --> 00:20:04.152
You've gotta be kidding.

372
00:20:04.152 --> 00:20:07.952
How much do you think I devoted myself to you?

373
00:20:07.952 --> 00:20:10.852
Next it's your turn to look after me.

374
00:20:10.852 --> 00:20:14.852
You're spending your entire life paying me back.

375
00:20:16.652 --> 00:20:19.652
I found a spare key inside Hiroko's bag,

376
00:20:19.652 --> 00:20:22.052
so I borrowed it.

377
00:20:22.052 --> 00:20:27.952
I found out that Hiroko intended to depend on me for life.

378
00:20:27.952 --> 00:20:31.052
I didn't want her to swallow my whole life.

379
00:20:31.052 --> 00:20:34.652
I wanted to protect my freedom.

380
00:20:34.652 --> 00:20:36.452
However, Mr. Mouri,

381
00:20:36.452 --> 00:20:38.852
your intuition sure is sharp.

382
00:20:38.852 --> 00:20:41.952
You saw through my trick by a fluke.

383
00:20:41.952 --> 00:20:43.252
Mr. Takaoka.

384
00:20:43.252 --> 00:20:46.852
When you saw that potted sunflower knocked down on the floor,

385
00:20:46.852 --> 00:20:49.152
didn't you feel something?

386
00:20:50.652 --> 00:20:53.252
I don't know how it was in Fukushima,

387
00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.852
but this town was clear and sunny

388
00:20:54.852 --> 00:20:56.552
with not a cloud in sight.

389
00:20:57.752 --> 00:20:58.952
What about it?

390
00:20:58.952 --> 00:21:01.552
This room faces south.

391
00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:03.752
Moroever, the curtain has been torn apart

392
00:21:03.752 --> 00:21:06.252
and there is nothing to shut the light out.

393
00:21:06.252 --> 00:21:08.152
If that potted plant was knocked over

394
00:21:08.152 --> 00:21:12.852
between the estimated time of her death which was 11am to 1pm,

395
00:21:12.852 --> 00:21:15.652
the sunflower would've been exposed to a lot of sunshine

396
00:21:15.652 --> 00:21:20.152
until you found Hiroko at 5pm.

397
00:21:20.152 --> 00:21:24.652
For the sunflower, sunshine is the energy to make it bloom.

398
00:21:24.652 --> 00:21:26.752
Most naturally the flower...

399
00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:28.552
However...

400
00:21:29.752 --> 00:21:31.552
The flower is face down.

401
00:21:31.552 --> 00:21:33.052
From all the facts so far,

402
00:21:33.052 --> 00:21:36.352
we can deduce that the potted plant was knocked down at a later time.

403
00:21:36.352 --> 00:21:38.952
That is, right before the dead body was found.

404
00:21:38.952 --> 00:21:43.252
As a result of re-checking everything from that point of view.

405
00:21:43.252 --> 00:21:45.252
I see, I understand.

406
00:21:45.252 --> 00:21:48.152
But, Mr. Mouri, there is just one mistake.

407
00:21:49.552 --> 00:21:52.452
It was when everything was completed and I was ready to leave.

408
00:21:52.452 --> 00:21:54.152
That sunflower...

409
00:22:00.752 --> 00:22:05.352
Maybe something made the soil inside become lopsided.

410
00:22:05.352 --> 00:22:08.752
I didn't touch it at all.

411
00:23:38.552 --> 00:23:42.252
"The Mouri Detective Agency" -Well, I guess he said so, but...

412
00:23:42.252 --> 00:23:43.352
But, I think it was you.

413
00:23:43.352 --> 00:23:45.952
You fell down from the stand to disclose the truth.

414
00:23:45.952 --> 00:23:49.052
Right, Hiroko avenged her death.

415
00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:52.852
Does Pops have a guest or something?

416
00:23:52.852 --> 00:23:56.852
Hey, I really think so, but how about you?

417
00:23:59.452 --> 00:24:04.052
He's talking seriously to the sunflower.

418
00:24:04.052 --> 00:24:06.252
"Next Episode" -But, it's strange.

419
00:24:06.252 --> 00:24:07.952
There are no other lights around,

420
00:24:07.952 --> 00:24:10.852
so that house is probably the only house around.

421
00:24:10.852 --> 00:24:14.352
Only one large house like that around here?

422
00:24:15.752 --> 00:24:18.852
Who are you people and what are you doing there?

423
00:24:18.852 --> 00:24:21.652
Who, and why at this hour of the night

424
00:24:21.652 --> 00:24:23.252
with what type of sharp object did this to her?

425
00:24:24.352 --> 00:24:26.652
The mountain crone's knife...

426
00:24:26.652 --> 00:24:28.652
Don't tell me that...

427
00:24:28.652 --> 00:24:30.052
Next Conan!

428
00:24:30.052 --> 00:24:34.052
"The Knife of the Mountain Crone Part One"

429
00:24:49.852 --> 00:24:52.452
Next Conan's Hint:

430
00:24:52.452 --> 00:24:54.052
Kitchen Knife.

431
00:24:54.052 --> 00:24:55.952
The next episode is a difficult case involving a mountain crone.

432
00:24:55.952 --> 00:24:57.052
Yama's making an appearance.

433
00:24:57.052 --> 00:24:58.852
Oh, that klutzy police detective.
