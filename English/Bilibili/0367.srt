1
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,040
Today's stage is also at the breakwater.

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,740
The place was in such clear view and conspicuous.

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,540
The trick and the culprit, we'all catch them both!

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,040
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,840
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,425
Hey, Ejiri?

8
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:58,625
Get a hold of yourself! Snap out of it!

9
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:02,025
His lips are turning purple,

10
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:04,325
cyanosis is starting.

11
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,925
This is proof that he cannot breathe as he should.

12
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:12,025
Still I can feel his pulse by touch,

13
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:14,925
and his heart is beating quite okay,

14
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,925
which means possible brain damage

15
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:20,925
or neurotoxic poisoning!

16
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:27,325
Artificial respiration!

17
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,425
We've got to take this man on the ship

18
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,825
and head him off to the hospital!

19
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,725
Hang in there, okay, Ejiri?

20
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:34,925
Hurry!

21
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,925
Dear!

22
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,325
Don't move!

23
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:47,825
It's extremely likely that he was poisoned!

24
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,625
And the one who poisoned him

25
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,925
is possibly someone who is here at the breakwater!

26
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,425
Until the police get here,

27
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:03,025
don't touch anything and stay still!

28
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:04,925
What's up?

29
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,025
Who are you, sonny?

30
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:10,825
Conan Edogawa.

31
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:12,225
A detective.

32
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:19,225
"Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier (Part 2)"

33
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:23,125
First,

34
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,925
let's start with hearing about how you are all connected with each other.

35
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:27,525
"Kiriko Shirane (38), Mineto Kanetani (39)" -All of us

36
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:31,125
belonged to the same fishing club since our university days.

37
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,625
Including Ejiri, who was carried off a while ago too.

38
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,825
Do you come to fish at this breakwater frequently?

39
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:38,825
Yeah.

40
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:42,025
"Iwao Ida (39)" -On board the ship of the fisherman Ida.

41
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:46,425
Which means all of you know each other quite well from some time back.

42
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,925
Yes, especially Ida and I

43
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:50,625
because our parents who are fishermen also know each other well.

44
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,625
We've known each other since we were kids.

45
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,325
I see! You were saying that you're the daughter of a fisherman.

46
00:03:56,325 --> 00:04:00,125
Yeah, she's really knowledgeable about fish

47
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,125
and was really popular with men in the club too.

48
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,725
Moreover, she's a good cook and a beauty.

49
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:07,225
She was the Madonna of the fishing club.

50
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:09,225
Please cut it out, Kanetani.

51
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:11,125
Let's not talk about something so long in the past.

52
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,725
Is that why someone attempted to kill Mr. Ejiri?

53
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:18,725
Because Ms. Shirane was taken away by Mr. Ejiri.

54
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,325
What are you talking about?

55
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,525
Just a while ago,

56
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:23,525
when Ms. Shirane was about to run over to him,

57
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,525
she called him "dear".

58
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:29,825
Unless they have an intimate relationship,

59
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:32,225
she wouldn't be calling him that way, would she?

60
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,625
Then, the perp is the one

61
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,325
who had to go through a broken heart and held a grudge against him.

62
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:38,725
Mr. Kanetani! You did it, didn't you?

63
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:43,025
Don't be ridiculous!

64
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,825
Besides if that was my motive,

65
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:48,125
the fisherman Ida would also come up as a suspect.

66
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,125
What? Mr. Ida?

67
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,225
Because Ida was Shirane's fiance.

68
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,125
Fiance?

69
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,425
Besides, that's not possible.

70
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,325
Why not?

71
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:05,225
Because Ejiri and I got a divorce three years ago.

72
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,925
Huh? Why?

73
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:08,825
Well, a lot of things were involved.

74
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,725
But the fact that we both like fishing hasn't changed.

75
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:12,825
So on holidays or on our day off,

76
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:15,125
we invite Kanetani and come fishing together.

77
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,225
And? You always made everyone's lunch?

78
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:22,825
See, this lunch that Ejiri ate.

79
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:26,225
The size of the lunch box and the handkerchief it's wrapped in

80
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:30,925
is the same as the one Mr. Kanetani got from Ms. Shirane.

81
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:33,925
It's true that it looks just like Mr. Kanetani's lunch.

82
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:36,125
Don't tell me that the lunch was poisoned.

83
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:39,725
No way! I would never do something like that!

84
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:43,125
Besides, as far as that lunch is concerned,

85
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,425
I got it from Shirane on our way to the breakwater

86
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,825
and I gave it directly to Ejiri.

87
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:51,525
The lunch boxes are exactly alike and nobody knows who'll get it.

88
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:54,725
How can poison be put in something like that?

89
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:56,025
That's true.

90
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,625
The pole stand is in the water?

91
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:04,225
This is one of the two that Mr. Ejiri had erected.

92
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:08,225
The other pole stand is still standing okay, and yet why?

93
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,525
This case sure is hard to grasp.

94
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:25,025
Maybe the poison was smeared on the hook and swung around?

95
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:28,025
I see, the way they do in lure fishing.

96
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:29,525
That can't be.

97
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,225
Besides, it would be to difficult to pinpoint the part

98
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,925
where the skin is exposed in one fling.

99
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,325
If it works, it's just mere chance!

100
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:38,325
And if the poisoned hook is soaked in water for some time,

101
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:40,325
the poison would drift off.

102
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,625
So, the lunch was poisoned after all.

103
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,525
No, it's very unlikely.

104
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:49,125
If poison were to be in something that was chewed on,

105
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:53,525
I would've been poisoned too because I performed artificial respiration.

106
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:54,625
I see!

107
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:59,225
Which means that you knew he wasn't poisoned from the mouth.

108
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:04,825
No. I can't figure out where the poison was inserted.

109
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:08,625
And all I knew back then was that I had to perform artificial respiration

110
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,925
or he would've died there.

111
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:18,025
Hey, you!

112
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:20,725
Can't this ship go any faster?

113
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,625
Please stop rushing, officer.

114
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,525
What's this smell?

115
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,625
Hey, isn't smoke coming out?

116
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,825
Well, you're the one who keeps telling me to go faster!

117
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,325
The police sure are late.

118
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,625
They sure are. Well, I guess everything'll be okay!

119
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:41,225
The culprit is one of the two anyway!

120
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,825
As long as we keep are eyes on them.

121
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:47,525
Right, the fisherman wasn't here with us all this time so.

122
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:50,225
You can't be too sure.

123
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:52,225
If he made Mr. Ejiri drink some sleeping drug

124
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:57,025
with delayed effect beforehand.

125
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:59,325
When he came to pick us up,

126
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:02,725
he could've gone up to Mr. Ejiri to check out what was wrong

127
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:05,025
and poke him with a poison needle then.

128
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,525
Hey, wait!

129
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:10,625
You mean you let a possible killer and Dr. Agasa go together?

130
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,925
Yeah. There was no other way to save Mr. Ejiri's life.

131
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,425
I did give Dr. Agasa the tranquilizer gun though,

132
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:20,125
just in case something comes up.

133
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,925
Besides, if anything happens, Dr. Agasa 's going to call...

134
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,725
The phone?

135
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,225
Hello, Dr. Agasa?

136
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,625
-Hello... -Oh, Shinichi!

137
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,525
I just got Mr. Ejiri on the ambulance now!

138
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,125
And, how is he?

139
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,925
It's hard to say yet.

140
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,325
The type of poison hasn't been specified either.

141
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:44,725
Maybe if a doctor were to examine his left wrist

142
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,525
the type of poison may be specified.

143
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:48,725
Left wrist?

144
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:49,825
Right!

145
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:51,925
Although it was hidden with his sleeve,

146
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:55,725
there were traces of scratches there.

147
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:58,725
I'm sure that's how he was poisoned.

148
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:03,525
Incidentally, there was something that looked like glue on the sleeve!

149
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,725
Glue? You mean the plastic type?

150
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:10,125
Yeah. That stuff is not used for fishing, so isn't it odd?

151
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,425
Well, I'll give you the details when I get there.

152
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:14,625
Later, then.

153
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,025
Hey, Dr. Agasa.

154
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,325
Glue.

155
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,425
What did Dr. Agasa say?

156
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,625
He said he got Mr. Ejiri on an ambulance

157
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,825
so he's coming back here!

158
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:27,625
-That's great! -I guess everything's okay for now.

159
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,825
I wonder who the culprit is though?

160
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:34,725
He taught me how to put bait on my hook.

161
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,225
And, the lady, see!

162
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:39,825
She picked this bobber that got drifted away up for me.

163
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,825
She said she saw it floating in the water

164
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:45,325
so she picked it up with a net.

165
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,525
The fisherman seems to have taken Mr. Ejiri

166
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:52,125
to where the ambulance came to pick him up too.

167
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,625
At first, he seemed to be looking down on us because we're kids, but...

168
00:09:56,625 --> 00:10:00,025
You mean when he told you not to make too much noise?

169
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,225
Yes. We may be kids,

170
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:03,625
but we won't dance or carrying around portable shrines

171
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,525
in a place like this!

172
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:06,725
Right?

173
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:08,225
Dancing and carrying portable shrines?

174
00:10:08,225 --> 00:10:11,825
Hey. Tell me exactly what the fisherman said.

175
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:13,025
Let me think...

176
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,325
He said, don't make too much noise

177
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:17,325
and start an "Omatsuri" (Omatsuri means festival) with your friends!

178
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,725
I told him we won't start an "Omatsuri",

179
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:24,625
then he said, go ask the other people.

180
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,525
No. "Omatsuri" is fishing terminology...

181
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:32,325
Bobber, glue and "omatsuri".

182
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:35,025
I see. So, that's it!

183
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,225
Conan?

184
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:39,325
Don't tell me you've figured out who the culprit is!

185
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:40,725
Yeah. I figured out

186
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:44,725
who was trying to fish Mr. Ejiri's life with a poison hook

187
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:47,425
as well as the way it was done!

188
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,688
Sea bream! This is sea bream for sure!

189
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:02,888
Okay, all of you, enough for the detective thing already, right?

190
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:03,888
No!

191
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:07,088
You're saying that so that you can hide the evidence, right?

192
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:11,488
Listen. It's true that Ejiri didn't look all that great.

193
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:15,688
But we're not even sure if he was really poisoned or not yet, you know?

194
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:16,788
In the first place,

195
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:19,788
Ida, who took Ejiri to where the ambulance,

196
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:21,888
is a suspect too, right?

197
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,688
If he's the one,

198
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:27,788
then the evidence would've been disposed in the sea long time ago.

199
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,488
I guess so, but...

200
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,688
That's no problem

201
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:33,688
because Dr. Agasa who went with him, is keeping an eye on him.

202
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:36,988
Moreover, the possibility of Mr. Ida being the culprit

203
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,488
has drastically decreased.

204
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:42,388
Now that we know he safely took Mr. Ejiri to the ambulance

205
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:46,688
and is heading back this way with Dr. Agasa again.

206
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:49,788
Is that right, Conan?

207
00:11:49,788 --> 00:11:50,788
Remember what I said?

208
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:52,888
If Mr. Ida were the culprit,

209
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:56,688
he would've had to run over to Mr. Ejiri that he put to sleep beforehand

210
00:11:56,688 --> 00:11:59,388
and poke a poison needle into him.

211
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:02,388
The poison that was used is probably neurotoxic poison.

212
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,088
He would have difficulty breathing but he would be conscious.

213
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:09,088
If someone poked a poison needle into him, he would know who it was.

214
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:13,388
The culprit would never rush such a person to the hospital, right?

215
00:12:13,388 --> 00:12:16,088
Even if he would've done so, not to be suspected,

216
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,588
he would've fled off somewhere already.

217
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:21,688
Because when the poison wears off and Mr. Ejiri is able to talk,

218
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,888
the culprit would be revealed.

219
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:25,088
I see.

220
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:30,488
So that means the culprit has to be either Ms. Shirane or Mr. Kanetani.

221
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,688
Hey, how long is it going to take you to make repairs?

222
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:40,488
Please don't rush me like that, officer!

223
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:45,188
Darn it. We still have no idea what kind of case it is, and yet...

224
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:50,288
Are you saying either one of us is the one who poisoned Ejiri?

225
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:52,588
Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:57,288
It's true that we were fishing on both side of Ejiri,

227
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:00,988
but he was fishing on the tip of the tetra pod,

228
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,688
so he more than 10 m away from us.

229
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:07,588
How could we have poisoned him?

230
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,188
"Omatsuri".

231
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,388
"Omatsuri"?

232
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:13,088
"Omatsuri" is a fishing terminology

233
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:16,688
that is used when two lines get tangled with each other.

234
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:19,588
You know what to do when that happens, right?

235
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:22,288
I see! The culprit took advantage of him wanting to untangle his line,

236
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:25,788
in which he would bring his fish hook near his hand!

237
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:28,788
So, the comment of the fisherman...

238
00:13:28,788 --> 00:13:29,788
Don't make too much noise

239
00:13:29,788 --> 00:13:31,688
and start an "Omatsuri" (festival) with your friends.

240
00:13:31,688 --> 00:13:34,888
was not an insulting remark at all.

241
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,888
Right. The culprit deliberately

242
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:40,488
got the fishing line tangled with Mr. Ejiri's.

243
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:42,588
And, when Mr. Ejiri tried to untangle the line,

244
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,288
it's slightly pulled on

245
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:47,788
and the poisoned hook would sink into Mr. Ejiri's hand!

246
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:50,288
But, you did also say that

247
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,388
if the hook smeared with poison is soaked in the water for some time,

248
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,788
the poison would dissolve.

249
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:58,288
Yeah... If the poison was just smeared on to the hook,

250
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:01,088
then the poison would dissolve,

251
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:03,688
but it's a different story if glue is used.

252
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:05,388
-Glue? -Glue?

253
00:14:05,388 --> 00:14:07,788
Yeah. If poison is mixed into the glue

254
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,288
and then smeared onto the hook and dried hard.

255
00:14:09,288 --> 00:14:13,488
It would start to dissolve when soaked in salt water

256
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:16,488
and by the time it gets tangled with Mr. Ejiri's line.

257
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,188
It would be gooey and just right for use.

258
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:21,488
As proof of this,

259
00:14:21,488 --> 00:14:25,088
Dr. Agasa just told me on the phone that

260
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:28,088
there was glue on the left sleeve of Mr. Ejiri's shirt.

261
00:14:28,088 --> 00:14:29,488
He also mentioned that

262
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:33,988
there were traces of scratch marks on Mr. Ejiri's left wrist!

263
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:39,088
That's probably why Mr. Ejiri's pole stand was in the water too.

264
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,488
His pole stand?

265
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:46,688
Yeah. When the fishing line was pulled to sink the poison hook in,

266
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:50,788
the pole stand was pulled too and fell into the water as well.

267
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,088
But, can you really do something like

268
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:57,288
deliberately getting your own line tangled with somebody else's.

269
00:14:57,288 --> 00:14:58,588
Of course you can!

270
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:02,888
You use a lot of hooks with poison smeared on them and use light sinkers.

271
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:05,888
Then you let it drift along to the flow of the current

272
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:07,988
and it gets tangled super easily.

273
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:11,188
If the poisoned hook is a fly hook,

274
00:15:11,188 --> 00:15:12,788
when it is pulled up,

275
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,888
even if there were to be many hooks attached to it,

276
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:17,488
nothing strange would be thought of it!

277
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:18,588
I see.

278
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:22,188
And? Which of them did that?

279
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:23,188
I just said, didn't I?

280
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,088
That the line was tangled using the flow of the current, right?

281
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:30,188
Remember she picked up your bobber that drifted away, Ayumi?

282
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:32,588
Yes! She did.

283
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:35,188
In other words, if Ms. Shirane, who was on the right edge,

284
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,788
picked up your bobber,

285
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:39,388
the flow of the current was from left to right.

286
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:43,688
And if the culprit took advantage of the flow of the current.

287
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:47,088
Right, the one who was fishing between Mr. Ejiri and all of us.

288
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:49,188
Mr. Kanetani!

289
00:15:49,188 --> 00:15:51,388
You're the one who did it, right?

290
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:54,988
Wait... Is that true, Kanetani?

291
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:59,288
No way. No need to take what kids say all that seriously.

292
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,688
Besides, what makes you think I'd do something like that

293
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:04,288
at a breakwater like this?

294
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:05,688
I mean there're only so many of us

295
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:07,688
and the possibility of becoming a suspect is so high.

296
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:11,988
No. The suspects were narrowed down merely because of coincidence.

297
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:15,088
Back then, if the fish didn't bite his line,

298
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:18,188
we won't go over thinking that it's strange that he showed no reaction.

299
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:21,688
If he was left as he is, time would just pass by,

300
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:27,588
the estimated time of death would've been expanded

301
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,288
and there would've been a lot more suspects.

302
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,988
And you're the very one who said that

303
00:16:31,988 --> 00:16:33,988
you wanted to change fishing spots because no fish were biting.

304
00:16:33,988 --> 00:16:35,188
I see.

305
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:37,788
So, Mr. Ejiri who said that he wanted to stick it out here till night,

306
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,288
would've been left behind alone.

307
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:41,888
And if everyone else moves to a new fishing spot,

308
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:43,688
it could've been made to look as if someone came along in a boat

309
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:47,588
and poisoned Mr. Ejiri who was fishing all by himself.

310
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:51,288
Yeah. Besides, there are many people here that would testify that

311
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:54,888
Mr. Kanetani never once went near Mr. Ejiri too.

312
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,188
But if the hook poked him, he would at least let out a cry.

313
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:01,488
So, you set the timing for when to hook it on, right?

314
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,088
That is, to the sound of the ship that came to pick us up.

315
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,888
Oh, Dr. Agasa!

316
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:08,888
I see!

317
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:10,688
He erased the sound of the scream of pain

318
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:12,688
when being poked with the sound of the of the ship!

319
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:14,288
Moreover, the direction the ship came

320
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:16,688
from was opposite the direction that everyone was fishing.

321
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,988
Everybody attention would be distracted from Mr. Ejiri,

322
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:21,688
so it would be like killing two birds with one stone.

323
00:17:21,688 --> 00:17:25,088
But, sonny, you don't even have proof.

324
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,488
This pole of yours is the evidence.

325
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,488
The bobber is sunk

326
00:17:29,488 --> 00:17:31,688
so it should still be there.

327
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:37,688
Mr. Ejiri's pole that got tangled with your terminal tackle!

328
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:43,288
The glue that was mixed with poison probably almost completely dissolved.

329
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:45,788
But, that would not dissolve so easily.

330
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:50,788
Mr. Ejiri's blood that is on the hook that scratched him.

331
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,788
Kanetani.

332
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:58,188
Kanetani, may I ask why you did it?

333
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,888
Why would you want to kill him?

334
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:04,088
We just went drinking the other day all three of us together, didn't we?

335
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:08,588
The reason is his remark when we went drinking.

336
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,988
When you left the seat,

337
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:15,188
I asked him why you both got a divorce.

338
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,788
What? A lover?

339
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:21,488
Yeah. I just started a new business back then

340
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:23,988
and I was going through a lot of stress.

341
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:29,588
She found out that I was having an affair and left me.

342
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,588
He said that?

343
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:35,188
Yeah. I had no intention of saying anything

344
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:38,588
about the fact that he got a divorce of had a lover,

345
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:43,688
but I just couldn't forget what he said after all that.

346
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:46,988
Well, I guess in the end, be it a company, fish or women,

347
00:18:46,988 --> 00:18:49,788
the best part is when they are alive and kicking.

348
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,588
Don't tell her this, okay?

349
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,788
Yeah, it was like he had shattered the dream of my younger days.

350
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:58,688
I just couldn't take it in.

351
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:01,988
Because you were really our Madonna.

352
00:19:01,988 --> 00:19:03,188
Don't be silly.

353
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:07,588
He divorced me for my sake.

354
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:08,588
What?

355
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:12,788
Back then, his company was on the verge of bankruptcy.

356
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:17,188
And he couldn't save his employees unless he started a new business.

357
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:21,088
But, in order to do so, he had to take on an enormous amount of debt.

358
00:19:21,088 --> 00:19:24,888
He got on his hands and knees begging me to divorce him.

359
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:26,988
He begged me saying that if the new business fails,

360
00:19:26,988 --> 00:19:31,288
I'd end up having to face the collectors too.

361
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:34,788
I wanted to overcome the situation as husband and wife.

362
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:38,488
But since his stubborn and not too strong taking on pressure.

363
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:43,788
And as for me, I wanted to continue my job as a cuisine essayist I agreed.

364
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:48,788
So, that thing about a lover is a story he made up to put on a front.

365
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,288
I don't like that comment

366
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:53,488
he made of women who are alive and kicking though.

367
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:56,188
No, there's no need to get angry.

368
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:57,388
Because he was referring to you,

369
00:19:57,388 --> 00:20:00,788
when he said women who are alive and kicking.

370
00:20:00,788 --> 00:20:03,188
While sailing on the swaying boat,

371
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:06,088
Mr. Ejiri kept repeating to himself over and over again.

372
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,688
A fish that is truly alive and kicking

373
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:10,688
is one that can freely swim through the ocean.

374
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:14,388
He asked me if I thought so too.

375
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:15,388
What an idiot.

376
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:20,488
Oh, my God. What on earth have I done?

377
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:24,588
Don't worry! He seems to have recovered quite a bit already.

378
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:30,188
I got a call from Ejiri, who sounded okay.

379
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,388
He asked me to relay a message to you.

380
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:38,188
He said for you to get super fresh fish for her today.

381
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:40,488
If you do, he says he'll forget what happened today.

382
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:41,688
He said he would tell the hospital and police that

383
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:45,288
he was poisoned by a pufferfish that he cooked and ate on his own,

384
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:48,288
so to not come back until you get big catch.

385
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,288
Is today a special day or something?

386
00:20:51,288 --> 00:20:55,388
Oh, my? Come to think of it, today is our wedding anniversary.

387
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,488
Your anniversary? If I'm not mistaken today is...

388
00:20:58,488 --> 00:21:01,088
Don't tell me you forgot?

389
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:04,188
Happy Birthday, Dr. Agasa!

390
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:07,088
Kojima, which means that you were trying to...

391
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:10,788
Yeah, fish something for Dr. Agasa's birthday present!

392
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:13,288
No, Genta! Don't say a word about it!

393
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,088
We've been keeping it a secret from Ai too

394
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:17,388
so that we could throw a surprise party.

395
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:19,188
Oh, sorry...

396
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:21,688
I see. That's why these children

397
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:24,888
were planning to have a curry party at my house tonight.

398
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:26,788
Thank you all so much.

399
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:27,888
Don't cry.

400
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,388
I was trying to fish you a sea bream

401
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,388
but ended up fishing some odd black fish.

402
00:21:32,388 --> 00:21:34,788
Hey. Isn't this is black sea bream?

403
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:35,888
Black sea bream?

404
00:21:35,888 --> 00:21:38,788
The King of breakwater fishing, black sea bream!

405
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:40,288
It's an expensive fish!

406
00:21:40,288 --> 00:21:41,788
Incredible!

407
00:21:41,788 --> 00:21:44,788
-It's too much for Dr. Agasa, then. -I'd love to eat it.

408
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:48,388
So now it's your turn, Kanetani!

409
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:52,888
Get me a big one that is just as good as the one he fished, okay?

410
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:55,288
Because I've got to show him that.

411
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:59,488
That even if fish are caught, good fish is good.

412
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:33,088
Well, although there were an array of odd occurrences,

413
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:36,488
wasn't coming to the ocean a good idea?

414
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:37,988
Yes.

415
00:23:37,988 --> 00:23:40,388
Now I understand how fish feel.

416
00:23:40,388 --> 00:23:42,688
Just what do you mean by that?

417
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:47,088
The body temperature of humans is too warm for the fish.

418
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:51,288
Right, it's too warm for me too

419
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:52,988
that I feel as if I'm going to get burned.

420
00:23:55,288 --> 00:23:58,088
Hey, hey, it's still not repaired?

421
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:03,588
"Next Episode"

422
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,888
Hey... No way!

423
00:24:13,388 --> 00:24:15,488
So she was being used.

424
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,288
But you're not having it your way!

425
00:24:21,488 --> 00:24:23,488
I want to run away.

426
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:29,676
Next Conan, "The Witch in a Candy House"

427
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:32,815
Next Conan's Hint:

428
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,715
"Chocolate cake"

429
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:36,815
The next episode is an one hour special that takes place in Osaka.

430
00:24:36,815 --> 00:24:39,315
You've sure got a lot of things happening around you, Kudo.
