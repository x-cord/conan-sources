I'm your partner at all times!

3
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:06.499
The whereabouts of Ms. Kobayashi is not known?

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:08.899
1st grade class B, let's all go to do a grand search!

5
00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.199
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:11.899
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.099
His name is Detective Conan!

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.000
It's started to really rain hard after all.

10
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.300
Bummers, rain.

11
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.700
We were supposed to play dodge ball fifth period.

12
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.800
But I guess it's cancelled.

13
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.300
No way! And I was looking forward to playing!

14
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.400
Then what're we going to do on the fifth period?

15
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.000
Beats me.

16
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.500
We already finished funfest last week.

17
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.800
Then, maybe it'll be reading time?

18
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.600
That's boring.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900
Okay.

21
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.100
Done.

22
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.800

Do you all have a pencil with you?

26
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.200
Make sure you write kanji in the correct order!

27
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.600
Geez.

28
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.900
Honestly, give me a break.

29
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100
No, Conan.

30
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.600
Listen, Conan.

31
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.400
The order in which to write the kanji character woman is

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.200
first write the shape "ku" then "no" and finally "ichi"!

33
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.400
Yeah...

34
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.100
Oh, no!

35
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.300
I forgot to bring my eraser!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.100
Here.

Use mine. She says.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.800
I'm sorry!

Haibara, you're gonna get it.

43
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.500
Oh? Is something wrong, Conan?

44
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.000
Ms. Kobayashi!

45
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.300
Yes?

46
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.500
There's a student that's not writing anything at all!

47
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.600
What's the matter, Sakamoto?

48
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.300
Do you feel sick or something?

49
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.600
No.

50
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.100
The tips of all my pencils broke off.

51
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.500
So I can't write even if I want to.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.500
Didn't you bring a pencil sharpener with you?

53
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.100
I forgot.

54
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.100
Then why don't you borrow one from somebody.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.000

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.100
-What? -Come, now.

Thank you.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.000
From next time if you are in a fix, let's not worry on our own,

61
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and discuss the problem with everybody, okay?

62
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.100
Yes.

63
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.100

Genta.

69
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.300
Please leave the classroom open at recess after lunchtime.

70
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.800
In the meantime,

71
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.400
I will have to meet someone here.

72
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.000
We can't stay in the classroom, no matter what?

73
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.100
That person is very shy so...

75
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.800
Okay, lunchtime.

76
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.000
Yes...

77
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.500
"Library" -I wonder what it is.

78
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.900
Ms. Kobayashi's wink.

79
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.600
She's surely hiding something.

80
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.000
What's this?

81
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
That's our classroom, isn't it?

82
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.300
I wonder what's come up.

83
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.000
Did something happen?

84
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.200
Bad news!

85
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.600
Ms. Kobayashi...

86
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.900
"I will be taking care of Ms. Kobayashi."

87
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.500
"Can you figure out where she is?"

88
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.000
"From the fiend with 200 faces."

89
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.600
The fiend...

90
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.600
With 200 faces?

91
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.800
I see.

92
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.100
So this was the reason for her wink.

93
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.300
Cute, isn't she?

94
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.400
I tell you that Rampo freak.

95
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.700
Then,

96
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.300
does that means the person Ms. Kobayashi was seeing during recess was...

97
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.300
The fiend?

98
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.300
I'll go report this to the principle...

99
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.400
Hold it!

100
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.400
I found this piece of paper in my desk.

101
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.300
Is it from the fiend?

102
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.900
No. I think this is a deduction game that Ms. Kobayashi set us up with.

103
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.900
Deduction game?

104
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.200
In other words, she's going to drop us hints

105
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.400
so that we can figure out where she's hiding.

106
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.700
Since she sent us out of this classroom during recess,

107
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.600
maybe she still has some clue hidden here somewhere.

108
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.900
-Let's look for it. -Let's look for it.

109
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.900
Let's go!

110
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.100
I found one in my desk too!

111
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.700
Paper number two.

112
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.700
Mine is paper number one.

113
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.200
I have number five!

114
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.600
Number three.

115
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.900
Number two.

116
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.400
Number one.

117
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.200
Number five.

118
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.900
Number four is missing.

119
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.400
Then, it should be somewhere in the classroom too, right?

120
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.900
Okay. Let's all look for it, then!

121
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.100
-Yeah. -Yeah.

122
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.900
I found this paper in my desk too.

123
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.600
All right! It's number four!

124
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.300
Now we've got all the cards!

125
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.800
Hey, wait a second.

126
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.000
Who are you anyway?

127
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.500
How rude, Genta.

128
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.800
She's Maria Higashio who transferred to our school the other day.

129
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.900
Maria Higashio?

130
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.000
That's right, Genta. Don't tell me you don't remember.

131
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
My god.

132
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.100
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't remember.

133
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.100
What?

134
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.100
Because he was absent from school with a cold

135
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.300
when she first came to our school.

136
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.700
Oh, I see, no wonder.

137
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.800
Anyway, let's organize the hints that we've gathered.

138
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.500
Okay.

139
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.500
The card with number one on it

140
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.100
was in Mitsuhiko Tsuburaya's, that is my desk.

141
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.500
Number two was in Ayumi Yoshida's desk.

142
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.100
Conan Edogawa had number three.

143
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.500
Maria Higashio had number four.

144
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.000
And Genta Kojima had number five.

145
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.400
I wonder why only Genta's number is written in red.

146
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.700
Have you had nose bleeds recently?

147
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.700
No, I didn't have any!

148
00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.600
Maybe it's in order of grades?

149
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.700
See, in Japan, report cards are graded by

150
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.300
using the numbers one to five, right?

151
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.400
For example, if the grades of the five people here

152
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.000
matches the grades for... let's say art,

153
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.800
then maybe Ms. Kobayashi is in the art room.

154
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.900
One to five grading method?

155
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.200
The number two is about me?

156
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.800
The first graders at Teitan Elementary are evaluated only by two words,

157
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.500
"good" and "a bit more".

158
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.000
Oh, is that how?

159
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.400
I heard that when my big sister was going to school

160
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.700
they were graded on a five number evaluation method.

161
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.900
I guess I misunderstood it a bit.

162
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.500
If I remember correctly,

163
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.600
it seems to have been that way some time ago, but...

164
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.600
How many years apart are you from your big sister, Haibara?

165
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.600
Haibara, do you have a big sister?

166
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.900
Oh, maybe it was mum that said that.

167
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.800
Hey. It seems that the hint is not limited to just the five numbers.

168
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.100
See. In the back of the paper that was posted on the blackboard.

169
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.900
-Dice? -Dice?

170
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.700
316. (Pronounced as mi-i-mu)

171
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.200
245. (Pronounced as ni-shi-go)

172
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.700
316. (Pronounced as sa-hi-ro)

173
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.100
245. (Pronounced as fu-yo-go)

174
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.100
I don't think it has to do with a play on words.

175
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.900
But I wonder what these six numbers on the dice are?

176
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.500
We only found five numbers

177
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.700
so they seem to have no connection.

178
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.300
No, they are very deeply connected.

179
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.300
There should still be a number six

180
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.500
hidden somewhere in this classroom.

181
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.400
The number six?

182
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.600
There was none in my desk.

183
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.400
None in mine either.

184
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.500
Me neither.

185
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.900
Same here.

186
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.900
Then, where is number six?

187
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.200
It was inside.

188
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.300
If it's this meaningless paper you're talking about.

189
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.200
Come on! Why didn't you hurry up and tell us?

190
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.400
It's up to me what I want to do, isn't it?

191
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.200
What? Come to think of it, you don't look all that familiar either.

192
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.300
Who is he?

193
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.200
Come on, Genta! Have you forgotten?

194
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.400
He was badly hurt right after we entered 1st grade,

195
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.100
and started coming to school finally since October.

196
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.500
His name is Sakamoto...

197
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.600
What? What was your first name?

198
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.600
Surely it was Sakamoto...

199
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.700
Takuma!

200
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.600
Your full name's Takuma Sakamoto, right?

201
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
Yes.

202
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.100
Is that it?

203
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.100
Just as expected of you, Conan!

204
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.700
You remembered?

205
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.000
No, I hate to say this but I forgot too.

206
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.500
How'd you figure out his name, then?

207
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.100
Thanks to Ms. Kobayashi's code.

208
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.900
I deciphered her code and came up with the name "Takuma".

209
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.100
What? Then...

210
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.000
Did you figure out where Ms. Kobayashi is hiding?

211
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.100
Yeah, of course.

212
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.800
-Where? Tell me, Conan! -Where? Where is she?

213
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.900
Yes. Out with it without keeping us in suspense.

214
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.900
Darn it, Haibara!

215
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.800
First of all, as to why your number 5 is red, Genta...

216
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.300
1st grader, Conan Edogawa of class B.

217
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.900
Please come to the teacher's room immediately.

218
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.300
-I repeat! 1st grader, -You're being paged, Conan.

219
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.200
-Conan Edogawa of class B. -I guess.

220
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.000
Come immediately.

221
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.600
Looks like I have to go.

222
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.600
-What? -Hey, Conan.

223
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.100
Go if you have to but tell us the answer of the code before going!

224
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.400
Don't worry.

225
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.500
You guys can figure it out right away!

226
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.800
It's a simple game that every kid knows.

227
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.900
Bye then. I'm counting on "you're" guys!

228
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.700
"You're" guys? Come on!

229
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.100
-Hey! -Conan!

230
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.200
"You're"? "Yon (means four)- roku (means six) - shiku".

231
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.500
So, that's what it means.

232
00:11:55.109 --> 00:12:00.109
Hey. Do we have to solve Ms. Kobayashi's code without Conan?

233
00:12:00.109 --> 00:12:03.309
You think we should wait until Conan comes back.

234
00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:04.809
Oh come on.

235
00:12:04.809 --> 00:12:06.009
If he can solve it,

236
00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:09.409
there's no reason why we can't, don't you think so?

237
00:12:10.809 --> 00:12:12.909
But, you see...

238
00:12:12.909 --> 00:12:15.709
Besides, this is a code that an elementary school teacher

239
00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:18.809
made for the students of her class.

240
00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:22.509
It's not a mysterious dying message left

241
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:24.609
after a murder case or a code for a treasure map

242
00:12:24.609 --> 00:12:28.509
so I'm sure it's made so that we can solve it on our own.

243
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:32.709
There's no reason why we should back off even before trying, is there?

244
00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:34.209
Right.

245
00:12:34.209 --> 00:12:36.509
I'm starting to feel like we can solve it!

246
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:38.609
-Let's give it our best shot! -Then, let's start

247
00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:40.709
by attaching the name of the person

248
00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:44.409
that had numbered cards in their desk to the number on the dice.

249
00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:48.909
First, it's three, so Conan.

250
00:12:48.909 --> 00:12:52.809
Next it's one, so Mitsuhiko, then six is Takuma!

251
00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:54.809
Two is Ayumi.

252
00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:58.109
Four is Maria and five is me!

253
00:12:58.109 --> 00:13:03.309
Conan, Mitsuhiko, Takuma, Ayumi, Maria and Genta.

254
00:13:03.309 --> 00:13:05.309
If we take only the first vowel sound of our names,

255
00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:08.509
it comes out to CO-MI-TA-A-MA-GE.

256
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:10.409
"Comita amage"?

257
00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:11.509
If it's our last names,

258
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:14.109
it would be Edogawa, Tsuburaya, Sakamoto,

259
00:13:14.109 --> 00:13:16.909
Yoshida, Higashio, Kojima.

260
00:13:16.909 --> 00:13:20.909
It'll be "E-Tsu-Sa-Yo-Hi-Ko".

261
00:13:23.009 --> 00:13:24.609
Maybe the numbers that were in our desks

262
00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:28.009
and this dice are completely different things.

263
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:32.609
The fact that only Genta's five was written in red bothers me too.

264
00:13:34.609 --> 00:13:36.209
What's the matter, Ai?

265
00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:38.309
Did you figure something out?

266
00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:39.609
Oh, look.

267
00:13:39.609 --> 00:13:44.709
One thing that is red among six,

268
00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:47.309
I think there was something like that.

269
00:13:47.309 --> 00:13:50.809
One thing that is red among six?

270
00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:53.809
As for traffic lights, it's only one out of three.

271
00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:58.209
As for playing cards, it's 26 out of 52.

272
00:13:58.209 --> 00:14:00.709
Well...

273
00:14:00.709 --> 00:14:02.409
That...

274
00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:06.109
I get it!

275
00:14:06.109 --> 00:14:07.709
Dice, right?

276
00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:10.809
Incredible, Maria, you did great to figure it out!

277
00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:15.309
Yes! I love playing "sugoroku" (children's dice game)!

278
00:14:15.309 --> 00:14:16.309
You have a Kansai dialect.

279
00:14:16.309 --> 00:14:18.009
You love "sugoroku"?

280
00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:19.909
There's no need to be ashamed.

281
00:14:19.909 --> 00:14:22.609
Dialects are like accessories to words.

282
00:14:22.609 --> 00:14:24.509
If you want to talk without it, it's okay,

283
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:26.309
but you shouldn't get rid of it.

284
00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:31.109
Because it carries an important message

285
00:14:31.109 --> 00:14:33.709
of the district you were born.

286
00:14:33.709 --> 00:14:35.909
Yes! That's right!

287
00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:41.809
What does my number being red have anything to do with the dice?

288
00:14:41.809 --> 00:14:44.309
In a dice, the only red number is one, right?

289
00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:45.509
In other words,

290
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.909
it means that aside from the five that was in your desk,

291
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:51.109
one holds meaning!

292
00:14:51.109 --> 00:14:55.709
If it means that I'm number one of all six of us...

293
00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:59.209
The only thing thinkable is your height or weight.

294
00:14:59.209 --> 00:15:00.909
But when we measured height and weight the other day,

295
00:15:00.909 --> 00:15:05.409
Ayumi and I were just about the same height and weight.

296
00:15:05.409 --> 00:15:09.509
Besides, kids this age seem to grow at a fast rate on a daily basis,

297
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:11.409
so I guess it's not this.

298
00:15:11.409 --> 00:15:13.009
Incidentally.

299
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:18.109
Takuma, are there any games or sports you're good at?

300
00:15:18.109 --> 00:15:19.409
Why?

301
00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:22.409
Remember Conan saying?

302
00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:26.609
That the hint was a game that every kid knows.

303
00:15:26.609 --> 00:15:31.309
So I thought maybe it's in order of who's good at some game or sports!

304
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:33.909
Genta is number one, so...

305
00:15:33.909 --> 00:15:36.409
Okay, it's baseball!

306
00:15:36.409 --> 00:15:39.009
I can play baseball too.

307
00:15:39.009 --> 00:15:41.709
Because I used to play ball with dad a lot.

308
00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:44.109
Then, are you better than me?

309
00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.909
Hold it.

310
00:15:45.909 --> 00:15:48.609
I mean you're not professional baseball players or anything,

311
00:15:48.609 --> 00:15:51.109
but just 1st graders who are good at sports.

312
00:15:51.109 --> 00:15:52.209
Something like that is too hard to determine,

313
00:15:52.209 --> 00:15:54.409
that it's not something that can be lined out in order, is it?

314
00:15:54.409 --> 00:15:56.109
I guess so.

315
00:15:56.109 --> 00:15:59.909
There must be something else, another game that will serve as a hint.

316
00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:06.109
"1-B" -Ms. Kobayashi, right?

317
00:16:06.109 --> 00:16:09.309
You've been here eavesdropping on everybody's conversation, weren't you?

318
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:13.009
Since I was easily able to solve your code,

319
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:15.009
you used your cell phone

320
00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:18.209
and asked another teacher to suddenly page me, right?

321
00:16:18.209 --> 00:16:19.709
I couldn't help it, could I?

322
00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:22.609
Having you solve it too easily is no fun!

323
00:16:22.609 --> 00:16:26.209
It's not only because it's no fun, is it?

324
00:16:26.209 --> 00:16:28.809
You precocious brat.

325
00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:31.809
But it's going to work out.

326
00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:34.209
-Hide-and-seek. -TV game!

327
00:16:34.209 --> 00:16:36.509
Playing house!

328
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:38.709
None of them sound right.

329
00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:41.309
I'm good at musical chair!

330
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:43.809
It's because you have a big rear end, Genta.

331
00:16:43.809 --> 00:16:46.109
Musical chair. Rear end.

332
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:50.609
Doesn't anything cross your mind, Ai?

333
00:16:50.609 --> 00:16:52.209
Well.

334
00:16:52.209 --> 00:16:56.609
Maybe it's not a physical game.

335
00:16:56.609 --> 00:16:59.009
Yes. For example...

336
00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:00.209
Word chain game!

337
00:17:01.609 --> 00:17:04.809
The names of all six of us match the word chain game.

338
00:17:04.809 --> 00:17:07.109
Word chain game?

339
00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.409
True!

340
00:17:08.409 --> 00:17:11.309
Genta, Takuma, Maria,

341
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:14.309
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko, Conan.

342
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:18.309
Really! You've gotta find the right word and Genta is the first one!

343
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:21.009
It's amazing you figured it out!

344
00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:22.509
It was just by chance.

345
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:27.809
I see. Ms. Kobayashi is hiding in that classroom.

346
00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:31.809
But, Mitsuhiko. So what if it's a word chain game?

347
00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:36.109
So, match the order of the names to the number on the dice,

348
00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:40.009
and then line out the numbers that were in the desk of the six of us.

349
00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:43.609
The third name in line is Maria, so it's four!

350
00:17:43.609 --> 00:17:46.009
First is Genta so it's five.

351
00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:48.209
Sixth is Conan and it's three.

352
00:17:48.209 --> 00:17:50.309
Second is Takuma so it's six.

353
00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:52.109
Fourth is Ayumi, so it's two.

354
00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:54.509
Fifth is me and it's one.

355
00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:56.309
If we read this in order it goes.

356
00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:01.909
Four, five, three, six, two, one.

357
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:04.509
Yo-ko-sa-mu-ni-i?

358
00:18:04.509 --> 00:18:06.809
It's mumbo-jumbo, isn't it?

359
00:18:06.809 --> 00:18:09.909
Maybe it's not the word chain game?

360
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:11.409
It has to be!

361
00:18:11.409 --> 00:18:14.909
Because the word chain fits in too well to be a coincidence!

362
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:19.009
Come to think of it, Conan was saying that when he deciphered the code,

363
00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:22.409
he figured out that Sakamoto's first name was Takuma, right?

364
00:18:22.409 --> 00:18:26.809
Yes. If the game is making a word chain,

365
00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:31.609
the only name that can come between Genta and Maria is Takuma.

366
00:18:31.609 --> 00:18:35.009
But, there's a person called "Tajima" living in the neighborhood!

367
00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:36.809
There's a guy called "Tanuma" too!

368
00:18:36.809 --> 00:18:39.509
But, they're both last names, aren't they?

369
00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:46.609
I think Conan figured out the "ku" part of Takuma's name.

370
00:18:46.609 --> 00:18:48.009
-That's it! Right! -That's true!

371
00:18:48.009 --> 00:18:49.409
Is something the matter?

372
00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:52.109
Takuma's last name is Sakamoto.

373
00:18:52.109 --> 00:18:54.109
The sound "ku" in his name is the sixth letter

374
00:18:54.109 --> 00:18:55.709
from the top if written in hiragana.

375
00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:58.409
Everybody's saying that it matches the number six

376
00:18:58.409 --> 00:19:01.309
that was found in Takuma's desk!

377
00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:03.009
I see!

378
00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:05.509
"Tsuburaya" -So, my name is Tsuburaya and I found number one,

379
00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:06.809
so the first letter is "tsu" in hiragana.

380
00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:10.709
So, I'm Genta Kojima and found number five,

381
00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:12.009
"Genta" -so the hiragana "ge" of my name is to be used?

382
00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:13.509
You mean "n".

383
00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:15.709
"Yoshida" -I'm Yoshida and found number two,

384
00:19:15.709 --> 00:19:17.009
so the hiragana "shi" of my name is to be used!

385
00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:20.709
"Higashio" -My name's Higashio and I found number four, it's "o".

386
00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:24.209
"Edogawa" -Edogawa is number three, so the hiragana used is "ga".

387
00:19:24.209 --> 00:19:26.409
So, shall we read the letters just now

388
00:19:26.409 --> 00:19:29.009
in the order of the numbers on the dice that we saw a while ago?

389
00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:33.009
The first "three" on the dice is me, so...

390
00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:34.809
"O"!

391
00:19:34.809 --> 00:19:36.809
Next is Kojima so...

392
00:19:36.809 --> 00:19:38.309
"N"!

393
00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:39.909
What about Edogawa that comes next?

394
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:40.909
"Ga"!

395
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:42.609
Next, Sakamoto.

396
00:19:42.609 --> 00:19:44.209
"Ku"!

397
00:19:44.209 --> 00:19:45.309
Yoshida.

398
00:19:45.309 --> 00:19:46.509
"Shi"!

399
00:19:46.509 --> 00:19:48.209
Then, Tsuburaya!

400
00:19:48.209 --> 00:19:49.809
"Tsu"!

401
00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:52.409
The music classroom (ongakushitsu)!

402
00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:58.109
I'm kind of starting to understand how tough things are for Kudo.

403
00:19:58.109 --> 00:20:01.209
Let's all head on over to the music room then!

404
00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:02.509
-Yeah! -Yeah!

405
00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:05.109
Let's go, Maria!

406
00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.709
Hey! You're coming too!

407
00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:14.009
If the answer's not correct,

408
00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:17.909
we've got to think it over again together.

409
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:19.209
I know.

410
00:20:19.209 --> 00:20:21.209
"Music room"

411
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:26.009
Is Ms. Kobayashi there?

412
00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:29.509
No.

413
00:20:29.509 --> 00:20:31.509
Nobody seems to be here.

414
00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:33.509
No joke!

415
00:20:33.509 --> 00:20:38.209
Don't tell me that something was wrong in the way we solved the code.

416
00:20:38.209 --> 00:20:41.709
Maybe it's the dice that I mentioned.

417
00:20:41.709 --> 00:20:45.609
I think it's the word chain that was wrong.

418
00:20:45.609 --> 00:20:47.809
It can't be!

419
00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:51.509
Look really good before complaining.

420
00:20:51.509 --> 00:20:54.009
I'm sure she's here somewhere!

421
00:20:54.009 --> 00:20:57.609
I mean, you're stretching it out too far.

422
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:06.409
Ms. Kobayashi!

423
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:09.509
Which means that our deduction was...

424
00:21:09.509 --> 00:21:11.809
Yes, of course!

425
00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:13.409
You hit the bull's eye!

426
00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:19.509
You'd better be grateful!

427
00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:20.909
I had a hard time.

428
00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:22.509
Sorry.

429
00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:25.509
Okay then, Ms. Kobayashi. Give us a reward.

430
00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:27.409
I have no such thing for you!

431
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:29.409
You mean we don't get anything?

432
00:21:29.409 --> 00:21:33.109
I lose, you guys are fantastic.

433
00:21:33.109 --> 00:21:35.909
Will this do?

434
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:38.209
No way...

435
00:21:38.209 --> 00:21:42.209
No, you win, Ms. Kobayashi.

436
00:21:42.209 --> 00:21:45.909
A girl who was flustered by the change in environment

437
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:48.909
because she just transferred to this school.

438
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:51.809
And a boy who was absent for a long period of time from school

439
00:21:51.809 --> 00:21:54.409
because of a wound and couldn't quite fit into class.

440
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:56.909
You put their names into the code

441
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:59.009
and helped everyone remember their names.

442
00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:00.709
You set it up so that, like it or not,

443
00:22:00.709 --> 00:22:03.609
they had to participate in solving the code too.

444
00:22:03.609 --> 00:22:05.109
And you perfectly helped the two melt in

445
00:22:05.109 --> 00:22:07.609
and get along with the others in class.

446
00:23:34.509 --> 00:23:35.809
Hey, then!

447
00:23:35.809 --> 00:23:36.909
For our next extra curricular activity,

448
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:40.409
why don't we go explore the mysterious western style building on Nichome?

449
00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:44.009
You mean the "Etou" house, right next door to Dr. Agasa's?

450
00:23:44.009 --> 00:23:46.509
Rumor has it that it's vacant again

451
00:23:46.509 --> 00:23:49.409
and that there's an evil spirit living there!

452
00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:52.609
Come on, hey. That's my house!

453
00:23:52.609 --> 00:23:54.409
Oh? That sure sounds interesting!

454
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:57.409
Yes! Exploration of the mysterious western style house in Nichome!

455
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:59.409
"Etou..."

456
00:23:59.409 --> 00:24:01.509
It's read "Kudo".

457
00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:05.609
"Next Episode" -A stone is definitely here too.

458
00:24:05.609 --> 00:24:07.409
Maybe somebody's just playing a prank?

459
00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:09.909
This is pretty audacious.

460
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:13.009
It doesn't look like something a professional would do.

461
00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:15.409
"Advent Stone"

462
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:17.609
Crab is scissors, scissors. The orange is paper,

463
00:24:17.609 --> 00:24:21.009
The green caterpillar is rock. Paper scissors.

464
00:24:21.009 --> 00:24:24.309
I'm sure that Tsukasa is at that beach.

465
00:24:24.309 --> 00:24:26.309
Please! We've got to find him!

466
00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:32.509
Next Conan, "The missing page"

467
00:24:48.309 --> 00:24:50.109
Next Conan's Hint:

468
00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:52.509
"Photo frame"

469
00:24:52.509 --> 00:24:54.209
Next Episode is Kanto Railway.

470
00:24:54.209 --> 00:24:55.809
Where has that train run off to?

471
00:24:55.809 --> 00:24:57.309
I can't break it to you.
