1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.240
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.240
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.940
Sonoko's world in Karuizawa.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.840
A troublesome case as expected.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:43.867
Hey! Ran!

9
00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:45.467
Hurry up.

10
00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:47.267
We're running late!

11
00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:49.567
Okay, I'll be right there!

12
00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.667
Geez...

13
00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.167
Come on, Mr. Mouri.

14
00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.867
It's nothing to get heated up over.

15
00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:55.367
Shut up!

16
00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.967
Why do I, Kogoro Mouri,

17
00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:01.067
have to serve as a driver for two sassy chicks?

18
00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:03.367
Moreover, you're from the Suzuki Financial Group,

19
00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:05.267
don't you even have your own chauffeur?

20
00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:09.167
No way! I don't want a chauffeur driving me around on vacation.

21
00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.567
I hate feeling like I'm being watched!

22
00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.367
Is that so...

23
00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:16.867
Yes, that's how it is.

24
00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:20.467
Well, there's one kid who's got a cold,

25
00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:22.667
so be careful you don't catch it.

26
00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:25.267
Conan has a cold?

27
00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:27.067
Thank you for waiting!

28
00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:29.767
I took time trying to get Conan ready.

29
00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.967
Are you going to be all right, Conan?

30
00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:33.567
You got a cold, don't you?

31
00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:35.167
Yes, I'm fine, just fine.

32
00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:37.267
I just got the sniffles!

33
00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.267
Okay, so now that we're all set!

34
00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:44.767
Off we go to Karuizawa!

35
00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:46.467
Yes, ma'am.

36
00:02:49.867 --> 00:02:55.667
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 1)"

37
00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:03.467
Are you okay, Conan?

38
00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:05.167
Yes, I'm fine.

39
00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:06.567
If you start feeling bad,

40
00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:07.967
tell me right away, okay?

41
00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:09.367
Okay!

42
00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:11.267
Gosh, if you have a cold,

43
00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:13.767
why didn't you just stay home?

44
00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:15.967
The owner of Poirot Cafe

45
00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:19.567
offered to watch you one whole day today.

46
00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:25.167
But I want to see Sonoko's villa in Karuizawa too!

47
00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:27.067
Geez.

48
00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:29.367
And besides, knowing Sonoko for what she is,

49
00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.267
she'll probably think up some bad ideas like always.

50
00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:34.267
Maybe we'll find a really good mate!

51
00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:37.467
What? We're going boy-hunting playing tennis?

52
00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:38.667
That's right!

53
00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:41.667
Just about this time, there are many university students

54
00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:43.867
at the tennis courts near the villa.

55
00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:45.767
Gosh. If you do something like that,

56
00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:48.367
Kyogoku's going to get mad at you!

57
00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:50.267
What do you mean by that?

58
00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:53.867
Of course, he's the only guy for me.

59
00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.167
You're the one who's going to get someone today!

60
00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.967
What?

61
00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:01.467
You'll wear your tennis wear to show off your great body

62
00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:03.267
to the university students.

63
00:04:03.267 --> 00:04:04.767
You'll take a snapshot with him

64
00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:06.867
and send it to him as a mail attachment!

65
00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:10.967
You'll do all this to get Kudo, that boyfriend of yours, jealous!

66
00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:13.067
How about it?

67
00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:16.467
I don't think he'll get jealous.

68
00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:19.467
Just as I thought...

69
00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:23.667
Besides, the only thing I have is a Teitan High School jersey uniform.

70
00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.367
I don't have tennis wear.

71
00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:27.667
Don't you worry!

72
00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.867
I bought tennis wear for you and brought it along.

73
00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:34.167
Geez...

74
00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:35.367
Look at this!

75
00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:37.667
It's super mini and cute too!

76
00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.967
Short!

77
00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.967
Hey! I could never wear something like that!

78
00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:47.467
I didn't bring my safety pants with me either!

79
00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:48.567
I see...

80
00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:51.167
It can't be helped then.

81
00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:54.367
I guess you'll just have to wear a regular panties then, Ran.

82
00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.267
Regular panties?

83
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.467
Darn it! I'd love to see it.

84
00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:04.067
But I don't want others to see it.

85
00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:06.667
Hey. I don't know what you two are blabbering about

86
00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.367
but if my daughter is going to be humiliated

87
00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:10.367
just for that detective brat,

88
00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:11.767
I'm heading back home.

89
00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:14.067
You can if you want too but...

90
00:05:14.067 --> 00:05:17.867
There are going to be a lot of voluptuous girls there too.

91
00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:18.967
What?

92
00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:23.967
University girls!

93
00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:33.267
The weather was so nice in the morning, but now...

94
00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:36.867
My voluptuous university girls...

95
00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:39.367
We can't play tennis in this weather.

96
00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:42.467
I don't know if I should be happy or sad about this.

97
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.167
Oh, well...

98
00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:46.767
I thought I'll get to see Ran's panty glimpse with tennis shorts

99
00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:49.067
that I haven't seen in a while today.

100
00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:50.667
Too bad!

101
00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:53.467
Well, I guess I should be glad.

102
00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.767
Somebody's on the tennis court.

103
00:05:57.767 --> 00:06:01.167
Maybe they're my voluptuous girls...

104
00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:06.467
Darn it. It's a guy.

105
00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:08.667
May I help you with something?

106
00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:09.667
What?

107
00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.667
A handsome guy.

108
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.667
Oh, no...

109
00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.967
"Hiroto Akashi (32)" -I was just recalling memories

110
00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:17.567
when I first met my wife here.

111
00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:21.167
Geez. He's already taken...

112
00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:23.967
If all of you came to play tennis,

113
00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.667
would you like me to coach you on how to play better?

114
00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:30.267
I'm a tennis instructor.

115
00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:31.967
My house is near here too,

116
00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:33.167
so if you'd like...

117
00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:38.367
Thank you for your offer,

118
00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:39.867
but I don't think so...

119
00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:41.167
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.167
I see.

121
00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:43.867
That's too bad.

122
00:06:43.867 --> 00:06:45.067
So long.

123
00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:52.767
So we couldn't fish any men after all.

124
00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:54.467
Okay, let's go...

125
00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:57.467
fish instead then!

126
00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:00.667
Hey... What's with this turn of events?

127
00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:01.667
Just watch!

128
00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:05.567
I'll catch us some delicious fish for dinner!

129
00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:08.567
The Chef and my older sister are already preparing dinner

130
00:07:08.567 --> 00:07:11.267
and waiting for us there.

131
00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:15.667
It seems like the river water is increasing.

132
00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:19.967
Geez... It took my float and all again.

133
00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:22.367
That's because you don't tie it well enough!

134
00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:24.367
Fish lines are slippery

135
00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:27.567
so unless you tie them like this...

136
00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:31.667
Hey, your fishing line is being pulled, Mr. Mouri!

137
00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:32.667
What?

138
00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:35.867
Hey, this is a big one!

139
00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:43.967
My rental car?

140
00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:46.467
-No way! -It's been carried into the river!

141
00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:48.267
Didn't I tell you that

142
00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:51.467
you parked the car too close to the edge of the river.

143
00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:53.167
Why you...

144
00:07:54.267 --> 00:07:55.667
Dad!

145
00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:56.867
Darn it!

146
00:07:56.867 --> 00:07:58.367
I'm not letting the river take the car!

147
00:07:58.367 --> 00:08:00.467
You can't do anything about it already, Dad!

148
00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:11.067
Hey, are you okay?

149
00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:14.967
I'm fine, although my right wrist hurts a bit.

150
00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:17.067
I wonder if you sprained it.

151
00:08:17.067 --> 00:08:20.467
You probably landed on it when you fell into the river.

152
00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.267
Well, it's way better than being stranded in the water.

153
00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:25.667
This is no time for jokes!

154
00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:27.167
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:32.967
But, what do we do now?

156
00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:36.067
All our things have drifted away with the car.

157
00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:38.267
Our cell phones aren't working because we're out of range.

158
00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.967
And it's gotten dark after all this walking.

159
00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:43.067
On top of that,

160
00:08:43.067 --> 00:08:45.567
don't you two think that maybe we're lost?

161
00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.567
-What? -What?

162
00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:50.967
Hey, you mean you were walking around not knowing where you were?

163
00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:53.467
Well, I was just kind of trusting my intuition.

164
00:08:53.467 --> 00:08:56.167
Geez, what now?

165
00:08:56.967 --> 00:08:57.967
There's light.

166
00:08:57.967 --> 00:08:59.367
What?

167
00:08:59.367 --> 00:09:01.367
See, over there.

168
00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:04.167
You mean there are people living out in the mountains like this?

169
00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.267
I'm sure it's a mountain witch!

170
00:09:07.267 --> 00:09:10.667
Let's have her put us up for a while then.

171
00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:11.967
-What? -What?

172
00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:16.167
We got to get some dry clothes for this brat, don't we?

173
00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:20.467
Excuse me.

174
00:09:20.467 --> 00:09:22.467
I'm sorry to be intruding on you at this hour,

175
00:09:22.467 --> 00:09:23.867
but is anybody home?

176
00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.167
He's coming out!

177
00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:33.167
You guys are the ones who've come out.

178
00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:34.467
"Iwao Akashi (65), Hiroto's Father"

179
00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:37.567
So, you're solicitors of some kind again?

180
00:09:37.567 --> 00:09:39.567
I won't be deceived even if you bring kids along with you!

181
00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:41.867
No, we're...

182
00:09:41.867 --> 00:09:43.467
Go home! Go home!

183
00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:46.567
This is no place for swindlers like you to come!

184
00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:49.467
Who is it, father?

185
00:09:49.467 --> 00:09:51.867
You people are...

186
00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:56.267
What a laugh!

187
00:09:56.267 --> 00:09:58.767
You fell into the river trying to fish your car

188
00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:00.267
that drifted into the river.

189
00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.567
It's no laughing matter.

190
00:10:02.567 --> 00:10:03.767
Sorry...

191
00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:05.167
But he'll be fine!

192
00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:07.567
With a little compress and by fixing his wrist in place,

193
00:10:07.567 --> 00:10:11.467
if it's just a sprain, he'll recover in no time.

194
00:10:11.467 --> 00:10:14.667
Turn this way and let me look into your mouth.

195
00:10:16.567 --> 00:10:19.667
Your throat is red and your voice is hoarse,

196
00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:22.367
so try not to use your voice too much.

197
00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:24.967
You may come down with acute laryngitis.

198
00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:26.167
Okay.

199
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.467
It's as if you're a doctor...

200
00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:33.467
Yeah, I learned a lot when I was coaching tennis players

201
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:36.767
to prepare them for competitions.

202
00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:40.967
How do the clothes of when I was a child fit you?

203
00:10:40.967 --> 00:10:42.967
They fit like a glove!

204
00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:45.667
That's great then.

205
00:10:45.667 --> 00:10:47.867
I smell curry?

206
00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:51.367
Yes. It's left-over from last night, though.

207
00:10:51.367 --> 00:10:53.667
If you don't mind, would you like some?

208
00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:55.867
Can I?

209
00:11:01.867 --> 00:11:03.267
This is good!

210
00:11:03.267 --> 00:11:05.167
It's as good as the kind you eat at a restaurant!

211
00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:06.967
Really! It's delicious!

212
00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:08.567
Since you have a sore throat,

213
00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.167
you eat eggs over rice, okay, Conan?

214
00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:11.267
Okay...

215
00:11:11.267 --> 00:11:14.667
I like the spiciness of this curry!

216
00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.567
Your wife must be a good cook!

217
00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:18.167
Oh, well...

218
00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:21.067
I'm the one who made this.

219
00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:25.167
My wife passed away three years ago today.

220
00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:27.867
I see...

221
00:11:27.867 --> 00:11:31.067
That's why you were at the tennis court recalling memories of her.

222
00:11:31.067 --> 00:11:33.767
Well, when I was trainer, I also made meals for the players

223
00:11:33.767 --> 00:11:37.467
while taking their body condition into consideration too.

224
00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:41.267
I was also better at cooking than my wife.

225
00:11:41.267 --> 00:11:45.467
I'm going to take curry to father who is upstairs,

226
00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:46.967
so please help yourself to seconds if you wish.

227
00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:48.667
Oh, okay.

228
00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:57.467
Dad, I brought you your meal.

229
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:58.667
Yeah.

230
00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:09.767
Mr. Hiroto is sure taking his time.

231
00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:12.067
It's already been 40 minutes since then.

232
00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.267
This is really getting on my nerves.

233
00:12:16.267 --> 00:12:18.467
What is?

234
00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:21.667
This long cable hanging from the light above!

235
00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:23.867
It's getting in the way of me trying to eat.

236
00:12:23.867 --> 00:12:25.167
Stop complaining.

237
00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:27.867
You already had two servings.

238
00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:30.267
That cable is for dad.

239
00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:35.167
He wanted an electric cable that he could reach because he's hunched over.

240
00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.367
Oh, I see...

241
00:12:37.367 --> 00:12:39.467
You sure took a long time,

242
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.867
when all you did was go to give him his curry.

243
00:12:41.867 --> 00:12:42.867
Yeah.

244
00:12:42.867 --> 00:12:44.467
Dad started saying strange things

245
00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:47.267
so we got to talking with each other.

246
00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:50.667
He said he's not eating because he wants to die out of the blue.

247
00:12:50.667 --> 00:12:53.167
-What? -Wants to die?

248
00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:57.367
It seems that he thinks that he is being disliked by God

249
00:12:57.367 --> 00:13:01.867
because he's lost his wife as well as his daughter-in-law.

250
00:13:01.867 --> 00:13:03.267
Well, he seems to be okay now

251
00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:05.767
since he's started eating curry, which is also his favorite dish.

252
00:13:05.767 --> 00:13:07.467
So please don't worry about it.

253
00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:13.267
What? The road is blocked because of a landslide

254
00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:15.467
and you can't come to pick us up today?

255
00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:17.267
Are you serious?

256
00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:19.967
You can stay over here then.

257
00:13:19.967 --> 00:13:22.767
We've got a lot of mattresses here too.

258
00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:25.567
I'm sorry to trouble you, but thank you very much.

259
00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:26.967
Oh, right.

260
00:13:26.967 --> 00:13:29.467
Will you go get father's dish for me?

261
00:13:29.467 --> 00:13:31.667
Yes, sure!

262
00:13:33.867 --> 00:13:38.167
But he's very jittery as well as a slow eater.

263
00:13:38.167 --> 00:13:41.267
If the room light is on, it means he's still eating,

264
00:13:41.267 --> 00:13:44.767
so come back without making a sound, okay?

265
00:13:44.767 --> 00:13:45.967
Okay.

266
00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:53.067
The light of the room is...

267
00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:55.267
It's still on.

268
00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:57.467
Quiet...

269
00:14:00.867 --> 00:14:02.467
He's crying?

270
00:14:08.067 --> 00:14:09.867
No, not like that.

271
00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:11.367
Forehand goes like this.

272
00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:12.467
Okay.

273
00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:19.167
I'm sure he's already finished eating by now.

274
00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:22.767
I'll go back up to get his dishes again.

275
00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:24.767
Thank you.

276
00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:26.667
I'll go too.

277
00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.867
Quietly...

278
00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:35.267
Okay, the lights are out.

279
00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:40.867
What? He's not in bed.

280
00:15:06.847 --> 00:15:07.947
Ran?

281
00:15:15.847 --> 00:15:17.847
He's bleeding from his mouth?

282
00:15:21.347 --> 00:15:22.747
Ran! What's the matter?

283
00:15:22.747 --> 00:15:23.847
That is...

284
00:15:25.347 --> 00:15:27.647
Father...

285
00:15:27.647 --> 00:15:28.847
No way.

286
00:15:28.847 --> 00:15:31.347
Hey, what's going on?

287
00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:32.547
What...

288
00:15:38.147 --> 00:15:40.647
He's still warm,

289
00:15:40.647 --> 00:15:44.347
but his toes are starting to stiffen.

290
00:15:44.347 --> 00:15:47.847
He's estimated to have been dead for about 30 minutes.

291
00:15:47.847 --> 00:15:49.747
Excuse me, Mr. Hiroto.

292
00:15:49.747 --> 00:15:51.947
Will you please call the police?

293
00:15:51.947 --> 00:15:53.847
Sure.

294
00:15:53.847 --> 00:15:57.047
I guess the officers of the Gunma prefecture will be coming.

295
00:15:58.447 --> 00:16:01.747
Hey. If it's Gunma Prefecture...

296
00:16:01.747 --> 00:16:03.847
No way.

297
00:16:06.847 --> 00:16:09.547
"Gunma Prefecture"

298
00:16:09.547 --> 00:16:12.547
Summoned and here I am!

299
00:16:12.547 --> 00:16:14.147
If it's for you, Mr. Mouri,

300
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.647
I'll go through fire and water.

301
00:16:15.647 --> 00:16:17.347
The roads may be blocked because of the rain,

302
00:16:17.347 --> 00:16:19.847
but I've come as fast as possible because you have called me!

303
00:16:19.847 --> 00:16:22.947
I wonder if the Gunma police station has nobody else to dispatch?

304
00:16:24.647 --> 00:16:27.547
And? What kind of murder case is it this time?

305
00:16:27.547 --> 00:16:29.447
What's the murder weapon? Any evidence?

306
00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:32.547
You're going to do it, right? The Sleeping Kogoro deduction show!

307
00:16:32.547 --> 00:16:34.847
Stop smiling all over the place at a place like this.

308
00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:36.647
For God's sake, talk about lacking prudence.

309
00:16:36.647 --> 00:16:39.947
Besides, we're not even sure if this is a homicide either yet.

310
00:16:39.947 --> 00:16:42.447
There's the dead body.

311
00:16:42.447 --> 00:16:45.147
Don't tell me that this is...

312
00:16:45.147 --> 00:16:48.847
The one who passed away is the head of this house, Mr. Iwao Akashi.

313
00:16:48.847 --> 00:16:50.147
The one who found him is

314
00:16:50.147 --> 00:16:56.347
my daughter, Ran, who went to clear his dish.

315
00:16:56.347 --> 00:16:57.847
When she found him,

316
00:16:57.847 --> 00:17:00.547
the light of this room on the second floor was turned off.

317
00:17:00.547 --> 00:17:04.847
But when she checked an hour and a half earlier the light was on,

318
00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:06.847
so she thought he was still eating his curry

319
00:17:06.847 --> 00:17:09.147
and didn't enter the room.

320
00:17:09.147 --> 00:17:12.047
I checked right away after the incident

321
00:17:12.047 --> 00:17:14.847
but the victim seems to have been dead for about 30 minutes.

322
00:17:14.847 --> 00:17:16.747
There were four of us in the house then

323
00:17:16.747 --> 00:17:19.147
but all of us were in the living room on the first floor

324
00:17:19.147 --> 00:17:22.147
from two hours before the incident, so we all have an alibi.

325
00:17:22.147 --> 00:17:24.547
Well, the only one who wasn't in the living room all the time was me

326
00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:27.147
because I was taking a bath.

327
00:17:27.147 --> 00:17:29.847
Which means that you're the only one

328
00:17:29.847 --> 00:17:32.947
who could've committed the murder, Mr. Mouri!

329
00:17:32.947 --> 00:17:37.547
I came to this house for the first time today!

330
00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:39.247
I don't even know where the rope is,

331
00:17:39.247 --> 00:17:40.747
so how could I have done it?

332
00:17:40.747 --> 00:17:42.847
Oh, is that so?

333
00:17:42.847 --> 00:17:44.347
It's a bit of a concern

334
00:17:44.347 --> 00:17:47.047
that the victim is bleeding from his mouth

335
00:17:47.047 --> 00:17:49.047
but as you can obviously see...

336
00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:50.147
What?

337
00:17:50.147 --> 00:17:51.647
Why is it of any concern?

338
00:17:51.647 --> 00:17:52.947
I thought that people who die like this

339
00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:55.147
always bleed from their mouths?

340
00:17:55.147 --> 00:17:56.147
Yes...

341
00:17:56.147 --> 00:17:59.547
I've seen scenes like that in movies and dramas.

342
00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:01.847
That's not true.

343
00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:03.447
The doctor once told me that

344
00:18:03.447 --> 00:18:05.647
when something is wrapped around your throat,

345
00:18:05.647 --> 00:18:07.447
your face gets swollen because the blood circulation is stopped,

346
00:18:07.447 --> 00:18:09.247
and unless you have a wound in your mouth or something,

347
00:18:09.247 --> 00:18:11.447
you don't bleed from the mouth!

348
00:18:11.447 --> 00:18:13.847
So I think in the movies or dramas,

349
00:18:13.847 --> 00:18:16.047
they go out of their way to do so

350
00:18:16.047 --> 00:18:17.747
to make it visually obvious that the person is dead.

351
00:18:20.747 --> 00:18:22.547
No, don't talk.

352
00:18:22.547 --> 00:18:24.847
You'll strain your throat because of your cold.

353
00:18:24.847 --> 00:18:27.347
But, if it's just as the boy just said,

354
00:18:27.347 --> 00:18:30.047
I wonder why he's bleeding from his mouth.

355
00:18:30.047 --> 00:18:31.347
I think it's because he was going to the dentist

356
00:18:31.347 --> 00:18:34.347
to get his teeth treated.

357
00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:35.347
He told me that he was going to the dentist

358
00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:37.847
because his tooth was hurting.

359
00:18:37.847 --> 00:18:40.547
May I ask who you are?

360
00:18:40.547 --> 00:18:43.347
I'm Iwao Akashi's son, Hiroto.

361
00:18:43.347 --> 00:18:48.247
Although I was adopted by him when I was a child.

362
00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:52.947
His right molar's been pulled out.

363
00:18:52.947 --> 00:18:54.947
It seems that after he died,

364
00:18:54.947 --> 00:18:56.447
it bled from here

365
00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:59.347
and blood came out when he drooled.

366
00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:04.647
Mr. Hiroto, do you know when and which dentist that your father went to?

367
00:19:04.647 --> 00:19:06.147
Well...

368
00:19:06.147 --> 00:19:09.647
he left to go about two or three days ago.

369
00:19:09.647 --> 00:19:12.047
Who cares about it at this point?

370
00:19:12.047 --> 00:19:14.247
We already know that this is suicide.

371
00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:15.447
What?

372
00:19:15.447 --> 00:19:19.947
He probably used this ladder here.

373
00:19:19.947 --> 00:19:24.947
He got on here and pulled the rope through the thick beam there.

374
00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.947
No doubt this is suicide.

375
00:19:26.947 --> 00:19:28.747
According to what Mr. Hiroto told us,

376
00:19:28.747 --> 00:19:31.047
he said that his father was saying he wanted to die.

377
00:19:31.047 --> 00:19:32.547
No way...

378
00:19:32.547 --> 00:19:34.047
What am I going to do?

379
00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:36.247
I told everybody back at the station

380
00:19:36.247 --> 00:19:39.747
that I would video tape Sleeping Kogoro's deduction.

381
00:19:39.747 --> 00:19:43.147
Gosh.

382
00:19:43.147 --> 00:19:46.047
What am I going to tell everybody when I get back to the station?

383
00:19:46.047 --> 00:19:48.247
Well, all is well.

384
00:19:48.247 --> 00:19:49.947
Now that it's suicide, you don't have to

385
00:19:49.947 --> 00:19:51.547
go through the trouble of investigating any further.

386
00:19:51.547 --> 00:19:53.547
Well, that's true, but...

387
00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:56.647
Hey, don't think it's strange?

388
00:19:56.647 --> 00:19:58.847
This old man is bent over

389
00:19:58.847 --> 00:20:02.547
and only about 30cm taller than me and yet...

390
00:20:03.947 --> 00:20:05.747
See! The electric cable for the light here

391
00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:08.847
is made to fit the height of the old man and yet...

392
00:20:08.847 --> 00:20:11.247
I can't reach it even if I stretch my arm out.

393
00:20:13.747 --> 00:20:15.647
Now that you mentioned it.

394
00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:18.247
Which means that this is not suicide but...

395
00:20:18.247 --> 00:20:19.647
Well,

396
00:20:19.647 --> 00:20:22.847
some time ago when father got up late at night,

397
00:20:22.847 --> 00:20:24.647
the electric cable got in his eyes

398
00:20:24.647 --> 00:20:26.847
and he didn't like it all.

399
00:20:26.847 --> 00:20:30.647
So only the electric cable in my father's room is short.

400
00:20:30.647 --> 00:20:33.247
I see...

401
00:20:33.247 --> 00:20:35.147
So, it is suicide after all.

402
00:20:35.147 --> 00:20:36.447
Yes...

403
00:20:36.447 --> 00:20:39.447
We'll be waiting in the living room downstairs then,

404
00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:41.747
so if you have any questions just holler.

405
00:20:46.547 --> 00:20:48.247
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:49.847
For gotten all of you to be involved

407
00:20:49.847 --> 00:20:52.947
in something like this on your vacation.

408
00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:56.247
It's fine.

409
00:20:56.247 --> 00:20:58.647
Do you go fishing too?

410
00:20:58.647 --> 00:21:00.647
Because...

411
00:21:00.647 --> 00:21:03.547
See. Fishing for Beginners.

412
00:21:03.547 --> 00:21:07.247
That's a book my wife bought.

413
00:21:07.247 --> 00:21:10.047
The one who passed away from an illness three years ago?

414
00:21:10.047 --> 00:21:11.347
Yes.

415
00:21:11.347 --> 00:21:14.447
But, I've never seen her gone fishing,

416
00:21:14.447 --> 00:21:18.647
so maybe she was planning to do so after she recovered.

417
00:21:18.647 --> 00:21:20.247
Something's strange.

418
00:21:20.247 --> 00:21:22.847
There's something strange about him.

419
00:21:22.847 --> 00:21:27.547
He let's Ran go all the way upstairs to get the dish,

420
00:21:27.547 --> 00:21:31.447
the length of the electric cable of that room

421
00:21:31.447 --> 00:21:34.547
and the thing about his father's teeth being treated are all fishy.

422
00:21:34.547 --> 00:21:36.447
If he knew that his father had his teeth treated

423
00:21:36.447 --> 00:21:37.847
two or three days ago,

424
00:21:37.847 --> 00:21:40.947
why would he make something spicy like curry?

425
00:21:42.147 --> 00:21:44.047
If he was making food for the players

426
00:21:44.047 --> 00:21:45.247
when he was a trainer

427
00:21:45.247 --> 00:21:47.047
because he was concerned about their health,

428
00:21:47.047 --> 00:21:49.247
he should know of things like this.

429
00:21:50.547 --> 00:21:52.347
As for that curry,

430
00:21:52.347 --> 00:21:55.547
the amount that he made is way too much for just two of them.

431
00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:57.447
He couldn't have known beforehand

432
00:21:57.447 --> 00:21:59.847
that we would be coming here.

433
00:22:00.947 --> 00:22:02.347
And besides...

434
00:22:02.347 --> 00:22:05.247
There must be something

435
00:22:05.247 --> 00:22:07.447
with the way the electric cable is tied.

436
00:22:07.447 --> 00:22:11.347
There is definitely something behind this case.

437
00:23:43.447 --> 00:23:45.447
"Next Episode" -What do you mean "come to think of it"?

438
00:23:45.447 --> 00:23:46.647
It's nothing.

439
00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:49.947
But when I went in front of that room the first time,

440
00:23:49.947 --> 00:23:53.847
I heard the old man was crying.

441
00:23:53.847 --> 00:23:56.747
I got the picture of this trick.

442
00:23:56.747 --> 00:23:59.147
Okay then, now that I know.

443
00:24:03.747 --> 00:24:05.547
This is bad!

444
00:24:05.547 --> 00:24:07.047
I lost my voice!

445
00:24:08.147 --> 00:24:09.447
Next Conan,

446
00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:13.447
"The Suspicious Spicy Curry (Part 2)"

447
00:24:14.215 --> 00:24:16.415
Next Conan's Hint:

448
00:24:16.415 --> 00:24:18.415
"Electric cable"

449
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:20.015
I'll try and see something in the curry!

450
00:24:20.015 --> 00:24:21.915
Clean cut potatoes from the garden but it doesn't make sense.

451
00:24:21.915 --> 00:24:23.461
Out of nothing, he talks with a lot of spice.
