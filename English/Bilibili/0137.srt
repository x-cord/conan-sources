1
00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:04,282
Alibis, secret codes, tricks, deals.

2
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:06,382
The mysterious organization of men in black.

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:08,082
It's case closed for the mysterious castle!

4
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:09,782
Will Conan really be all right?

5
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,282
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:13,282
A child in appearance with the I.Q of an adult.

7
00:00:13,282 --> 00:00:15,782
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:57,195
We, the Youth Detective Squad and Dr. Agasa,

9
00:01:57,195 --> 00:01:59,195
set out to go camping.

10
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:02,295
We get lost on the way home,

11
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:04,895
and run into a castle surrounded by a forest.

12
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:09,195
We luckily get to stay over at the castle,

13
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,295
but the members of the Mamiya family

14
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:14,695
seem to be have a veiled history behind them.

15
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:19,195
I happen to find a hidden door in one of the rooms of the castle,

16
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:22,795
and ran into a mummified corpse!

17
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:24,595
However, just at that time...

18
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:33,695
"The Old Blue Castle (Part 2)"

19
00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:37,995
What is this supposed to be?

20
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,195
Doc.

21
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:04,695
Oh, hello, is this the police?

22
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:06,995
I'm calling on behalf of Shinichi Kudo.

23
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:11,295
Please put me through to Inspector Megure of the 1st division.

24
00:03:11,295 --> 00:03:15,295
Oh? Are you calling your friend or something, little lady?

25
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,395
Hello, this is Megure...

26
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:19,895
-Yes, I guess you could say that. -Hello...

27
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:22,395
Oh, Haibara!

28
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,495
There you are!

29
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,095
Geez, where'd you go?

30
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,595
Our bed's ready!

31
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:32,195
Where's Doc?

32
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:34,195
Wasn't he with you?

33
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:38,895
No. Maybe he's looking for the treasure in this castle.

34
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:56,195
Doc's bed is empty.

35
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,195
I'm sure something fell upon them after all.

36
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:01,595
Grandmother?

37
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:03,595
What brings you out here at this time of night?

38
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,895
I came to pick up my daughter

39
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,795
because it's taking her so long to come.

40
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:10,795
Just leave Mother up to us,

41
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:13,395
and go back to your room and rest.

42
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,195
Anyway, I need to investigate this matter.

43
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:37,495
Just as I thought.

44
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:42,395
Just what are you guys doing?

45
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:45,495
We're worried about Conan.

46
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,795
Dr. Agasa's not back either, besides...

47
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,795
We'll help you search too.

48
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:53,195
The more the merrier!

49
00:04:53,195 --> 00:04:55,395
Right, right!

50
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,395
Well, all right.

51
00:04:57,395 --> 00:04:59,195
I won't be held responsible even if you're killed.

52
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:03,495
-Hey? -What do you mean?

53
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,395
This is the room that...

54
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:13,095
The room that we came in the afternoon, right?

55
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:15,995
Kojima,

56
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:19,095
can you take the chair and put it by the under the clock?

57
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,895
Yeah.

58
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,495
Haibara?

59
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,195
What on earth are you doing?

60
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:41,395
What is this?

61
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:43,295
It's a hidden corridor.

62
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,895
It was rigged so that by manually spinning

63
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,295
the hand of the clock, the door opens.

64
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,395
Let's go.

65
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:53,795
Oh, that's...

66
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:57,495
Yes. Dr. Agasa gave this wristwatch type light to me.

67
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:00,295
Oh, so you got one from him too!

68
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:01,995
What do you mean, you too?

69
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:05,995
Oh, that's just great.

70
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:07,295
Let's go.

71
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:15,095
What a long stairway.

72
00:06:22,095 --> 00:06:24,295
What is that?

73
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:26,395
-It's blood. -What?

74
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:28,495
Judging from the color and how dry it is,

75
00:06:28,495 --> 00:06:30,695
it hasn't been here for that long yet.

76
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:33,795
Wow, Haibara, you're just like Conan!

77
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:36,195
We've got no time to waste.

78
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:39,595
This may be his blood, you know.

79
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,995
Please take a look! There are some letters carved on the stairs!

80
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:53,695
"He" is an impostor... trying to take the treasure of the castle...

81
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,695
It seems that the person

82
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:56,195
wanted to write "away from me" or something.

83
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:59,295
Could it be that Conan wrote this?

84
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:02,195
No, judging from the sentence, it can't be.

85
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:04,195
It seems to have been carved quite some time ago too.

86
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:05,995
Who on earth wrote it?

87
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:08,195
I don't know.

88
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,595
But, since the carving is cut off

89
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,495
before the sentence is finished.

90
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:15,895
The person couldn't finish writing for some reason.

91
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,195
Couldn't finish writing?

92
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:18,895
No...

93
00:07:18,895 --> 00:07:23,195
Right, it could be that the person died here.

94
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:28,995
If Conan found the corpse, and was distracted by it,

95
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:32,395
when someone either hit or stabbed him from behind,

96
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,195
that explains the blood stain.

97
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:36,995
Hey, something's on the floor!

98
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,295
It looks like glasses.

99
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,795
Hey, isn't this...

100
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,495
Dr. Agasa's glasses?

101
00:07:45,495 --> 00:07:48,995
Why is Dr. Agasa's glasses here?

102
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:51,595
It's cracked and it also has blood on it.

103
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:54,095
Could something have happened to Dr. Agasa?

104
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:57,595
Haibara?

105
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:59,095
What's the matter?

106
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:09,095
This is the place where I lost track of Dr. Agasa a while ago.

107
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:10,995
How strange.

108
00:08:10,995 --> 00:08:13,895
This door won't open.

109
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:15,895
But, Genta's still inside.

110
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,195
We have no choice

111
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:20,795
but to enter from where we first did and join him.

112
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,295
-Okay. -Darn!

113
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:25,795
What's going on? It opened just a while ago!

114
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,195
Huh?

115
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,095
It seems to be locked.

116
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,795
What? It was open just a while ago.

117
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:42,395
Somebody was tailing us.

118
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:43,995
The door was locked

119
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:45,895
so that we won't be able to go back along the corridor

120
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:48,295
and flee outside.

121
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:52,095
Although we coincidentally made it out the door just a while ago..

122
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:54,595
Which means that Genta...

123
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:57,895
There is no doubt that he probably fell into the hands

124
00:08:57,895 --> 00:08:59,895
of the person who tailed us.

125
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,695
Oh, no.

126
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:06,495
Let's look for another way to get into that corridor.

127
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:07,995
While there is still a possibility

128
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:11,895
of the threesome who disappeared still being alive.

129
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,695
What a big room...

130
00:09:14,695 --> 00:09:18,095
This is probably Sir Takahito's atelier

131
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,895
because he said he draws.

132
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:26,595
Wow, there are a whole lot of newspapers.

133
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:30,295
He uses them to wrap his drawings and wipe his brushes!

134
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:35,395
It sure does look old, though.

135
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:36,695
This is?

136
00:09:36,695 --> 00:09:38,895
An article of the fire that occurred 4 years ago!

137
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:46,395
That's...

138
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:51,995
It's Conan's glasses.

139
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,695
15 were killed in the fire.

140
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:02,695
Since the fire had burned the bones to ashes,

141
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:03,895
identification of the bodies

142
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,395
were made by the accessories they were wearing.

143
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,995
There is still one person whose whereabouts is still unknown.

144
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:11,595
So, someone took advantage of this fire,

145
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:14,595
and switched himself with another.

146
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:17,795
Mitsuhiko is gone.

147
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:24,895
Maybe he went inside that door.

148
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,095
Strange.

149
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,495
That's the entrance of the tower where the fire broke out.

150
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,595
It was supposed to have been locked.

151
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,095
-Mitsuhiko! -Wait.

152
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:37,395
It could be a trap.

153
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:40,095
I'll go inside and check it

154
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:44,095
so you go and hide in the grass nearby.

155
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,095
But...

156
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:48,395
If I don't come out by the time you count to 300,

157
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:50,295
get out of here immediately.

158
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:52,195
If you run down the path of the forest,

159
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,895
you may luckily be saved.

160
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:57,295
-Haibara... -You've got to be brave!

161
00:10:57,295 --> 00:11:00,995
You're going to give that bread to Conan, aren't you?

162
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,295
Yes.

163
00:11:13,495 --> 00:11:15,595
Two.

164
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:17,395
Three.

165
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:19,495
Four.

166
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:20,695
Five...

167
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:22,295
83.

168
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,895
84.

169
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:26,595
85. 86.

170
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,295
153.

171
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:30,195
154.

172
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:32,995
155... 298.

173
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:34,895
299.

174
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,995
3... 300.

175
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:50,495
I've counted till 300.

176
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:01,595
Haibara!

177
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:10,484
Where are you, Haibara?

178
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:14,184
Haibara!

179
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:20,684
If I don't come out by the time you count to 300,

180
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:22,184
get out of here immediately.

181
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:24,284
If you run down the path of the forest,

182
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,984
you may luckily be saved.

183
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,184
No... no way.

184
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,584
I can't run away,

185
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,884
because I'm taking this bread to Conan.

186
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,984
I'm not scared.

187
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:46,784
Where are you, Haibara?

188
00:12:46,784 --> 00:12:48,784
Please answer me!

189
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:57,484
Haibara!

190
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:08,884
This is...

191
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:10,584
the restroom.

192
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:13,484
Oh, Haibara?

193
00:13:16,084 --> 00:13:18,084
No... no.

194
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,884
It's not Haibara.

195
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:00,884
I think he's gone away.

196
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:05,584
Why didn't you listen to me and flee?

197
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:07,984
You were saved only because I just happened

198
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:09,384
to be in the hidden door.

199
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:12,484
Otherwise, you would've been killed by now!

200
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:13,984
But...

201
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:16,684
I can't run away alone,

202
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:19,884
knowing that you may all be in danger.

203
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:22,784
Goodness, what a girl.

204
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,384
Now, wipe your tears,

205
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:27,584
and let's set off to look for everyone.

206
00:14:27,584 --> 00:14:28,684
Okay.

207
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:33,484
Where's Mitsuhiko?

208
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:34,684
I wonder.

209
00:14:34,684 --> 00:14:37,284
If he came into this tower,

210
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:39,784
maybe he's been caught by the one we just encountered?

211
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,484
Oh, no.

212
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,084
Conan and the others are not here.

213
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:56,684
What did you do with your Youth Detective badges?

214
00:14:56,684 --> 00:15:00,284
Oh, the battery ran out, so we gave it to Dr. Agasa.

215
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,884
I see.

216
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:08,384
Oh, look. There's someone there.

217
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,384
See, over there.

218
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:15,484
Skeleton!

219
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,084
This is...

220
00:15:20,984 --> 00:15:23,884
It's been a skeleton for quite some time.

221
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:26,284
But, judging from the dust on it,

222
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:29,184
it's been put here not too long ago.

223
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:33,984
He seems to be the one who carved the letters on the stairs.

224
00:15:33,984 --> 00:15:38,184
It was probably moved here because Conan found it.

225
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:41,484
But, who is this person, anyway?

226
00:15:42,784 --> 00:15:47,184
Only the bones of the feet are much narrower than the other parts.

227
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,984
Besides, the teeth look like it's been grinding quite a bit.

228
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:52,684
And, the length of the hair, maybe a woman?

229
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:56,584
Don't tell me that the person who is pretending to be her is...

230
00:15:57,384 --> 00:16:00,584
What's the matter, little ladies?

231
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,584
I heard voices so I came to check.

232
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:09,184
Oh? Where is your other friend?

233
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:10,584
We're in great trouble!

234
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:14,484
All of my friends were captured by a bad person and...

235
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:16,184
Haibara!

236
00:16:18,284 --> 00:16:20,484
Hey, we have to take the old lady along too,

237
00:16:20,484 --> 00:16:22,084
or she'll be attacked by the bad person!

238
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:23,184
What're you talking about?

239
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,984
She's the one who attacked you a while ago!

240
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:27,084
What?

241
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:28,384
The bone of the corpse was of somebody

242
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:30,284
who hadn't walked for a long time!

243
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,984
Considering the sex and age,

244
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:34,384
there is no doubt that the corpse was that of Mrs. Mamiya!

245
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,984
Then, who is the one we just saw?

246
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,484
An impostor who had switched herself with Mrs. Mamiya.

247
00:16:38,484 --> 00:16:40,084
She got plastic surgery to look just like Mrs. Mamiya,

248
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:43,384
and as for little details she feigned being senile.

249
00:16:43,384 --> 00:16:45,284
She carried it out on the day of the fire!

250
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:46,984
She probably thought she couldn't keep deceiving

251
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,984
Mrs. Mamiya's daughter that she burned her to death!

252
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:51,984
If she knew of the existence of this underground path,

253
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:54,384
she could've committed arson without anybody knowing,

254
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:55,584
as well as sneak out,

255
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:59,184
get plastic surgery and come back!

256
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:06,484
She's probably after the treasure in this castle.

257
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,284
Right. She found out that my purpose for coming here

258
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:13,584
was the treasure and almost fired me.

259
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,584
So, I switched places with her.

260
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:18,984
Being that my voice sounded like hers to begin with.

261
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:21,484
Don't worry.

262
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:24,284
I won't keep you down in the dark underground

263
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,584
like I did that old lady.

264
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:28,584
I'll let you faint and then line you out

265
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:33,184
in the forest with your friends after 2 or 3 days.

266
00:17:33,184 --> 00:17:38,284
After your cheeks lose their plumpness and become super slim!

267
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,384
Cut it out.

268
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:49,184
Drastic dieting is not good for kids.

269
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:50,284
Right!

270
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,984
Those two are just fine the way they are!

271
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:53,984
Right, right!

272
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:57,084
It's healthier to eat until your stomach's full!

273
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,384
All of you...

274
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:01,084
How did you guys?

275
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:03,184
Thanks to Mitsuhiko.

276
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:05,884
He used the pursuit function of my glasses,

277
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,784
to detect our location by the transmission waves that were

278
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:09,884
being emitted by the badges of the Detective Squad

279
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:11,784
that Doc had on him!

280
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,784
Darn...

281
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:16,684
It's no use trying to get away.

282
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,884
Housekeeper whose whereabouts was unknown,

283
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,384
Miss Mutsumi Nishikawa!

284
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:24,284
I called a friend who is a plastic surgeon

285
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:28,084
and discovered your identity right away.

286
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:30,884
I asked him, "Do you remember any weird patient who came"

287
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:34,184
"and asked you to turn her into an old lady?"

288
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:37,984
Which means you guys so saw the corpse too.

289
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,284
I didn't have to look at the corpse

290
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,884
to tell that you were an impostor.

291
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:45,684
There is no way that Mrs. Mamiya who has never left the house,

292
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:48,684
nor taken a trip anywhere, could've possibly

293
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:51,684
felt inconvenienced by the size of the passport

294
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:54,184
that was changed 6 years ago.

295
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:56,784
Although I couldn't figure out that

296
00:18:56,784 --> 00:19:00,784
you traveled abroad several times to maintain that face of ours.

297
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:05,984
I'd like to compliment you for disclosing my true identity,

298
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,884
but you couldn't possibly capture me,

299
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:11,084
because I have this underground wired.

300
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,384
Huh? Are you going to run away?

301
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:16,084
I know how to get to the aisle that you were looking

302
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:17,584
for all this time.

303
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:19,184
What? Don't tell me you uncoded

304
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,984
the code hidden in the chess pieces in the yard?

305
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:25,084
Yeah! Chess pieces are usually designated

306
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:29,184
by the letters "A" to "H", and the numbers "1" to "8"!

307
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,284
Judging from the position of the Knight,

308
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:31,784
the correct way to view the chess board

309
00:19:31,784 --> 00:19:33,684
is from the stoned pavement.

310
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,184
Viewing it from that direction...

311
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:38,384
If you read it off in order, it goes...

312
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:45,384
E-G-G-H-E-A-D, "Egg head"

313
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,584
which means argumentative intellectual.

314
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:53,884
Yes, it's about Sir Mamiya who thought tip the code.

315
00:19:55,184 --> 00:19:57,484
All you have to do next is turn the portrait in the direction

316
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:59,884
designated by the black pieces, which is left.

317
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:09,284
The entrance to the secret aisle will open up.

318
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:13,584
Oh, having served in this castle for 20 years.

319
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:16,984
I finally get to see the treasure that I've been seeking.

320
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:20,284
I'm not letting anybody have it. Not anybody!

321
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:27,984
Oh! On the other side of the glittering door...

322
00:20:27,984 --> 00:20:30,184
is my treasure!

323
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:44,084
This is my treasure?

324
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:45,484
Where is it?

325
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,584
It's written on the door, isn't it?

326
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:51,884
"I'll give this beautiful scenery of the castle"

327
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,984
"to the first one who arrives here," it says.

328
00:20:56,984 --> 00:20:58,684
Ridiculous...

329
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:03,684
You mean I killed many just for something like this?

330
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:05,584
For something like this,

331
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:09,084
I changed my face to an ugly old woman...

332
00:21:09,084 --> 00:21:13,084
For... for something like this?

333
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:17,784
An hour later, the police arrived

334
00:21:17,784 --> 00:21:20,584
and she was taken away.

335
00:21:20,584 --> 00:21:25,984
A truly old woman who has lost her soul,

336
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,084
a wretched sight.

337
00:22:59,784 --> 00:23:03,884
Sir Mitsuru was disappointed about the treasure of the castle,

338
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,584
but, his son Takahito seemed to be relieved

339
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,484
at hearing that the killer was arrested.

340
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:10,184
It seems that he was suspicious about the fire

341
00:23:10,184 --> 00:23:11,784
that broke out 4 years ago,

342
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:15,684
and was searching around in secret.

343
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:16,884
That hidden aisle

344
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,084
was something that came with the castle to begin with,

345
00:23:19,084 --> 00:23:20,984
and Sir Mamiya being a historian,

346
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:24,384
made a complete replica of it when he rebuilt the castle.

347
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:26,484
This castle sure was a lot of fun!

348
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:28,284
It was really thrilling and full of suspense indeed!

349
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:29,584
Very true!

350
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:30,884
Hey...

351
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:33,984
Conan and I were hit and knocked out, you know.

352
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:39,184
Oh, Sir Takahito says he'll prepare breakfast for all of you!

353
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,484
Eat before you leave! You, with the glasses,

354
00:23:41,484 --> 00:23:43,784
you haven't eaten anything since last night, have you?

355
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:48,284
No thanks, we got food supply for camp in the car too.

356
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:52,784
And besides, for me, this bread is more than a feast!

357
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:58,684
Oh, I think I'll accept the invitation, then.

358
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:00,084
Me too!

359
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,484
Hey...

360
00:24:08,184 --> 00:24:10,884
Okay, go for it, Gomera!

361
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:12,584
What's the matter?

362
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,584
There's some kind of black shadow!

363
00:24:23,684 --> 00:24:25,184
What's wrong, Mitsuhiko?

364
00:24:25,184 --> 00:24:27,284
I saw it.

365
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,184
Next Conan,

366
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,305
"Last Show for Murder (Part 1)"

00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:36,286
Takagi's Next Conan's Hint:

368
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,486

The stage of the next episode will be at a theatre.

370
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:41,686
Someday I'd like to go with Officer Sato to...

371
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:43,286
I'm so embarrassed!
