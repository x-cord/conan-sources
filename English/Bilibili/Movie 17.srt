- Yup!

That's an awfully dry explanation.

in this stuff, Ayumi-chan?

No...

Oh, I just wanted to test

47
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,480
We haven't even boarded the ship yet,
let alone setting sail.

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,160
Strange. It sure is taking long.

49
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,120
Yeah. After they found that ship this morning,
they must have increased security.

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,250
So that's it.

51
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,630
I was eager
to test the satellite phone too,

52
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,230
but it sounds like we'd better not use it this time.

- Uhoh. I better get back in line.
- Before you do...

Um, not really.

63
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,040
Is that why you called?

64
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,650
The name "Aegis destroyer"
is taken from Greek mythology.

65
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,420
We all know that Aegis was a shield
given by Zeus to his daughter Athena

66
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,780
to ward off bad luck.

67
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,930
When Zeus fought the monster Hydra,

68
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,430
the Hydra's sharp teeth bit Zeus's body
in several places.

69
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,450
But there was one place he wasn't bit.

70
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,560
Where was it?

71
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,980
1. His lips.

72
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,940
2. His chest.

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,910
3. His stomach.

74
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,710
4. His waist.

75
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,250
That's it.

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,930
The professor insisted that I ask.

77
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,690
Hmm...

78
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,300
Wait a second, when did you have a chance
to talk to the Professor, Conan?

79
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,400
Huh? Oh, when I went
to the bathroom just now.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,380
Hey, Conan. I can't figure it out.

81
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,430
I don't know either.

82
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,610
What's the answer?

83
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,770
- The answer is number four, "his waist."
- Why?

84
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,750
"The hydra let the waist go to waste."

85
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,660

- Huh?

107

What time is it?

108
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,300
Um...

109
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,400
- Don't you have your watch, Ran Nee-chan?
- I'm having it fixed.

110
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,890
In the meantime, I've been using
my cellphone to tell the time.

111
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,830
But then they took our phones.

112

- Okay... Thank you, Mitsuhiko-kun.
- Sure!

117
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,780
It's waterproof too, so you
don't have to worry about sea winds.

118
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,000
And it's an atomic clock,
so it's super accurate!

119
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,420
What's an atomic clock?

120
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,160
You don't know?

121
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,690
It's a clock that tells time
using a signal that it gets twice a day.

122
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,840
Wow!

123
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,180
By the way, the two times
are morning and evening at 5 o'clock.

124
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,330
Where does the signal come from?

125
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,670
Oh, well um...

126
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,540
In this area, I think it would
come from Fukushima.

127
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,760
Really?

128
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,770
You sure are well informed, Conan-kun.

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,190
I learned it from Shinichi Ni-chan.

130
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,250
Huh? What's going on?

131
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,900
What's that weird sound?

132
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,180
Hey, what's happening?

133
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,650
Calm down, sir. We're fine.

134
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,010
That sound occurs
when a high volume of water

135
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,700
is pulled into the inlet
valve by the ship's bilge pump.

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,910
- Dad, please!
- You may sit down.

137
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,310
Oh, and...

138
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,600
Your mouth's bilge pump seems to have
a loose valve. You might want to check it.

139
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,370
Oh, thank you. Sorry about that.

140
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,480
Dad! Sit down, please!

141
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,240
Unbelievable...

142
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,890
But could that sound
have really come from a pump?

I'm the high school student detective
Shinichi Kudo.

145
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,590
I had come to an amusement park with my
childhood friend and classmate Ran Mouri,

146
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,480
when I saw a man dressed all in black
making a suspicious transaction.

147
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,450
I was so focused on witnessing the trade,

148
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,830
that I didn't notice his companion
approaching me from behind.

149
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,050
The man forced a poison pill
down my throat

150
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,110
and when I awoke,

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,800
my body had shrunk.

152
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,190
If my enemies figured out
that I'm still alive,

153
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,710
they might come after me again
and those around me would be in danger.

154
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,430
At the advice of Dr. Agasa,
I decided to hide my true identity,

155
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,420
and when Ran happened to ask my name,
I immediately replied Conan Edogawa.

were invented by Dr. Agasa.

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,100
By the way,

175
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,340
the professor is not the only one

176
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,740
who knows my true identity.

177
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,530
Ai Haibara.

178
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,790
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

179
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,940
At one time

180
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,300
she was an ally of the men in black.

181
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,920
but to escape the organization,

182
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,420
she drank the same poison
as me

183
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,980
and her body shrunk in size.

184
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,590
After that, she moved in with the Professor

185
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,400
and the two of us began to live
as first graders.

186
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,730
Our bodies have shrunk,
but our brains remain the same.

187
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,010
No maze is too difficult
for a great detective...

188
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,500
And only one truth will prevail!

189
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,240
Prepare for anti-aircraft training.

190
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,210
All crew to your stations.

191
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,680
The ship will now begin
anti-airfcraft drills.

192
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
All crew to your stations, immediately!

193
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,390
Guests with small children
please come to the front.

194
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:57,420
We will now conduct
public anti-aircraft drills.

195
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,270
Keep your eyes peeled for aircraft.

196
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,770
This is the heart of the Aegis Destroyer.

197
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,560
It's also known as CIC.

198
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,840
The first target is approaching.

199
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,030
- 35 degrees, 66 miles per hour!
- They're coming this way?

200
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,960
It's just a drill.

201
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,210
I see.

202
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,700
So that's it.
They shouldn't surprise us like that.

203
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,090
They seem very cool about it all.

204
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,240
Yeah. They don't bother
to put on a show.

205
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,410
Well, that's what reality is like.

206
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,290
Target Two will now attack the ship.

207
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,940
The ship has judged
Target Two to be a threat.

208
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,910
Counter-attack will begin immediately.

209
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,050
Anti-aircraft weapons,
follow instructions from CIC.

210
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,480
Commence fire!

211
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,190
Prepare single-mounted gun!

212
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,510
Mark 45 cannon, mode four.
Prepare to fire.

213
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,130
Attacks on Target Two
will be carried out remotely.

214
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,410
Target is within firing range.

215
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,550
Prepare to fire!

216
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,100
On my command. Fire!

217
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,370
Target collision in 30 seconds.

218
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,940
What gives? We only get
graphics on a monitor?

219
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,590
Dad, stop it!

220
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,630
Even seeing the graphics is amazing.

221
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,710
This is Aegis's biggest secret.

222
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,070
It's the first time
it has been shown to civilians.

223
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,250
Oh, well it certainly does seem top secret.

224
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,750
Target Two has been shot down.

225
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,410
It's just like a video game.

226
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,070
Confirming destruction of target two.

227
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,580
Do you think we could operate it?

228
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,350
No way!

229
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,310
Hey, not you guys too!

230
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,770
Ready to fire.

231
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,910
Fire!

232
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,570
Auto mode.

233
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,900
Mark intercepted.

234
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,830
Target one dropping in altitude.

235
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,740
12 seconds until impact.

236
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,180
Target one shot down.

237
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,860
Huh? They hit it?

238
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,970
Yes. All enemy aircraft
have now been shot down.

239
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,460
Oh!

240
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,880
That was cool!

241
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,500
-Yeah.
-Is that it?

242
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,660
I can't say I understood it.

243
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,670
- With that, we will now...
- Radar alert! Nationality unknown!

244
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,860
Detecting enemy, designated target Alpha!

245
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,070
Target is approaching ship!

246
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,620
Target Alpha converging at five degrees.

247
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,810
Distance of 8000.

248
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,100
This is CIC.

249
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,130
Target Alpha detected.

250
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,690
- Converging at five degrees, distance 8000.
- Target Alpha?

251
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,810
-Captain!
-Yes.

252
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,970
This is Captain Tateishi.

253
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,080
(Yukio Tateishi, Captain of the Hotaka. Rank, Captain)
All radar stations, begin detection.

254
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm enroute to CIC.

255
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,250
I'll accompany you.

256
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,500
Right.

257
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,820
We're going to CIC.

258
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,360
We will now shift environmental control
to the prefectural office.

259
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,890
Enemy target Alpha,
speed and depth unchanged.

260
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,380
It's heading straight for us!

261
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,160
Roger. Be ready for sudden changes
in target's trajectory.

262
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,990
Prepare for incoming fire!

263
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,350
No possibility
that it's a natural lifeform.

264
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,080
No response to friend or foe
identification request.

265
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,180
It's a submerged object,
untraceable to any allies.

266
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,450
Activate Gypsy!
Pause ship movement at minus one.

267
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,910
Left full rudder!

268
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,090
Left!

269
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,650
-Target has stopped at bow.
-Roger.

270
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,950
Left full rudder!

271
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,240
Left!

272
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,030
Prepare 90-degree mobile cannon!

273
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,550
Did the ship really just stop?

274
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,460
-Ship halted!
-It suddenly seems a lot more realistic.

275
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,190
Yeah. This is intense.

276
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,890
-Send a luminous anti-submarine signal.
-Roger.

277
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,900
Signal ready.

278
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,410
Firing luminous signal.

279
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,720
Image will appear on Monitor 3.

280
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,400
-This is so cool!
-Yeah!

281
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,520
Isn't it amazing? That light seemed real.

282
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,750
No way!

283
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,770
Prepare for anti-submarine combat!

284
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,000
Warning red!

285
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,110
Yes sir!

286
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,260
Everyone, the ship may
sway a bit.

287
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,810
Reposition data and seek confirmation
from approaching undersea vessel!

288
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,820
Did something happen?

289
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,860
This really is a drill, right?

290
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,470
Of course it is.

291
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,430
Things are finally getting interesting!

292
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,720
No, this may be...

293
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,340
The acoustic echoes are growing duller.

294
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,390
What's the status?

295
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,510
Image unclear.
Detection status insufficient.

296
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,860
Deactivate spy.

297
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,830
Confirm target with SH60K.

298
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,180
Target getting closer.

299
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,510
SH60K ready.

300
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,280
Distance 3200 meters.

301
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,310
The ship has entered
torpedo range of the target.

302
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,470
What?

303
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
-Still no response from the target?
-Nothing yet!

304
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,510
Target coming closer.

305
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,450
Distance 3100 meters.

306
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,880
100 meters until target in torpedo range.

307
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,210
Captain, what do we do?

308
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,260
All crew, prepare for counter attack.

309
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,410
Captain, wait!

310
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,960
If we do that, we'll be in open combat.

311
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,350
Target speed 10, distance 3000.

312
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,780
Within firing range of target.

313
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,840
Maintaining distance of 3000.

314
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,970
Flagship, full speed ahead!

315
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,900
Roger!

316
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,550
Flagship, full speed ahead!

317
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,240
Evasive manuevers!

318
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
Hard to starboard, full speed!

319
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,390
This is really intense.

320
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,540
It's way better than a video game!

321
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm kinda scared.

322
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,670
I don't blame them for being scared.

323
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,700
This Aegis Destroyer
is actually under attack.

324
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,100
No response from target.
Approaching from 40 degrees, port side!

325
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,700
I wanted to see who we're dealing with.
Flash torpedo!

326
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,590
Prepare flash torpedo!
Flagship hard to port!

327
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,680
Hard to port!

328
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,430
Preparing antisubmarine flash torpedo!

329
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,610
Orders from CIC.

330
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,680
Flagship, hard to port.

331
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,790
-Hard to port!
-Port!

332
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,400
This is the left cannon.

333
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,480
Antisubmarine flash torpedo loaded!

334
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,130
Fire torpedo!

335
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,250
Antisubmarine flash torpedo fired!

336
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,590
Field of vision about to clear!

337
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,960
Image will appear on monitor 3.

338
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,290
-Huh?
-Brace for impact!

339
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,580
The ship is about to sway a bit.
Please keep an eye on the children.

340
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,630
Hey, are you all okay?!

341
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,630
Yeah.

342
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,250
That was pretty rough!

343
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,830
So cool!

344
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,090
Hey, where's that child's guardian?

345
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,340
What is that?

346
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,690
A submarine?

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,210
No... I don't think so.

348
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,450
A fishing boat. It's abandoned.

349
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,370
What's going on?

350
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,080
There's no possibility
of explosives onboard.

351
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,080
It's just an abandoned ship,
carried by the tide.

352
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,100
Cease anti-submarine operations!

353
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,940
Anti-submarine submarine operations ceased.

354
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,430
Ship returning
to normal public drill route.

355
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,100
Repeat.

356
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,340
Ship returning
to normal public drill route.

357
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,000
US Navy submarines...

358
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,140
Is it over?

359
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,090
Yes, that concludes
our anti-aircraft combat drills.

360
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,930
That was amazing.

361
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,610
Yeah, I thought we were really in battle.

362
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,620
I even forgot I was hungry.

363
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,440
They call that a drill?

364
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,850
Now, please enjoy a tour of the ship's bow.

365
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,920
Okay!

366
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,760
The self-defense forces surely are cool.

367
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,910
- I'd like to try one of those uniforms on.
- Me, too!

368
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,890
Conan, hurry up!

369
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,510
Aegis destroyers are pretty big.

370
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,520
I wonder what its measurements are.

371
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,000
It feels even bigger than that.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,530
I wonder if that's the ship
they were shooting at in the video.

373
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,130
Conan, join the photo with us!

374
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,290
Oh, uh... sure!

375
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,270
Over here!

376
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,940
-Yuki, let's go.
-Okay.

377
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,280
-Don't let go of my hand, okay Yuki?
-Hey, that child...

378
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,790
Right.

379
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,320
Hey there. Your name's Yuki, huh?

380
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,760
Eh? Yeah...

381
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,980
I'm glad to see you found your dad.

382
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,640
What do you mean, little boy?

383
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,510
Well, when the ship was swaying just now,

384
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,170
you weren't there, mister.

385
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,200
I was worried.

386
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,480
Oh, well I happened
to be in the bathroom, then.

387
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,220
I see! So that's it.

388
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,160
That's why he was all alone...

389
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,930
Now then, let's go
see the other side, Yuki.

390
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,390
Okay.

391
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,350
Toilet or not,
he would have felt the ship rocking.

392
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,060
But even after the combat drill at CIC,

393
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,970
he didn't show himself
until we had free time on the deck.

394
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,730
Something's not right.

395
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Hey, you! No more running around!

396
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,190
The minute we turn away, you will disappear...

397
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,390
Oh, sorry...

398
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,920
There are female crew
on the Aegis Destroyer?

399
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,810
Hey, you don't seem very sorry!

400
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,980
Wow, cool!

401
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,230
A female crew member!

402
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,220
I've never seen that before.
Let's take a picture!

403
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,460
-You're right!
-This is great!

404
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,740
Come on, come on!

405
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,760
Say, Miss... will you take a photo with us?

406
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,250
A photo?
(Nanami Fujii. Rank: Captain)

407
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,550
What a beauty!

408
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,120
A great detective
and a beautiful soldier.

409
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,680
This could work.

410
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,610
My lady...

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,060
I'm sorry these children can't behave themselves

412
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,150
around an officer
with sacred duties like yourself.

413
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,360
Oh, uh...

414
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,670
Dad! Stop it!

415
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,960
What? I just wanted
to take a photo with her.

416
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,840
In that case, there is no need to stand so close.

417
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,690
Mitsuhiko, lend me your camera.

418
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,780
Huh? Okay...

419
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,000
Thank you.

420
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,170
Okay everybody, look over here!

421
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,600
- Yay!
- I'm sorry but photos...

422
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,760
We can take them, right?

423
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,890
After all, look around!

424
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,680
Can you take a photo of us next?

425
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,640
Is this how you salute?

426
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,070
Do it with us next, please.

427
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,550
I see... Very well.

428
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,580
Alright!

429
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,870
I wanna stand next to her!

430
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,980
No, me!

431
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,250
Let me in too!

432
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,440
Conan-kun, don't you want to join?

433
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,350
I'm fine. Ran Nee-chan,
you should get closer.

434
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,590
Okay.

435
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,010
Now then, here I go.

436
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,280
- Oh, sorry. One more picture.
- Huh?

437
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,680
Are you sure you know how to do it?

438
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,760
Sorry, I had the wrong setting on.

439
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,830
There, that's perfect.

440
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,240
For real, this time.

441
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,850
Say "Aegis"!

442
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,430
Yay!

443
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,030
Well? Did you get it?

444
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,780
Yeah. This one's perfect.

445
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,970
Let me see!

446
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,800
Thank you very much.

447
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,280
Not at all. Now, you'll have to excuse me.

448
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,410
Say, miss soldier!

449
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,560
What is it?

450
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,470
What work do you do on the ship?

451
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,960
I'm in charge of cooking for everyone.

452
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,570
I see.

453
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,320
On an Aegis,
she would be eligible for captain.

454
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,200
She's lying. Her insignia indicates
she's a first-class officer.

455
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,310
Now, you'll excuse me. I have work to do.

456
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,210
Thank you very much!

457
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,410
Oh, may I at least give you my card?

458
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,400
I apologize. Please feel free to ignore him
and return to your work.

459
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,860
(Detective Mouri's Agency, Kogoro Mouri)
Huh? Aren't these cards a little flashy?

460
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,920
Good job, boy! Miss, wait!

461
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,680
You there, the beautiful lady!

462
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,130
What an embarrassment.

463
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,340
Sorry, Sonoko. Hold these, will you?

464
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,960
What an ugly business card!

465
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,990
He said he wanted a new design

466
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,850
that would stand out at a crime scene.

467
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,080
But somehow,
I don't think he's using them right...

468
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,800
Mitsuhiko.

469
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,410
Can you lend me that camera again?

470
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,690
Sure.

471
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:41,340
-Here.
-And give this card to Ran Nee-chan.

472
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,510
-Um, okay.
-I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

473
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,050
-Huh?
-Conan-kun!

474
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,860
What photos is he gonna take
in the bathroom?

475
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,940
By the way, Ai-kun...

476
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,510
Yes?

477
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,630
Do you think the children
enjoyed the riddle I gave them?

478
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,890
As long as the answer wasn't "4. waist".

479
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,390
Hello?

480
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,860
Professor, I'd like you
to look into something.

481
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,600
Oh, it's you Shinichi.

482
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,340
Hmm? You sent a photo to Ai-kun's phone?

483
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,290
Got it. We'll take a look.

484
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,600
Say, don't tell me
some kind of accident happened?

485
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,430
No, there's just something bothering me.

486
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,610
Did the photo arrive?

487
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,370
Yes. We have it.

488
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,600
It looks like a female naval officer.

489
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,370
Only one photo?

490
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,790
Yes. I'd like you to look up
what organization she's part of.

491
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,260
Women make up only four percent
of the maritime SDF.

492
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,310
They'll often be introduced in public
for PR purposes.

493
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,640
You should be able to find it.

494
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,860
I see. Yes, we should be able to find it.

495
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,500
By the way, what about the quiz?

496
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,940
He hung it up.

497
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,460
Too bad.

498
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,020
A satellite signal?

499
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,040
From where on the deck?

500
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,860
The deck area on the starboard bow.

501
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,470
That's near the place where the guest passengers are.

502
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,880
Go look into it!

503
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,910
Yes, sir.

504
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,340
This is CIC to all stations...

505
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,310
Captain! You don't think
X is among the passengers?

506
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,090
Could it be that X had something to do

507
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,920
with that abandoned ship approaching us?

508
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,070
X...

509
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,730
Here you see the radar that functions
as the eyes of the Aegis destroyer.

510
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,740
It may not look like much,

511
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,480
but this radar can detect
distances over 450 km.

512
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,020
It can also detect
more than 200 targets at once

513
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,460
Wow!

514
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,780
It's the Great Detective of the sea!

515
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,520
How cool!

516
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,510
That spot...

517
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,470
That's where I had
my call with the Professor.

518
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,170
They must have caught my satellite signal.

519
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,680
Either that or...

520
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,820
The Aegis system developed by the U.S.

521
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,580
is only provided to America's trusted allies.

522
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,300
Right. Understood.

523
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,170
We should probably report this.

524
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,100
Please do. I'll go search the deck.

525
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
Next, I will explain

526
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,140
about the SH60K helicopter
at the ship's stern.

527
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,630
Wow, a helicopter!

528
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,280
- Cool! I can't wait!
- What's wrong, Conan-kun?

529
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,090
Oh, I need to go to the bathroom.

530
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,480
What? Again?!

531
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,050
Hold it, Conan-kun.

532
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,780
I'm going with you.

533
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,420
Huh? I'm fine by myself.

534
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,610
No, whenever I let you out of my sight,
you wander off somewhere else.

535
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,260
- That's not...
- You did it just now.

536
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,360
Now then, let's go.

537
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,780
Okay...

538
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,490
Even I almost got lost while looking
for the bathroom just now.

539
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,500
You're in high school
and you still get lost...

540
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,580
That's right. She's always been that way.

541
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,410
Unbelievable. How far did you
have to go to buy drinks?

542
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,250
Sorry! I got lost on my way back.

543
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,280
That's why I offered to go with you.

544
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,720
Yeah, but...

545
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,160
No more wondering around alone.

546
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,790
Next time you might not make it back.

547
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,480
I'll be fine.

548
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,830
No matter how I get lost,

549
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,870
you'll find me right?

550
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,940
You're a famous detective
after all, Shinichi.

551
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,850
That's cold!

552
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,340
You...

553
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,710
Don't worry.

554
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,760
Huh?

555
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,890
If you get lost on your own,

556
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,680
I'll find you no matter where you are.

557
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,310
Wherever you are.

558
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,470
Huh?

559
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,040
Isn't the bathroom this way?

560
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,710
I'm sorry, Conan-kun. I think we're lost.

561
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,220
You never disappoint...

562
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,440
Whose voice was that?

563
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,600
Conan-kun!

564
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,690
Sawamura-san, we've drawn in
something terrible from the water.

565
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,910
Something terrible?

566
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,500
Hey, that's...

567
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,860
-Hey, you two. This area is off-limits.
ｰDon't tell me...

568
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,200
That's a human arm.

569
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,170
This is bad.

570
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,240
What do we do?

571
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,640
First things first, you all need
to report this to the captain.

572
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,930
Yes.

573
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,070
Ran Nee-chan,

574
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,630
we should tell Kogoro Oji-san.

575
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,000
Right...

576
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,760
Excuse me, perhaps you
should consult with my father.

577
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,230
The object on the table
is a human arm, isn't it?

578
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,980
That's--

579
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,930
My father is Kogoro Mouri.

580
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,420
Perhaps you've heard of him? The famous
Detective known as Kogoro the Sleeper.

581
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,130
(Detective Mouri's Agency
Detective Kogoro Mouri)

582
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,810
(Kaiho Gakuen)

583
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,950
Oh! It's you, Kudo.

584
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,770
Eh? A body?

585
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,260
You said a body turned up
on an Aegis Destroyer?

586
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,540
(Off-limits)
Actually, all they've found is a left arm.

587
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,830
And if I'm right,

588
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,360
it was a piece of left armed clothes
in a Maritime SDF uniform.

589
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,520
Serious? So then, the victim was SDF?

590
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,680
I don't know yet
if it was an accident or a murder.

591
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,760
But I'm certain the dead person
was a 1st Lieutenant.

592
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,540
Sounds fishy.

593
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,660
Okay, got it.

594
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,190
I'll leave right away
and wait for your call.

595
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,680
Bastard!

596
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,560
After school clubs have already started!

597
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,130
I got no time for that!

598
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,490
I gotta go to Maizuru.

599
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,100
Huh? Maizuru? Hey, Heiji!

600
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,330
There's no one here.

601
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,400
Right...

602
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
We don't see any equipment capable
of satellite communication.

603
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,930
I knew it. They picked up my signal.

604
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,360
X may have infiltrated the ship.

605
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:38,870
Understood.

606
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,950
X?

607
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,030
Oh no!

608
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,490
Did you hear a weird noise?

609
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,780
Shinichi's signal has been cut.

610
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,630
I wonder if something happened.

611
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,470
And we were about to tell him
the results of our search.

612
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,750
(No results found. Please try again)

613
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,380
I guess it was my imagination.

614
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,550
Right...

615
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,840
It was nothing.

616
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,720
We'll resume patrol.

617
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,540
That was close.

618
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,270
I should have known an Aegis ship
would have heavy security.

619
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,380
Even so, I have to find
another way to communicate.

620
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,600
They'll catch me
if I use their equipment...

621
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,040
That mark...

622
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,460
It means there's a strong magnetic field
being generated.

623
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,760
If I use this room...

624
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,990
I'm Captain Tateishi.

625
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,560
You must be Mouri-san.

626
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,630
Indeed. I'm the Great Detective
Kogoro Mouri.

627
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,300
I heard everything
from First Lieutenant Sekiguchi.

628
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,440
(Makoto Sekiguchi, Wakasa Unit, Military Police Captain)
I'm Sekiguchi, an MP.

629
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,170
An MP? In other words,
the SDF's military police?

630
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,620
- Yes.
- I see.

631
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,960
And that's the body part, is it?

632
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,040
Yes. It's over here.

633
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,610
Well, well.

634
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,650
It doesn't look like it has been severed
with a sharp object.

635
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,290
And judging from the wound,
there was no live body response.

636
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,200
So you think it was severed after death?

637
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,290
Yes. Where was the arm found?

638
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,510
In the filter for the ship's bilge pump.

639
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,170
If I'm correct about those devices...

640
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,890
That sound occurs
when a high volume of water

641
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,090
is pulled into the inlet
valve by the ship's bilge pump.

642
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,750
So then, that sound we heard...

643
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,150
When we depart from Maizuru Port,

644
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,510
the pump sometimes takes in garbage
that had been floating on the sea water.

645
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,580
The arm must have been caught
in the filter at that time.

646
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,000
A filter?

647
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,760
When sea water is sucked into the ship,

648
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,140
there's a filter to prevent us
from drawing in garbage, fish and shells.

649
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:51,610
It's like a big net put over the valve.

650
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,390
Then how did...

651
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,590
If there's a piece of garbage
obstructing the filter,

652
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,010
we sometimes retrieve it for inspection.

653
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,530
It's usually large pieces
of seaweed or plastic.

654
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,890
Do you have any idea whose arm this is?

655
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,220
So, you do.

656
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,930
Who is it, Captain Tateishi?

657
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,890
Judging by the insignia on his cuffs
and this wristwatch,

658
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,960
it appears to be a First Lieutenant
from the Wakasa unit.

659
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,580
After confirming with the base,

660
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,870
a lieutenant named Sasaura is currently
whereabouts unknown.

661
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,320
There doesn't seem to be any doubt, then.

662
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,510
Looks like his watch stopped at 5:30 AM.

663
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,860
How do you know it's AM?

664
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,440
You can tell by how
the calendar wheel is half turned.

665
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,070
The fact that we can still see part of the
previous day's name means it was morning.

666
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,170
Was Sasaura-san a crewmember of the Aegis?

667
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,900
He was onboard from time to time,

668
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,400
but was not part of the current shift.

669
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,140
The bilge pump was activated

670
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,000
when we left Maizuru Port, right?

671
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,820
Yes, and I think it was at that time

672
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,350
that Lieutenant Sasaura's left arm
was severed by the valve.

673
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,690
I see.

674
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,940
So at that point, his body
was already floating

675
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,590
in the water near Maizuru Port.

676
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,290
And then, when the pump began operating,
the body was pulled in

677
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,130
with the sea water
and got caught in the valve.

678
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,280
Only the left arm remained in the filter.

679
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,620
That about sums it up.

680
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,180
Yes, I think that's correct.

681
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,760
Very well, when do you return to the port?

682
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,020
We are scheduled to return at 5:30 PM.

683
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,020
Not good...

684
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,990
Judging from the state of the arm,

685
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,410
we'll need a full-body autopsy
performed right away.

686
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,640
That reminds me...

687
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,800
There's a helicopter onboard!

688
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,480
Wow! Cool!

689
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,460
So this is where you steer the ship.

690
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,680
Conan-kun!

691
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,260
Damn it, boy! Stay out of here!

692
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,420
Well, I was looking for the helicopter

693
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,240
when I heard your voice.

694
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,530
A helicopter...

695
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,280
I see. With that,
we can carry the body right away.

696
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,380
But if we use the helicopter,
the other passengers will notice.

697
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,650
There's no time to worry about that.

698
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,020
Mouri-san, if the passengers
find out about this,

699
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,960
they're sure to panic.

700
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,660
I wanna see the helicopter fly!

701
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,450
Just like you did with that cannon earlier!

702
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,910
If you fly the helicopter
like it's part of the demonstration...

703
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,190
That's it. If we do that,
no one will suspect.

704
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,780
Captain Tateishi,

705
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,630
every second matters at this point.

706
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,070
Very well.

707
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,950
Prepare the helicopter immediately.

708
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,870
What? On an Aegis destroyer?
(Metropolitan Police Bureau)

709
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,780
Right. Understood.

710
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,680
We'll contact
the Kyoto Prefectural Police right away.

711
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:39,090
And as soon as we have permission to board,

712
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,520
we'll head to your location.

713
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,400
Right. Thank you.

714
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,980
There's a chance the culprit
is onboard this ship.

715
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,250
Right. First, we'll need you
to inspect the left arm.

716
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,330
Yes. Thank you again.

717
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,570
Ladies and Gentleman, we will now
perform a demonstration

718
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,380
of a helicopter launch.

719
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,000
There will be danger until it leaves
the deck. Please step away from the fence.

720
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,310
Thank goodness.
It looks like we're in time.

721
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,710
Yes. Oh, hey it's you.

722
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,500
Is something wrong?

723
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,070
Is your dad gone again?

724
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,800
You were alone before, right?

725
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,470
Are you okay, little boy?

726
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,050
Where are your mom and dad?

727
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,440
At least his dad is here.

728
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,200
But he seems to have gone somewhere.

729
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,260
I see.

730
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,730
Your name is Yuki, right?

731
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,530
Yes.

732
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,980
In that case, you should stay with him, Conan.

733
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,920
I'll go ask an SDF soldier what to do about Yuki-kun.

734
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,420
Wait, don't! If you do that...

735
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,280
Do what?

736
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,720
I'm... okay.

737
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,860
I don't need your help.

738
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,730
Yuki-kun, wait!

739
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,340
Here. You dropped this.

740
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,670
- Oh...
- What kind of pills are those?

741
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,330
For rashes.

742
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,080
They stop me from itching.

743
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,400
Is there a reason you need them?

744
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,940
I'm not supposed to drink milk.

745
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,420
Oh, I see. It's for a food allergy.

746
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,630
Yuki-kun, wait!

747
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,490
- My dad told me.
- Huh?

748
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,780
He wants me to become a strong boy.

749
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,940
That's why he named me Yuki,
"courage" in Japanese.

750
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,550
So, I'll be okay.

751
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,770
Yuki!

752
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,220
So here you are.

753
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,260
- Are you his father?
- Yes.

754
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,150
Thank goodness. He seemed to be lost.

755
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
I'm sorry for the trouble.

756
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,000
This is what happens
when you wander around alone!

757
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,560
Hey, we've reached Maizuru, haven't we?

758
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,340
Yeah. But first,
we gotta gather information.

759
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,380
What's that crowd doin' over there?

760
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,800
I never imagined something like that
would happen on the Aegis.

761
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,790
I'm surprised too, honestly.

762
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,230
There's a lot of noise. Is everything okay?

763
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,340
Yes. I'm hiding to prevent
my signal being detected.

764
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,390
In that case, I'll adjust the signal,
so it's hidden.

765
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,550
Anyway, what about that female officer?

766
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,430
We did research,
but she's not part of the SDF.

767
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,000
I knew it! It's a person!

768
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,480
Whatcha doin', Heiji?

769
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,560
Never mind. You just stay here.

770
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,680
Hey, Heiji!

771
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,030
He's got no left arm!

772
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,150
Anyone call the police?

773
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,210
They're on their way now.

774
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,010
A body with no left arm.

775
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,420
Rank of lieutenant.

776
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,120
There's no doubt

777
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,280
this is what Sasaura-san Kudo told me about.

778
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,010
Huh? Is that blood?

779
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,950
No, not blood... What is it, then?

780
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,490
No, no, no! Stop it!

781
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,730
What are you doing, Kid?

782
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,530
Ya' can't touch the body until
the police come.

783
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,720
(Maritime Self Defense Force)

784
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,280
I'm Inspector Megure!

785
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,700
I came along
with the Wakasa Coast Guard.

786
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,590
Thank you for coming.

787
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,430
I'm Captain Tateishi.

788
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,820
I'm Sato.

789
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,880
I'm Takagi.

790
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,630
(Masaaki Kurata, Wakasa Coast Guard, Security Section)
Kurata, from security.

791
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,520
(Tsutomo Munekawa, Wakasa Coast Guard, Detective Section)
I'm Detective Munekawa.

792
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,520
- We'll discuss the details inside.
- Right.

793
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,590
What? At the Wakasa Bay Shipyard?

794
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,890
Yes. There's little doubt.

795
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,590
The defect and rank on the uniform matched.

796
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,690
In other words, Sasaura-san had his arm

797
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,390
drawn in by the Aegis Destroyer at Maizuru Port

798
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,190
(Wakasa Bay, Wakasa Shipyard)
and the rest of his body drifted here.

799
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,400
Wait, drifted? How?

800
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,630
Couldn't the ocean currents
have carried him?

801
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,430
Does a current like that exist?

802
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,480
I'll look it up,

803
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,040
along with the objects
that adhered to his body.

804
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,730
Adhered objects?

805
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,920
Yes. I don't know the details,

806
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,910
but he has red stuff
on the back of his neck.

807
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,900
Red objects that stuck to him...

808
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,600
Hattori, go meet up with the Professor.

809
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,750
Whoa, that looks good!

810
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,060
Let's eat!

811
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,700
Mm. It's delicious.

812
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,440
Navy curry is really good.

813
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,050
It's the best curry I've ever had.

814
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,030
You're right. It's yummy.

815
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,040
Yuki-kun...

816
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,880
I guess I'm over-thinking.

817
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,090
I wish I could make something this good.

818
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,640
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you for the meal.
- Did I say something wrong?

819
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,270
You should just call him on the phone

820
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,550
and say "I've made some tasty
curry for you. Come home soon!"

821
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,070
Idiot.
Like he'd really come home just for curry.

822
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,050
Right about that.

823
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,570
But I'll call him anyway.

824
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,130
I knew it!

825
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,730
That's not it.

826
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,000
I just need to tell Shinichi something.

827
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,350
Yeah, yeah. Have fun.

828
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,690
What does she want to tell me?

829
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,080
Oh no! My phone's gonna ring!

830
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,630
Where are you going, Conan-kun?

831
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,820
To the bathroom.

832
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,190
Again?

833
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,600
I'll be right back.

834
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,350
That summarizes my deductions
and the information we have now.

835
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,610
I see.

836
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,830
So because of the public demonstrations,

837
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,130
you haven't been able
to investigate in detail.

838
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,080
Correct.

839
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,660
Where are the civilian passengers now?

840
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,980
Having a meal in the dining area.

841
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,690
Then we should probably search
the public areas of the ship now.

842
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,810
Wait.

843
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,900
I was told that Lieutenant Sasaura's body
was found at the shipyard in Wakasa Bay.

844
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:56,100
Do we still need to do a search?

845
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,670
Just in case.

846
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,780
It may have been caught in the filter

847
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,730
before the ship left port.

848
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,050
Very well.

849
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,930
I will guide you around the ship.

850
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,900
Ran?

851
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,330
How did you know it was me?

852
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,980
More importantly, do you need something?

853
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,370
What do you mean, "more importantly?"

854
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,000
Listen, Shinichi. Right now, I'm...

855
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,550
You're on an Aegis Destroyer, right?

856
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,890
That's great! I wish I could be there.

857
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,900
Hey! How did you know?

858
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,520
I told you before, didn't I?

859
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,260
No matter where you are, I'll find you.

860
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,700
Shinichi...

861
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,910
I know! Conan told you, didn't he?

862
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,130
He must have called you.

863
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,470
Huh? Oh, you got me...

864
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,820
Anyway, don't worry.
I'm sure they'll sort things out, soon.

865
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,960
It's not fair for you to say that
from so far away!

866
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,800
What?

867
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,400
You're nervous because I'm not there with you?

868
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,910
Don't be stupid!

869
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,520
You know that's not true!

870
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,420
That's the spirit!

871
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,970
Talk to you later. Stay strong.

872
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,320
Huh? Hey!

873
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,600
I am here with her, though.

874
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,670
Dummy...

875
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,370
(Off-limits)

876
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,550
Inspector Megure's team is reported
to have found it on the deck.

877
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,010
Where on the deck?

878
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,220
I don't know the details.

879
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,180
Anyway, we had better hurry.

880
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:28,770
They found something on the deck?

881
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,220
This way!

882
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,510
That's right, over here!

883
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,120
Underneath this missile launch pad,

884
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,830
we found Sasaura-san's cell phone.

885
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,260
Where exactly was it?

886
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,860
Inside this gap.

887
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,580
Let me see that.

888
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,190
His last communication was...

889
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,740
His last email was just after
9 pm last night.

890
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,300
His last call was this morning at 5:30.

891
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,850
This morning at 5:30?

892
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,190
That's the same time
that his wristwatch stopped.

893
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:56,640
It's also the estimated time of death.

894
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,370
What?

895
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,690
The results of the autopsy...

896
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,630
Sasaura-san's estimated time of death
was between 4 and 6 AM this morning.

897
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,110
In other words, Sasaura-san was onboard
the Aegis at that time.

898
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,850
Did you find out the cause of death, too?

899
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,760
Yes. It was drowning.

900
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,980
So then, at 5:30 this morning,

901
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,180
Sasaura-san dropped
over the side of the Aegis?

902
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,510
So it seems.

903
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,340
I see. Very well.

904
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,070
So at 5:30 this morning, Sasahara-san
got in a fight with someone here

905
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,470
and dropped his phone as a result.

906
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,540
After that, he ran

907
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,610
and must have been cornered over here.

908
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,220
Then he was pushed overboard.

909
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,240
In which case, this is definitely a murder.

910
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,970
Then, as we thought,
it must be that Sasaura-san's body

911
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,100
was sucked in with the water
pumped by the Aegis

912
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,370
and got caught in the filter
before the ship left Port.

913
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,340
Yes.

914
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:45,920
Once the Aegis left Maizuru Port,

915
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,330
the bilge pump was activated again

916
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,820
and his arm was severed.

917
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,380
After that, his remaining torso
floated at sea

918
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,980
and rode the current until it arrived
at the Wakasa Bay Shipyard.

919
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,520
With that in mind, it makes sense that
this cell phone was dropped on the deck.

920
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,790
The cell phone's SD card flap is open.

921
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,170
I don't remember opening it.

922
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,600
What about the data card?

923
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,950
Nothing.

924
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,690
You don't think the killer took it out?

925
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
That would mean that the motive
for the murder

926
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,540
was this cell phone's data card.

927
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,850
Damn it. To get a look at that cell phone,

928
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,700
I'll have to come out of hiding.

929
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:33,930
Not so fast.

930
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,800
What is it, Mouri-kun?

931
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,480
Oh, nothing.

932
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,380
Upstairs, huh?

933
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,500
(Captain's Room)

934
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,150
What the... It's broken!

935
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,110
What's she doing?

936
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,110
Huh? The Captain's Room?

937
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,750
That's the micro SD card.

938
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,760
Come on...

939
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,280
I was right. The data came from here.

940
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,340
I'll be in the Captain's Room, then.
If you find anything out, let me know.

941
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,540
Hey, Captain! Can I take a photo with you?

942
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,920
Young man, this area is off-limits.

943
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,550
Let's go back on deck and take one.

944
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,000
Okay!

945
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,880
As expected, she took the card.

946
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,460
But she shouldn't have had time to erase
all the data she loaded on this computer.

947
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,050
So, where is the cell phone located now?

948
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,830
In the meeting room.

949
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,220
What about the security staff?

950
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,760
- They're checking the...
- Why is the captain here?

951
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,560
Wait a second! Those voices I heard...

952
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,640
(Now ready to copy data to your selected device. Begin copying?)

953
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,480
She caught on.

954
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,770
Just a bit longer...

955
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,170
Don't move!

956
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,020
I've been had.

957
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,080
Damn it. I couldn't copy everything.

958
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,400
Why would X be after this data again?

959
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,500
-"X"?
-I have to put things the way they were.

960
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,930
That's right...

961
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,980
There was no sign of X anywhere.

962
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,440
"X"...

963
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,230
Either way, I have to get out of here fast

964
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,620
and get the data I copied to the Professor.

965
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,620
No, wait.

966
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,510
If I emit a satellite signal here,

967
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,940
I might be able to determine who she is.

968
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,970
Another satellite frequency!

969
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,320
This one's coming from the Captain's room!

970
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,900
What? But the Captain is in a meeting.

971
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,140
You don't think it's X?

972
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,010
Confirm the Captain's location now.

973
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,140
Yes sir.

974
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,660
This is bad...

975
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,340
There's important data
stored in that room...

976
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,650
I've finished downloading.

977
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,410
That Shinichi...

978
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,750
What did he send this time?

979
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,070
Who knows?

980
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:56,010
It's Kudo-kun we're talking about.
He probably wants us to research something.

981
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,450
(South Kyoto, Kyoto City, Uji. Exit 1, Exit 2.)
Oh! We've arrived in Kyoto!

982
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,280
Freeze!

983
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,260
What are you doing in here?

984
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,180
The answer is on a need-to-know basis.

985
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,440
Captain Fujii.

986
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,240
So it was you.

987
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,480
Captain.

988
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:13,850
We'll discuss this later.

989
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,390
Hey, you're...

990
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,500
Who is that?

991
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,060
Don't worry about her.

992
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,050
Please leave.

993
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,440
Yes sir.

994
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,330
Wait!

995
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,310
We came here because a suspicious
frequency was detected.

996
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,480
Yes.

997
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,080
And when we arrived, she was here.

998
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,510
I believe we have a right to ask

999
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,530
for her identification.

1000
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,990
I apologize,

1001
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,890
but we are unable to identify her
to outside parties.

1002
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,270
Outside parties?

1003
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,950
Give me a break!

1004
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:46,680
They're right. The police,
and us in the coast guard,

1005
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:49,220
are here to investigate the murder.
We're all allies.

1006
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,490
Oh, it's that lady soldier again!

1007
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,600
I told you to stay put!

1008
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:01,440
My friends said it was rare for a female
soldier to be on an Aegis Destroyer.

1009
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,740
Just get out of here!

1010
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,800
That's right.

1011
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,270
Is it normal for female soldiers
to ride on an Aegis Destroyer?

1012
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,650
Why yes.

1013
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,970
There's a new movement
to give female soldiers

1014
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,550
assignments on the Aegis ships from now on.

1015
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,950
We've assigned her to guide the passengers.

1016
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:20,050
I see. So that's it.

1017
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,340
That's strange. She told us
she was the ship's cook.

1018
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,050
Oh, uh... that's true, she did say that.

1019
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:28,970
What's the meaning of this?

1020
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,310
That's...

1021
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,710
At this rate,

1022
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,720
we'll have no choice but to assume

1023
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,030
that Sasaura-san's killer

1024
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,660
is among your crew.

1025
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:42,710
Hold on a second. We've done everything
we can to cooperate...

1026
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,110
Captain.

1027
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,200
I think we should tell them.

1028
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,810
I'm an intelligence officer.

1029
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,890
An intelligence officer?

1030
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,520
The ones under the direct control
of the Ministry of Defense?

1031
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,530
Yes.

1032
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:05,740
I monitor and control information
on the SDF and its officials.

1033
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:09,720
But why would an intelligence officer
be onboard an Aegis Destroyer?

1034
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,990
Wait, this must be about that
suspicious vessel from this morning.

1035
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,230
Yes.

1036
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,800
We believe that it was a spy boat
sent by a certain country.

1037
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:23,160
It's true that it had
a wireless communication antenna

1038
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,700
and explosives that were meant
to detonate the ship.

1039
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,750
You certainly know a lot about it.

1040
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,830
The one who found the suspicious ship was me.

1041
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,270
That's how I became involved
in this operation.

1042
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,120
The ship was found near Maizuru Port,
which is where the Aegis was docked.

1043
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:42,390
We believe that a spy

1044
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:44,370
may be onboard this ship.

1045
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,490
A spy?

1046
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:49,250
Yes. We refer to the spy as X
and are investigating.

1047
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,810
X...

1048
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:52,850
What reason would a spy have?

1049
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,810
We believe they want to get their hands
on secret information

1050
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,320
about Aegis destroyers.

1051
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,730
Information?

1052
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,400
What would happen if the secret leaked?

1053
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,950
We would lose the trust
of the American military,

1054
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,220
who developed and provided us
with the Aegis system.

1055
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,610
No, worse than that,

1056
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:14,530
if secret information
about the Aegis destroyers were leaked,

1057
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,640
the entire strategy of Japan's first
line of defense would be revealed

1058
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,760
and we would be left defenseless
against invasion

1059
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,690
by other nations.

1060
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,460
In other words,

1061
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,110
it would be a major threat
to national security.

1062
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:36,150
Naturally, the murder victim Sasura-san
knew of the spy as well?

1063
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,710
Yes.

1064
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,990
Of course. It was his job.

1065
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,200
His job?

1066
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,680
What sort of work did Sasaura-san do?

1067
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,720
As a lieutenant,
he was a commanding officer.

1068
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,880
Lieutenant Sasaura was the designated naval
intelligence coordinator for the Wakasa region.

1069
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,400
An intelligence coordinator?

1070
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,510
He protected information
about the Aegis Destroyer.

1071
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,110
I see, so that's why he was killed by X,
who was after that information.

1072
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:08,340
In that case, it was X who removed
Sasaura-san's data card from his phone.

1073
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:11,200
No, the one who did that was her.

1074
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,190
Why would she remain quiet about that?

1075
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,100
Please, let us through.

1076
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,740
Excuse me.

1077
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,660
We will now conduct a search
for communication devices aboard the ship.

1078
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,540
- Uh-oh.
- This means a search of your belongings.

1079
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:26,360
- Please enter in here.
- Say, Oji-san!

1080
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,970
Huh? What is it?

1081
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,330
I forgot that I ordered
a second helping of curry.

1082
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,070
Curry?

1083
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,450
Unbelievable. Why are you even in here?

1084
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,680
Go, already!

1085
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,770
Okay.

1086
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,850
Thanks, old man.

1087
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,310
Welcome aboard!

1088
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,130
Hattori, can you hear me?

1089
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,500
Yeah. We managed to find the Professor.

1090
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,950
What did you find out
about the red adherent object?

1091
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:08,970
We're lookin' into that now.

1092
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,390
Give us a 'sec.

1093
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,730
Now that ya' mention it,

1094
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,980
I'm amazed you can do this kind
of analysis in a car.

1095
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,730
Ai-kun was originally
a scientist after all.

1096
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:18,890
A scientist?

1097
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,090
What'cha talkin' about? She's just a little kid!

1098
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,590
Don't sweat the little stuff.

1099
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,410
Got it. Here it is.

1100
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,210
TBT.

1101
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,260
It's a kind of self-polishing paint.

1102
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,840
- It's specially designed for boats.
- So it's boat paint?

1103
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,670
Is there no way to tell whether or not

1104
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:39,720
it came from the Aegis destroyer?

1105
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,470
Alright, got it. I'll have
the little woman look it up.

1106
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,440
The little woman?

1107
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,740
Oh, another thing. The currents...

1108
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,820
There were no currents capable of carrying
Sasaura-san's body

1109
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,670
from Maizuru to Wakasa Bay.

1110
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,960
So then how did it end up there?

1111
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,590
And what about the data I sent?

1112
00:52:58,770 --> 00:52:59,920
That stuff?

1113
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,260
Kudo wants to ask 'bout that data he sent.

1114
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,500
Shinichi?

1115
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,810
The data seems to be part of information
about the Aegis destroyer itself.

1116
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,580
I knew it.

1117
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,470
We found traces that it was copied off
of a certain company's cloud.

1118
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,630
A cloud? You mean those services

1119
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,440
that store data through the Internet?

1120
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,860
Right.

1121
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,430
If you crack the ID and Password,

1122
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,710
you should be able to see the original
data on the cloud.

1123
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,900
I see.

1124
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,830
So Sasaura-san uploaded the Aegis data

1125
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,290
to a cloud service and then later on,

1126
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,750
he copied it to that cell phone data card.

1127
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,780
But why in the world would Sasahara-san

1128
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:45,750
save the Aegis data
to a civilian cloud service?

1129
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,800
Professor, use Sasahara-san's ID
to send the Aegis data from the cloud

1130
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,130
to the captain's room.

1131
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,100
But...

1132
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,300
Don't worry.

1133
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,630
I was there earlier, so I know the address.

1134
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,270
Please.

1135
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:06,040
I'm sorry to do this immediately upon
the arrival of the prefectural police,

1136
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,980
but we'd like to hear
the results of your search.

1137
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,810
Of course.

1138
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,060
Mr. Captain,

1139
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,660
before we arrived,

1140
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,160
(Detective Kurumazaki, Detective Fumimaro Ayanokoji)
we looked into the final movements

1141
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,530
of the murder victim, Sasaura.

1142
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:20,830
(舞鶴湾遊覧船)
At 5:30 this morning,

1143
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:24,810
an employee of a tourist boat spotted
Sasaura-san flying the Japanese flag

1144
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,220
atop a cliff in Maizuru Bay.

1145
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,160
Why would Lieutenant Sashara
do such a thing?

1146
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,320
We don't know yet.

1147
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,810
But what concerns us the most
are his movements yesterday.

1148
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,820
Sasaura-san was questioned by you personally

1149
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:40,060
at the Maritime SDF base in Wakasa,

1150
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,170
Sekiguchi-san.

1151
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,870
Can you tell us
what you questioned him about?

1152
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:47,760
Th-That's...

1153
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,670
More secrets?

1154
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,450
Captain Fujii,

1155
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,140
you can't tell your fellow officers
in the maritime SDF?

1156
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,970
I would need approval
from the defense ministry first.

1157
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:01,940
I've had enough of this!
Sasaura-san is dead!

1158
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,690
If you don't talk to us,

1159
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,900
we can't begin to help you.

1160
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,440
He was on your team, wasn't he?

1161
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,780
- Your teammate--
- That bastard is no teammate of mine!

1162
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:14,870
Huh?

1163
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:16,400
That's not a comment we can just ignore.

1164
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,400
What's this?

1165
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,210
Why has the Aegis data been sent here?

1166
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,350
Inspector...

1167
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:23,310
Right.

1168
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:25,410
If you won't cooperate with us willingly,

1169
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,050
we'll have to do it by force.

1170
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:33,790
This was sent from a cloud service with
Sasaura-san's ID.

1171
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,920
Nice timing, Professor.

1172
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,540
A cloud?

1173
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,420
You don't think it was to show to X?

1174
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,610
Wait a minute.

1175
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,990
Saving the aegis data on the Internet

1176
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,450
is against the law.

1177
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,580
And that's why you were questioning
Sasasura-san, isn't it?

1178
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,050
And our female officer
over here knew about it.

1179
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,240
Where are you going?

1180
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,430
Wait! We're not finished.

1181
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,860
Let me go!

1182
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,210
Unlike the rest of you,
I'm working on behalf of the nation!

1183
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,370
With that kind of attitude,

1184
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,020
not only can you not protect the nation,
you won't even be able to arrest X.

1185
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:20,290
So let us work with you

1186
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,760
for the sake of Japan.

1187
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:28,900
The Aegis destroyer data has been leaked
from the Maritime SDF base in Wakasa.

1188
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,930
Lieutenant Sekiguchi! Stop!

1189
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:35,260
I was ordered to investigate
the matter by Captain Fujii.

1190
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,690
I knew it.

1191
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,780
Then, is Lieutenant Sasaura

1192
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,480
the one who leaked the data?

1193
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,980
- Yes.
- Where the hell did he leak the Aegis data to?

1194
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,850
To a mercantile agency run
by a man named Takekawa.

1195
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,850
However, the agency ceased operations
several years ago.

1196
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,870
- A dormant company?
- Yes.

1197
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,900
Someone else bought the company

1198
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,230
and has been using Takekawa's name
to conduct spy activities.

1199
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,050
It's a common route here in Japan.

1200
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,390
So Sasaura-san leaked the information

1201
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,980
to the person calling himself Takekawa.

1202
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,580
Yes. And the day after we found out,

1203
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:15,310
we were alerted by the coast guard
about the suspicious ship

1204
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,020
that was found in Maizuru bay.

1205
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,680
We felt the ship's proximity to Maizuru
Port, where the Aegis destroyer was docked,

1206
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,150
couldn't be a coincidence.

1207
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,120
We found parts
from a certain country aboard the suspicious ship.

1208
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,480
Yes.

1209
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,060
Hearing that, we concluded that a spy
from the fake Takegawa's country

1210
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,650
had arrived on Japanese soil.

1211
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:34,020
You can't be serious.

1212
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,370
And that spy is X?

1213
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,510
We believed it was likely

1214
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:39,000
that X would use
Lieutenant Sasaura's guidance

1215
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,970
to board this ship.

1216
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,200
But with the demonstration today,
you knew security would be light.

1217
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,780
Why didn't you say anything?

1218
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,840
A member of the SDF may have leaked
information on an Aegis destroyer

1219
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,290
to a foreign spy.

1220
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:58,690
We could never reveal such a scandal.

1221
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,010
We decided that until the truth was known,

1222
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,530
we would investigate ourselves.

1223
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,440
So when I found his
cell phone on the deck...

1224
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,050
Did a passenger drop this?

1225
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,460
Why would it be here?

1226
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,310
It's Lieutenant Sasaura's phone.

1227
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,370
We had better search the rest of the deck.

1228
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:36,190
You found it before I did?

1229
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:40,260
So then, Sasaura-san was definitely
aboard the Aegis, wasn't he?

1230
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,840
And he was murdered by X.

1231
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,750
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to contact
the Defense Ministry.

1232
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,930
So it was you who was sending out
satellite transmissions.

1233
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,510
I apologize.

1234
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:56,490
After crew became concerned, I began
doing so from the control room.

1235
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:00,150
Oh man, I almost ended up
sharing the blame.

1236
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:04,630
This is Fujii. Regarding the confidential
matter we were investigating,

1237
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,200
the police and coast guard have...

1238
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,320
What? Takekawa?

1239
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,240
Two hours ago?

1240
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:13,840
Yes.

1241
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,090
We've confirmed that he is
in the Kyoto city limits.

1242
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,510
So they found Takekawa.

1243
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,940
If Takegawa has traveled
from Tokyo to Kyoto,

1244
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,180
perhaps he plans to meet X on the ship.

1245
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,450
Where is Takekawa now?

1246
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,750
Intelligence officers are in Kyoto
searching for him.

1247
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:33,930
Then, where was he seen two hours ago?

1248
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,460
He was spotted on the surveillance camera
of a hotel inside the Kyoto city limits.

1249
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:41,190
You have a photo of Takekawa, right?

1250
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:42,600
Yes.

1251
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,130
We'll track him using N System Orbis,
the police's street surveillance camera.

1252
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:48,170
In that case, the Kyoto Prefectural Police

1253
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,830
offer their full support.

1254
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:50,540
Right.

1255
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,990
Please let us
in the Coast Guard assist too.

1256
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:56,860
Please arrange for all images
from those cameras

1257
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,870
to be sent to this ship.

1258
00:59:58,590 --> 00:59:59,600
I see.

1259
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,280
Aboard the Aegis Destroyer Hotaka,

1260
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,050
we can analyze the images immediately.

1261
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,140
Okay!

1262
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,400
This is more like it!

1263
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,750
These are images from cameras in Kyoto,
two hours ago.

1264
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,340
I told them to first send us images
of the hotel and its surroundings.

1265
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:21,190
There's a message from Maizuru Base!

1266
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,050
After examining
the abandoned ship at port,

1267
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,090
they discovered parts
from a certain nation in the ship's hull.

1268
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,690
Displaying on main monitor.

1269
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,590
It's the same nation
as the other suspicious boat.

1270
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,930
But they couldn't possibly have
two vessels in Japanese territorial waters.

1271
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,550
That would mean our encounter
with that abandoned ship

1272
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,140
was no mere coincidence.

1273
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,560
- But that's...
- Did they use the bay's currents

1274
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,460
to attempt a terrorist attack?

1275
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,350
No, that's impossible.

1276
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,360
Before departing this morning,

1277
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,130
we calculated the bay's currents

1278
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,770
and the trajectories of other ships.

1279
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,630
We then shifted our route to the left.

1280
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,010
The change was made this morning?

1281
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,640
Then there would be no way to...

1282
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,490
(Maizuru Bay Tourist Boat)
At 5:30 this morning,

1283
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:10,580
an employee of a tourist boat spotted
Sasaura-san flying the Japanese flag...

1284
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,380
Maybe he was trying to...

1285
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:14,640
I have to check!

1286
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,110
A route change was made this morning.

1287
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,550
There's no way an abandoned ship
could reach our precise path

1288
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,280
without them knowing in advance.

1289
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,410
Right.

1290
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:25,840
Who knew about the route change?

1291
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:28,130
Only those at the Wakasa Base.

1292
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,230
I see.

1293
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:30,930
There's no way for the spy to know.

1294
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,160
Huh? Hey, kid! What are you...

1295
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,860
Oh no, not you again...

1296
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:35,730
I told you to stop!

1297
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,510
What's he doing here?

1298
01:01:36,510 --> 01:01:37,570
- I apologize.
ｰ There it is.

1299
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,600
- Don't touch anything!
- Hey!

1300
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,790
Not this time.

1301
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,570
Huh? This isn't mine.

1302
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:46,410
Of course it isn't!

1303
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,290
Now you're really gonna...

1304
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:49,380
Wait!

1305
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,140
The staff at the Wakasa base
knew about the route change.

1306
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,490
That's what you said, right?

1307
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:54,780
Yes.

1308
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,660
Right. And that means
Lieutenant Sasaura knew.

1309
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,090
Take a look at this signal flag.

1310
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,960
In the dark of early morning,
the witness may have

1311
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,950
mistaken it for the Japanese flag.

1312
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,620
You're right.

1313
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,400
So that's it. Sasaura-san
informed X this morning

1314
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,380
by using the signal flag as a code.

1315
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,120
Speaking of code...

1316
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,980
What does the flag mean?

1317
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:19,460
The route will shift left.

1318
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,780
So then...

1319
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,370
Yes. X knew
about the route change in advance.

1320
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,390
Huh? I thought I left something in here,
but I guess not.

1321
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:30,840
I'm going back to the dining room.

1322
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:32,360
And stay there this time!

1323
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,640
Wait, boy!

1324
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:34,960
Uh-oh...

1325
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,980
Target spotted!

1326
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,560
Are you sure?

1327
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,510
Yes.

1328
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:42,090
It's a 93% match to Takekawa.
There's no doubt about that.

1329
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,330
What's the location?

1330
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,730
Kyoto Pontocho Park.

1331
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:46,400
12:03 PM.

1332
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:48,020
Magnify image.

1333
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:55,800
Pontocho Park, you say?

1334
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,000
Yes. Hurry!

1335
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,100
Get there before the package is retrieved!

1336
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,550
Easy for you to say!

1337
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:04,160
And get a photo of Takekawa as well.

1338
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,190
A photo? Why?

1339
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,330
I'm counting on you.

1340
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,100
He hung up on me.

1341
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,960
Anyway, we have to hurry.

1342
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,170
Okay!

1343
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:15,850
Oh no...

1344
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:17,560
Found you, Conan-kun!

1345
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,040
Where have you been?

1346
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,680
The scavenger hunt is gonna start!

1347
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:24,900
Oh, uh...

1348
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:26,700
Target spotted!

1349
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:30,690
12:10 PM at Keihan Gion-Shijo Station.

1350
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,860
That's the platform for Osaka.

1351
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,600
He's getting on!

1352
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,180
(Limited Express Yodoyabashi)

1353
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,090
It's a limited express.

1354
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,220
There won't be many stops.

1355
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,680
We'll ask the Osaka Police for cooperation.

1356
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:42,910
Right.

1357
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,490
That boy's gone...

1358
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:51,190
(Osaka Prefectural Police Bureau) I need you to send all images
from surveillance cameras

1359
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:54,290
at every stop made
by the Keihan limited express line,

1360
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,590
between Gion-Shijo and Yodoyabashi,
to this address.

1361
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,370
The Aegis Destroyer Hotaka's CIC?

1362
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,970
I'm counting on you Otaki.
It's urgent.

1363
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,260
Yes sir.

1364
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,730
Items for the scavenger hunt are hidden
between the cafeteria

1365
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:08,500
and the fore deck.
There are five of each type.

1366
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,590
We hope you can find them all.

1367
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:13,840
Got it! I found it, everyone!

1368
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:15,980
Wow, great job!

1369
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,290
Well done.

1370
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,940
That's number three!

1371
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,820
That means there's two more left.

1372
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,490
Let's find them and go back to the deck!

1373
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:23,700
Right.

1374
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,750
Ran! Help us out over here!

1375
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,720
Sure.

1376
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,400
The discovery of a suspicious ship,

1377
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,770
a sudden shift to a combat state,

1378
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,750
and the death of Sasaura-san...

1379
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,280
It's all the work of X,
a spy from a certain country.

1380
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,630
We believe they want to get their hands
on secret information

1381
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,260
about the Aegis Destroyer.

1382
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:54,540
May I have a moment, little boy?

1383
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,980
Something was burnt here.

1384
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,010
Yeah... This is it!

1385
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,560
This is what Kudo was looking for.

1386
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:06,980
The police have arrived.

1387
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,820
There it is! Over there!

1388
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,040
Okay! Contact base!

1389
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,260
Yes, sir!

1390
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,710
Conan-kun...

1391
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,860
You really showed us
how it's done, back there.

1392
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,280
Huh? What do you mean?

1393
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,720
Who are you, exactly?

1394
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:32,910
What sort of data is there that could only
be obtained by boarding the ship?

1395
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:37,460
For example, perhaps data on the ship responses
to a sudden submarine attack.

1396
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:39,930
How did you...

1397
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,470
I knew it.

1398
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:44,800
You're saying that X engineered
the abandoned ship

1399
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,150
in order to get his hands on that data?

1400
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,650
Where would he go to get it?

1401
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,290
The CIC, where everyone is now.

1402
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,450
Or the Captain's room.

1403
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,410
There!

1404
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,110
Because of the sudden emergency
during the drill,

1405
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,960
the Captain came up to the CIC.

1406
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,840
During that time,
the Captain's Room was empty.

1407
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,270
So that's it...

1408
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,930
He snuck into the Captain's room then
and stole the data.

1409
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,510
That means I know who X is!

1410
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:16,500
Wait a second!

1411
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,340
Ah! Conan-kun!

1412
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:21,890
That little devil's at it again...

1413
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,760
I'm getting worried. I'll follow him.

1414
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,080
Hey, wait! Ran!

1415
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,400
Stop this instant boy!

1416
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:30,620
Captain Fujii.

1417
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:33,830
Takekawa has arrived in Osaka.

1418
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:35,390
Osaka?

1419
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,360
Yes. Yodoyabashi station.

1420
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,170
That you, Kudo?

1421
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,750
What Takekawa hid
was a note of some kind.

1422
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:46,510
A note of some kind?

1423
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:49,220
Yeah. It was mostly burned up.

1424
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,920
It's gonna be hard to read it now.

1425
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:52,560
Speaking of Takekawa,

1426
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:55,900
he's on the move
from Odayabashi Station in Osaka.

1427
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,240
Find his trail, quick!

1428
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,220
Got it.

1429
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,210
Yuki-kun... Yuki-kun!

1430
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,140
Amemiya-san? Amemiya-san!

1431
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,530
Amemiya-san!

1432
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:27,110
You're...

1433
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:29,430
Hey, is Yuki-kun okay?

1434
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,170
That's right, Yuki...

1435
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,290
His dermatitis is acting up.
He said he was going to the bathroom.

1436
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,050
Dermatitis?

1437
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,920
Yeah. When that happens,
he has to wash his hands

1438
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,820
and rub on the medicine he brought, right?

1439
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,010
Yes.

1440
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,730
The bathroom, then?

1441
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,340
Are you worried about him?

1442
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,400
Well, of course.

1443
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,730
But when the boat was shaking,

1444
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,870
you weren't there with him.

1445
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:57,580
I told you, I was in the bathroom.

1446
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,940
No, you were in the Captain's Room.

1447
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,340
I called out "Amemiya-san" just now,

1448
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,910
but you didn't even turn around.

1449
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,410
Plus, Yuki didn't bring a rub-on ointment.

1450
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,600
He brought pills.

1451
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:12,050
Not for dermatitis, but for food allergies.

1452
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:15,190
If you're his father, you would know.

1453
01:08:15,610 --> 01:08:18,460
That means you aren't his father.

1454
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,890
Isn't that true,
Mr. Spy from a certain country?

1455
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,210
Who the hell are you?

1456
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:28,750
Conan Edogawa.

1457
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,410
Private Detective.

1458
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:36,980
How come a kid think he can do against me?

1459
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,140
Are you okay, boy?

1460
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:56,830
No! Wait!

1461
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:57,970
Don't!

1462
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,240
Don't do it! My dad will die!

1463
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:09,150
Damn it...

1464
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,570
The old bastard's card...

1465
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:16,580
I've managed to piece together this much.

1466
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:17,900
SENSHU

1467
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,440
What's the mark at the end?

1468
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,630
If it's got somethin' to do with the Aegis,

1469
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:24,610
maybe they mean the Japanese word for bow.

1470
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:27,210
If it's not about the boat,
then the anchor or somethin'.

1471
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:28,330
No way!

1472
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:30,410
An anchor mark's long at the bottom.

1473
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,240
This looks more like an arrow.

1474
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,650
If it's an arrow,

1475
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,100
then wouldn't it mean "look at the sky"?

1476
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,250
The sky?

1477
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:45,200
I see. Kazuha! You're brilliant!

1478
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:47,320
Brilliant?

1479
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,610
Old man, Senshu Airport!

1480
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:50,930
What did you say?

1481
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:54,240
It's not an anchor, or an arrow.
It's a plane!

1482
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,550
A plane?

1483
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,750
I don't remember an airport called Senshu.

1484
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,050
Otherwise known
as Kansai International Airport.

1485
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:00,670
(Otaki Police)

1486
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:03,650
Kansai International used ta'
be called Senshu Airport.

1487
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:08,060
His father disappeared at Maizuru Port

1488
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,020
and then he boarded this boat
with some men he doesn't know.

1489
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:15,120
The man told me that if I didn't do
what he said, they'd kill my father.

1490
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:18,000
A man who wasn't
in the CIC during the drills...

1491
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,240
Yes.

1492
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:23,550
He must have been in the captain's room,
stealing the drill data.

1493
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,770
This means that man is X.

1494
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,090
Do you remember what the man looks like?

1495
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,550
Will you help us?

1496
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,850
I'll do it.

1497
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,410
I remember his face well.

1498
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:39,350
Then come to the CIC with us. We'll
look at the surveillance footage too. Okay?

1499
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:40,660
Sure!

1500
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,170
Let's move, then.

1501
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:43,520
Come on, boy.

1502
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,090
Right.

1503
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:48,360
Your dad told you, right?

1504
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:52,880
Your name is Yuki, courage in Japanese.
So be strong.

1505
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:59,250
Neither Takegawa, nor X,
have been caught yet.

1506
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:00,180
I see.

1507
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:01,340
Kansai International!

1508
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:01,880
Huh?

1509
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,250
Takegawa may be headed to the airport!

1510
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,680
- What?
- How would you know that?

1511
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,110
Oh, Heiji. I mean, my son told me.

1512
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:10,260
Heiji?

1513
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:11,020
I told him not to,

1514
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,920
but it seems he's on his way there now.

1515
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,490
Toyama! Emergency deployment
for the entire airport!

1516
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:20,050
Takekawa will pass by airport security.
Don't let him get away!

1517
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:29,230
This must be it.

1518
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33,710
Where is Takekawa now?

1519
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,220
He was last spotted at Namba station.

1520
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:37,450
I see.

1521
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,510
What about the witness who saw X?

1522
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:42,980
Conan-kun will help us with that.

1523
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:43,970
Huh?

1524
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,430
You can check the monitor from this seat.

1525
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:47,520
Okay!

1526
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:49,580
How the hell does he know about X?

1527
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:53,410
If you see the man you saw, tell me.

1528
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,610
Right.

1529
01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,670
Oh no! The video files will be lost!

1530
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,850
What?

1531
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:00,640
The files were saved on a server.

1532
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:01,560
What's wrong?

1533
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,570
- We've been had.
- Damn it, he's one step ahead of us.

1534
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,130
Are there no images still active?

1535
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,880
We should still have the real time feed.

1536
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,990
Switch to that.

1537
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,760
Yes, Ma'am.

1538
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,390
Just a minute, kid.

1539
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:13,410
Sure.

1540
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:17,680
I doubt X would make the mistake
of appearing on camera at this point.

1541
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,960
We'll have to ask Yuki what routes X took,
when he came and went.

1542
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,570
Incoming message from Osaka!

1543
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:27,650
There's a high likelihood that Takegawa is
headed for Kansai International Airport!

1544
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:30,910
- What?
- He thinks he can just get away on a plane!

1545
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:35,560
We're very sorry, but we must
terminate the scavenge hunt

1546
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,240
taking place on deck.

1547
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,240
The game will continue in the cafeteria.

1548
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,700
Conan-kun, where are you?

1549
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,520
Excuse me, Miss.
The waves will get a bit rough,

1550
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,990
so we need you to go indoors.

1551
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,870
Have you seen a boy with eyeglasses?

1552
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,320
Is he lost?

1553
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:53,290
No, it's not th--

1554
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,310
In that case, please return indoors.

1555
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,190
- The deck is now closed.
- Oh... right.

1556
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,920
Takekawa is enroute to Kansai Airport!

1557
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:04,460
Request assistance
from the Airport Security base immediately.

1558
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,580
Yes, sir.

1559
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,850
Inoue-san, I will leave the rest to you.

1560
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,030
Right.

1561
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,510
Now we just have to deal with X
before he escapes the ship.

1562
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:15,000
Your dad told you, right?

1563
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:19,290
Your name is Yuki, courage in
Japanese. So be strong.

1564
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:23,400
I want to...

1565
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,330
I want to help catch the spy, too.

1566
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:29,830
Target spotted at Kansai Airport!

1567
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,560
89% match.

1568
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:36,440
He's seen on the surveillance monitor
in front of Gate 3, North Wing Terminal.

1569
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:38,440
He's going inside the airport!

1570
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:41,750
Okay. We're almost there, Yuki-kun.

1571
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:42,780
Right.

1572
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,600
Excuse me, do you have a moment?

1573
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,190
Oh, sure.

1574
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,130
Oh no! You're X!

1575
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,480
What's the matter, Yuki?

1576
01:13:58,010 --> 01:14:02,030
Did you think I'd let you be like that, when you know
so much about what I've been doing?

1577
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,710
Stand up! On your feet, now!

1578
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,730
Oh, Conan...

1579
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,860
When I find him this time,
I'll have to tie him down.

1580
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,160
Huh? Yuki-kun and his father.

1581
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,200
I wonder if they didn't hear
that the deck is off-limits.

1582
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,960
Is this really where you want to get out?

1583
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:35,060
Yes. I'm sure Takekawa is here.

1584
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,550
We'll go park the car, then.

1585
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:39,350
Okay. We'll go on ahead.

1586
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,610
Huh? Wait, Heiji!

1587
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:43,800
Why here?

1588
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:47,400
Those involved with the search here
already know Takekawa's face.

1589
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,660
He can't board like a normal passenger.

1590
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,930
How'd you get that picture?

1591
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,820
I talked Otaki into sendin' it.

1592
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,430
The only way he can board a plane
without being seen

1593
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:59,280
is through cargo.

1594
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,900
In other words, if he can hide among
an international cargo delivery...

1595
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,180
Hey, kid!

1596
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:05,150
Don't stand there! It's dangerous!

1597
01:15:05,150 --> 01:15:06,230
Okay!

1598
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,360
You'll wait here
until the next patrol comes.

1599
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,770
Understood?

1600
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,840
If you're good,
you'll see your father again.

1601
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:27,320
Excuse me...
Did you by any chance see Conan-kun?

1602
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:31,560
He is the boy with the glasses who was with me.

1603
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,470
No, I haven't seen him.

1604
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,080
I see...

1605
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,690
Yuki-kun, do you know where he is?

1606
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,230
Yuki was with me, so he hasn't seen him.

1607
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,140
I guess we both have trouble
with kids getting lost.

1608
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,760
Right.

1609
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:48,390
Bye now, Yuki-kun.

1610
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,280
He always wanders off...

1611
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,740
Oh, and by the way, this area
is off-limits to passengers right now.

1612
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:00,330
Is that so?

1613
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,400
As soon as Yuki recovers
from his sea sickness, we'll go back.

1614
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:06,520
Onee-chan, help me!

1615
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,340
This man is a spy!

1616
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,420
Yuki!

1617
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:12,020
Are you sure you want to do that?

1618
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,140
Yuki-kun, what's wrong? Are you okay?

1619
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,470
I'm very sorry.

1620
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,030
We've been playing a spy game

1621
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,410
and he's gotten
a bit too caught up in it.

1622
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:24,430
He's lying! This man's not my father!

1623
01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:26,340
He's not your father?

1624
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,560
In that case, you stay with him, Conan.

1625
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,710
I'll go ask an SDF soldier what to do about Yuki-kun.

1626
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:35,990
Wait, don't! If you do that...

1627
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,090
Do what?

1628
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:41,340
I'll be okay.

1629
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,030
He's not your real father, huh?

1630
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,530
He's not! Help me, Onee-chan!

1631
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,960
Enough, Yuki.

1632
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,400
- Yuki-kun, come here!
- Okay.

1633
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:56,580
Humph. Stupid woman.

1634
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:59,650
If you hadn't stuck your neck out,
you wouldn't have to die.

1635
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:02,310
So, you really are a spy?

1636
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:03,900
That's right.

1637
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:06,800
But it's too late for you to back out, now.

1638
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,290
Wh-What?

1639
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,540
Yuki-kun, run and get the others!

1640
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,730
Okay!

1641
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:25,050
Damn it...

1642
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:28,780
Not so fast!

1643
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,300
You're good, but even so...

1644
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:23,540
Target sighted.

1645
01:18:23,690 --> 01:18:25,430
He's in the G zone
of the international cargo area.

1646
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,420
Good. Are you sure it's him?

1647
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,340
Yes, it's a 97% match.

1648
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:32,240
It's up to you, Hattori.

1649
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:34,840
Hello? This is Megure
from the Metropolitan Police.

1650
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,150
We've confirmed that Takekawa is in Zone G.

1651
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:39,820
Roger. Takekawa is in Zone G!

1652
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,030
Zone G is this way!

1653
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:47,000
Hey, you can't go in there!

1654
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,470
Let me go!

1655
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,570
No-can-do, kid.

1656
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:52,070
I said, let me go!

1657
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:52,750
Settle down!

1658
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,180
Please let me go!

1659
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,040
Yuki-kun!

1660
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,110
The spy!

1661
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,170
What?

1662
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:58,620
I saw the spy!

1663
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:01,580
There must be a ton of people
who look like this here.

1664
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:03,440
How'm I suppos'd to find him?

1665
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,810
Hey! Look out!

1666
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,320
Are you okay?

1667
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,620
Yeah. Thanks.

1668
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:13,950
You really are careless, ya' know!

1669
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,120
Wander around and you'll get hurt.

1670
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,200
Wait here. Got it?

1671
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,450
Eh?

1672
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,340
I'll be right back!

1673
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,900
Wait, Heiji!

1674
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:27,750
If that's the way you're gonna treat me,
I'll find Takekawa first!

1675
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:34,690
Ta-Takekawa?!

1676
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:42,630
Stop, Takekawa! Get back here!

1677
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,250
What is it, Kazuha?

1678
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,910
Kazuha? Where are you?

1679
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,040
Don't tell me she went by herself...

1680
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:53,610
There he is! Get him!

1681
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,820
Police! Freeze!

1682
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:59,570
Get out of my way!

1683
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:00,970
Stop!

1684
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:02,800
Nanami-san, wait!

1685
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:05,930
- Come to the deck with us.
- Huh?

1686
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,710
I doubt that a spy who's burned it

1687
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,790
will stay on this ship
until it reaches the harbor.

1688
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,680
You're right.

1689
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,830
But you two...

1690
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,480
Wait, Conan-kun!

1691
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:17,990
Yuki-kun, you go back with the others.
Got it?

1692
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:20,040
B-but...

1693
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:21,580
Onee-chan...

1694
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:44,930
Get back here!

1695
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,320
Stay back! Don't come any closer!

1696
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:48,360
Give it up!

1697
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,570
You have nowhere to run!

1698
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:52,210
We'll see about that.

1699
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,480
Don't do anything stupid!

1700
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,310
There are too many obstacles.

1701
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,730
It's almost vertical from here.

1702
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:06,520
I can't kick a ball from this angle.

1703
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,700
I've got it!

1704
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,830
Nanami-san!

1705
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:16,860
- Can you move the cannon counter-clockwise?
- The cannon?

1706
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:18,650
If you can, do it quick!

1707
01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:19,740
Please!

1708
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:22,870
Okay.

1709
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,900
Kazuha!

1710
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:32,940
Die.

1711
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:34,920
Hei...ji!

1712
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,450
Get down!

1713
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:49,250
Are you okay, Heiji-san?

1714
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:56,840
Stop!

1715
01:21:57,770 --> 01:21:58,690
He won't get away!

1716
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,660
Don't do it!

1717
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:14,900
Come on!

1718
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,020
No way!

1719
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,560
Suspect in custody!

1720
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,010
Don't get any ideas, Takekawa!

1721
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:37,010
Great. I should leave the rest to you.

1722
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:38,900
Heiji, are you okay?

1723
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,420
Hurry! Call an ambulance!

1724
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:42,820
You're exaggerating.

1725
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:43,790
Heiji!

1726
01:22:43,790 --> 01:22:46,210
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

1727
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:48,930
- Are you sure, Heiji-san?
- Yeah.

1728
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,630
What now, Kazuha?

1729
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,670
No! No crying!

1730
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,740
Ow-ow-ow-ow!
I've just been shot, you know!

1731
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:07,090
Get off! Kazuha, you... Ow!

1732
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:13,870
He really had me worried.

1733
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,630
But now, things should calm down...

1734
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,240
Inspector, look at this!

1735
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:20,920
We've received word from Kansai Airport
that among the international cargo,

1736
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:24,850
they discovered a healing capsule
built to look like a hydraulic press.

1737
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,630
That's how he was going to get away?

1738
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:30,210
We've also been informed that after
taking Takekawa into custody,

1739
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:33,550
they found a suspicious voicemail message
on his cell phone.

1740
01:23:33,720 --> 01:23:35,030
I had them send it.

1741
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,470
Please let us hear the message!

1742
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:40,070
It may have been from Lieutenant Sasaura.

1743
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:41,370
Roger.

1744
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,770
I'll make the arrangements.

1745
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,150
Open wide.

1746
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,810
It's good!

1747
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:48,970
Excuse me...

1748
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,080
What's the matter? Are you lost?

1749
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,320
Where is the older lady who was with you?

1750
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,080
Older lady? You mean Ran?

1751
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,650
Now that you mention it,
where is Ran Onee-san?

1752
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,990
She went to look for Conan
and never came back.

1753
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:01,920
The access ID is

1754
01:24:02,190 --> 01:24:03,540
AEGIS

1755
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:05,370
0902.

1756
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,030
The password is

1757
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:08,300
0505.

1758
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,770
End of info.

1759
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:11,170
There's no doubt

1760
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:14,540
that's Lieutenant Sasaura's voice.
(April 20th 5:30 AM)

1761
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:17,940
It's right around the estimated
time of death.

1762
01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:20,940
This message was on Takekawa's phone.

1763
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:25,850
This is irrefutable proof that Lieutenant
Sasaura passed the Aegis data to Takekawa.

1764
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:28,160
- I heard the sound of waves.
- Huh?

1765
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,670
Maybe he was near the ocean.

1766
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:31,780
The sound of waves?

1767
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:34,160
That one and the sound of someone's voice.

1768
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:34,900
What?

1769
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,280
Let me hear that again.

1770
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,370
Yes, sir.

1771
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,480
I've saved the Aegis data

1772
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,400
on the KRY cloud.

1773
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:43,140
The access ID is

1774
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,430
AEGIS0902

1775
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,420
- The password is 0505. End of info.
- What is that metal sound?

1776
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,900
Play that last part again.

1777
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:53,980
Yes, Ma'am.

1778
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:57,840
The password is 0505. End of info.

1779
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,840
I hear it.

1780
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,680
You're right.

1781
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,710
Is it a man's voice?

1782
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:03,060
But I can't make out what he's saying.

1783
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,940
We'll begin voice analysis immediately.

1784
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:06,330
Sorry for the extra work.

1785
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,150
Something's wrong here.

1786
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,750
I don't feel like we've tied
everything together yet.

1787
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,770
That's you, Shinichi?

1788
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:20,520
The TBT found on Sasaura's body

1789
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,010
wasn't from the Aegis Destroyer Hotaka.

1790
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:27,360
But it was from a boat, right?

1791
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:32,390
Yes. After referencing other boats that go
in and out of Maizuru Port and Wakasa bay,

1792
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:35,310
we found a tourist boat
that sails around the old military port.

1793
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:39,970
It departs from Maizuru Port and travels
through the Wakasa shipyard.

1794
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:41,970
As we suspected,

1795
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:45,390
the TBT matches the paint
on the tourist boat.

1796
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:46,490
In that case...

1797
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:49,800
(Tourist boat　Sasaura-san　Wakasa Shipyard) Sasaura-san's body
was caught by the tourist boat

1798
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,620
and was carried
from Maizuru Port to Wakasa Bay.

1799
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:55,740
Yes. There's no doubt about that.

1800
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,060
A tourist boat
that leaves from Maizuru Port...

1801
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:03,650
At 5:30 this morning, Sasaura-san was
spotted by an employee of a tourist boat

1802
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:05,680
waving the Japanese flag

1803
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,850
from atop a cliff near Maizuru Bay.

1804
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:09,720
The password is 0505.

1805
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,780
April 20th, 5:30 AM.

1806
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:16,260
The time was 5:30 AM?

1807
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:17,430
The last call he made

1808
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,200
was at 5:30 AM this morning.

1809
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,590
5:30 AM this morning.

1810
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:22,980
That's when his wristwatch stopped too.

1811
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:25,160
It's also the approximate time of death.

1812
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,660
The time Sasaura-san was spotted,

1813
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:32,850
the time of the voicemail message,

1814
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,520
and the approximate time of death
are all the same.

1815
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:37,820
5:30.

1816
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:42,360
I see! I've been making
a terrible assumption.

1817
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:54,890
After being apprehended at the airport,

1818
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:58,330
Tatekawa has been handed to the
Security Bureau of the Osaka Police.

1819
01:26:58,870 --> 01:27:00,910
X too will be sent there too,

1820
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,670
once we arrive at Maizuru Port.

1821
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:04,800
Doesn't the SDF want to question him?

1822
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:08,430
In this investigation, there is no SDF,
police department or Coast Guard.

1823
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,530
We should question Takekawa and X together.

1824
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,980
Right. I agree.

1825
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,240
Good.

1826
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,070
Well, that was easy!

1827
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:24,550
Indeed. We didn't even need your deductions
this time around, Mouri-kun.

1828
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:30,990
Mouri-san!

1829
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,210
Mouri-san?

1830
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:40,780
Um. that's the pilot's seat...

1831
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,090
Are you okay?

1832
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:43,580
No need to worry.

1833
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,470
I'm just feeling a little drunk.

1834
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,880
From the waves?

1835
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,470
On a boat this big...

1836
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:52,430
No. Drunk on my brilliant reasoning.

1837
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,510
What exactly can you say
at this point, Mouri-kun?

1838
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:56,730
Everything.

1839
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:00,110
I know who killed Sasaura-san.

1840
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,090
"Who killed him?"

1841
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,620
It wasn't the spy X we have in custody?

1842
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:08,330
It's true that X boarded the Aegis

1843
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:10,260
with the intent to steal information.

1844
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,540
Yes.

1845
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:15,100
And he killed Sasaura for the data
card on his cellphone.

1846
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:20,070
No, the one who took the data card
was Captain Fujii.

1847
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:22,100
He's right.

1848
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:26,270
Huh? Then why was Sasaura-san killed?

1849
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,130
Exactly. There would be no reason
for him to die!

1850
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:32,410
In other words, it wasn't X who killed him.

1851
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:33,780
What are you saying?

1852
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:34,990
Who else would...

1853
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:36,700
Think back.

1854
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,490
Sasaura-san was on a cliff

1855
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,700
near Maizuru Port this morning.

1856
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:43,200
Yes. He was signaling X with his flag.

1857
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,980
Right. Then, he fell overboard
and drowned in the ocean.

1858
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:48,520
It means...

1859
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:52,030
Sasaura-san wasn't
aboard the Aegis this morning.

1860
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,430
What?!

1861
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,780
But his cell phone was found onboard!

1862
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,980
That was meant to mislead us
into thinking he was here.

1863
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,460
The killer left it there in a hurry.

1864
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,800
Think about it.

1865
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,290
- Fujii-san.
- Huh?

1866
01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:09,100
Where and when did you find
Sasaura-san's cell phone?

1867
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:11,360
When you put it that way,

1868
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,740
it was well after we left port

1869
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,110
and even though
it was somewhere easy to spot,

1870
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:18,820
no one found it until then.

1871
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:20,700
That's right. And the reason is

1872
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:24,670
because it was a red herring,
planted after we left port.

1873
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:28,320
That means the killer is someone
who boarded the Aegis Destroyer

1874
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,640
while it was at sea.

1875
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,470
Isn't that right...

1876
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,890
Kurata-san?

1877
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,960
Huh? What are you...

1878
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:42,060
I only learned of Sasaura-san
because of this investigation!

1879
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,280
He's right, Mouri-kun.

1880
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,880
He would have no motive
to kill Sasaura-san.

1881
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,740
Indeed. He never meant to kill him at all.

1882
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:49,870
What?

1883
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:55,300
Conan, play back the message
on Sasaura-san's phone, one more time.

1884
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,420
I've saved the Aegis data

1885
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,430
on the KRY cloud.

1886
01:29:59,710 --> 01:30:02,410
- The access ID is...
- Does anyone hear a metallic sound?

1887
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,170
- You're right.
- It sounds familiar.

1888
01:30:05,170 --> 01:30:06,380
What could it be?

1889
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:12,110
It's the sound of a policeman's baton
hitting the holstered gun around his waist.

1890
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:15,050
Isn't that right, Kurata-san?

1891
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,200
Wait a minute.

1892
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:25,500
Every member of the Coast Guard carries
a baton and a gun!

1893
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:26,600
I see.

1894
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,010
But then, this message
was left at 5:30 this morning.

1895
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:31,890
The time of death...

1896
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:33,780
It is also 5:30 this morning!

1897
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:40,350
In other words, he never had any time
to bring this cellphone onboard this ship.

1898
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:44,080
What's more, the one who discovered the
suspicious boat this morning

1899
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:46,840
was you, Kurata-san. Correct?

1900
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:51,770
That means you were patrolling
Maizuru Port at that time.

1901
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,960
Do you still deny it?

1902
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:56,770
Freeze!

1903
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:01,890
I never...

1904
01:31:02,060 --> 01:31:05,930
I never thought it would end up like this!

1905
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,710
Who is out here at this time?

1906
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:12,260
Awfully suspicious.

1907
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,570
Hey, you. What are you doing over there?

1908
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:18,150
Damn it!

1909
01:31:24,070 --> 01:31:26,300
Hold it! I'm with the Coast Guard!

1910
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:27,810
Don't make me chase you!

1911
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:29,350
He was obviously up to something.

1912
01:31:30,680 --> 01:31:31,940
Let go of me!

1913
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:47,230
He must have been on the run after
delivering the information to Takekawa.

1914
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,450
I had no idea about any of that.

1915
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,880
I hurried down from the cliff to search for
the man who had fallen into the water.

1916
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,920
That's when I found the suspicious boat.

1917
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,890
Later, as I busied myself
contacting headquarters

1918
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,610
and the Maritime SDF,

1919
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,400
I learned something else.

1920
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,250
I got word from the Kyoto police

1921
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:11,270
that Lieutenant Sasaura's arm had been
discovered onboard this Aegis Destroyer.

1922
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:15,130
I panicked and searched
the dead man's belongings.

1923
01:32:17,060 --> 01:32:20,440
That's how I learned that
the suspicious man from this morning

1924
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,440
was actually Lieutenant Sasaura.

1925
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,940
Even if it was in the line of duty,

1926
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:29,370
the thought that I had killed
an SDF officer made me very nervous.

1927
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,050
I then begged my boss
to let me be part of this investigation.

1928
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,610
Why would you do that?

1929
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:42,100
I realized that if people thought he might
have been killed onboard the Aegis,

1930
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:45,270
I could make it look like
that was what really happened,

1931
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:48,810
and maybe I could avoid punishment.
I then pretended to investigate

1932
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:51,690
and decided to leave his cell phone
on the deck where it would be easily found.

1933
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,780
After that, you know what happened.

1934
01:32:57,330 --> 01:33:01,060
I'm very sorry that my selfish behavior
got in the way of the investigation.

1935
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:04,980
Please allow me to apologize.

1936
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:17,750
- Oji-sama! Have you seen Ran?
- No...

1937
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,860
We've searched everywhere
but can't find her.

1938
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:22,020
She's probably just lost again.

1939
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,260
No, that's not it.

1940
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,650
We looked everywhere.

1941
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:27,050
She disappeared after fighting that spy.

1942
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,280
What?!

1943
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:29,350
Inspector!

1944
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:30,790
What is it, Sato-kun?

1945
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,760
There's something that X said.

1946
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:34,470
Something he said?

1947
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:36,710
Yes. He claims that
just before we caught him,

1948
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:40,300
a female passenger figured out who he was.

1949
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:43,280
He threw her overboard to silence her.

1950
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:54,640
He said she was high school age
and attacked him with karate.

1951
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,360
Did you say Karate?!

1952
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,390
It can't be!

1953
01:33:57,690 --> 01:33:58,740
Ran!

1954
01:33:58,740 --> 01:33:59,450
No way!

1955
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:00,940
You're not saying Ran...

1956
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:01,910
Are you serious?

1957
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:05,040
No! Ran...!

1958
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:23,840
Please hold tight to any small children.

1959
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,730
According to X, Mouri-san fell overboard

1960
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:36,320
around this area, I believe.

1961
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:38,340
We've gone pretty far from there.

1962
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,120
Hey wait, you all can't...

1963
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,760
Don't worry about them!
Get the helicopter ready!

1964
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:43,800
Ah, Yes sir!

1965
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,750
Make room!

1966
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:46,800
I've calculated the flow of the current.

1967
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:48,530
She should be somewhere around here.

1968
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:49,790
But that's...!

1969
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,590
That's four times farther than usual!

1970
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,050
A low-pressure front from the southwest

1971
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:56,060
has accelerated the currents.

1972
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,020
The waves are getting taller, too.

1973
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,050
Her stamina will start to fade.

1974
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:01,940
We had better find her soon.

1975
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,510
The patrol helicopter is ready for lift off!

1976
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:06,310
Good! Leave immediately!

1977
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,870
Yes, sir!

1978
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:08,000
Let me on, too!

1979
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:10,100
Don't be stupid!

1980
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,260
But...!

1981
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:13,570
A child will only get in their way!

1982
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:15,120
Damn it...

1983
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:30,170
She can't hold out much longer.

1984
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:31,700
We have no time to lose.

1985
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:34,160
No matter what,
we have to find her before sundown!

1986
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,570
Roger.

1987
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:37,430
No time to lose...?

1988
01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:40,280
Ran... Ran is okay, right?

1989
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,540
What happens if someone
falls from the deck?

1990
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:48,750
She should be wearing a life jacket.

1991
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,370
But look how high we are.

1992
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,190
If she landed badly in the water...

1993
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:53,260
No!

1994
01:35:53,260 --> 01:35:55,160
But of course, there' still hope.

1995
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:07,220
Onee-san! It's my fault!

1996
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:11,930
Is there no way to confirm if she's alive?

1997
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,450
We have to leave things
to the helicopter for now.

1998
01:36:15,390 --> 01:36:17,480
Even with narrowed search parameters,

1999
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:21,120
it would be near impossible to cover
that whole area by sundown.

2000
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:25,090
There's also a chance that the waves
have carried her even further away.

2001
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:30,900
Help me, Shinichi!

2002
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,980
We've arrived at the designated waters!
Beginning search now!

2003
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:38,740
We'll use the speaker to call out.

2004
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,130
Put us on.

2005
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:41,230
Roger.

2006
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:43,710
Mouri-san! Ran Mouri!

2007
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:45,300
We're here to rescue you!

2008
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:47,300
Everything will be okay!

2009
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,500
Please just hang on a little longer!

2010
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:52,060
Ran! Ran, where are you?! Ran!

2011
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:55,310
Onee-chan, don't die!

2012
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:56,870
We'll be there soon!

2013
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:58,000
Stay calm.

2014
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,280
There must still be a way

2015
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,900
to find Ran...

2016
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,460
The waves are coming even faster!

2017
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,050
I think we need to expand the search area.

2018
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,990
It will be sundown soon.

2019
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,520
Limit the area to Alpha-Bravo-Box

2020
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:10,990
and keep looking!

2021
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:11,970
Roger.

2022
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:13,530
Heading to Alpha-Bravo-Box.

2023
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:31,440
Ran Mouri, we have come to rescue you.

2024
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,560
We'll be there soon. Please hang on!

2025
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,510
It's getting pretty dark.

2026
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:39,010
We have only 15 minutes until sundown.

2027
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:45,320
Sundown... Who cares about sundown?!

2028
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:48,270
Keep looking until you find her!

2029
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:50,550
Find Ran!

2030
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:53,260
We all want to do that,

2031
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:56,670
but in this season, the temperature
of the water drops rapidly

2032
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,170
at 5:00 before sundown.

2033
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:01,650
After 5:00, even if we find her...

2034
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:03,800
Not good...

2035
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,900
The sea temperature is already dropping.

2036
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:08,110
Damn it! There's no time!

2037
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:10,810
There must be a way...

2038
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:13,390
A wristwatch...

2039
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:17,100
Didn't Ran borrow a watch from Mitsuhiko?

2040
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:18,600
Why?!

2041
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:20,960
Why are you stopping the search?!

2042
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:22,650
I know you'll find her!

2043
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:24,030
Don't give up!

2044
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:25,850
This ship is amazing, right?

2045
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:27,400
That's right! Do something!

2046
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,740
It's the Great Detective of the Sea, right?

2047
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,830
The Great Detective of the Sea...

2048
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:37,590
That's it!
If we use the Aegis system's radar...

2049
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:43,490
At 1700 hours, this ship will hand
the rescue operation to outside experts

2050
01:38:43,850 --> 01:38:45,290
and return to Maizuru Port.

2051
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:46,460
The atomic wristwatch!

2052
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:48,910
Ran has an atomic wristwatch on!

2053
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,170
The Aegis system can pick up a signal
like that, can't it?

2054
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:55,200
Mitsuhiko, you said the watch
was completely waterproof, right?

2055
01:38:55,970 --> 01:38:57,010
Yes!

2056
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:59,990
It receives signals
at exactly 5 AM and 5 PM.

2057
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:02,370
Captain, there's no time. Please hurry!

2058
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:04,830
Prepare the signal detection device!

2059
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:09,160
One minute, forty seconds to 5:00 PM.

2060
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,590
You can do it, right?

2061
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,240
We will do it!

2062
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:16,160
Prepare signal detection! Quickly!

2063
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:17,580
This is not a drill!

2064
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:19,800
Repeat, this is not a drill!

2065
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,230
All officers on deck, please evacuate.

2066
01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:25,360
Repeat! All officers on deck,
please evacuate!

2067
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,280
Please! Make it in time!

2068
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,260
Evacuation complete!

2069
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:31,600
Signal detection device, ready!

2070
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:34,040
Begin Aegis signal detection!

2071
01:39:34,180 --> 01:39:35,410
Begin detection!

2072
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:39,140
Present time, 1659 hours.
10 seconds until 5 PM.

2073
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:43,920
9-8-7-6

2074
01:39:44,510 --> 01:39:49,280
5-4-3-2-1.

2075
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:50,770
Exactly 5 PM!

2076
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:03,840
Any response?

2077
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:07,880
No response within search parameters.

2078
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:11,830
What? But why?!

2079
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,310
It could be that the wristwatch
that picks up the signal

2080
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,540
has already sunk beneath the sea.

2081
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:21,390
Ran...

2082
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,620
No. It can't be.

2083
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,330
You'll find me, won't you?

2084
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,170
That's why I offered to go with you.

2085
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:44,670
Yeah, but...

2086
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:47,170
No more wandering around alone.

2087
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,750
Next time, you might not make it back.

2088
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:51,290
I'll be fine.

2089
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:52,320
Huh?

2090
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:54,040
No matter how lost I get,

2091
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,870
you'll find me right?

2092
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,190
After all,
you're a great detective, Shinichi.

2093
01:41:05,430 --> 01:41:07,320
How can I call myself a great detective

2094
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,370
if I can't find Ran?!

2095
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:16,060
Ran!

2096
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:29,620
Ran!

2097
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:37,770
That sounded like Conan's voice...

2098
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:42,920
I told you, didn't I?
I'll find you, no matter what.

2099
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:45,890
What took you so long?

2100
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,540
Shinichi...

2101
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,320
Could it be?

2102
01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:00,410
It's weak, but I have a signal!

2103
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:02,350
It's getting stronger!

2104
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:06,590
It's Ran! Ran is there! Send the helicopter!

2105
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:10,310
Send the helicopter immediately!

2106
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:11,280
Roger!

2107
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:15,370
Target coordinates, four kilometers
northwest of ship.

2108
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:19,600
Latitude 36 degrees north. Four minutes.
Longitude 135 degrees East. Go, now!

2109
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,880
Roger. Heading toward designated point.

2110
01:42:26,130 --> 01:42:28,150
Arriving at search point.

2111
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,340
Directly over search point.
Visibility poor.

2112
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:37,910
Worse, the glare from the waves
at sundown is awful.

2113
01:42:38,510 --> 01:42:40,660
-I doubt we can find her before sundown.
ｰGlare?

2114
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,670
Say, is there one point of glare
that's shinier than the others?

2115
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:47,150
Uh, umm...

2116
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:48,620
Well? Answer him!

2117
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:51,150
Yes. A portion of the sea surface

2118
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:53,870
is reflecting light
from the helicopter in an odd way.

2119
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:56,810
That's it! Follow that light!

2120
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,640
It will lead you to Ran!

2121
01:42:59,710 --> 01:43:02,300
Do as the boy says
and have them fly to that spot.

2122
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:04,150
Please, Captain.

2123
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:05,540
Right.

2124
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,380
Follow the glow from floating matter.

2125
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,210
The victim should be at the VC point.

2126
01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:11,180
Roger.

2127
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,760
We're at the convergence point
of the floating matter.

2128
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:31,570
We will now descend.

2129
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,920
There's something below us!

2130
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:40,890
It's definitely not random objects!

2131
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:45,660
Found her!

2132
01:43:45,930 --> 01:43:46,940
We have found the victim!

2133
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:48,790
She's alive!

2134
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:50,590
Beginning rescue.

2135
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,850
Yes!

2136
01:43:59,890 --> 01:44:02,110
Thank you. Well done.

2137
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:04,640
Once you recover her,
head immediately to a hospital.

2138
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:06,060
Roger.

2139
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:09,890
The victim seems to be conscious, but we
will fly to a hospital as a precaution.

2140
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:13,190
Her body temperature is low,
but her heart rate is stable.

2141
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,720
Shinichi...

2142
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:25,630
Thanks, Old man.

2143
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:01,160
I told ya'! It's nothing!

2144
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:02,310
It's just a scratch!

2145
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:03,960
Nothin' serious!

2146
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:05,350
Thanks, Hattori.

2147
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:06,980
Sure.

2148
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:08,210
Kazuha...!

2149
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:11,200
I said, I'm okay.

2150
01:49:11,410 --> 01:49:13,410
Don't make that face...

2151
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,640
Oh no, no crying!

2152
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:21,610
What's up with him?

2153
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:24,360
Your name's Conan, right?

2154
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:25,830
Oh, Nanami-san!

2155
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:27,760
Thank you for everything.

2156
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,920
That's my line.

2157
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,560
Thank you.

2158
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:34,780
I'll be going, then.

2159
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,490
Say, Conan-kun.

2160
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:41,000
Who are you, really?

2161
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,080
Conan Edogawa.

2162
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:47,190
Just your average first grader.

2163
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:12,220

(18th Feature Film to open in April, 2014)

2166
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:21,160
Aren't you forgetting something?

2167
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,750
(December, 2013)

2168
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:27,800
I can't talk you out of it?

2169
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:29,740
It can't be helped.

2170
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:32,480
Let's get it over with.

2171
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,620
