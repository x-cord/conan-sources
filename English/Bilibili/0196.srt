1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.340
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.040
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.740
A parent is a parent but not the child.

5
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.540
Ran's challenge outdoes Kogoro.

6
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.140
His name is Detective Conan!

"Unseen Weapon - Ran's First Case"

10
00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.299
It's so hot!

11
00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.899
The Akasaka Princess Hotel's a nice hotel

12
00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.599
but this hill's a killer.

13
00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.499
You're so right! I'd like to change right away

14
00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.399
and jump right into the pool, don't you?

15
00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.499
Listen, Ran.

16
00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.099
I'm going to find me a gorgeous guy

17
00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.599
so don't you get in my way, understand?

18
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.199
Yes. I understand completely.

19
00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.099
By the way, have you heard anything from Shinichi?

20
00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.899
No. Not since he left.

21
00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:26.999
Is he working on another case?

22
00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.399
I just don't understand how one can get so worked

23
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.599
about a case.

24
00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:36.299
Look at that car.

25
00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.299
This doesn't look good!

26
00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.099
Look out!

27
00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.899
I'm so sorry! Are you two all right?

28
00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:50.399
We're fine.

29
00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.399
Just barely.

"Akasaka Princess Hotel"

31
00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:56.799
So Ms. Yoshino,

32
00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.699
you're an instructor at a flower design school.

33
00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.999
Yes, I work at Shizuoka five days a week.

34
00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.199
Did you say Shizuoka?

35
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.199
That's very far, isn't it?

36
00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.599
"Chie Yoshino (31)"

37
00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.099
In fact, I was on my way to school just now

38
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.399
when I remembered today was a holiday.

39
00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.299
So I called my husband...

40
00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.599
He works for an insurance company

41
00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.899
and we made plans to meet here at this hotel.

42
00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:22.999
We were going to have lunch.

43
00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.899
Oh, I see.

44
00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.299
I'm really very sorry about what happened.

45
00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.599
I suddenly got dizzy and lost consciousness for a second.

46
00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.999
I've been getting dizzy spells

47
00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.999
and splitting headaches a lot lately.

48
00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.399
Maybe you're sick?

49
00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.899
No, the doctor couldn't find anything wrong.

50
00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:43.099
It's probably the weather.

51
00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.399
The temperature has been fluctuating

52
00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.399
so radically lately, hasn't it?

53
00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:50.299
And I guess the fatigue's been building up

54
00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.499
since I have to drive to and from Shizuoka every day.

55
00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:54.999
The proof is when there's no school

56
00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.799
or when it's cool, even if it's a weekday,

57
00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.999
I feel fine. Nothing happens.

58
00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.499
Is that so?

59
00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.199
Chie!

60
00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:03.999
Hi, there!

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:07.399
"Akio Yoshino (33)" -This is my husband, Akio Yoshino

62
00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:09.099
Oh, hello.

63
00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.999
This is Ran Mouri and Sonoko Suzuki.

64
00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.599
I had another dizzy spell

65
00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.399
and nearly ran them down.

66
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:17.799
Again?

67
00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.399
Were you hurt in any way?

68
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.599
No, we're fine! Although it was a close call.

69
00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.399
Your wife was nice enough to treat us to lunch.

70
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:29.199
I see. Please accept my apologies.

71
00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.099
And how do you feel?

72
00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.699
I'm okay. I felt fine after I rested a while.

73
00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.299
Good. I'm so relieved.

74
00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:38.799
He seems so nice.

75
00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:39.799
Yes.

76
00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:42.699
Excuse me, I think we'll be going now.

77
00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.499
That's right, you were going to the pool, weren't you?

78
00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.199
All right then.

79
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.399
Where do you two live?

80
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:52.599
In Beika.

81
00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.199
Oh, that's near us.

82
00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.199
We live in Haido.

83
00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.699
We live very close to the park, please drop by sometime!

84
00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.399
Thank you!

85
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.699
A bump?

86
00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.399
What is this?

87
00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:13.199
Ran, be careful! There's a bump here!

88
00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.299
Okay.

89
00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:24.399
"Mouri Detective Agency"

90
00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.699
Well?

91
00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.299
Don't you think it's strange?

92
00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:28.699
What is?

93
00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.499
I just told you, he knew she had just had a dizzy spell,

94
00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:35.499
so why didn't he warn her about the bump?

95
00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:38.699
She couldn't have gotten hurt badly if she had tripped and fell!

96
00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.699
It wasn't such a big bump,

97
00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.899
I don't see why you're making such a big deal out of it.

98
00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.099
But Sonoko warned me about it.

99
00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.699
And I'm sure that guy would too.

100
00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:55.199
"That guy"? Who're you talking about?

101
00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:56.599
Oh, nothing.

102
00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.299
Anyway! I'm very curious about that couple.

103
00:06:00.299 --> 00:06:02.599
I think I'll go over to visit Mrs. Chie and check things out.

104
00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.899
And do what?

105
00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:06.399
I want to find out what's causing her

106
00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.299
to have those headaches and dizzy spells!

107
00:06:08.299 --> 00:06:10.199
What? You're no doctor.

108
00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.699
Don't poke your nose where it doesn't belong.

109
00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.799
I'm not stupid, I can figure it out!

110
00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:16.399
If you're going to insist, go ahead and try.

111
00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.399
I most certainly will!

112
00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:24.299
I've never heard her say anything like this

113
00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:27.799
but she does have a point, something's fishy.

114
00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:30.099
Hey, can I go with you?

115
00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:33.199
Do you want to come with me?

116
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.699
Then I'll ask Sonoko to come along

117
00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:35.899
and we'll all go together!

118
00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:38.299
What do I care?

119
00:06:38.299 --> 00:06:41.099
I guess I'll have my rice now.

120
00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:42.399
Get it yourself!

121
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:44.099
What?

122
00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.299
What a grouch.

123
00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:49.499
"Yoshino's Residence"

124
00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:51.699
Amazing!

125
00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:53.299
This place is super nice!

126
00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:56.799
The garden's so well cared for.

127
00:06:56.799 --> 00:06:59.199
Your home is so beautiful!

128
00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:00.499
Thank you!

129
00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:03.699
We just finished building this place a month and a half ago.

130
00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.799
No wonder. I had a feeling it was new.

131
00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:09.299
A new house, how wonderful!

132
00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:13.999
But carrying a loan of 40 million yen is pretty rough.

133
00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:16.299
That's why we both have to work,

134
00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:19.399
otherwise we'd never make ends meet.

135
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.999
Here you are.

136
00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:22.399
Thank you.

137
00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:25.299
I apologize for barging in on you

138
00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:26.699
when it's your day off.

139
00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:27.699
It's quite all right!

140
00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:31.299
My husband went out this morning, so I'm alone today.

141
00:07:31.299 --> 00:07:33.699
Your husband seems so nice!

142
00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:35.399
Yes, I suppose he is.

143
00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:37.299
He loves cars and he's been complaining lately

144
00:07:37.299 --> 00:07:39.299
that he hasn't been able to go out

145
00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:41.599
for drives like he used to.

146
00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.399
I guess that's why he goes out walking every morning,

147
00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.499
to take his mind off it.

148
00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:49.999
And while he's out, I fix breakfast.

149
00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:54.099
This may be a strange thing to ask but...

150
00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.299
Why do you go all the way to Shizuoka to work?

151
00:07:57.299 --> 00:07:59.399
To help pay for the loan.

152
00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:03.699
I used to teach at a design school here in the city

153
00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:07.699
but my husband told me about this school in Shizuoka.

154
00:08:07.699 --> 00:08:11.099
The salary was better there.

155
00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:12.999
I see.

156
00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:14.999
But still, it's pretty hard on you, isn't it?

157
00:08:14.999 --> 00:08:17.599
Driving there every day.

158
00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:18.799
That's right!

159
00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:19.799
If you took the train,

160
00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.099
you'd at least be able to get some sleep.

161
00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:25.299
Actually, I enjoy driving.

162
00:08:25.299 --> 00:08:27.299
The entrance to the highway is near here,

163
00:08:27.299 --> 00:08:29.199
besides, it's much more convenient

164
00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:31.299
when you have a lot of supplies and large equipment, isn't it?

165
00:08:31.299 --> 00:08:33.299
I guess.

166
00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.999
By the way, have you kids ever thought about insurance...

167
00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:38.799
Oh, dear! I forgot, you're still in school.

168
00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.699
What was that?

169
00:08:40.699 --> 00:08:41.999
I'm terribly sorry.

170
00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:44.499
My husband works for an insurance company

171
00:08:44.499 --> 00:08:47.499
and I've gotten into the habit of suggesting people to get insurance.

172
00:08:47.499 --> 00:08:50.399
As a wife, you're helping your husband, right?

173
00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:52.099
Yes. Well...

174
00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:55.299
I felt bad about just suggesting it to others

175
00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:58.899
so I just recently adjusted my policy to 100 million.

176
00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:02.499
A 100 million?

177
00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:04.599
My husband asked me to.

178
00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:06.899
The monthly payments are very high.

179
00:09:06.899 --> 00:09:08.699
But I get my money back

180
00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:11.599
after a certain amount of time

181
00:09:11.599 --> 00:09:14.099
I figured it'd make his sales rate look good.

182
00:09:14.099 --> 00:09:16.499
You're really crazy about him, aren't you?

183
00:09:16.499 --> 00:09:20.099
Eh? Oh, do you think so?

184
00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:21.899
100 million yen?

185
00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:23.599
Could it be...

186
00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:25.599
But then...

187
00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:30.999
Excuse me, when did you start having those headaches and dizzy spells?

188
00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:32.699
Let's see.

189
00:09:32.699 --> 00:09:35.399
About a month ago I guess.

190
00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.599
A month ago.

191
00:09:36.599 --> 00:09:40.499
That means half a month after the house was built.

192
00:09:40.499 --> 00:09:44.399
Maybe that's what they call "sick house syndrome"

193
00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:49.899
"Sick house syndrome"?

194
00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:50.999
What?

195
00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:54.099
Did you say "Shiku hakku (To be in agony)"?

196
00:09:54.099 --> 00:09:56.499
I said "sick house syndrome"!

197
00:09:56.499 --> 00:10:00.099
It's when people get sick from the gas given off by the lumber

198
00:10:00.099 --> 00:10:02.699
and paint used when building a house!

199
00:10:02.699 --> 00:10:07.899
Sonoko, I'm sure you've heard of formaldehyde.

200
00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.099
Don't make fun of me!

201
00:10:10.099 --> 00:10:12.699
Of course I know about those things!

202
00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:15.299
I'm not sure. but don't think that's it.

203
00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:17.299
Why not?

204
00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:18.999
The contractor who built this house

205
00:10:18.999 --> 00:10:22.799
is a friend of my husband's.

206
00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:28.199
My husband would have told them not to use anything that was dangerous.

207
00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:29.399
But...

208
00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:32.699
But I still think you should have it checked out!

209
00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:35.899
The contractor could have deceived you.

210
00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:39.299
Sonoko! Do you know of any companies

211
00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:41.499
that specialize in checking for contaminated building supplies?

212
00:10:41.499 --> 00:10:42.599
Well, sure.

213
00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:45.099
My father would probably know, we could ask him.

214
00:10:45.099 --> 00:10:47.099
All right then, let's ask him right away!

215
00:10:47.099 --> 00:10:50.499
Mrs. Chie, I think you should have it checked just to be safe!

216
00:10:50.499 --> 00:10:52.299
Well, Okay.

217
00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:04.399
Ran, you're acting strange today.

218
00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:07.699
Why did you insist on getting her house checked?

219
00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:09.799
I had my reasons.

220
00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.999
Ran thinks Mrs. Chie's husband, Mr. Akio,

221
00:11:12.999 --> 00:11:18.299
is trying to kill her to collect the insurance money.

222
00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:21.699
What? Ran, is that true?

223
00:11:21.699 --> 00:11:24.899
Yes.

224
00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:27.399
What's going on?

225
00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.699
First, Mr. Akio gets the contractor

226
00:11:30.699 --> 00:11:33.499
to build the house using dangerous materials

227
00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:36.699
so that Mrs. Chie's health starts getting bad.

228
00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:39.299
And on the other hand,

229
00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:43.399
he suggests she take the job in Shizuoka.

230
00:11:43.399 --> 00:11:45.699
But why?

231
00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:48.299
Mrs. Chie does as he suggests

232
00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:51.499
and drives to and from work on the highway every day.

233
00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:53.999
What if she has a dizzy spell while driving...

234
00:12:04.599 --> 00:12:06.299
That's impossible...

235
00:12:06.299 --> 00:12:08.599
Maybe you're overthinking it.

236
00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:11.099
First of all, if things like that happened,

237
00:12:11.099 --> 00:12:14.499
wouldn't the house make Mr. Akio sick too?

238
00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:16.999
He does live in the same house too!

239
00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:19.799
But those materials could've been used

240
00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:22.299
only for her room and the kitchen.

241
00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:27.499
Of course, we have no proof.

242
00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:28.899
But as long as the possibility exists,

243
00:12:28.899 --> 00:12:31.399
I thought it was best to check it out.

244
00:12:33.499 --> 00:12:35.199
At this point,

245
00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:36.299
we still didn't know

246
00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:38.899
if Ran's suspicions were correct.

247
00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:43.299
But something doesn't seem right.

248
00:12:43.299 --> 00:12:45.099
I couldn't put my finger on it.

249
00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:50.999
This is a formaldehyde detector.

250
00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:54.599
There's a possibility that different materials were used in each room

251
00:12:54.599 --> 00:12:58.499
so I think it's best if we checked every room to be accurate.

252
00:12:58.499 --> 00:13:01.299
Fine, you may start anytime.

253
00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.499
All right then let's begin.

254
00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:06.099
When Chie told me about this,

255
00:13:06.099 --> 00:13:08.199
I was shaken up

256
00:13:08.199 --> 00:13:11.999
but then there is a possibility

257
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:13.599
the contractor did use those kinds of materials.

258
00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:17.599
So I figured it might be better to have it checked.

259
00:13:17.599 --> 00:13:20.999
-Yes, that's right. -Yes, that's right.

260
00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:23.899
Well, I'm going for a walk.

261
00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:26.699
I'll pick up some cake on the way back.

262
00:13:26.699 --> 00:13:27.999
That would be nice.

263
00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:29.099
See you later.

264
00:13:33.099 --> 00:13:36.399
He really loves to take walks!

265
00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.299
I'm going to take a walk too!

266
00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:40.999
Hey, Conan. Don't stay out too long!

267
00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:42.099
Okay!

268
00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:17.399
That customer's going to buy it, isn't he?

269
00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:20.199
Yes! He used to come in all the time on his days off

270
00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:21.599
but I think he's made up his mind now!

271
00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:24.399
What?

272
00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:26.099
25 million yen!

273
00:14:26.099 --> 00:14:28.499
Come on, is he serious?

274
00:14:28.499 --> 00:14:30.699
We have the results!

275
00:14:30.699 --> 00:14:32.099
Every room shows a level

276
00:14:32.099 --> 00:14:34.599
much lower than 0.08 ppm

277
00:14:34.599 --> 00:14:36.599
which is the level the Ministry of Health and Welfare

278
00:14:36.599 --> 00:14:39.699
has declared safe four years ago.

279
00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:42.299
Are you sure about that?

280
00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:44.099
And what does that mean?

281
00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:47.199
It means this house is absolutely safe!

282
00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:48.699
What a relief.

283
00:14:48.699 --> 00:14:50.799
I guess "sick house syndrome" has nothing to do with

284
00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:53.999
what that is making me sick.

285
00:14:53.999 --> 00:14:55.599
You're just tired.

286
00:14:55.599 --> 00:14:58.399
Let's try to get to bed earlier.

287
00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:00.999
Yes.

288
00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:03.899
I don't understand.

289
00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:06.199
Is there something else going on here?

290
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:14.789
"Mouri Detective Agency" -I told you so!

291
00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:19.989
That's what happens when amateurs try to do a professional's job!

292
00:15:19.989 --> 00:15:23.889
I wonder if it could just have been my imagination.

293
00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:25.489
I hope you didn't tell them

294
00:15:25.489 --> 00:15:31.589
you are the famous detective Kogoro Mouri's daughter.

295
00:15:31.589 --> 00:15:33.789
Of course not.

296
00:15:33.789 --> 00:15:35.289
That's good.

297
00:15:35.289 --> 00:15:36.289
I hope this taught you

298
00:15:36.289 --> 00:15:39.789
not to go sticking your nose into other people's business.

299
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:42.989
Well, answer me!

300
00:15:42.989 --> 00:15:44.689
I understand

301
00:15:51.589 --> 00:15:56.089
I guess I just can't compete with "that guy".

302
00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:07.089
Conan.

303
00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:10.689
Ran, I don't think you were wrong.

304
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:16.589
Today, I overheard the salesmen

305
00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:18.689
at the place they sell sports cars,

306
00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:21.089
Mr. Akio is going to buy a car

307
00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:23.589
that costs 25 million yen!

308
00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:25.889
25 million yen?

309
00:16:25.889 --> 00:16:28.589
Where's he getting the money from?

310
00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:30.789
The insurance on Mrs. Chie?

311
00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.389
He is trying to kill Mrs. Chie after all!

312
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:36.189
Yeah. Even after he pays off the loan on the house,

313
00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:38.889
he'll still have 60 million left.

314
00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:44.089
But there was no sign the air in the house was contaminated.

315
00:16:44.089 --> 00:16:47.089
Maybe he was poisoning her food.

316
00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:50.889
But I think she does all the cooking.

317
00:16:50.889 --> 00:16:52.189
That's right.

318
00:16:54.589 --> 00:16:57.289
"Mouri Detective Agency"

319
00:17:00.689 --> 00:17:02.489
What do you think?

320
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:04.289
How did he do it?

321
00:17:04.289 --> 00:17:06.189
While I'm sitting here,

322
00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:10.189
danger could be creeping up on Mrs. Chie.

323
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:13.689
Hey, Shinichi, what am I going to do!

324
00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:16.889
Something's bugging me.

325
00:17:16.889 --> 00:17:20.089
And it's been bugging me ever since Ran told me about it.

326
00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:24.489
What is it?

327
00:17:24.489 --> 00:17:25.889
Wait a minute.

328
00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:28.089
I'm sure Mrs. Chie said...

329
00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.489
That's it! I've figured it out!

330
00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:34.989
You want to know what Mrs. Chie told me the first time?

331
00:17:34.989 --> 00:17:39.089
Yeah! What did she say about her dizzy spells?

332
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:42.289
I'm pretty sure it's...

333
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:44.489
It's probably the weather.

334
00:17:44.489 --> 00:17:46.689
The temperature has been fluctuating

335
00:17:46.689 --> 00:17:48.889
so radically lately, hasn't it?

336
00:17:48.889 --> 00:17:51.889
And I guess the fatigue's been building up

337
00:17:51.889 --> 00:17:54.389
since I have to drive to and from Shizuoka every day.

338
00:17:54.389 --> 00:17:56.989
The proof is when there's no school

339
00:17:56.989 --> 00:17:58.889
or when it's cool, even if it's a weekday,

340
00:17:58.889 --> 00:18:02.189
I feel fine. Nothing happens.

341
00:18:02.189 --> 00:18:04.289
That's what she said.

342
00:18:04.289 --> 00:18:07.789
See! If it was something in the house,

343
00:18:07.789 --> 00:18:10.189
then wouldn't the symptoms be worse on her days off

344
00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:12.889
when she's at home longer

345
00:18:12.889 --> 00:18:14.989
instead of when she's out?

346
00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:17.689
You know. You're right.

347
00:18:17.689 --> 00:18:20.289
I think the thing that's giving her headaches

348
00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:22.989
and dizzy spells aren't in the house.

349
00:18:22.989 --> 00:18:25.389
Is it somewhere else?

350
00:18:25.389 --> 00:18:28.089
Maybe at the design school in Shizuoka?

351
00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:30.789
Or, someplace between her house and the school.

352
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:31.889
What?

353
00:18:34.389 --> 00:18:35.789
Could it be...

354
00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:41.389
"Next morning" -I'm going for my walk now.

355
00:18:41.389 --> 00:18:43.789
Okay. Ham and eggs for breakfast okay with you?

356
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:44.889
Sounds good!

357
00:18:44.889 --> 00:18:46.889
I'll be hungry when I come home

358
00:18:46.889 --> 00:18:48.489
so make a lot!

359
00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:33.089
Hey?

360
00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:34.789
What are you kids doing here?

361
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:38.689
Mr. Yoshino, what did you just put in your pocket?

362
00:19:38.689 --> 00:19:40.389
What?

363
00:19:40.389 --> 00:19:42.089
It's an air conditioner disinfectant.

364
00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:46.789
I wanted to protect Chie from cold germs and other bacteria.

365
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:49.089
Okay then, when the police get here,

366
00:19:49.089 --> 00:19:50.789
you'll show that to them, won't you?

367
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.389
What?

368
00:19:52.389 --> 00:19:54.389
I just called them.

369
00:19:54.389 --> 00:19:56.989
A police officer that I know.

370
00:19:56.989 --> 00:19:58.789
Police?

371
00:19:58.789 --> 00:20:01.589
I'm sure Mrs. Chie would never have dreamed that

372
00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:04.489
her husband, the man she trusted the most,

373
00:20:04.489 --> 00:20:06.489
was spraying an "unseen weapon"

374
00:20:06.489 --> 00:20:10.189
into her car's air conditioner every morning.

375
00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:13.789
That's why Mrs. Chie never got sick when she didn't drive to work

376
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:15.989
or when it was cool enough

377
00:20:15.989 --> 00:20:18.089
where she didn't have to use the air conditioner.

378
00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:25.689
Mrs. Chie.

379
00:20:28.489 --> 00:20:29.689
Akio.

380
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:47.589
Later, the police investigation showed

381
00:20:47.589 --> 00:20:49.089
that the spray bottle contained

382
00:20:49.089 --> 00:20:52.589
a diluted agricultural chemical composed of organic chlorine.

383
00:20:53.989 --> 00:20:55.289
In his confession,

384
00:20:55.289 --> 00:20:58.489
he said that he embezzled several million from his company

385
00:20:58.489 --> 00:20:59.889
and was trying to cover the deficit

386
00:20:59.889 --> 00:21:01.089
but he also wanted a new sports car

387
00:21:01.089 --> 00:21:03.689
and that's why he thought up this plan.

388
00:22:41.389 --> 00:22:44.589
You mean Mrs. Chie sold the house?

389
00:22:44.589 --> 00:22:46.789
Yes and with some friends,

390
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:50.089
they opened a flower design company!

391
00:22:50.089 --> 00:22:51.189
Look.

392
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:55.889
She looks good!

393
00:22:55.889 --> 00:22:57.189
Ms. Chie Taniguchi.

394
00:22:57.189 --> 00:22:59.889
She got a divorce and went back to her maiden name.

395
00:22:59.889 --> 00:23:03.289
Boy, women get over things so quickly.

396
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:05.489
But to be suspicious of Mr. Akio Yoshino

397
00:23:05.489 --> 00:23:07.089
just from that one step at the hotel,

398
00:23:07.089 --> 00:23:08.889
Ran sure was sharp.

399
00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:10.989
I'm so glad things worked out.

400
00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:12.989
If you hadn't noticed anything and done all you did,

401
00:23:12.989 --> 00:23:14.989
Ms. Chie might be dead now!

402
00:23:14.989 --> 00:23:15.989
Hold on now!

403
00:23:15.989 --> 00:23:20.789
Maybe you're getting to be like "you know who".

404
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:22.189
Don't be silly.

405
00:23:22.189 --> 00:23:26.389
But I guess you could say I wanted to understand him a little more

406
00:23:26.389 --> 00:23:29.489
or maybe get to feel closer to him.

407
00:23:32.189 --> 00:23:33.489
Yes, I understand.

408
00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:37.389
So, do you understand Shinichi a little more now?

409
00:23:40.689 --> 00:23:42.189
No way!

410
00:23:42.189 --> 00:23:45.389
Who can understand that mystery fanatic!

411
00:23:46.689 --> 00:23:48.989
Whatever you say.

412
00:23:48.989 --> 00:23:51.289
But never mind that, let's go eat some yummy cakes!

413
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:54.289
Let's go.

414
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:56.189
Well, I guess it's for the best.

415
00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:00.489
"Next Episode"

416
00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:05.289
Was he trying to damage his own car?

417
00:24:09.489 --> 00:24:13.389
Hey, doesn't the president have a portable telephone with him?

418
00:24:16.289 --> 00:24:17.389
Ran?

419
00:24:19.489 --> 00:24:20.789
Ran!

420
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:22.489
Ran, where are you?

421
00:24:23.189 --> 00:24:24.589
Next Conan,

422
00:24:24.589 --> 00:24:28.489
"Trap of the Super Car (Part 1)"

423
00:24:28.907 --> 00:24:31.307
Next Conan's Hint:

424
00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:32.907
"Open window"

425
00:24:33.807 --> 00:24:36.407
-The next episode... -Where does one buy a super car?

426
00:24:36.407 --> 00:24:38.107
Is it in a super market?
