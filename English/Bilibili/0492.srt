1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,525
I was checking on the connection between Kir of the Black Organization,

2
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:07,625
Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke Hondo,

3
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:11,225
the new student who transferred from another school to Ran's class.

4
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:13,225
I found out that Eisuke's father

5
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,825
was hired at a place called "the Company".

6
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:18,325
And that Eisuke was looking for his older sister

7
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:20,425
who had left home ten years ago,

8
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:23,225
that looked exactly like Rena Mizunashi.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,025
Is Eisuke Hondo's older sister and Rena Mizunashi,

10
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,925
one and the same person?

11
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:31,825
We went to visit Mr. Anno

12
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,125
who happened to be a great fan of Rena Mizunashi.

13
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,525
We came to see you, sir.

14
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:40,925
We've got a favor to ask you.

15
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:45,525
We want you to take a look at the picture of this woman!

16
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,325
Sizzling hot suspense.

17
00:01:06,325 --> 00:01:08,925
A red scream and black bullet whizz through the darkness.

18
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:11,125
Eisuke Hondo looks for his older sister with all his might.

19
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:13,725
An unexpected truth is revealed through blood types.

20
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,225
He sees through the one and only truth.

21
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:16,825
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

22
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:19,225
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

23
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:58,324
"Red and Black Clash: Kin"

24
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:02,424
"Anno"

25
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,224
No matter what angle I look at her from,

26
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,824
she looks like none other than Rena when she was young.

27
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:16,324
You think so too, don't you? Don't you?

28
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:19,324
Then maybe she's your older sister after all, Eisuke.

29
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,124
Huh? Are you Rena's younger brother?

30
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:24,524
Come to think of it, you have her eyes!

31
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,924
Could you get me her autograph?

32
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:30,724
Oh, but I think that the announcer called Rena Mizunashi

33
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:33,224
and sis are two different people.

34
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:35,624
He's looking for his older sister who left home,

35
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,724
that's her in this picture, you see!

36
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:40,024
I'm sure it's her, then!

37
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:42,524
I'm a great fan of hers and I would never make a mistake!

38
00:03:42,524 --> 00:03:44,224
But...

39
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,824
Come to think of it, when Rena first came on TV,

40
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:51,424
she had a hair style very similar to that of this woman.

41
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,224
Maybe watching a video of back then may help?

42
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:59,424
This is a recording of the news program that made her popular.

43
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,824
Well, take a look at it.

44
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,724
This is an image taken from the air.

45
00:04:03,724 --> 00:04:05,524
The scene sure looks like a battlefield!

46
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:07,624
This chemical plant suddenly exploded.

47
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,624
Although it is still unconfirmed,

48
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,924
there seems to be a number of over 100 casualties.

49
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,824
The victims are being moved into

50
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:14,524
a hospital nearby one after the other.

51
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:16,709
This disastrous incident occurred while we, at Nichiuri TV

52
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:18,224
were conducting an interview here.

53
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,709
I was also slightly injured myself because of the explosion...

54
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,324
Excuse me!

55
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:23,724
Is there anyone here that is blood type AB,

56
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,624
any AB blood type people around?

57
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,024
We don't have enough blood.

58
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:29,324
Is there anyone with blood type AB?

59
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:32,224
I'm sorry, I have blood type AB, so I've got to go!

60
00:04:32,224 --> 00:04:33,524
What, Rena?

61
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,624
Oh, I'm blood type AB!

62
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:40,824
My, you're hurt too.

63
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:43,724
Yes, but I've got a lot of hot blood.

64
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:46,124
I see, please come inside with me.

65
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:49,824
Did you see that? She's hurt herself, and yet she has the kindness

66
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,324
to offer her blood to someone else!

67
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,324
That's not easy to do, right?

68
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:56,024
No, it's not.

69
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:59,424
The fact is, she was at this plant doing an interview,

70
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,324
and had a bad wound that required several stitches herself.

71
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:04,724
That's why after she gave blood for blood transfusion,

72
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,724
she went faint and had to receive transfusion herself.

73
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,024
Cute try, don't you think?

74
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:16,824
I'm completely recovered now.

75
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:20,024
How about it, Eisuke? She's not your older sister?

76
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:22,324
-No, she isn't! -Huh, why not?

77
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:25,124
Go on, and take a closer look at her!

78
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,124
It's not her, I'm telling you it's not her.

79
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:29,824
If what his older sister said...

80
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:34,324
Your blood type is one that you can give to everybody.

81
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:35,824
If what she said is true,

82
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:37,724
his blood type is the only blood type

83
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:39,524
that can be given to anyone.

84
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:41,124
Blood type, O.

85
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,524
Normally, blood of the same type is used for transfusions,

86
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,424
but when there is a need for a large amount of blood transfusion

87
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:50,124
or in a life or death situation and blood is needed right away,

88
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,124
no matter what blood type the person is,

89
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:54,724
blood type O is used.

90
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:57,624
The situation in the video just now, was just that.

91
00:05:57,624 --> 00:05:59,124
But, O blood type people

92
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:02,024
can only receive from other O blood type people.

93
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:04,624
If he received blood from his older sister in the past,

94
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:06,924
his sister should've also been blood type O.

95
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:08,424
However, the woman in the video

96
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:10,124
declared that she was blood type AB.

97
00:06:10,124 --> 00:06:12,624
Moreover, she received blood transfusion herself later on too.

98
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:15,224
If she were actually blood type O,

99
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:18,724
and for some reason lied saying that she was blood type AB,

100
00:06:18,724 --> 00:06:21,024
she can give blood to a person who is blood type AB,

101
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,824
but she cannot receive that blood type!

102
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:24,224
In other words,

103
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:28,524
Rena Mizunashi and the woman in the picture are two different people.

104
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,824
Then, the reason he's looking for Rena Mizunashi

105
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,424
is not because she's his older sister.

106
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:37,524
But, rather, it's because she looks exactly like his older sister.

107
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:40,224
"Haido Central Hospital"

108
00:06:43,924 --> 00:06:45,324
A young man who has an older sister

109
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,324
who looks just like Rena Mizunashi.

110
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,424
Yep. It seems as if he found out that Rena Mizunashi

111
00:06:50,424 --> 00:06:53,024
was hurt badly in that incident in the past.

112
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:56,324
Now he's going around to various hospitals looking for her.

113
00:06:56,324 --> 00:07:00,024
So, he may just show up at that hospital.

114
00:07:00,024 --> 00:07:03,124
Okay! So you want me to work it out, right?

115
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:04,324
Don't worry!

116
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:10,324
Only a few doctors and nurses are aware that she's here.

117
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:12,224
But what a surprise that

118
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,524
Rena Mizunashi had a younger brother.

119
00:07:14,524 --> 00:07:17,524
No, Rena Mizunashi and Eisuke Hondo's older sister

120
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:18,824
are two different people!

121
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:21,024
They have different blood types.

122
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,424
Huh, what do you mean?

123
00:07:22,424 --> 00:07:24,524
It's most likely that the guys in black

124
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:27,124
made the real Rena Mizunashi undergo plastic surgery

125
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:30,024
to make her look just like Eisuke's older sister

126
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,824
because of something having to do with Eisuke's father.

127
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:36,624
What? What's the identity of that boy's father?

128
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:40,424
I don't know yet, but all I can say is that

129
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:43,224
he is most probably a member of "the Company".

130
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:45,424
Company?

131
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,424
Don't tell me that...

132
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,224
I'm just saying most probably.

133
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,424
It's not that he himself said so.

134
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:51,524
Hey, you.

135
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:53,424
Aren't you prying a bit too deeply? It can be dangerous.

136
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:54,624
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

137
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,524
Yeah, at least for now.

138
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:58,624
At least for now?

139
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:01,924
Oh, I want to confirm something before I go.

140
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,524
Do you know what blood type Rena Mizunashi is?

141
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:08,324
Blood type AB, RH+.

142
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:10,224
Just as I thought.

143
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:14,824
Okay, I'll try checking on his father, on our side too.

144
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,724
But, promise me that you won't step into the dangerous zone!

145
00:08:17,724 --> 00:08:20,524
Okay, thanks Jodie.

146
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,624
And, how was it?

147
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,324
Were the older sister of the boy named Eisuke

148
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:27,924
and Rena Mizunashi really two different people?

149
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,724
Yeah, Rena Mizunashi is blood type AB,

150
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:32,924
and Eisuke Hondo is blood type O.

151
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,624
If the story about Eisuke receiving a blood transfusion

152
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:35,582
from his older sister is true,

153
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,418
they're two different people.

154
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,418
Because blood type O people

155
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,024
can only receive blood from people with the same blood type!

156
00:08:41,024 --> 00:08:42,418
But, he received the blood transfusion

157
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:44,824
when he was a child, didn't he?

158
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,424
It could be that he's mistaken.

159
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:50,924
Yeah, it's possible.

160
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:54,124
Including the fact of whether he really has blood type O.

161
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:57,224
Why don't you go confirm it by asking him directly then?

162
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:59,424
Or, hospitalizing him and checking it out?

163
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:00,924
Oh, come of it!

164
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,224
Either way, it's true that

165
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:04,924
we've got to check up on that as soon as possible.

166
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:08,224
We've got to find out why he's looking for Rena Mizunashi

167
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:10,524
and make him stop,

168
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:13,524
before those guys in black take note of him!

169
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:17,324
Right! Those guys were also looking for her.

170
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,824
Yeah, and most probably really desperately too.

171
00:09:20,824 --> 00:09:24,424
Wouldn't it be a good idea to make them see each other then?

172
00:09:24,424 --> 00:09:27,724
You know where she's hospitalized,

173
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:29,224
and besides that boy named Eisuke

174
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:31,624
is not a member of their group, right?

175
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:35,624
No, I can't risk letting them see each other yet.

176
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:39,124
Because there's still a possibility that Eisuke Hondo

177
00:09:39,124 --> 00:09:43,324
is being used by them without his being aware!

178
00:09:43,324 --> 00:09:45,824
"Haido Central Hospital"

179
00:10:19,024 --> 00:10:21,524
"Aoyama General Hospital"

180
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:33,424
You've finally awakened?

181
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,224
You're...

182
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:37,024
You don't remember?

183
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:39,224
I'm the one who ran you down with my car.

184
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:42,124
Oh, now that you mentioned it.

185
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:51,724
I'm sorry, just because of my carelessness.

186
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,624
No, I was absent-minded too.

187
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,924
Don't you have a headache? Does any part of your body hurt?

188
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,124
No, I'm fine.

189
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:02,124
I'm glad! I'll go get the doctor now!

190
00:11:02,124 --> 00:11:05,424
What's your name?

191
00:11:05,424 --> 00:11:07,824
I'm Akemi Miyano.

192
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:13,724
I'm Dai Moroboshi. Nice to meet you.

193
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:17,524
Oh, yes, same here!

194
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:55,335
What? You know where Rena Mizunashi's condo is?

195
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:56,335
Are you serious?

196
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:59,935
Yep. She asked us to check on an incident for her in the past.

197
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,835
Right, dad?

198
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:03,435
Yeah.

199
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:10,435
Doorbell prank?

200
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:13,735
And you want me to nab the one who's doing it?

201
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:16,535
See, I told you that it'd be rude to ask him.

202
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:26,335
I checked and found out...

203
00:12:26,335 --> 00:12:29,335
A kid!

204
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:31,235
No good. If you're a boy, be strong

205
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:33,835
and put your mother at ease.

206
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:38,935
So, it turned out to be a prank played by a kid.

207
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:41,935
I'm home!

208
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:43,435
Oh, hi, Conan.

209
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:46,735
Then, why didn't you take Eisuke along?

210
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:48,335
He can make out if it's really his older sister or not

211
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,035
if they meet, right?

212
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,135
Because I didn't think it was a very good idea to tell him

213
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:55,535
where a famous announcer lived without asking permission first.

214
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,835
And, I didn't want to build up his hope,

215
00:12:57,835 --> 00:13:01,035
then find out she was the wrong person and disappoint him even more.

216
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,935
I'm telling you it's not her!

217
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:05,735
He watched that video of Rena Mizunashi

218
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:08,435
but insisted that she wasn't his older sister too, right?

219
00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:10,235
I guess so.

220
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:13,035
It's good that he didn't go.

221
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:15,335
Those guys in black are likely

222
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:19,435
watching that condo now after Rena Mizunashi disappeared.

223
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:24,035
If Eisuke Hondo was taken to her place,

224
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:25,435
they would immediately lay their eyes on him,

225
00:13:25,435 --> 00:13:27,835
and things would have taken a turn for the worse.

226
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:32,335
So, Rena Mizunashi wasn't the older sister,

227
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:35,135
who ran away from home of that klutzy boy?

228
00:13:35,135 --> 00:13:37,635
Nope, well, he said she wasn't.

229
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,735
Come to think of it, back then.

230
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:47,835
I used to have a younger brother about his age in the past.

231
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:50,835
So, it wasn't the klutzy kid she was referring to then?

232
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:52,035
I guess not.

233
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:55,235
Besides, I'm sure that his blood type was not the same as Rena,

234
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:58,735
when I asked him about it some time ago.

235
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,635
Come on, Ran, just because their siblings,

236
00:14:00,635 --> 00:14:03,035
their blood types don't have to be the same, you know.

237
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:05,835
But, in that video she said,

238
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:08,035
"I'm blood type AB!"

239
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,235
Blood type AB people

240
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:12,335
can only give blood to the same blood type people, right?

241
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:13,335
Yep.

242
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:14,935
If I remember correctly,

243
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:16,635
Eisuke mentioned that his older sister gave him blood for a transfusion

244
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,935
when he was a child and saved him.

245
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:22,335
I see, so if that klutz and Rena Mizunashi are really siblings,

246
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:25,035
they should both be blood type AB.

247
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:29,335
What blood type did Eisuke say he was?

248
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,135
If I remember correctly...

249
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,735
Blood type O.

250
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:38,735
Hey, are you all right?

251
00:14:38,735 --> 00:14:43,035
Yes, I just tripped over something on the floor.

252
00:14:43,035 --> 00:14:46,435
Oh, I see. The tile is a slightly flipped over.

253
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:48,235
Oh, unlucky, as usual.

254
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:52,035
No, I think you're possessed by something else.

255
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,735
When did Eisuke come?

256
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:57,035
Together with us a while ago.

257
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:59,035
He was using the restroom.

258
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:02,335
I'm the very first assistant of the Mouri Detective Agency, you see.

259
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,735
But, unfortunately, I have no work you can help me with.

260
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:07,735
Is that so?

261
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:11,435
By the way, what's all this interest in my blood type about?

262
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:13,335
We were wondering what blood type you are.

263
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,735
You see, we're interested in what blood type you are.

264
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,635
Come on, why don't you tell him straight that he's blood type O,

265
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:22,635
so he's not Rena Mizunashi's younger brother?

266
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:24,935
But, what if he's thinking somewhere in his heart

267
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:27,235
that she may be his older sister?

268
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:28,335
I feel so sorry for him.

269
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:32,535
-Hey, are you really blood type O? -Yes.

270
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,435
Have you donated blood recently?

271
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,535
Oh, no, I haven't.

272
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:39,135
Then, have you been brought to the hospital

273
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,235
because of a bad injury or something?

274
00:15:41,235 --> 00:15:43,235
No, I haven't.

275
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,535
I used to go to the hospital a lot when I was little

276
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:47,635
because of wounds and illness.

277
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:50,935
I remember it was back when I just entered grade school.

278
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:52,635
Bye bye.

279
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:57,335
I was run over by a car.

280
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,835
But, I haven't been hospitalized since.

281
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:01,635
You mean when you received blood transfusion from your older sister?

282
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:04,835
Yes. Well, I do slip and fall,

283
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:07,435
and get little cuts and bruises every day even now, though.

284
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:09,235
I'll bet.

285
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,835
Oh, right.

286
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:13,535
If you're that interested in knowing what blood type I am,

287
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:15,935
why don't you come with me tomorrow to where I'm going?

288
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:17,935
I'm sure you'll get your answer.

289
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,935
I was contacted by a person of the mansion

290
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,735
that my mother and I used to stay at before,

291
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:24,035
telling me that my mother's belongings were found.

292
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:25,435
So, I'm going to go pick them up.

293
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:28,435
Belongings? Your mother passed away?

294
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,235
Yes, from an illness.

295
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:34,135
It seems that my mother-child booklet is in there too.

296
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:35,435
What shall we do?

297
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:38,835
I don't think so, because I've got something to do tomorrow.

298
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:43,335
Oh, but, it's the Okudaira residence in Haido-cho 3-chome,

299
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,835
very near from here.

300
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:47,235
Huh? If it's to the Okudaira residence in Haido-cho,

301
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:49,735
I'm going there tomorrow too.

302
00:16:49,735 --> 00:16:50,935
Dad.

303
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:52,535
Is it for work?

304
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:56,935
Yeah. Something about the oldest son of the family

305
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:59,235
was killed in a queer way, a year ago.

306
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,835
And they have no clue as to who the killer is.

307
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:05,164
They contacted me, the famed, Kogoro Mouri

308
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:08,435
to re-investigate the case.

309
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:11,358
Oh, their son, you mean Tango?

310
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,358
Oh, I'm sure that was the name.

311
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,358
Oh, so you know him, Eisuke?

312
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:19,415
Rather, it was when I was a child,

313
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:21,435
so the only thing I remember is his name.

314
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,135
But, how cruel.

315
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:24,935
You just said you didn't have any cases.

316
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,835
I meant, I don't have any cases

317
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,835
that a klutz like you can help me with.

318
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:31,235
Oh, come on.

319
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:40,135
Your mother was working here as a housekeeper?

320
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:43,635
Yes, we lived here. She raised me while working here.

321
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,735
Back then, what were your father and older sister doing?

322
00:17:53,735 --> 00:17:56,535
I was told that my dad was working in Osaka

323
00:17:56,535 --> 00:18:00,135
and that my sister was studying abroad as an exchange student.

324
00:18:00,135 --> 00:18:02,535
But, she used to come home, every vacation she had.

325
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:06,435
As for dad, the most I got to see of him was during New Years.

326
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,535
"The morgue"

327
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:12,135
After my mother passed away,

328
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:14,435
my father took custody of me,

329
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:17,235
and I ended up living in Osaka with him for a while.

330
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,935
For a while? You mean you don't live with him now?

331
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:24,035
No, it seems that father went abroad on a business trip.

332
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:26,335
And since then, I was taken care of at an acquaintance's house.

333
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,835
What an irresponsible father.

334
00:18:28,835 --> 00:18:32,235
I wouldn't be surprised that your older sister left home.

335
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:40,635
But, my father sends me money every month.

336
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:43,535
"Eiko Okudaira (56)" -My Eisuke, long time no see.

337
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,835
Has it been about ten years since I last saw you?

338
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:47,935
You've really grown!

339
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,535
Yes, thanks to everyone.

340
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:52,135
I've taken your mother's belongings out.

341
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,935
Come on in, everyone.

342
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:58,435
Oh, Kikuyo, will you please show them in?

343
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:00,235
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:05,535
She's the housekeeper that came to work for us after your mother.

345
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:07,035
"Kikuyo Tabata (39)" -She's not all that amiable,

346
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:09,835
"Kikuyo Tabata (39)" -but she's a very kind person.

347
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,335
Well...

348
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:14,035
My, are you also here accompanying Eisuke?

349
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:15,135
Oh, no,

350
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:19,835
I'm Kogoro Mouri and have come by request of your husband.

351
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:22,335
My, you mean that famous detective.

352
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,935
I've heard about you from my husband.

353
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:26,635
Yes!

354
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:30,935
I'll show Detective Mouri to my husband's study,

355
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:34,135
so you go ahead and show Eisuke and the others to the living room.

356
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:36,235
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:49,035
Oh, they sure look alike.

358
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:51,635
Eisuke really looks like his mother, doesn't he?

359
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:56,335
I guess so because he didn't look like his father.

360
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,435
Oh, here it is.

361
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:00,235
The mother-child booklet!

362
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,435
It's written over here, see?

363
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:08,535
Eisuke Hondo, blood type O!

364
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:10,435
True.

365
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:12,735
So, now everyone knows that I'm blood type O!

366
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,035
I see.

367
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:15,635
So, all that's left now is to verify the story

368
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:18,635
about whether his older sister really gave him blood for transfusion.

369
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:22,135
I'm sorry, that the bag is slightly squashed.

370
00:20:22,135 --> 00:20:24,235
I wonder why that bag was where it was.

371
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:27,835
It was stuck way in back of the drawer in my dresser.

372
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:30,135
But, I'm glad it was found.

373
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:32,035
We showed it to Mrs. Okudaira

374
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:34,335
and found out it was the belongings of the housekeeper

375
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:36,135
who worked here before,

376
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,035
that's why we called you.

377
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:42,935
Moreover, today is the first anniversary of Tango's death.

378
00:20:42,935 --> 00:20:44,235
First anniversary of death?

379
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,635
Mrs. Okudaira remarked that

380
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:49,235
she thought that her son had summoned everyone here.

381
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:50,735
Long time no see.

382
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:52,035
Although it's been ten years since I last saw you,

383
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:54,135
you haven't changed much, Mr. Segawa.

384
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,735
No, the one who was working here when you were here

385
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:58,535
was my older brother.

386
00:20:58,535 --> 00:21:03,835
He also passed away two years ago today of a traffic accident.

387
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:08,835
Then this is the story.

388
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:12,035
Mr. Okudaira, while you were showing the home video

389
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:15,235
that you filmed to everyone except your son,

390
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:17,235
who was drowned in the pool

391
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:22,135
by someone who had snuck in from outside.

392
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:26,235
Yeah, the police said that the estimated time of death of my son,

393
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:28,135
was between 9:00 to 10:00 pm.

394
00:21:28,135 --> 00:21:30,935
We were all in the living room for 5 hours from 7:00 to 12:00

395
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:34,535
watching the video right through.

396
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:49,535
And this is the print out of the video we were watching back then.

397
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:52,435
Both his legs are tied and his mouth is covered with masking tape.

398
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,535
Talk about terrible.

399
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:57,335
But, why the video?

400
00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:59,135
Well, the housekeeper

401
00:21:59,135 --> 00:22:01,935
was screaming at the top of her lungs the following morning

402
00:22:01,935 --> 00:22:04,335
about my son being in the pool with all the water drained.

403
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:06,435
I thought that she was playing a joke on us,

404
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:09,235
trying to surprise us.

405
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:11,135
But, it was no joke

406
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:14,435
and it turned out that he was really dead.

407
00:22:14,435 --> 00:22:16,335
Do you have any idea of anyone

408
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,735
who could've had a grudge against your son?

409
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:20,935
An idea of anyone,

410
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:23,635
not outside, but rather inside this house.

411
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,835
Just what do you mean?

412
00:22:25,835 --> 00:22:29,435
This is what I think, Detective Mouri.

413
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:32,735
My son was killed by someone sly and clever

414
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:35,335
who lives in this house.

415
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,235
A year ago,

416
00:24:15,235 --> 00:24:18,735
the oldest son of the Okudaira family was murdered.

417
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:22,135
The murder has still not yet been found.

418
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:23,735
But the master of the house insists that

419
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:25,435
the murderer is someone in the house.

420
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:28,235
Is it really so?

421
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,135
Before even getting to reveal the truth,

422
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,535
the head of the household himself dies along with a shriek.

423
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:39,035
Next on Detective Conan,

424
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:42,435
"Red and Black Crash: A Shriek"

425
00:24:58,035 --> 00:24:59,935
Next Conan's Hint:

426
00:24:59,935 --> 00:25:02,335
Valuable vase.

427
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,635
Eisuke, don't go near it!

428
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,635
Don't worry, I'm just going to take a look.

429
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,635
He's been punished.
