1
00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:02,766
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02,766 --> 00:00:04,566
Once he gets started, you can't stop him.

3
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,366
Today we solve the mystery of the legend!

4
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,466
The trick and the evidence are beyond your imagination.

5
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,166
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,166
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,766
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:58,504
We come to an old temple while on vacation.

9
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:02,704
But development of a tourist attraction

10
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:06,204
has brought trouble with the tour company.

11
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,404
And the next morning,

12
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:08,904
the president of the tour company,

13
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:14,104
Hideaki Oda, is found hanging from the pagoda,

14
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:18,304
Exactly like the legend surrounding the pagoda...

15
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,604
It was a just reward.

16
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,704
There's no mistake!

17
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:25,904
This is where it really happened!

18
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:29,004
If my theory is correct...

19
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,804
Mr. Oda didn't commit suicide!

20
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,304
He was murdered!

21
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:36,004
And the killer most probably is

22
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:37,904
the one who said what did...

23
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:38,904
It's him.

24
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:46,004
"The Terrifying Legend of the Five-story Pagoda (Part 2)"

25
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:53,304
Hey! What are you doing here!

26
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:57,704
Isn't that tie pin over there Mr. Oda's?

27
00:02:57,704 --> 00:02:59,004
What?

28
00:03:03,904 --> 00:03:05,504
How about it, Mr. Mouri?

29
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:08,104
Is it Mr. Oda's tie pin?

30
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,004
Yes, most likely.

31
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:14,904
Diamond tie pins aren't very common!

32
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:19,204
Mr. Kajimura, I'd like you to look at this too.

33
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,504
"Yousuke Kajimura (43)" -Yes! There's no mistake.

34
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:23,004
This belongs to Mr. Oda!

35
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:24,604
"Tan Kai (64)" -There, you see.

36
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,304
"Juukichi Okabe (55)" -And you accused us of being thieves!

37
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:31,404
"Shun Kai (26)" -His wallet is probably around here somewhere too.

38
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:33,904
How about doing a thorough search?

39
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:39,104
Well... Now we know Mr. Oda wasn't robbed!

40
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:44,604
His tie pin probably fell when he hung himself.

41
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:49,604
But Mr. Mouri! The pagoda is over 10m from here!

42
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,904
If it dropped at the time of the suicice,

43
00:03:51,904 --> 00:03:55,104
don't you think it's a bit too far to fall?

44
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,904
It could have happened like this!

45
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,404
Mr. Oda was deciding whether to kill himself here or not!

46
00:04:02,404 --> 00:04:05,504
And he didn't realize it fell off!

47
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:09,504
But tie pins don't fall off so easily!

48
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:11,204
Excuse me.

49
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:15,104
There were grass stains on Mr. Oda's elbow.

50
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:16,804
So what?

51
00:04:16,804 --> 00:04:19,904
Wasn't the tie pin found here?

52
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:23,304
That's it! So the stains from the grass around here!

53
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:28,604
Mr. Mouri! I'm positive Mr. Oda struggled with someone here and fell!

54
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:29,904
And another thing,

55
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:32,104
when they were taking the body down,

56
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,504
the rope was too short.

57
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:38,404
Mr. Oda's feet didn't reach the railing.

58
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,604
What? Hey, officers!

59
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:44,204
When you were lowering the body did his feet reach the railing?

60
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:47,804
No, sir! It was about 50cm short!

61
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:49,404
How can it be?

62
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:50,404
If he stood on the railing

63
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:52,204
and the rope didn't reach his neck,

64
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,104
he couldn't have comitted suicide!

65
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:58,804
Mr. Mouri! How do you explain this?

66
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:01,404
Don't worry about it.

67
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:03,204
It doesn't mean a thing.

68
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:06,004
What do you mean?

69
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,504
After a lot of deliberation,

70
00:05:09,504 --> 00:05:11,604
Mr. Oda climbed the pagoda to kill himself!

71
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:13,604
The rope may have been 50cm short,

72
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,604
but there was no turning back!

73
00:05:16,604 --> 00:05:18,504
In other words, he jumped to the rope

74
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:21,604
and put it over his head!

75
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:25,604
But there are so many circumstances indicating it was murder!

76
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:29,704
All right. Let's just say for the time being that it was murder!

77
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,404
The killer would have to carry

78
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:35,404
the hefty, unconscious Mr. Oda up the narrow stairway

79
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:37,604
wide enough for only one person,

80
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:41,604
the killer would have to drag the body!

81
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:44,404
But there was no indication of this

82
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:47,204
on either the body or the pagoda!

83
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:50,204
Moreover, how could the killer hang Mr. Oda

84
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:54,104
with a rope 50cm too short?

85
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,704
Yes, that's true!

86
00:05:56,704 --> 00:06:00,004
The murder theory is beginning to sound far fetched.

87
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:03,804
That's right! Unless it was suicide,

88
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:07,604
there's no way he could have hung from the pagoda!

89
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:14,004
It looks like you showing everyone how stupid you are!

90
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:15,204
You're nothing but a mere human.

91
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:18,904
You'll never be able to solve the mysteries of heaven's wrath!

92
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:21,904
Give up and leave this place at once!

93
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:24,404
Why you...

94
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:27,404
It's true, there are many unanswered questions

95
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:29,004
but there's not enough evidence

96
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:31,404
to prove this was a murder made to look like suicide.

97
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:35,204
But this case is definitely a murder!

98
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,304
The problem is...

99
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:41,004
How did the killer hang him from the roof of the pagoda?

100
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:43,204
Unless I can solve this trick,

101
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:46,004
this case will be classified a suicide!

102
00:06:49,404 --> 00:06:52,804
This was the end tied to the railing

103
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,404
Why did the killer use a slipknot to tie it?

104
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:00,604
That's it!

105
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:02,704
There's this method!

106
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:06,004
The fog is finally starting to clear!

107
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,504
Using this method,

108
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:10,004
it's possible to tie the rope to the railing!

109
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:12,304
Hey, kid!

110
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:14,304
You're not supposed to touch the things around here!

111
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:15,904
I am sorry.

112
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,804
If my theory is correct...

113
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:21,904
That thing should be around here!

114
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,504
There it is!

115
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:34,204
No doubt about it!

116
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,104
Mr. Oda's death can be made to look like suicide

117
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:37,504
with this method.

118
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:44,504
A fresh scratch is on it.

119
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:02,704
Curse, you say?

120
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:04,204
You thought up one fantastic trick,

121
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:07,604
using the legend as your guide!

122
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:09,304
But now for the evidence!

123
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:12,504
I have to find proof that show he's the murderer!

124
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:18,304
This was a strange suicide

125
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:21,004
but it's settled now!

126
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:22,504
Are you sure?

127
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:25,804
Something about it still bothers me.

128
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:27,704
What? Why are you so stubborn?

129
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:29,104
All right then go ahead.

130
00:08:29,104 --> 00:08:31,504
Write down on your report. Death by curse.

131
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:33,504
You... You got to be kidding!

132
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:36,204
If I do that, I'll be laughed at!

133
00:08:36,204 --> 00:08:38,104
Excuse me...

134
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,804
Would it be all right if I returned to the hotel now?

135
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,904
I'm sure the employees are shaken up by this.

136
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:46,504
Let's see.

137
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:47,904
I suppose it'll be all right.

138
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,004
But to be on the safe side,

139
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:51,904
give me your contact number.

140
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:57,704
I'll be at the hotel, so...

141
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,104
Look at all that money.

142
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,704
Thank you very much, son.

143
00:09:03,704 --> 00:09:04,804
Here we are.

144
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:07,004
You can reach me here.

145
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,404
Yes. I'll do that.

146
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:11,504
Mr. Kajimura, you sure have a lot of money on you.

147
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:14,804
It couldn't be Mr. Oda's, could it?

148
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,204
Of course not!

149
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:20,004
Mr. Oda's wallet is another color!

150
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:21,904
His money is for the payment I have to make

151
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:23,804
to one of the hotel's suppliers today!

152
00:09:25,404 --> 00:09:27,204
It was just a joke, a joke!

153
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:29,704
You scared me.

154
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,204
Hey! Now that Mr. Odas dead,

155
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,704
the plans for that amusement park are dead too, aren't they?

156
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,304
Yes.

157
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:39,704
If construction isn't stopped right away,

158
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,504
our company will go bankrupt.

159
00:09:42,504 --> 00:09:47,104
I'm sure the deed to the temple will be returned to you.

160
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:49,304
What? Really?

161
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:51,804
Yes!

162
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:56,604
Mr. Oda gave me the deed to hold on to.

163
00:09:56,604 --> 00:10:00,104
I think it's best if I gave it back to you now.

164
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,504
Isn't that wonderful, Mr. Tan Kai?

165
00:10:02,504 --> 00:10:06,504
Mr. Kajimura, you are a very understanding man!

166
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:07,704
I was wrong about you!

167
00:10:07,704 --> 00:10:09,604
That's very flattering.

168
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:11,104
As for the incident of the deed,

169
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:14,204
I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding between you two.

170
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,104
In lieu of Mr. Oda's last act of generosity,

171
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:20,404
I will recite a prayer for him!

172
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,604
Now that my mind is at ease,

173
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:25,204
I can go back to the head temple and resume my training!

174
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,804
If I leave now, I'll get there by evening.

175
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:32,004
I'll start cleaning the pagoda.

176
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:36,404
I've found it!

177
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:40,404
The undeniable, solid proof!

178
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:43,904
He's the murderer after all.

179
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:52,993
Officer Yokomizo...

180
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:55,193
What do we do now?

181
00:10:55,193 --> 00:10:56,393
Mr. Mouri.

182
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:59,293
This case is definitely a suicide!

183
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,793
Yes, I see.

184
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,493
Since you're so sure about it.

185
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,893
I was forced out of bed so early this morning,

186
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,593
I am so sleepy.

187
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:12,493
I am going to the hotel and get some sleep.

188
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:17,893
What time? Oh no! I'm so sleepy.

189
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:24,093
Now to put this button speaker

190
00:11:24,093 --> 00:11:26,993
on Pops Kogoro's forehead.

191
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,193
I have no choice.

192
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:38,193
All right! This is a suicide case!

193
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:39,393
We're going back to the station!

194
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:42,093
Just one moment

195
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:46,093
Officer Yokomizo, you are absolutely hopeless.

196
00:11:46,093 --> 00:11:48,893
Are you talking about me?

197
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,293
You were being given so many hints,

198
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,893
why didn't you realize that?

199
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:55,793
This was no suicide.

200
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:57,493
It's murder!

201
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,893
I knew it!

202
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,693
But, Mr. Mouri...

203
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:08,293
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

204
00:12:08,293 --> 00:12:12,893
Because I wanted you to solve it and get the credit!

205
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:14,693
Is that so?

206
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,593
Forgive me for being so dense.

207
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:17,993
It couldn't be helped.

208
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:21,593
Now pay close attention to my mystery solving show.

209
00:12:21,593 --> 00:12:23,693
Now, Officer Yokomizo...

210
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:25,893
I would like to conduct an experiment.

211
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:29,493
May I enlist the aid of your officers?

212
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:31,193
Of course you may!

213
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,793
Officers! Get ready!

214
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,893
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

215
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:37,093
First, we'll put a bag

216
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:40,493
weighing the same as Mr. Oda on the grass,

217
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,993
tie a rope around the bag's head.

218
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,693
Take the rope up to the level five of the pagoda

219
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:48,593
and drape it over the edge of the roof.

220
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:52,293
Then you pass it through the railing until it reaches the ground

221
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,793
and tie it to the scrap metal left

222
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:57,393
on the old unused well!

223
00:12:57,393 --> 00:13:02,393
And to make one side of the scrap metal easier to drop,

224
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:04,293
it is placed atop a steel rod!

225
00:13:07,993 --> 00:13:09,193
Here you are!

226
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:13,693
Now, Officer Yokomizo,

227
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,993
pull hard on that string!

228
00:13:33,793 --> 00:13:34,993
It... It's hanging?

229
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:36,793
Just like Mr. Oda was.

230
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:38,593
What do you think?

231
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:42,393
This is the identity of your so-called curse!

232
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:44,293
The rope was charred

233
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:46,393
because it rubbed on the edge of the roof,

234
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,693
causing friction!

235
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:51,093
And although the rope was brand new,

236
00:13:51,093 --> 00:13:53,893
it was frayed because of the friction!

237
00:13:55,393 --> 00:13:59,293
And since we found the tie pin on the grass,

238
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:02,293
I assume that's where it happened!

239
00:14:02,293 --> 00:14:06,693
But how did the killer get the rope around Mr. Oda's neck?

240
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:09,493
Mr. Oda would have put up a fight

241
00:14:09,493 --> 00:14:13,793
but examination of the body showed no such marks!

242
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:16,493
Yes, that's a very good question!

243
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:19,393
Let me explain things in the order it happened...

244
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:25,193
First, the killer called Mr.Oda to meet him here.

245
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:26,993
Then when he saw the opportunity,

246
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:29,293
he put the noose around Mr. Oda's neck.

247
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,993
And pulled the string at the same time.

248
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:35,193
Dropping the scrap metal into the well.

249
00:14:35,193 --> 00:14:39,193
But there's a time lag

250
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:40,793
before Mr. Oda is pulled up,

251
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:44,093
the rope around his neck would come off!

252
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:49,993
So the killer grabbed his legs causing him to fall!

253
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:51,493
Since it dark,

254
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,993
even a slim man would be able to topple

255
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,693
a large man like Mr. Oda who's caught off guard!

256
00:14:56,693 --> 00:14:59,593
The grass stains on his elbow

257
00:14:59,593 --> 00:15:02,193
also happened at that time.

258
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,693
This is when the tie pin also fell.

259
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:07,893
Mr. Oda had no time to undo the rope,

260
00:15:07,893 --> 00:15:09,393
he was pulled up.

261
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:15,493
I am positive Mr. Oda was tripped!

262
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,093
If he wasn't,

263
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,293
there would be no way

264
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,993
he would get dirt on the heels of his shoes!

265
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:22,893
I get it!

266
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,393
No.

267
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:27,293
Wait a minute, Mr. Mouri!

268
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,893
Are you saying more than one killer was involved?

269
00:15:32,293 --> 00:15:36,993
It seems you've come across that dilemma, Officer Yokomizo!

270
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:40,493
After all, Mr. Oda weighs 100kg!

271
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:45,793
If the killer tried to tie the rope to the railing alone,

272
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,993
he wouldn't be able to bind the rope around his hand,

273
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:49,993
only squeeze it!

274
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:51,693
The moment the rope was cut,

275
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:55,693
it would be pulled out of his hand!

276
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,793
In other word, it's not possible

277
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:59,793
to tie the rope to the railing by himself!

278
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,793
But it is possible!

279
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,193
Even if the killer was alone!

280
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:06,293
That's ridiculous!

281
00:16:06,293 --> 00:16:08,193
Exactly how was it done?

282
00:16:08,193 --> 00:16:14,493
The killer used a slipknot on the railing!

283
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:17,193
A slipknot?

284
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:21,393
It forms a loop on the rope.

285
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:25,193
I've given instructions to the officer on the pagoda.

286
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,493
Please have him do it.

287
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:31,493
Hey! Cut the rope and tie it to the railing!

288
00:16:31,493 --> 00:16:32,993
Yes, sir!

289
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,993
First, he needs to pull the slipknot loop

290
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,993
pass a stick into the loop

291
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:41,793
to make a stopper.

292
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,793
Then he cuts the rope on the outside,

293
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:47,493
pulls the cut end through the loop and ties it.

294
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:50,493
The stick is pulled and the ruse is complete!

295
00:16:50,493 --> 00:16:51,793
Officer Yokomizo!

296
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:54,993
The rope is tied to the railing!

297
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:57,793
It's possible to do it alone.

298
00:16:57,793 --> 00:17:01,393
All that is left is to collect the rope that has fallen

299
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:05,093
and throw it into the legendary old well!

300
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,993
With this I ends my explanation

301
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:14,993
of how the curse was used to cover up a murder.

302
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,493
The only mistake the killer made was

303
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:22,393
the 50cm difference between Mr. Oda's feet and the railing.

304
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:24,293
Because that's what

305
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,093
aroused my suspicion

306
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:29,493
that it wasn't suicide!

307
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:33,093
Then the only one who is capable of rigging all of this

308
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,593
is someone who is familiar with the temple.

309
00:17:36,593 --> 00:17:37,993
Hold on there!

310
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:41,393
Are you insinuating one of us is the killer?

311
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,493
That's right!

312
00:17:42,493 --> 00:17:45,693
The man responsible for this charade is...

313
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:47,493
Mr. Kajimura!

314
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:48,893
Yes, the killer is you!

315
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:53,393
Mr. Mouri, you can't be serious!

316
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:57,693
I don't know very much about this temple!

317
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:00,593
You are the general manager of the Hotel Oda,

318
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:03,693
but you are also an executive of Oda Tours!

319
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:05,293
It's easy for you to get the blueprint to this place,

320
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,293
by saying it's for the construction of the amusement park.

321
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,993
Then you can calculate the height of the pagoda,

322
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:13,293
the distance to the well and its depth... everything!

323
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:17,493
And wasn't it you who told the construction workers

324
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,593
to put the scrap metal near the well?

325
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:22,293
So you could use it in your scheme.

326
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:25,493
Yes, I may have given the orders!

327
00:18:25,493 --> 00:18:29,193
But if I did, it was due to some work related matter!

328
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:31,493
Besides, Mr.Mouri, you too are aware

329
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:32,793
that I was on a business trip last night,

330
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:34,693
I wasn't even here!

331
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,393
Then how did you know

332
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:40,693
about Mr. Shun Kai and Mr. Oda's argument last night?

333
00:18:41,993 --> 00:18:46,093
Then you came here today, you said...

334
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:47,593
But last night,

335
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,893
when he was threatened

336
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,893
to be taken to court by the temple,

337
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:54,293
he seemed very concerned.

338
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:57,593
Shun Kai came back last night

339
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,693
right after you left!

340
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:02,993
But how did you know about that?

341
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:06,493
That's because I had a call.

342
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:10,593
Mr. Oda called me on my cellular at the hotel in Tokyo.

343
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,993
No. You're lying.

344
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:16,593
You heard their conversation right here on these grounds!

345
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:18,493
When you called Mr. Oda to meet you here

346
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:20,693
so you could kill him!

347
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,893
Enough of this foolishness!

348
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:23,993
All you have are accusations!

349
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:25,293
Show me some proof!

350
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:28,593
Proof that I was here last night!

351
00:19:28,593 --> 00:19:31,493
You have the evidence on you!

352
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:34,193
The irrefutable evidence!

353
00:19:34,193 --> 00:19:36,393
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri?

354
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:40,693
Yes, look inside his wallet.

355
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,393
May I?

356
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:46,293
If you're talking about Mr. Oda's fingerprints on the bills,

357
00:19:46,293 --> 00:19:48,693
that won't be proof.

358
00:19:48,693 --> 00:19:50,893
He gave me the money himself!

359
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:53,593
Mr. Mouri, what am I looking for?

360
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,093
It should be stuck between the bills!

361
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:57,993
It's a receipt!

362
00:19:57,993 --> 00:19:59,093
A receipt?

363
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:06,293
Let's see... It's a receipt for the Hotel Oda.

364
00:20:06,293 --> 00:20:09,493
September 12th, 19:40.

365
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:10,993
For cigars.

366
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,393
-What? -That's right!

367
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:16,893
We saw Mr. Oda get that receipt last night

368
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:20,893
while we were having dinner!

369
00:20:20,893 --> 00:20:22,493
You left after that

370
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:25,993
and if you hadn't seen him since then,

371
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:30,393
tell us how the receipt ended up in your wallet?

372
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:36,293
I'm pretty sure after you killed Mr. Oda,

373
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:38,993
you saw his wallet lying in the grass

374
00:20:38,993 --> 00:20:40,893
so you decided to keep the money as cash earned!

375
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:44,393
But you didn't notice that

376
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:50,093
the receipt stuck between the bill!

377
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:52,193
If you check the receipt,

378
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:55,093
you'll find Mr. Oda's fingerprints on it!

379
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,593
What do you have to say about that, Mr. Kajimura!

380
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,193
Are you still going to deny it?

381
00:21:04,793 --> 00:21:08,693
How stupid...

382
00:21:08,693 --> 00:21:10,293
What a silly thing to get caught by...

383
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:12,893
What was your motive?

384
00:21:12,893 --> 00:21:15,493
Taxes...

385
00:21:15,493 --> 00:21:18,293
When the company began having financial difficulties,

386
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:21,793
Mr.Oda told me to file a fake financial report.

387
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:26,293
Sure, I profited from the scheme too

388
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:28,193
but then I realized he was letting me profit

389
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:31,793
only because he eventually intended

390
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:35,593
to make me take the fall for everything..

391
00:21:35,593 --> 00:21:37,693
So you killed him.

392
00:21:37,693 --> 00:21:38,993
Yes...

393
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,893
Before he chopped me off like some lizard's tail,

394
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:46,193
after I've worked myself to the bone for the company.

395
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:20,693
I thought we were going to enjoy ourselves.

396
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:22,393
Why is that every time you're with us,

397
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:24,693
we get involved in a case, dad?

398
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:27,193
How would I know?

399
00:23:27,193 --> 00:23:31,493
Dad, is there any possibility that you're cursed?

400
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,993
There are people right here.

401
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:34,793
Why don't we have you exorcised?

402
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:36,393
That's ridiculous!

403
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,093
I am a private detective!

404
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:40,193
I'm supposed to be involved with cases!

405
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:41,893
That's what feeds us!

406
00:23:41,893 --> 00:23:44,693
Trouble is my business!

407
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:49,593
Cases are supposed to follow a famous detective around!

408
00:23:51,193 --> 00:23:52,893
Dad?

409
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:59,893
He's right, he's never lacking trouble.

410
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:07,193
"Next Episode"

411
00:24:07,193 --> 00:24:08,693
What is this?

412
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:18,293
If the killer came in through the waterway,

413
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:20,993
then the room should be sopping wet.

414
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:24,793
I see.

415
00:24:24,793 --> 00:24:27,393
That's why that person did that.

416
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:29,493
