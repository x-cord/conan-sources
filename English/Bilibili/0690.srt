1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,640
"Ten years ago"

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,940
What?

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,840
You want out of the case?

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,440
Are you saying that you want out of this case?

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,240
Yes, well, I guess so.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,040
Let's not depend on a novelist like him

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,740
and nab the culprit, just by the hands of we, the police,

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,340
Assistant Inspector Megure!

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,940
The press is making a great fuss, after all over the word

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,940
"Death" that was written with the blood of the corpse.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,440
They're saying that it may be the start of a bizarre series of murders!

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,240
-Yeah... -No need for worry.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,440
This is not a homicide.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,540
But this word, "Death"...

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,540
I assure you.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,940
Yusaku Kudo here will.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,340
Repeated time after time, it's okay.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,340
Love and crime occur today and tomorrow.

19
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,140
The cold case of that father in question.

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,140
What is the mystery behind the case ten years ago?

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,740
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,420
"Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 1)"

25
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,020
You mean Shinichi Kudo's father

26
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,420
is that famous mystery writer Yusaku Kudo?

27
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,620
Yep! It seems that he's away from Japan

28
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,920
and writing from somewhere abroad, though.

29
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,320
I used to read a lot of his novels when I was a child.

30
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,420
The Night Baron Series and the like.

31
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,820
Well, but, thanks to him,

32
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,720
that mystery loving freak son of his was born!

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,520
But, how comforting to know that

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,820
your future husband's father is a best seller novelist!

35
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,920
You're assured an easy life.

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,220
Future husband?

37
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,920
By the way, about what you were saying a while ago, is it true?

38
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Is it true that you know about the bizarre case,

39
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,220
the only one that Yusaku Kudo ever gave up on?

40
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,920
Yes. Back when Shinichi's father was still in Japan,

41
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,020
he was cooperating on investigating the case.

42
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,520
But Shinichi was really angry that his father

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,920
had given up on that case half way through.

44
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,720
And, what kind of case was it?

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,820
Well...

46
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,720
If I remember correctly, some kind of word

47
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,020
was written near the corpse.

48
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,220
Hey! Are you all right?

49
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,020
Hey, get a hold of yourself, Takaichi!

50
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,520
Mr. Takaichi?

51
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Hey, Takaichi!

52
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,520
What's the matter?

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,720
Well, you see.

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,320
We were looking for him because he didn't show up at work.

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,420
Then we found him slumped down in a place like this.

56
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,320
He's bleeding from his mouth besides.

57
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
We did call the ambulance to be safe.

58
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,320
There's no need to call the ambulance.

59
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,520
Almost about nine hours

60
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,220
seems to have passed since he died already.

61
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,220
What?

62
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,320
Does he have alcohol dependency?

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Yeah. He used to say that

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
the doctor told him to stay away from alcoholic drinks.

65
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,520
But, how'd you know about it?

66
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,320
He's got jaundice on the white of his eye.

67
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,920
He's skinny but has a popped belly.

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,520
This is an abdominal build of fluids!

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,620
It's proof that he's got a malfunctioning liver!

70
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,420
Furthermore, there is a bottle of sake left behind untouched

71
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,420
in the dispenser of the vending machine.

72
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,720
From the circumstances,

73
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
it's very likely that it's the bottle of sake that he bought!

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,620
If he were a patient suffering from a bad liver,

75
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,220
he would most naturally stay away from alcohol

76
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,020
that would worsen his symptoms.

77
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,020
However, if he wanted alcohol despite his condition,

78
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,320
I just thought that he may have an alcohol dependency problem!

79
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,620
Wow.

80
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,820
So, well, an alcoholic

81
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,520
suffering from cirrhosis of the liver had a burst varix

82
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,020
and spit blood.

83
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,420
And since unfortunately, there was no one around at that time,

84
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,620
he couldn't get help and died.

85
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,420
That's what you'd normally think.

86
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,320
But, this is not death by illness.

87
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,920
It's a crime committed by someone with malicious intent!

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,820
What?

89
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,020
As proof of this, right in front of this man, see!

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,920
There is the word "Death" written with blood.

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,820
Hold it.

92
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,320
This word, "Death"!

93
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
Looks just like the word that was found back

94
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,920
at the scene of the crime ten years ago!

95
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,520
Don't tell me that!

96
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,020
It's the case that Shinichi's father gave up on

97
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,720
that was mentioned a while ago.

98
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,420
Yep! Back then, Shinichi showed me the picture of the crime scene,

99
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,320
so there's no mistake about it!

100
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,120
"Death"

101
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,820
Mail for Shinichi's cell phone?

102
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,720
It's from Ran.

103
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,720
I encountered a murder scene on my way to school today

104
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,220
and was surprised to find that the word written in blood

105
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,820
left behind at the scene

106
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,220
was exactly like the word you showed me ten years ago!

107
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,020
Sera and Sonoko say that they want to see that photo too

108
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,420
so we're going over to your house after school to look for it.

109
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,820
I hope you don't mind.

110
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,320
Besides, I have an idea of where it may be.

111
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,720
A word written in blood ten years ago.

112
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,920
Does she mean the case Dad ran out on?

113
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,520
I mean, wait a sec.

114
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,420
To look for it? Don't tell me that Sera and Sonoko

115
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,120
are coming over to my house too?

116
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,720
Hey? Where's Conan?

117
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,420
Come to think of it, he's not around.

118
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,120
How dare he slack off?

119
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,620
He said he had something urgent to do, so he had to leave early.

120
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,020
He said he'd make up for this one day.

121
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,220
Make up for it?

122
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,820
If he's making anything, I'd like eels over rice then!

123
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,120
He's making up for it.

124
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,920
Oh! It's a response from Shinichi.

125
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,020
I really don't feel comfortable

126
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,420
having people searching the house on their own,

127
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,820
so I told Conan where the picture is

128
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,520
and had him go to get it.

129
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,420
So, please settle for him taking it to the detective agency

130
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,620
and showing it to you there, okay?

131
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,720
Then, why don't you tell me where it is?

132
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,820
I get it!

133
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,920
Maybe he's got some lewd books near the picture, or something?

134
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,220
What?

135
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,020
But we already got here!

136
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,020
This is it, right? Shinichi Kudo's house.

137
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
Yep.

138
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,220
Why don't we go inside while we're at it?

139
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,820
I'd like to meet Subaru, the guy who I heard lives here too!

140
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,420
Hello!

141
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,120
Conan's shoes.

142
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,820
You mean he's already here!

143
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,320
That brat sure is fast.

144
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,520
But, there's something about Subaru's

145
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,420
that's been bothering me from before!

146
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,220
Huh? What? What about?

147
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,620
Because you see,

148
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,020
he always wears clothes that hides his neck, doesn't he?

149
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Huh? Is that so?

150
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,120
Yep, that's why maybe he's got an embarrassing tattoo

151
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,520
or something on his neck that he wants to hide!

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,820
Now that you mentioned it...

153
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,120
So, I was thinking of pulling off his top

154
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,820
when I have the chance someday, what do you say?

155
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,120
What do I say?

156
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,220
Isn't it just that you want to see Subaru naked, Sonoko?

157
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,420
Well, that too.

158
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,620
Conan.

159
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,420
So, that' s where you are!

160
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,120
Oh, Subaru!

161
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
I think Conan is here.

162
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Oh, you mean he's in the study?

163
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,620
Okay, we'll go over there then!

164
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,120
Sonoko!

165
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,520
He doesn't have a tattoo on his neck.

166
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Let's go, Sera!

167
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,520
Yeah. Okay.

168
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:31,512
Hey, Conan!

169
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:34,412
Do you want me to help you look for it?

170
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:37,612
I'm fine! I'm just about to find it already.

171
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,012
Why don't you drink black tea or something in the kitchen?

172
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,912
I'll take it to you when I find it!

173
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:44,112
Oh, okay.

174
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:46,412
I'll be waiting for you then! Let's go!

175
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,212
Yeah. See you later then, Conan!

176
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:50,212
Yep.

177
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:58,112
I tell you. After I mailed her telling her not to come.

178
00:10:58,112 --> 00:11:02,112
Maybe Shinichi's hiding something after all.

179
00:11:02,112 --> 00:11:03,912
Hiding what?

180
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,312
Lewd books.

181
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,012
No way.

182
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:10,212
Because although he let you clean the place

183
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,712
every month on your own,

184
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,512
isn't it strange that he doesn't want you

185
00:11:13,512 --> 00:11:15,912
-to look for that certain picture? -But...

186
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:19,612
No, he may be hiding a woman.

187
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,212
A woman?

188
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:22,712
Take a look at this.

189
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:24,512
A hair clip band.

190
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:28,012
It was on this shelf.

191
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,912
Women have a tendency to put things like these

192
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:31,812
in places like this.

193
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:36,812
Oh, it's probably Shinichi's mother's! Right?

194
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:39,912
Come to think of it, she usually used to tie her hair back.

195
00:11:39,912 --> 00:11:42,512
But, among the dishes that aren't washed yet,

196
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:43,812
there is a glass cup where lipstick

197
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:47,612
seems to have been wiped off with the thumb.

198
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:52,012
And in the drain of the sink, there is a long strand of hair.

199
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,512
It looks to be hair from a wig, though.

200
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:58,612
Don't tell me that Shinichi's

201
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:01,112
flirting with some woman or something?

202
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:02,612
If you think so,

203
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,312
why don't you take a picture of this and save it,

204
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:06,412
and keep it in your diary!

205
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:09,312
If you write in when and where you found this evidence,

206
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,412
and how you felt at that time,

207
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:15,212
it would come in handy when you go to court.

208
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,112
Court?

209
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,612
Use a disposable instant camera rather than a digital camera

210
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,512
where the pictures can be processed in any way!

211
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:25,012
For the diary, use a ball point pen that cannot easily be revised,

212
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:27,612
and write in the news or weather of that day

213
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,512
to increase reliability!

214
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,712
The weather and news?

215
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:34,212
And you're saying that she'd be able to get

216
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,112
that smooth talking mystery freak by doing so, master?

217
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,912
Well, sort of. I guess.

218
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:42,412
Mr. Kudo hasn't been here for a while, has he?

219
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:43,912
Most naturally speaking,

220
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:48,312
wouldn't that guy called Subaru that we saw awhile ago, his lady?

221
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:50,412
I guess so.

222
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:55,012
I brought you the picture. What're you talking about?

223
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:58,712
Never mind. You don't need to know about this, Conan!

224
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,812
It's adult talk.

225
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:07,912
Really, it sure looks alike!

226
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,812
This word "Death" written in blood.

227
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,112
Then, don't tell me that

228
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:14,712
the murderer from ten years ago appeared again?

229
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,712
The serial killer?

230
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,312
Yeah. I checked on the internet and found that

231
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:23,012
the word written in blood ten years ago wasn't publicized.

232
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:24,912
So I guess there's no mistake deeming that

233
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,612
the same culprit committed the crime!

234
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:29,412
It's true that they both look alike, but...

235
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:33,112
Dad, back ten years ago...

236
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,512
I assure you.

237
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:40,312
Yusaku Kudo here will.

238
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:43,812
I'll assure you that this culprit who wrote and left behind

239
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,312
this word "Death",

240
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:49,712
will never ever appear again.

241
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,712
What's going on?

242
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:02,412
I thought you said the culprit would never ever appear again?

243
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:03,712
Dad?

244
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,612
What? Really?

245
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:14,612
Did that Yusaku Kudo really say so?

246
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:16,112
Yep!

247
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,412
He said that the culprit who wrote the word "Death"

248
00:14:18,412 --> 00:14:21,712
that was found near the corpse would never ever appear again.

249
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:26,512
Shinichi said that he heard so from his father ten years ago!

250
00:14:26,512 --> 00:14:29,212
I remember that Shinichi told me so

251
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:31,712
when he showed me the picture too!

252
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:35,712
Moreover, although there was blood on the man's palms and fingers,

253
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:38,212
there was none on his fingertips,

254
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,212
so Shinichi was unconvinced, insisting that the dead man

255
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:43,112
couldn't have written the words on his own,

256
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:46,512
and yet, why wasn't this deemed to be a homicide case.

257
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:52,812
Even if it wasn't murder, there's no mistake that

258
00:14:52,812 --> 00:14:56,212
someone was near the corpse before the blood dried up.

259
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:59,112
Besides, this morning we encountered a crime scene

260
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:04,812
where a word written in blood exactly like this one was found.

261
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:06,612
But, if I remember correctly, that case

262
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:09,312
that happened ten years ago, wasn't it deemed as an accident?

263
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,112
Yep, that's right.

264
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:12,312
Death by accident?

265
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,312
The details seem to be written on this paper

266
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:17,412
that was inside together with this picture.

267
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:20,812
Let's see.

268
00:15:20,812 --> 00:15:23,112
The person who died was Mr. Takefumi Koriyama,

269
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,512
the principal of a nursery school,

270
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:29,112
and the cause of his death was shock from damage to his heart.

271
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:30,412
A shattered piece of glass from the fishbowl

272
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,412
that poked into his chest area pierced through his heart

273
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,012
and lead to his death.

274
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,312
He was scheduled to move the fish into

275
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,412
a fishbowl temporarily in order to clean the fish tank but,

276
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:42,912
he forgot the fishbowl at his residence

277
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:46,112
so went back to get it, and on his way back to the nursery,

278
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,612
he used a shortcut going through the park.

279
00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:52,212
However, he unfortunately tripped over a stone on the cobbled road,

280
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:56,512
and fell, still holding the fishbowl in his hand and passed away.

281
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:58,412
The one who first found the dead body

282
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:00,412
was a student at that nursery,

283
00:16:00,412 --> 00:16:02,712
Ryosuke Nishimura, five years old.

284
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,612
The only son of a monk of a temple nearby.

285
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,212
When the nursery school employees

286
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:10,512
were making a fuss over the principal not coming back,

287
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,512
they hear from this boy that he saw the principal

288
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:15,412
lying on the ground on his way to the nursery.

289
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:16,812
So, they run over to the park

290
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,312
and found the principal's body there.

291
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:24,112
The boy back then was jittery and reticent

292
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:26,812
but as soon as he began eating the candy that he had,

293
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:29,312
he finally started talking.

294
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:30,812
He talked about the fact that

295
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:32,512
he was taking care of a puppy in the park

296
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:33,712
along with the other students,

297
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:37,112
and that he checked on the dog on his way to the nursery.

298
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,112
He went on to explain that he called out to the principal

299
00:16:39,112 --> 00:16:42,312
but he didn't answer, so the boy thought that he was dead,

300
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:43,612
gathered some flowers from the park

301
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,112
and placed it by him as an offering.

302
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:47,512
Oh, really,

303
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:49,412
there are flowers in the picture.

304
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:51,412
Above the word written in blood.

305
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:54,912
But, it looks more scattered, than like an offering, doesn't it?

306
00:16:54,912 --> 00:16:58,712
I'm sure the culprit who wrote this word scattered them around!

307
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:02,612
But, if that principal was murdered by someone,

308
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,412
the culprit would've had to push the principal

309
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:07,912
who was holding the fishbowl from behind, give him a fatal blow

310
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:09,312
and write the word using the blood

311
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,412
that was bleeding from the principal...

312
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:15,012
but this boy who offered the flowers seems to have said that

313
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:18,212
there was no such word written in blood back then.

314
00:17:19,312 --> 00:17:23,212
If so, right after the culprit attacked and killed the principal,

315
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:24,912
he hid for a while without even attempting to flee,

316
00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:26,912
despite the boy having come along.

317
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,712
Then, waited for the boy to leave

318
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,512
and approached the corpse once more,

319
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:35,012
leaving the word written in blood behind.

320
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:39,412
Maybe it's that boy?

321
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:41,412
The one who wrote the word using the blood?

322
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:42,412
What?

323
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:45,012
I'm sure that he wrote it when he offered the flowers!

324
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:46,612
See, because he was the son of a monk,

325
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,712
maybe he did it to put the dead to rest.

326
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:50,712
But, he was only a boy of five years old, you know.

327
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:53,312
I don't think he knew how to write the kanji character "Death".

328
00:17:54,612 --> 00:17:56,612
But this brat who is just about the same age

329
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:58,412
seems to be able to write it though.

330
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,012
How was the man

331
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,212
who died that you and everyone else saw this morning?

332
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,712
Huh?

333
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,112
It could serve as a hint to nab the culprit

334
00:18:06,112 --> 00:18:08,012
if you can find some similarities

335
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:10,812
with the case that occurred ten years ago.

336
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,812
Similarities...

337
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:15,512
Nothing else except for that word written in blood.

338
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,212
The thing that was found near the corpse

339
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,712
was not flowers but a cigarette.

340
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:23,912
I see! The thing that was in that picture was a cigarette.

341
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,112
Yep.

342
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:27,112
It was smeared with blood though.

343
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:29,412
The estimated time of death of that man

344
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:32,612
was around 23:00 last night.

345
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,412
The corpse was leaning against the sake vending machine,

346
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,212
and in the dispenser of the machine,

347
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:40,012
a new bottle of sake was still inside.

348
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:44,412
Something happened to that man right after he bought the sake,

349
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:47,812
and I think he was left there until daybreak.

350
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:51,912
You can only buy sake using a vending machine till 23:00, see!

351
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:54,612
But, the word "Death" that was found near the man

352
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:57,312
was also written in blood, right?

353
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,912
Was that man poked by something too?

354
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:03,212
He was bleeding from his mouth!

355
00:19:03,212 --> 00:19:06,412
That man seems to have had an alcohol dependency problem, you see.

356
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:11,112
So, I first thought that he died of bleeding from a burst varix.

357
00:19:11,112 --> 00:19:13,112
That is, until I saw the word written in blood

358
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:16,312
from the opposite side of the corpse!

359
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:23,412
In other words, the points in common of these two cases

360
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,612
are that the font of the word "Death" are almost exactly alike

361
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:31,012
and the other that both corpses do not look to have been murdered?

362
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:32,412
Yes...

363
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:34,912
And...

364
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:39,212
According to the newspaper clipping that was inside the envelope,

365
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,012
it's written that the nursery employee who rushed over to the park

366
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,912
found the word "Death" only after

367
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:46,812
he tried to lift the body and move it.

368
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,012
This picture is probably one that was taken

369
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:51,112
after the corpse was moved a bit,

370
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:54,512
and when that boy found the corpse, the word written in blood

371
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,312
was already there

372
00:19:56,312 --> 00:20:00,312
but was hidden out of sight by the body.

373
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:02,212
Oh, I'm sorry...

374
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:03,812
for butting in on you.

375
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:09,512
Subaru is a Holmes fan and loves to make deductions!

376
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:14,112
Come to think of it, this morning, we saw the colleague

377
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,012
shaking the body of the man who died, right?

378
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:20,912
Yep. Maybe that corpse was moved a bit too.

379
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:24,712
If so, why not ask the police about it?

380
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:27,512
Officer Takagi was the one who came

381
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:29,712
when you called the police, right, Ran?

382
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,412
Maybe he'll tell you something.

383
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:35,012
Oh, you mean the corpse that was found this morning?

384
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:38,412
I'm sure it was a man called Mr. Isao Takaichi

385
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:40,012
that lives near the site.

386
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:43,812
I don't know what happened to the corpse after that though.

387
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:45,812
It was concluded to be a robbery case,

388
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,412
and was passed over to the investigation 3rd division.

389
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:52,612
Robbery? It wasn't a homicide?

390
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:57,312
Hey, cut out the joke! What about that case is a robbery?

391
00:20:57,312 --> 00:21:00,112
You are...

392
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:02,912
I'm Sera, the one who was with Ran at the scene of the crime!

393
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:04,212
Oh.

394
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,612
That high school girl detective.

395
00:21:06,612 --> 00:21:09,312
You saw too, didn't you? That word "Death" written in blood?

396
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:11,812
Well, I thought the same thing too.

397
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,612
That this was a bizarre homicide case.

398
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:17,212
But, Inspector Megure who came along

399
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,612
after you all left for school,

400
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,412
saw that word written in blood

401
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:24,112
and immediately said, 'this is probably a robbery'.

402
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:27,712
In fact, no wallet was found on the corpse.

403
00:21:27,712 --> 00:21:29,812
But, he did buy the beer, didn't he?

404
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:31,112
If he lived close by,

405
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:34,012
he could've just had enough money on him to buy the beer!

406
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:37,612
Yeah. I thought so too, but...

407
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:41,112
Oh, by the way, just like you had said,

408
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:44,312
he seems to have died of a burst varix due to cirrhosis.

409
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,812
Hey, Officer Takagi! Let's go get info!

410
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:48,012
Oh, yes, sir!

411
00:21:48,012 --> 00:21:50,112
So, I've got to go, sorry.

412
00:21:51,412 --> 00:21:52,512
Oh, hey?

413
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,712
I'm not finished yet!

414
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:55,712
Hey!

415
00:21:58,612 --> 00:21:59,912
Darn.

416
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:05,112
It's not a homicide but a robbery.

417
00:23:28,412 --> 00:23:30,212
It's strange, isn't it?

418
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:31,912
I'm sure that Inspector Megure

419
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,412
was also in charge of the case that occurred ten years ago.

420
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,912
It's only natural that he would consider it

421
00:23:35,912 --> 00:23:37,912
to be a case of serial murder, and yet...

422
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:39,512
That's true.

423
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:43,212
Ten years ago, Inspector Megure is sure to have seen

424
00:23:43,212 --> 00:23:45,312
that word written in blood too.

425
00:23:45,312 --> 00:23:48,112
And yet... why?

426
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:51,212
Besides, back then, Dad was talking with the boy

427
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,112
who first found the corpse.

428
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:54,712
Moreover, he was smiling too.

429
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:58,312
I wonder why.

430
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:02,212
I wonder why Dad declared that it was not homicide.

431
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:04,712
Why?

432
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,312
If you're going to ask for advice on the case,

433
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:11,712
it'll have to be Shinichi Kudo, right?

434
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:14,212
Subaru was saying!

435
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:20,012
That Shinichi is just like a ninja. Saizo Kirigakure!

436
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,212
Sanada!

437
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:23,012
He says that he found out the truth of the case,

438
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:25,312
so to head for the scene of the crime right away.

439
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:28,412
I guess we gotta go to determine

440
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:31,412
whether his deduction is right or wrong.

441
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:37,012
Next Conan, "Yusaku Kudo's Cold Case (Part 2)"

442
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:55,412
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,912
"Loose Change"

444
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,112
Are you more concerned about him flirting than the case itself?

445
00:24:59,112 --> 00:25:00,712
In order to win the case.

446
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:02,208
Hey, hey!
