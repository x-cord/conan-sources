1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,070
Darn it!

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,770
This is why I hate rainy days.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,470
You should've stayed home then.

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,270
No way, idiot!

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,270
What better chance can there be since Ran's not home!

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,470
What makes you think I'll stay home and not go drinking?

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,170
But Ran prepared dinner before she left.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,770
It's not my fault if you get scolded later, you know.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,070
Look at you!

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,370
You're tagging along with me, too!

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,070
You can make more excuses with me around, can't you?

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,970
And? What do you want to eat?

13
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,270
Well...

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,270
What was that?

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,170
Pops that sound just now...

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,270
Yes. It could be a traffic accident!

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,570
A canvas stained black with crime.

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,070
Vivid brilliant deduction skills change its color!

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,070
The headlights shine on the scene of the incident.

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,370
Is it a mere accident? There is an unexpected turn of events.

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,170
He sees through the one and only truth.

22
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,070
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,570
His name is Detective Conan!

24
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:03,828
"Bus Stop in the Rain"

25
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,528
Hey, you! Are you all right?

26
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:22,428
How is he?

27
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:24,928
He's just passed out.

28
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:29,228
But why's he in the middle of the road like this?

29
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:31,228
Pops! Over there!

30
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:32,228
What is it?

31
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,428
What?

32
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,128
No good.

33
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:44,228
He's dead.

34
00:03:44,228 --> 00:03:46,928
Call the police, kid.

35
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:49,128
I don't think we need to.

36
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:56,528
The car parked on the center line...

37
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,328
Inspector?

38
00:03:58,328 --> 00:03:59,328
Mr. Mouri?

39
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,528
Why are you both here?

40
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:04,928
We were on our way back from a case

41
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:09,828
when we saw a suspicious looking car stopped on the center line.

42
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:13,428
But what are you doing here, Mr. Mouri?

43
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,328
Well, you see...

44
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:20,028
We happened to be walking nearby when we heard the sound of a crash.

45
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:23,428
So we ran over here and this is what we saw.

46
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,528
I guess there aren't any security cameras around.

47
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:33,728
Yes.

48
00:04:33,728 --> 00:04:36,528
Besides, in this rain and darkness,

49
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:40,228
I guess we can't expect any eye-witnesses either.

50
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:44,728
This means we have no choice but to ask him what happened.

51
00:04:44,728 --> 00:04:46,528
Is he okay?

52
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:49,128
It's seems his life is in no danger.

53
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:52,628
Besides, I think the ambulance will also be here shortly.

54
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:57,128
I guess we'll just have to wait for him to regain consciousness.

55
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:59,428
And, what's the identity of the victim?

56
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:00,528
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:03,828
There were a wallet and cell phone in his pocket.

58
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:07,728
From his ID card we found that he is Mr. Naohiro Tsutsumi, age 31.

59
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:11,328
The cause of death is most probably a brain contusion

60
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:12,628
due to strong impact to his head.

61
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:18,228
It seems he's had a drink.

62
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:21,728
So he may have been drunk and jumped out before the car or something.

63
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:26,828
But we can't assume it was an accident yet.

64
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:46,228
All you ever do is get in the way at crime scenes.

65
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:47,928
So, stay still and wait here.

66
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,928
My head...

67
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:57,728
What?

68
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:00,128
Don't you remember anything?

69
00:06:00,128 --> 00:06:02,028
Remember?

70
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,328
I was driving...

71
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:09,428
That's right. I...

72
00:06:09,428 --> 00:06:11,328
What happened to the person I ran over?

73
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,228
Is he all right?

74
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:16,128
Unfortunately...

75
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:17,928
Oh, no.

76
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:20,428
Are you okay?

77
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,028
Are you hurt?

78
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,928
I'm fine.

79
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,628
Just to be safe, let's have you examined later.

80
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,328
The ambulance will be here soon.

81
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,328
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:38,828
How is he?

83
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:41,228
The inside of his mouth is cut,

84
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,828
but it seems he has no other injuries.

85
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:48,328
We'd like him to accompany us to inspect the scene of the accident then.

86
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:49,728
No problem.

87
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,528
Then, would you please come this way?

88
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:54,528
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,128
"Toshiaki Kikuchi (31)" -Let's start with your name.

90
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:03,228
I'm Toshiaki Kikuchi.

91
00:07:03,228 --> 00:07:04,728
Where do you work?

92
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,828
I'm unemployed right now.

93
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:08,928
I see.

94
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:10,928
Alright, then.

95
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:19,628
Tsutsumi?

96
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:23,728
Tsutsumi!

97
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:25,528
Tsutsumi.

98
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,228
It's you after all.

99
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,128
How did you end up like this?

100
00:07:31,128 --> 00:07:33,328
Why?

101
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,828
Do you know him?

102
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:36,828
Yes.

103
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:43,228
How could I have run over you?

104
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:44,428
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:46,428
I'm so sorry!

106
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:56,828
Are you friends with the victim?

107
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:59,428
He was an ex-colleague of mine at the same company.

108
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,628
What do you mean by ex?

109
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:07,228
Tsutsumi and I were both laid off recently.

110
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:08,928
We entered the company at the same time

111
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:12,428
and were on good terms with each other, you see.

112
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:18,828
We were laughing about that fact we got laid off at the same time, too.

113
00:08:18,828 --> 00:08:20,528
I see.

114
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:23,128
It may be tough on you,

115
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:27,728
but will you give us details on the circumstances of the accident?

116
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:28,728
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:33,228
After eating dinner at a restaurant owned by a friend of mine,

118
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,628
I was driving back home.

119
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,528
I noticed a person holding an umbrella came out in front of my car

120
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,828
and slammed on the brakes.

121
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,628
But in this rain and darkness...

122
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,328
I know I'm just making excuses.

123
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,828
You said you finished eating dinner,

124
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:03,028
but of course you didn't drink, did you?

125
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,728
No way.

126
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:06,628
Not even a drop.

127
00:09:11,928 --> 00:09:13,228
That umbrella...

128
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:26,428
This umbrella is the victim's.

129
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,028
What are you doing, sir?

130
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,528
Oh, it's you.

131
00:09:36,528 --> 00:09:39,228
I came to get my own umbrella.

132
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:43,228
I can't keep sharing umbrellas with the officer for too long, you see.

133
00:09:43,228 --> 00:09:46,328
Inspector Megure, the paramedics brought this over.

134
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,028
It seems like they found something.

135
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:53,628
Seems so.

136
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,128
What seems to be the matter?

137
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:01,628
They found a suicide note from Mr. Tsutsumi.

138
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:05,728
"Life is too hard. I'm at my limit."

139
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,028
No.

140
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:10,528
He left a suicide note.

141
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,128
In other words, this is not an accident,

142
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:18,928
but suicide.

143
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:23,128
Where did they find that suicide note?

144
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:30,028
The paramedics found it in Mr. Tsutsumi's pocket.

145
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:34,828
Mr. Kikuchi.

146
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:39,928
Would you have any idea why he would commit suicide?

147
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:42,228
After being laid off,

148
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:47,028
he was energetically trying to find another job.

149
00:10:47,028 --> 00:10:48,828
But things didn't work out as well.

150
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:54,128
How I wish I could win the lottery or something.

151
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:58,128
More importantly, how's looking for a job coming along?

152
00:10:58,128 --> 00:10:59,528
What?

153
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:04,728
There are no companies that would be interested in hiring me already!

154
00:11:04,728 --> 00:11:07,228
Don't say that, Tsutsumi.

155
00:11:08,328 --> 00:11:10,628
Thanks to your unpleasant talk,

156
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,628
I'm turning sober.

157
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,528
Darn it!

158
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,928
Hey, Kikuchi. Lend me money, will you?

159
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,628
You got some going away money from the company, didn't you?

160
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:22,928
I used it all up already!

161
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,528
Gosh.

162
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:26,228
Just give me the money!

163
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,128
Hey!

164
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:29,828
I'm going to borrow a bill.

165
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:35,128
What do you intend to do from now?

166
00:11:36,728 --> 00:11:38,128
Beats me.

167
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:42,528
If worse comes to worse, maybe I'll commit suicide or something.

168
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:44,428
Commit suicide?

169
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,728
Come on. I'm only joking.

170
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:48,828
See you.

171
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,328
I see.

172
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:56,828
He was laid off from the company and also had money problems.

173
00:11:56,828 --> 00:12:00,328
I didn't think he was cornered to the point of having to commit suicide.

174
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:03,328
He should've come talk to me.

175
00:12:03,328 --> 00:12:06,428
Officer Takagi, there's something on the back.

176
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,328
You're right.

177
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,528
Looks like a piece of string.

178
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:12,628
That's...

179
00:12:12,628 --> 00:12:14,228
What did I tell you?

180
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:17,528
Don't get carried away.

181
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,228
It hurts!

182
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:21,028
Stay away.

183
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:23,728
The rain's starting to pour harder.

184
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:26,728
Let's take shelter from the rain, too.

185
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:27,928
Good idea.

186
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:41,728
Well, there's nothing really suspicious,

187
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:44,128
so I guess this can be concluded as a case of suicide.

188
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:49,628
How heavy will my sentence be?

189
00:12:49,628 --> 00:12:51,828
Well...

190
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,928
It all depends on the inspection of the traffic department,

191
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:56,428
so it's still hard to tell just yet.

192
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,828
But I doubt it'll be worse than forward inattention

193
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:04,728
and professional negligence resulting in death.

194
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:06,528
I see.

195
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,928
No.

196
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:09,828
This is not suicide.

197
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:10,928
Darn it.

198
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:12,828
I have nothing conclusive yet.

199
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,028
Darn it! I'm soaking wet!

200
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:20,328
This coat doesn't repel water at all!

201
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:30,428
I got it!

202
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:48,695
It must be here somewhere.

203
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:54,795
I found it!

204
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:59,495
The guys from the transportation department are sure taking their time.

205
00:14:00,695 --> 00:14:02,995
According to the paramedics who came a while ago,

206
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:06,895
there was a multiple collision accident on Beika Ohashi Bridge.

207
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,695
Today's was sudden...

208
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:11,895
Mr. Mouri!

209
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:13,295
Has it come to you already?

210
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,195
Don't tell me it's the usual?

211
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,995
Yes, I figured it out.

212
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:22,795
This was a premeditated murder committed by Mr. Kikuchi.

213
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:28,295
But you were saying it was suicide till just a while ago.

214
00:14:28,295 --> 00:14:29,295
Yes.

215
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:33,695
I was completely deceived by Mr. Kikuchi's true to life act.

216
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,895
What nonsense are you talking about?

217
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:37,295
Mr. Kikuchi.

218
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:40,895
There are several things in your testimony that doesn't make sense.

219
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,595
Hey, Conan. Show the you-know-what to the inspector.

220
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:46,095
Okay. Inspector Megure!

221
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,595
I found this near the car.

222
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:51,095
I think it's Mr. Tsutsumi's umbrella.

223
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,095
It looks like an ordinary umbrella.

224
00:14:57,095 --> 00:15:02,395
Mr. Kikuchi testified that a person holding an umbrella came bursting out.

225
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:03,795
Huh?

226
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:07,295
That umbrella was closed, wasn't it?

227
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:11,295
Maybe it closed from the impact of the accident or something?

228
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:15,195
That umbrella is a jump type umbrella.

229
00:15:15,195 --> 00:15:17,895
It opens at the push of a button,

230
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:23,395
but when you close it, you need to slide the part called the runner.

231
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:29,695
As you can see, unless you deliberately close it,

232
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,595
the umbrella can't close.

233
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:39,195
Then, when did Mr. Tsutsumi close his umbrella?

234
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:44,095
It's hard to imagine he closed it himself after he was hit.

235
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:45,695
If so...

236
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,195
You're right.

237
00:15:47,195 --> 00:15:49,595
I must've remembered wrong.

238
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:53,095
Tsutsumi didn't have his umbrella open to begin with.

239
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,395
Yes, I'm sure of it.

240
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,995
No mistake about it.

241
00:15:55,995 --> 00:15:58,895
Oh, you remembered wrong.

242
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:00,495
It's true.

243
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:03,395
My mind was a mess after the accident.

244
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,195
According to my deduction,

245
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:10,895
I think Mr. Tsutsumi closed his umbrella so he could get into your car.

246
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,195
Am I wrong?

247
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,695
What do you mean?

248
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,495
When I got to the scene,

249
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,395
the interior light of the car was on.

250
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,195
Hey, you! Are you all right?

251
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:27,695
And when you went back to your car to get your umbrella

252
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,695
and closed the door on the passenger's seat side,

253
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,995
the interior light of the car went out.

254
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,095
In other words,

255
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:36,695
somebody had opened the door of the passenger's seat once.

256
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,795
And for some reason,

257
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,195
the door wasn't completely closed.

258
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:42,695
Mr. Kikuchi.

259
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:45,195
Why did you go out of your way to take the umbrella

260
00:16:45,195 --> 00:16:48,095
that was in the backseat from the passenger's seat side?

261
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:50,295
Well...

262
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:53,395
You thought that the interior light of the car being on

263
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:57,395
would serve as proof that you tried to let him on your car

264
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,595
and tried to hide the evidence, didn't you?

265
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,095
Wrong!

266
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:06,095
Mr. Kikuchi, you summoned Mr. Tsutsumi out to this empty road

267
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:09,295
with no security cameras around.

268
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:15,095
And when Mr. Tsutsumi came,

269
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:17,295
you urged him to get in the car.

270
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:21,895
Mr. Tsutsumi closed his umbrella to get in the car

271
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,995
and the moment he placed his hand on the door,

272
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,295
you suddenly put the car in reverse.

273
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:31,895
He must have received the abrasions on his right hand fingers then.

274
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:38,995
Then, you stopped once.

275
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:42,495
You then headed the car straight for Mr. Tsutsumi

276
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,095
who was standing there not understanding what was going on.

277
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,495
Hold it.

278
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:50,795
Why did he have to put the car in reverse?

279
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:54,095
He needed to earn acceleration speed

280
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:56,995
in order to run over a person and kill him.

281
00:17:56,995 --> 00:17:59,695
The fact that the side mirror on the passenger's seat side

282
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:02,295
is bent towards the windshield

283
00:18:02,295 --> 00:18:05,795
is proof that the car reversed once.

284
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:08,795
The side mirror probably hit Mr. Tsutsumi

285
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:11,095
when the car was put in reverse.

286
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:23,095
After running over Mr. Tsutsumi,

287
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:28,095
you took the suicide note that you had prepared and left the car.

288
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:34,195
Then you hid the suicide note in the pocket of Mr. Tsutsumi's jacket,

289
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,895
returned to your car

290
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,695
and pretended to be passed out.

291
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,795
This is the full story of the case.

292
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,695
It's true that everything falls into place.

293
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:50,195
But do you have proof?

294
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:54,195
You can't conclude me as being a killer with just what you have, can you?

295
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:55,495
Right.

296
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:57,795
Only this much of circumstantial evidence isn't enough

297
00:18:57,795 --> 00:18:59,495
to conclude that Mr. Kikuchi is the killer.

298
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,795
There's proof.

299
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:04,795
Please look at the suicide note that Mr. Tsutsumi had on him.

300
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:07,995
What is it?

301
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,095
Please take a good look at the paper.

302
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,195
Don't you think it's much too clean?

303
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:18,295
If Mr. Tsutsumi was run over

304
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:20,995
with the suicide note in the pocket of his jacket,

305
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,995
it's odd that the paper is not more crumpled.

306
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:27,695
Now that you mentioned it, I guess so.

307
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:31,295
Next, the way the suicide note is wet is strange.

308
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,095
He's right!

309
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:35,595
A part of it isn't wet.

310
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:37,295
What do you mean?

311
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:41,695
That means that the suicide note was waterproof.

312
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:45,295
Why would something like that be done to the suicide note?

313
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:47,495
It wasn't the note itself.

314
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:51,495
The note was probably placed together with other waterproof items.

315
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:56,095
Therefore, the water repellent was transferred onto it.

316
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,295
Officer Takagi.

317
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:02,895
Please check the dashboard of Mr. Kikuchi's car, will you?

318
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:03,995
Yes, sir.

319
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:12,895
I found it.

320
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:16,795
The car wax and the towel to wipe it off.

321
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:19,895
Mr. Kikuchi.

322
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:22,695
You waxed your car today, didn't you?

323
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,995
The fact that only the sleeve of your right hand

324
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:27,795
is repelling the rain proves it.

325
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:34,295
If the blue fiber that's on the suicide note

326
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:37,295
and the fiber of that towel matches,

327
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:41,295
it will be obvious that you put the suicide note

328
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:42,795
into Mr. Tsutsumi's pocket.

329
00:20:48,495 --> 00:20:52,495
Maybe you were hoping that the evidence would be washed away by the rain,

330
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:55,195
but it seems to have backfired on you.

331
00:20:56,795 --> 00:21:00,695
When he was laid off from the company,

332
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:03,995
he told our boss a lot of things

333
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:05,895
to discredit me and got me laid off, too.

334
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:14,495
What?

335
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:16,195
Tsutsumi!

336
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:18,695
Why did you lie like that?

337
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,195
Thanks to you, I...

338
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:24,295
There are no reasons.

339
00:21:24,295 --> 00:21:28,095
I just wanted to drag somebody down with me.

340
00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:34,295
You mean you had the nerve to ruin my life just for that?

341
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:38,095
Well, since we were both laid off together,

342
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:40,495
we might as well be friends.

343
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:42,095
Okay, buddy?

344
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:49,295
My life was ruined because of his whim.

345
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:53,095
I couldn't forgive him!

346
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:31,595
So, we finally get to eat dinner.

347
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:32,595
Yes.

348
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:36,195
It's raining again.

349
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:40,695
Huh? Where's my umbrella?

350
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:42,395
That's right!

351
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:45,195
I left it at the bus stop!

352
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,795
I'd better hurry back to get it...

353
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:52,495
What a classic case of "danger past, God forgotten."

354
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:56,095
"Next Episode"

355
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,395
If only you didn't tag along,

356
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,195
it would've been a great drive!

357
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:03,295
But Ran asked me to come with you.

358
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:08,795
Thank goodness, you seem to have completely overcome your problem.

359
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:11,195
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Mouri.

360
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:13,495
This is where I would like you show you next.

361
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,695
An amusement park!

362
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:18,295
If so, what's her motive?
