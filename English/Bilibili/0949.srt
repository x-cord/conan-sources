6
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.270
if this doesn't get picked up first.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.970
I hope they decide to use it.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.070
Just kidding.

Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

He sees through the one and only truth.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.170
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

20
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:58.211
I've visited Nichiuri TV several times,

21
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:01.911
but this is the first invitation I've received from Nichiuri Radio.

22
00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:05.311
I'm Manda, the world's greatest producer.

23
00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:08.711
What? The best in the world?

"Teruomi Manda (40), Nichiuri TV and Radio Production Unit Producer"

25
00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:12.911
Oh, please. I can't believe you took me seriously, Mr. Mouri.

26
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.811
It's a joke.

27
00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:15.811
I'm actually only the second greatest

28
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:18.211
-in the world. -What's with this guy?

29
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:22.811
And this is the world's greatest director, Kujirai.

30
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.011
"Mamoru Kujirai (35)" -I'm Mamoru Kujirai.

Nice to meet you.

No, thank you.

40
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.611
So, Mr. Mouri, you got any alcohol in your system?

41
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:53.011
Alcohol?

42
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:55.211
No, of course not.

43
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.711
What?

44
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:59.411

45

47
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.211
-Got it. -Hold on. Are you sure?

48
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.311
We're about to start.

49
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:08.911
What? But isn't it true?

50
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:11.211
They said Mr. Mouri performs better

51
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:14.011
when he's had a drink or two.

52
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:20.011
I suppose they're not wrong.

53
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:21.811
Then it's decided.

54
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:25.011
Mr. Mouri, we'll be heading into the studio now.

55
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:27.611
We'll see you later.

56
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:28.811
All right.

57
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.711
Is that producer guy, Mr. Manda, always like that?

58
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:36.611
I guess so.

59
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:38.011
Really?

60
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:41.111
Anyway, what would you like to drink?

61
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:43.011
"On Air"

62
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:51.511
Today's concern comes from TM of Tokyo.

63
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:53.911
"I don't know what to do about the crazy woman"

64
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:56.411
"who is living in the apartment directly above mine."

65
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:59.311
"She's definitely noisy and she throws cigarette butts"

66
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:01.511
"and empty cans onto my balcony."

67
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:04.811
"I have no idea what to do."

68
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:08.811
I see. This is a truly pressing concern.

69
00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:10.611
Today's guest, Mr. Mouri,

70
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:13.411
what advice do you have as a detective?

71
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:17.011
It makes you angry because you think of her as human.

72
00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:20.511
That obnoxious woman is nothing more than trash!

73
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:21.611
What?

74
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:27.911
I don't think it's right to treat people like garbage...

75
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:31.611
TM, you should give her a taste of her own medicine!

76
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:34.511
Throw trash back onto her balcony!

77
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:36.711
Burnable trash, non-burnable trash!

78
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.011
Even your food scraps!

79
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:42.611
Mr. Mouri really is the best.

80
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.411
I told you this would happen!

81
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:46.011
What are we supposed to do now?

82
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.011
"Mr. Mouri, you're the best!" -Throw your extra large trash!

83
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:49.511
Play the jingle!

84
00:05:49.511 --> 00:05:50.511
"Jingle"

85
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:53.211
He's still going!

86
00:05:57.211 --> 00:06:00.711
"Detective Mouri's comments is truly nice"

87
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:05.011
"The curtains are now rising on my plan"

88
00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:08.611
"Several hours later"

89
00:06:08.611 --> 00:06:10.911
Answer the door, you witch!

90
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.911
What's all this about?

91
00:06:12.911 --> 00:06:14.911
I could ask you the same thing!

92
00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:16.811
"Kumi Kijima (38)" -You're the one who picked a fight with me!

93
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:19.311
You trash talked me on the radio!

94
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:22.211
"Towako Manda (31)" -What? I don't know what you're talking about.

95
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:23.911
It must've been someone else.

96
00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:25.711
Don't play dumb!

97
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:27.611
Hey, stop!

98
00:06:27.611 --> 00:06:29.511
I can't believe you used the radio!

99
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.911
That hurts!

100
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:33.711
They don't even know they're being manipulated.

101
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:36.311
It's all going exactly according to plan.

102
00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:39.111
You'll pay for this!

103
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:41.211
Don't think you'll get way with it!

104
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:44.811
Move out of here already, you nuisance!

105
00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:56.411
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Yes, Inspector.

106
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:59.511
I did appear on a radio show yesterday.

107
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:01.011
What about it?

108
00:07:01.011 --> 00:07:04.311
I told you, I've got nothing to do with it!

109
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.211
Just come to Nichiuri TV.

110
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:08.811
You're a witness.

111
00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:10.611
A witness?

112
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:12.011
Witness to what?

113
00:07:12.011 --> 00:07:14.111
A murder case!

114
00:07:14.111 --> 00:07:17.211
What? A murder case?

115
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:19.811
Hurry.

116
00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:32.611
The victim is Towako Manda, 31 years old,

117
00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:35.211
a resident of a nearby apartment building.

118
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:41.411
She was killed late last night around 12 am.

119
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:44.211
She must've been struck with this metal pipe.

120
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:45.311
It hurts!

121
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:48.111
We didn't find any fingerprints on the weapon,

122
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:51.111
and there wasn't any blood at the crime scene.

123
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:52.511
I see.

124
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:55.311
So, why am I a witness?

125
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:57.111
Because the murderer's motive

126
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:00.811
may have had something to do with the radio show you appeared on.

127
00:08:00.811 --> 00:08:04.911
What? How is that radio show the motive?

128
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:09.311
Yesterday evening, the victim and Mrs. Kumi Kijima,

129
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:14.711
who lives above her, argued about the show.

130
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.111
The listener's concern was about

131
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:19.411
the obnoxious behavior of the woman

132
00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:21.411
who lived above her.

133
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:25.711
I believe the listener's name was TM.

134
00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:26.811
TM?

135
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:31.611
Those are the same initials as the victim, Towako Manda's.

136
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:34.711
I see. Then the obnoxious woman must be...

137
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:38.311
Of course I'm angry!

138
00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:40.611
When I came home from work yesterday,

139
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:43.111
I found a note in my mailbox.

140
00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:46.211
"Nuisance" -and a recording of the radio show.

141
00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:52.111
It makes you angry because you think of her as human.

142
00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:55.511
That obnoxious woman is nothing more than trash!

143
00:08:56.811 --> 00:08:59.111
So I went to yell at her!

144
00:08:59.111 --> 00:09:01.811
Pops, you said those cruel things?

145
00:09:01.811 --> 00:09:04.011
Well, you know...

146
00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:10.411
Well... I have no excuse.

147
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.911
I had a little too much of the drink I was offered.

148
00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:15.611
I'm sorry!

149
00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:19.411
No... It's not your fault.

150
00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:25.911
Anyway, the building manager intervened

151
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:28.211
and was able to calm things down.

152
00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:29.811
You'll pay for this!

153
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:31.911
Don't think you'll get way with it!

154
00:09:31.911 --> 00:09:35.711
Move out of here already, you nuisance!

155
00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:40.511
What? Then you did invite the victim out later that night...

156
00:09:40.511 --> 00:09:42.711
I told you, I didn't do it.

157
00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:44.211
Now...

158
00:09:45.811 --> 00:09:50.211
But immediately after the victim wrote in about her concern.

159
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:54.611
It's not that simple, Mouri.

160
00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:55.911
Ms. Yashiro.

161
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:57.111
Yes.

162
00:09:57.111 --> 00:10:03.311
The listener, TM, isn't the victim, Towako Manda.

163
00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.611
What?

164
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:08.311
It's someone completely different named Tsugumi Mourikawa.

165
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:12.411
But you received a CD recording of the show

166
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:15.511
in your mailbox, right?

167
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.011
That's it.

168
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:20.711
Towako Manda, who happened to share the same concern,

169
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:23.311
heard the show on the radio

170
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.111
and recorded it onto a CD.

171
00:10:26.111 --> 00:10:30.311
She put it in Mrs. Kijima's mailbox out of spite.

172
00:10:30.311 --> 00:10:32.311
When Mrs. Kijima heard it,

173
00:10:32.311 --> 00:10:35.011
she thought it was about her.

174
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.511
I told you...

175
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:37.911
But, Mouri,

176
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:42.511
it wasn't the victim who put the CD in her mailbox.

177
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.011
-What? -What?

178
00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:48.811
I'm having Takagi look into it right now.

179
00:10:51.011 --> 00:10:55.011
Isn't this case a little too convenient for someone?

180
00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:59.211
It may be a coincidence but the victim is the victim.

181
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:00.511
What do you mean?

182
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.611
We learned this when we arrived,

183
00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:08.311
but the victim Towako Manda is the wife of Producer Manda.

184
00:11:08.311 --> 00:11:09.611
They're currently separated.

185
00:11:09.611 --> 00:11:10.811
Your wife?

186
00:11:10.811 --> 00:11:14.311
Oh, but don't worry about it, Mr. Mouri.

187
00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:17.411
I was going to divorce that thing.

188
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:23.611
But your wife was firmly against divorce, wasn't she?

189
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:25.411
What does that have to do with this case?

190
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:28.711
But since your wife is gone,

191
00:11:28.711 --> 00:11:30.911
that means your wish came true, right?

192
00:11:30.911 --> 00:11:32.011
Oh, please.

193
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:35.911
Don't say such strange things, Kujirai and Nino.

194
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:39.211
The conversation's gone in a strange direction.

195
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:42.811
Yeah. It sounds like he's grateful for what the culprit did.

196
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:45.111
I told you, it wasn't me!

197
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:48.011
I did harass her a little.

198
00:11:48.011 --> 00:11:51.811
She kept boasting about being a rising artist.

199
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:55.211
She was a rising artist?

200
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:57.211
It seems that way.

201
00:11:57.211 --> 00:12:00.011
But that has nothing to do with this case.

202
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:05.011
Yes, but if the divorce proceedings weren't going well...

203
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:07.711
Mr. Mouri, you too?

204
00:12:07.711 --> 00:12:09.711
You're making it sound like

205
00:12:09.711 --> 00:12:13.111
I'm somehow involved in her murder.

206
00:12:13.111 --> 00:12:14.211
Right?

207
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:17.811
Oh, please.

208
00:12:17.811 --> 00:12:19.511
Yes?

209
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:21.011
Thank you.

210
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:24.711
I see. Right away.

211
00:12:24.711 --> 00:12:28.911
Excuse me. There's a meeting scheduled in this room.

212
00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:31.611
Understood. We'll move.

213
00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:39.311
Inspector, there's a job I have to check on.

214
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:40.811
That should be fine.

215
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:42.011
Excuse me.

216
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:43.511
Thanks for doing this.

217
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:44.711
Sure thing.

218
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:48.611
Inspector Megure.

219
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.611
How did it go, Takagi?

220
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:53.111
Yes, sir. About that...

221
00:12:54.511 --> 00:12:56.311
I knew it.

222
00:12:56.311 --> 00:13:00.211
Mr. Manda, this is the CD we were just discussing.

223
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:01.811
You're the one who put this

224
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:04.911
in Mrs. Kijima's mailbox, weren't you?

225
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:06.011
What?

226
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:15.211
"Just as planned"

227
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.778
Our investigation revealed that

228
00:13:26.778 --> 00:13:30.978
this CD wasn't a recording of the broadcast

229
00:13:30.978 --> 00:13:35.378
but copied directly from the source.

230
00:13:35.378 --> 00:13:38.778
Some of the station staff claim that yesterday afternoon

231
00:13:38.778 --> 00:13:44.378
Mr. Manda asked them to create a copy.

232
00:13:44.378 --> 00:13:48.178
Naturally, he told them not to tell anyone.

233
00:13:48.178 --> 00:13:49.678
I wonder why.

234
00:13:49.678 --> 00:13:51.978
Then you disappeared from the station

235
00:13:51.978 --> 00:13:54.278
for about two hours.

236
00:13:54.278 --> 00:13:56.378
During that time, are you sure you didn't go to the apartment

237
00:13:56.378 --> 00:14:01.278
and put the CD in Mrs. Kijima's mailbox?

238
00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:04.378
It certainly seems that way.

239
00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:06.978
I knew it was you!

240
00:14:06.978 --> 00:14:08.578
Mr. Manda.

241
00:14:08.578 --> 00:14:10.178
During the review meeting

242
00:14:10.178 --> 00:14:12.978
after yesterday's broadcast,

243
00:14:12.978 --> 00:14:14.778
someone said they wished

244
00:14:14.778 --> 00:14:17.778
the woman living above my wife

245
00:14:17.778 --> 00:14:20.978
to listen to today's show.

246
00:14:20.978 --> 00:14:23.778
I'd told everyone that she was frustrated

247
00:14:23.778 --> 00:14:26.178
with the obnoxious woman living above her.

248
00:14:26.178 --> 00:14:29.278
That's when I realized something interesting might happen

249
00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:33.978
if I made it seem like she'd complained about her.

250
00:14:38.478 --> 00:14:40.778
You've gotta strike when the iron's hot.

251
00:14:42.378 --> 00:14:45.678
"Now the whole world's laughing at you."

252
00:14:45.678 --> 00:14:46.678
"Nuisance"

253
00:14:48.378 --> 00:14:52.178
And just as you planned, your wife was killed.

254
00:14:52.178 --> 00:14:53.278
What?

255
00:14:53.278 --> 00:14:56.578
That's how he made someone else do the killing.

256
00:14:56.578 --> 00:14:59.478
Manipulating another so he wouldn't get his own hands dirty!

257
00:14:59.478 --> 00:15:00.778
No!

258
00:15:00.778 --> 00:15:04.178
I just wanted her to suffer a little.

259
00:15:04.178 --> 00:15:06.578
I never thought she'd be killed for it.

260
00:15:06.578 --> 00:15:08.478
I'm...

261
00:15:08.478 --> 00:15:10.878
I'm sorry!

262
00:15:12.378 --> 00:15:15.878
Even if it wasn't deliberate,

263
00:15:15.878 --> 00:15:20.578
you're still responsible for causing a murder.

264
00:15:20.578 --> 00:15:24.178
All I did was go and yell at her!

265
00:15:24.178 --> 00:15:26.678
Mr. Mouri, I have a request.

266
00:15:26.678 --> 00:15:30.878
Please prove Mrs. Kumi Kijima's innocence.

267
00:15:30.878 --> 00:15:32.378
What?

268
00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:33.678
-Yashiro. -Yashiro.

269
00:15:33.678 --> 00:15:36.878
You believe me?

270
00:15:36.878 --> 00:15:38.978
It's for Mr. Manda, actually.

271
00:15:41.178 --> 00:15:44.078
If he caused the murder,

272
00:15:44.078 --> 00:15:47.078
then Mr. Manda will be held responsible too.

273
00:15:47.078 --> 00:15:48.978
I can't let that happen.

274
00:15:48.978 --> 00:15:50.978
He's very important to me.

275
00:15:50.978 --> 00:15:53.078
I owe him everything.

276
00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:56.078
You owe Mr. Manda everything?

277
00:15:56.078 --> 00:16:01.878
I debuted as a broadcast writer with a radio drama.

278
00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:06.878
He looked through the script I brought in as a total amateur.

279
00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:12.978
Yashiro, you're lucky you got to deal with me.

280
00:16:14.678 --> 00:16:19.678
Mr. Manda, who was a director at the time,

281
00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:22.578
took it upon myself to put my show on the radio.

282
00:16:22.578 --> 00:16:25.478
So you owe him for helping you debut.

283
00:16:26.778 --> 00:16:30.678
We never worked together after that,

284
00:16:30.678 --> 00:16:31.978
but one month ago,

285
00:16:31.978 --> 00:16:35.778
he returned as the producer of "The Until Noon Show",

286
00:16:35.778 --> 00:16:38.678
and we were finally reunited.

287
00:16:38.678 --> 00:16:39.978
I see.

288
00:16:39.978 --> 00:16:43.078
You want to save the man who helped you.

289
00:16:43.078 --> 00:16:45.578
It's true that if she's innocent,

290
00:16:45.578 --> 00:16:48.478
then Mr. Manda won't be held responsible.

291
00:16:48.478 --> 00:16:52.878
You gotta save me, Mr. Mouri!

292
00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.778
Mr. Mouri, please! Save me!

293
00:16:54.778 --> 00:16:59.278
Inspector, does Mrs. Kumi Kijima have an alibi?

294
00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:02.178
Every Friday she goes bar-hopping.

295
00:17:02.178 --> 00:17:03.978
She said that's what she was doing last night.

296
00:17:03.978 --> 00:17:06.278
It's true!

297
00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:07.678
I see.

298
00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:12.378
Hello, this is Megure.

299
00:17:12.378 --> 00:17:13.778
Yes.

300
00:17:13.778 --> 00:17:15.678
What? You found someone?

301
00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:21.278
Got it.

302
00:17:21.278 --> 00:17:22.278
Thank you.

303
00:17:23.378 --> 00:17:26.478
Mrs. Kijima's alibi has been verified.

304
00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:27.978
See?

305
00:17:27.978 --> 00:17:32.278
An employee said she was drinking there last night

306
00:17:32.278 --> 00:17:34.878
from around 11 pm until past midnight.

307
00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:37.778
Which means...

308
00:17:38.978 --> 00:17:43.578
I told you I didn't kill her from the start!

309
00:17:43.578 --> 00:17:46.878
In other words, what I did

310
00:17:46.878 --> 00:17:52.178
had absolutely nothing at all to do with her murder.

311
00:17:53.378 --> 00:17:55.878
That's great news, Mr. Manda.

312
00:17:55.878 --> 00:17:59.078
I've got the God of Radio on my side.

313
00:18:00.178 --> 00:18:03.178
But then who's the culprit?

314
00:18:03.178 --> 00:18:04.978
Who knows?

315
00:18:06.478 --> 00:18:09.778
In any case, now that we know our program

316
00:18:09.778 --> 00:18:11.878
had nothing to do with the case,

317
00:18:11.878 --> 00:18:14.778
we can get out of here.

318
00:18:14.778 --> 00:18:16.578
Before that, Mr. Manda.

319
00:18:16.578 --> 00:18:19.278
Where were you last night?

320
00:18:19.278 --> 00:18:20.678
Me?

321
00:18:20.678 --> 00:18:23.278
I went drinking with these guys.

322
00:18:23.278 --> 00:18:25.578
But I suddenly felt tired,

323
00:18:25.578 --> 00:18:27.678
so I went home and went to bed.

324
00:18:28.778 --> 00:18:31.678
In other words, you were home alone?

325
00:18:31.678 --> 00:18:34.178
What about it?

326
00:18:34.178 --> 00:18:36.878
It's ironic,

327
00:18:36.878 --> 00:18:39.478
but now that our prime suspect, Mrs. Kumi Kijima,

328
00:18:39.478 --> 00:18:41.378
has been proven innocent...

329
00:18:41.378 --> 00:18:44.778
We're forced to consider who stands

330
00:18:44.778 --> 00:18:47.378
to benefit the most

331
00:18:47.378 --> 00:18:51.178
from the death of Towako Manda.

332
00:18:51.178 --> 00:18:54.378
It's the end of the line, Mr. Manda.

333
00:18:54.378 --> 00:18:56.878
You killed your wife

334
00:18:56.878 --> 00:19:00.578
and put that CD in Mrs. Kumi Kijima's mailbox

335
00:19:00.578 --> 00:19:04.178
so it would look like she did it.

336
00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:07.678
You made the police believe she had a motive.

337
00:19:07.678 --> 00:19:10.578
What are you talking about, Nino?

338
00:19:10.578 --> 00:19:12.178
Mr. Inuyama.

339
00:19:12.178 --> 00:19:15.278
We're also considering the possibility

340
00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:17.678
Mr. Inuyama just mentioned.

341
00:19:17.678 --> 00:19:19.378
But if that's true,

342
00:19:19.378 --> 00:19:22.878
then wouldn't he have done something to disprove Mrs. Kijima's alibi?

343
00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:26.078
Normally, yes, but...

344
00:19:26.078 --> 00:19:28.778
It happened in the middle of the night.

345
00:19:28.778 --> 00:19:31.178
He probably assumed she'd be unable

346
00:19:31.178 --> 00:19:33.878
to prove her alibi

347
00:19:33.878 --> 00:19:36.478
even if he didn't do anything.

348
00:19:36.478 --> 00:19:39.078
After all, Mr. Manda's all talk.

349
00:19:39.078 --> 00:19:41.378
Mr. Kujirai, why?

350
00:19:41.378 --> 00:19:44.178
I've been wondering.

351
00:19:44.178 --> 00:19:46.378
Do Mr. Inuyama and Mr. Kujirai

352
00:19:46.378 --> 00:19:48.978
not get along with Mr. Manda?

353
00:19:48.978 --> 00:19:51.978
I'm sure there's a lot going on between them.

354
00:19:51.978 --> 00:19:54.078
I know all about you, Mr. Manda.

355
00:19:54.078 --> 00:19:56.778
You're secretly scheming to prevent me

356
00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:59.978
from becoming independent.

357
00:19:59.978 --> 00:20:03.678
Well, you know, the station has its reasons.

358
00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:05.978
You don't love radio!

359
00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:07.678
You never have.

360
00:20:07.678 --> 00:20:09.778
You only think of your programs as tools

361
00:20:09.778 --> 00:20:11.278
to make yourself rich.

362
00:20:11.278 --> 00:20:13.278
You misappropriate them for your personal use!

363
00:20:14.378 --> 00:20:17.278
That has nothing to do with this.

364
00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:18.678
You're right.

365
00:20:18.678 --> 00:20:19.978
Why don't you tell us all about it

366
00:20:19.978 --> 00:20:21.878
at the station

367
00:20:21.878 --> 00:20:23.478
where there won't be any outsiders?

368
00:20:23.478 --> 00:20:25.478
The station?

369
00:20:27.278 --> 00:20:31.178
I've told you last night I was sound asleep at my home!

370
00:20:31.178 --> 00:20:32.978
You gotta believe me!

371
00:20:32.978 --> 00:20:36.478
"He's been sent to hell!"

372
00:20:36.478 --> 00:20:38.778
"That darn man!"

373
00:20:38.778 --> 00:20:41.978
He has motive and no alibi,

374
00:20:41.978 --> 00:20:45.678
and it's true that he tried to have the obnoxious woman

375
00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:47.378
living above her wife attack her.

376
00:20:47.378 --> 00:20:49.878
Yeah, but...

377
00:20:49.878 --> 00:20:52.578
Isn't this a premeditated murder?

378
00:20:52.578 --> 00:20:54.578
Could Mr. Manda really have come up with this

379
00:20:54.578 --> 00:20:57.078
if he's all talk?

380
00:20:57.078 --> 00:21:01.378
He was just that desperate to divorce his wife.

381
00:21:01.378 --> 00:21:02.578
Mr. Okada.

382
00:21:02.578 --> 00:21:05.178
Thank you for the other day.

383
00:21:05.178 --> 00:21:08.978
Hey, Abe. How did it go?

384
00:21:08.978 --> 00:21:11.078
Hey, Ms. Yashiro.

385
00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:15.578
Those two seem to really hate Mr. Manda.

386
00:21:15.578 --> 00:21:19.978
-What? -Are you saying one of them did it

387
00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:22.778
and is trying to frame Mr. Manda?

388
00:21:22.778 --> 00:21:26.578
I just thought it might be a possibility.

389
00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:28.078
You're right.

390
00:21:35.178 --> 00:21:37.778
That's not possible.

391
00:21:37.778 --> 00:21:42.078
It's true that they don't get along with Mr. Manda,

392
00:21:42.078 --> 00:21:44.078
but I can't believe they'd kill his wife

393
00:21:44.078 --> 00:21:46.378
just to get at him.

394
00:21:46.378 --> 00:21:47.978
Right?

395
00:21:47.978 --> 00:21:49.678
See, you brat?

396
00:21:49.678 --> 00:21:53.078
But they hate him so much.

397
00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:55.078
I'm kind of hungry.

398
00:21:55.078 --> 00:21:56.678
I should get something to eat.

399
00:21:56.678 --> 00:21:59.478
Listen to me!

400
00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:08.478
-Man, I'm hungry. -Pops!

401
00:22:09.878 --> 00:22:16.478
"Even if the boy suspects something, it's too late"

402
00:22:17.778 --> 00:22:22.578
"Everything has gone according to plan"

403
00:22:24.078 --> 00:22:27.478
It has ended in my victory!

404
00:22:32.478 --> 00:22:34.478
"To be continued"

405
00:23:54.378 --> 00:23:56.678
"Next Episode"

406
00:23:56.678 --> 00:23:57.878
Isn't this...

407
00:23:57.878 --> 00:24:00.478
"Radio drama" "He Disappeared Without Saying Goodbye"

408
00:24:00.478 --> 00:24:04.578
Inspector, about the case of Towako Manda's murder

409
00:24:04.578 --> 00:24:10.178
by her husband and suspect, Teruomi Manda...

410
00:24:10.178 --> 00:24:12.578
The plot lurking behind it

411
00:24:12.578 --> 00:24:15.278
most likely began a month ago.

412
00:24:18.978 --> 00:24:20.478
Next Conan,

413
00:24:20.478 --> 00:24:24.378
"The Radio Questions and Concerns Show (Solution Arc)"

414
00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:27.321
Next Conan's hint:

415
00:24:27.321 --> 00:24:29.321
"Radio drama"

416
00:24:29.321 --> 00:24:31.421
-The culprit... -Is still one up on us.

417
00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:32.521
What should we do?

418
00:24:32.521 --> 00:24:33.621
Do your best.
