1
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.710
Invited by Heiji Hattori and Kazuha Toyama,

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.610
Ran and I came to Yadori Village in Shizuoka

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.110
to help unearth the buried treasures of Tokugawa.

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.910
However, that night...

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.310
It's bright outside.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.410
What is it?

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.710
It's burning in front of the hotel!

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.810
-What? -What?

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.810
Who would do something like this?

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.210
It's Nue.

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.810
The Nue came along with the black smoke.

12
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.810
Idiot!

13
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
-A thing like that doesn't exist. -Heiji!

14
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.110
Look at that.

15
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.210
"Stay out, danger!"

16
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.310
As we pursued the monster even more, what we saw was...

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.410
Blood?

18
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.510
Isn't that Mr. Someji?

19
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.310
Is he passed out?

20
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.310
No, he already dead.

21
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
He's got claw marks on him

22
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.310
as if he were attacked by a beast.

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.910
Curtains rise as the headliner appears.

24
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.410
He beautifully dances his mystery-solving steps.

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.410
So it was the Nue after all that made those huge lacerations.

26
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.810
It gives impetus to the mystery of the buried treasure.

27
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.310
He sees through the one and only truth.

28
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.410
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

29
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.910
His name is Detective Conan!

30
00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:27.767
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Claw Traces Edition)"

31
00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:33.867
He was dead?

32
00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:35.167
Mr. Someji?

33
00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.667
Really?

34
00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:42.067
Yeah, beyond the trees that are around the lake near this hotel.

35
00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:46.067
He had a large claw mark on his back and was murdered.

36
00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:50.867
"Fumie Masuko (46), Novelist" -Don't tell me that it was a claw mark

37
00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:52.767
that looked to be one of a tiger's?

38
00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:56.167
No, it was much larger.

39
00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.867
Four claw marks about 10 cm apart.

40
00:04:01.067 --> 00:04:02.567
You must be joking?

41
00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.367
This is no joke.

42
00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:06.867
"Hajime Tsurumi (22), Journalist" -It's Nue.

43
00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:09.767
He was murdered by that huge beast.

44
00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:10.867
After all, it's said that the Nue has paws

45
00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:13.367
and legs like that of a tiger.

46
00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:14.667
"Michiki Tanzawa (62)" -I thought it were the jars,

47
00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:17.267
"Archaeologist" -but it was the beast after all.

48
00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:18.467
What?

49
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.667
Oh, no, I was just talking to myself.

50
00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.067
The jars...

51
00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:24.767
That's what he thought?

52
00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:27.067
And? Did you call the police?

53
00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.367
Yes, I did.

54
00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:31.167
They told us they couldn't come here right away

55
00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:33.167
because this place is so remote.

56
00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:37.367
But I wonder if the police can handle a monster like that?

57
00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:39.067
Don't worry.

58
00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:42.967
There's no way the monster's real.

59
00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:45.067
That's some sort of a trick.

60
00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:48.367
This burnt place smells of kerosene too.

61
00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:52.267
But there were huge claw marks on the back of the corpse, right?

62
00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:57.267
Mr. Someji was probably stabbed in the back by the perpetrator and fled,

63
00:04:57.267 --> 00:04:59.267
but collapsed from exhaustion,

64
00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:03.167
after which the perpetrator made a long cut over the initial wound.

65
00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:04.867
Then the perpetrator made three more cuts beside it

66
00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:08.167
to make it look as if the victim was attacked by the Nue.

67
00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:09.967
And the person who could've done that

68
00:05:09.967 --> 00:05:13.167
was the village head who summoned Mr. Someji out here but...

69
00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:14.767
Oh, but...

70
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:16.267
"Densuke Takekuma (58)" -The truth is, I was asked to invite everyone here

71
00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:17.967
"Village head of Yadori Village" -by a stranger too.

72
00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:20.567
In addition to the notebook I showed you at dinner,

73
00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:22.967
I was sent some money and a message

74
00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:25.567
stating that inviting the four of them,

75
00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:26.867
it would rekindle the legend of the hidden treasure

76
00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:28.567
and revitalize the village.

77
00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:31.367
Letters addressed to all four people were also enclosed,

78
00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:34.167
saying that if I mailed them out the four would surely come.

79
00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.867
There was another envelope

80
00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:38.667
inside the letter that I sent you, there?

81
00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:40.967
Yeah. A letter about the cave-in accident

82
00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:43.467
that happened 16 years ago.

83
00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:45.667
Well, that could also be some lie

84
00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:47.867
that you made up on your own too, though?

85
00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:49.867
It's no lie!

86
00:05:49.867 --> 00:05:51.767
Even the hotel and rooms that you were to stay in

87
00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:54.167
were designated.

88
00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:55.567
Well, at any rate...

89
00:05:56.867 --> 00:05:59.267
We'll hear you out after the police get here.

90
00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:00.567
Until then,

91
00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:04.267
you'll all have to stay put in your rooms.

92
00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:05.467
Right.

93
00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:08.767
Let me have all your cell phones that make sounds too.

94
00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:11.167
Because somebody could've been creating

95
00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:14.167
those eerie cries with his device.

96
00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:16.267
Wait.

97
00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:17.967
If just as the village head said,

98
00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:22.067
that somebody had designated your rooms...

99
00:06:22.067 --> 00:06:24.867
Maybe the rooms could be rigged?

100
00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.367
Our room seems to be

101
00:06:26.367 --> 00:06:31.067
the one that the foreigner who died from the cave-in used.

102
00:06:31.067 --> 00:06:33.867
I'd like somebody to change rooms with us.

103
00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:36.567
Is that true?

104
00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:37.567
Yes.

105
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:42.167
The notebook he used to practice hiragana was in the drawer.

106
00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:45.467
There seems have been other notebooks too, but...

107
00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:47.267
My, how interesting.

108
00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:50.167
Let me change rooms with you then.

109
00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:51.767
No.

110
00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:54.767
Let me stay in that room.

111
00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:58.267
I don't want women to be scared.

112
00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:02.667
Then, can I move to the room on the third floor?

113
00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:06.367
I don't mind, but stay in the room.

114
00:07:06.367 --> 00:07:08.467
If you leave, I'll take you to be the perpetrator.

115
00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.067
I see, I see.

116
00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:16.367
From here all your rooms are in view.

117
00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:18.867
If that monster should appears again,

118
00:07:18.867 --> 00:07:20.567
we can all chase it away together.

119
00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:23.467
Rather, why are you here with us, village head?

120
00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:25.267
Stay put in your room.

121
00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:28.567
Leave the rest to us.

122
00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:31.067
No can do. Although I was asked to do so,

123
00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:34.267
I'm the one who invited all of you over.

124
00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:36.867
I must see that you all stay safe as the village head.

125
00:07:36.867 --> 00:07:40.967
Well... Then, will you tell me about it?

126
00:07:40.967 --> 00:07:42.467
Tell you what?

127
00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:44.367
The reason why you invited the four people.

128
00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:48.867
Wasn't it written in the letter from that somebody?

129
00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:50.467
Yeah.

130
00:07:50.467 --> 00:07:53.667
Mr. Michiki Tanzawa, the archaeologist

131
00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:54.867
is very knowledgeable

132
00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:57.067
about the geological features of Shizuoka Prefecture here.

133
00:07:57.067 --> 00:08:01.067
It seems he's inspected this area sometime in the past too.

134
00:08:01.067 --> 00:08:02.567
He not only excavates ruins in Shizuoka Prefecture,

135
00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:03.767
but does so nationwide.

136
00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:05.667
Until several years ago,

137
00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:08.467
he was well-known as a commentator

138
00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:11.467
for TV Specials having to do with ruins.

139
00:08:11.467 --> 00:08:14.767
Well, but after he was suspected of excavating fake earthenware,

140
00:08:14.767 --> 00:08:17.967
he stopped making public appearances.

141
00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:20.767
Then, what about that lady novelist?

142
00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.167
You don't know Fumie Masuko?

143
00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:28.167
She's famous for writing bizarre novels in which monsters appear.

144
00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:30.567
Because she writes such stories,

145
00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:33.067
she's very knowledgeable about Japanese monster stories.

146
00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:36.267
If she feels that the image is not right during dramas and such,

147
00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:38.867
I hear there were times she'd have them change the location

148
00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:41.367
or repaint the color of the house that is used.

149
00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:44.167
Since she graduated from an art university,

150
00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:46.267
I can see that tends to be picky though.

151
00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:51.667
That has nothing to do with the hidden treasures of Tokugawa.

152
00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:53.967
In the letter it said, if the hidden treasures won't do,

153
00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:57.767
revitalize the village using the Nue.

154
00:08:57.767 --> 00:08:59.867
But...

155
00:08:59.867 --> 00:09:03.267
The reportage writer isn't famous, is he?

156
00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:04.967
That's right.

157
00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:07.867
The murdered victim, Mr. Yasukatsu Someji

158
00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:09.767
was a historian knowledgeable

159
00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:12.267
about the hidden treasures of Tokugawa.

160
00:09:13.867 --> 00:09:17.267
Mr. Hajime Tsurumi is a novice reportage writer

161
00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:18.967
who goes throughout the country pursuing monster stories.

162
00:09:18.967 --> 00:09:21.167
That's all that was written about him in the letter.

163
00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:23.767
I don't know why he was invited either.

164
00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:33.067
But, why weren't the survivors of the cave-in accident invited?

165
00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:34.467
That way, you could've asked in more detail

166
00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:36.467
about what happened back then, right?

167
00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:39.867
That's because they seem to have disappeared

168
00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:42.167
since that accident.

169
00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:44.567
We don't even know their names.

170
00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:48.467
Then, why did you invite Heiji over?

171
00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:52.067
The fact is, it was written in the letter

172
00:09:52.067 --> 00:09:54.267
to call the renown detective, Kogoro Mouri,

173
00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:58.167
but too much money was spent on renovating this hotel.

174
00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:00.367
At first, we were thinking of inviting

175
00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:02.467
Mr. Shinichi Kudo of Tokyo over,

176
00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:03.867
but we couldn't get a hold of him.

177
00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:07.967
So we invited Mr. Hattori from Osaka.

178
00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:11.467
Hey, you mean I came in place of Pops and you?

179
00:10:11.467 --> 00:10:12.667
Sorry.

180
00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:15.567
Come to think of it, it said in the letter

181
00:10:15.567 --> 00:10:19.567
that I could also bring my girlfriend with me,

182
00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:21.467
but was that also written in the letter

183
00:10:21.467 --> 00:10:22.767
that you got from that somebody?

184
00:10:22.767 --> 00:10:23.767
Yes.

185
00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:26.367
In the letter it said to make sure

186
00:10:26.367 --> 00:10:29.267
to call Mr. Mouri's daughter over too.

187
00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:30.767
Because it would be more pleasing to the eye

188
00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:32.467
to have young girls perform in the video

189
00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:34.367
for revitalizing the village.

190
00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.267
Well, I guess all is well.

191
00:10:37.267 --> 00:10:41.067
And, the trees in front of the hotel...

192
00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:44.667
why is only the one on the very left of the hotel a different species?

193
00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:47.767
See. The other trees in front of the hotel

194
00:10:47.767 --> 00:10:50.367
all have pointed tips

195
00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:52.367
but only one of the trees is different, right?

196
00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:56.867
I wonder I haven't been here for a while too.

197
00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:01.267
What's this?

198
00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:03.067
The burnt ruins of this stick.

199
00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:05.167
Something that looks like a cloth is stuck to it.

200
00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:09.167
Was something like this in front of the hotel?

201
00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.267
Who knows?

202
00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:11.667
Hey!

203
00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.667
You guys are making so much noise!

204
00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:15.367
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:18.667
I was thinking of taking a nap before the police got here.

206
00:11:18.667 --> 00:11:22.367
But you guys are making so much noise that I can't sleep!

207
00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:24.967
Doesn't bother me.

208
00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:28.567
After all I'm only a novice reportage writer

209
00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:30.767
who was invited among all of you famous people.

210
00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:33.167
I've got to keep my antenna up to par without sleeping a wink

211
00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:35.267
if I want to write a good reportage.

212
00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:39.567
Besides, who knows when that monster will show up again.

213
00:11:45.067 --> 00:11:46.967
It's the cry again.

214
00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:48.367
Where on earth is it coming from?

215
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:50.667
What?

216
00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:51.867
What's with that fire?

217
00:11:51.867 --> 00:11:54.067
Beats me. It broke out just like that.

218
00:12:02.567 --> 00:12:03.867
It's Nue.

219
00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:06.967
That monster's come again.

220
00:12:21.034 --> 00:12:22.134
It's Nue.

221
00:12:22.134 --> 00:12:25.334
That monster's come again.

222
00:12:29.234 --> 00:12:31.534
What was that scream?

223
00:12:31.534 --> 00:12:34.634
It sounded like Mr. Tanzawa upstairs.

224
00:12:34.634 --> 00:12:37.434
Which means it's the room where we originally were.

225
00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:39.034
The room on the very left of the third floor.

226
00:12:40.134 --> 00:12:41.234
Oh, hey.

227
00:12:41.234 --> 00:12:43.334
You can't go in without a spare key.

228
00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:55.434
Mr. Tanzawa! What's up?

229
00:12:55.434 --> 00:12:57.134
Hey! Mr. Tanzawa?

230
00:12:57.134 --> 00:12:58.534
Please move out of the way.

231
00:12:58.534 --> 00:12:59.734
The key...

232
00:13:01.434 --> 00:13:02.834
Mr. Tanzawa, I'm coming in.

233
00:13:10.034 --> 00:13:12.334
No good, he's already dead.

234
00:13:15.434 --> 00:13:16.534
Under his chin...

235
00:13:16.534 --> 00:13:18.134
there are two red spots.

236
00:13:19.434 --> 00:13:21.234
Was he bitten by a snake?

237
00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:23.934
Is that the only spare key to this room?

238
00:13:23.934 --> 00:13:25.734
Yes.

239
00:13:25.734 --> 00:13:28.834
Which means this room is a locked room...

240
00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:33.234
Hey. Don't tell me it really exists.

241
00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:35.434
The monster called Nue.

242
00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:45.234
Everyone, thank you so much for waiting.

243
00:13:45.234 --> 00:13:46.734
I'm Sango Yokomizo

244
00:13:46.734 --> 00:13:48.434
from Shizuoka Prefectural Police Department.

245
00:13:48.434 --> 00:13:49.534
According to the report,

246
00:13:49.534 --> 00:13:52.634
it seems that you witnessed a huge monster.

247
00:13:52.634 --> 00:13:55.234
Now that I'm here, you'll all be fine.

248
00:13:55.234 --> 00:13:58.834
I shall protect all of you from that monster.

249
00:13:58.834 --> 00:14:02.334
Two people have already died, though.

250
00:14:02.334 --> 00:14:05.634
Well, it's probably just some trick or something, though.

251
00:14:05.634 --> 00:14:08.734
Will you tell me of the circumstances

252
00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:10.634
when you witnessed that monster?

253
00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:15.534
It cried an eerie neighing like cry

254
00:14:15.534 --> 00:14:18.534
then we saw the grass in front of the hotel up in flames.

255
00:14:18.534 --> 00:14:20.534
We all went outside

256
00:14:20.534 --> 00:14:22.334
and saw from the other side of the wall...

257
00:14:22.334 --> 00:14:24.334
It appeared on all fours.

258
00:14:24.334 --> 00:14:28.334
A monster huge enough to reach the second floor window.

259
00:14:29.534 --> 00:14:30.634
And?

260
00:14:30.634 --> 00:14:34.934
Did you see a thin fishing line on top of that monster?

261
00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:37.734
-We didn't see anything like that. -Yeah.

262
00:14:37.734 --> 00:14:38.834
I see.

263
00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:41.934
It in fact bit the sign board that was in front...

264
00:14:41.934 --> 00:14:44.334
Pulled it out and took it away.

265
00:14:44.334 --> 00:14:47.534
It pulled the sign board out and took it away?

266
00:14:47.534 --> 00:14:50.534
Was that sign board about 30 cm?

267
00:14:50.534 --> 00:14:52.734
This is that sign board!

268
00:14:52.734 --> 00:14:56.434
"Stay out, danger!" -See the teeth marks here?

269
00:14:56.434 --> 00:14:59.434
It sure is large, isn't it?

270
00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:01.334
This sign board was on the ground

271
00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.934
in the direction that the monster fled off to.

272
00:15:03.934 --> 00:15:06.234
The blood that was dripping from the sign board

273
00:15:06.234 --> 00:15:08.234
led all the way to the rim of the lake.

274
00:15:08.234 --> 00:15:10.534
So we followed it...

275
00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:14.234
And found historian Mr. Someji dead.

276
00:15:14.234 --> 00:15:17.934
He had lacerations on his back that looked like claw marks.

277
00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:21.534
Claw marks like that of a cat?

278
00:15:21.534 --> 00:15:24.334
This is the picture we took of the corpse.

279
00:15:24.334 --> 00:15:28.234
There's a space of about 10 cm between each claw mark, right?

280
00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:29.934
It can't be a cat, right?

281
00:15:29.934 --> 00:15:32.534
You're right.

282
00:15:32.534 --> 00:15:35.934
That's why I told everybody to stay put in their rooms

283
00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:38.434
until police got here.

284
00:15:38.434 --> 00:15:41.134
Just in case, I had them give me their cell phones

285
00:15:41.134 --> 00:15:42.934
because it can create sounds.

286
00:15:42.934 --> 00:15:46.334
So, the village head, Heiji and I went outside

287
00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:50.334
to stand guard around the area that the monster appeared.

288
00:15:50.334 --> 00:15:54.234
Then we heard a neighing cry again,

289
00:15:54.234 --> 00:15:57.734
then the fire that we just put out suddenly broke out again,

290
00:15:57.734 --> 00:16:00.034
and the flames got larger and larger.

291
00:16:00.034 --> 00:16:01.334
While we were all taken by surprise,

292
00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:03.334
we heard the archaeologist Mr. Tanzawa

293
00:16:03.334 --> 00:16:05.034
who was in the corner room of the third floor

294
00:16:05.034 --> 00:16:07.434
groan a deadly groan and went over.

295
00:16:07.434 --> 00:16:09.434
When we went over to his room,

296
00:16:09.434 --> 00:16:12.934
we found him murdered in a locked room.

297
00:16:12.934 --> 00:16:14.534
This time he had bite marks

298
00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:17.134
that looked to be that of a snake's under his chin.

299
00:16:17.134 --> 00:16:18.834
Come to think of it,

300
00:16:18.834 --> 00:16:20.234
when that monster fled,

301
00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:22.334
I happened to see its tail.

302
00:16:22.334 --> 00:16:23.534
Yes, that's right.

303
00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:25.434
It looked like a snake, didn't it?

304
00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:26.434
Yes.

305
00:16:26.434 --> 00:16:28.234
The tail, a snake?

306
00:16:28.234 --> 00:16:31.034
I'm sure you've heard about it too, Inspector?

307
00:16:31.034 --> 00:16:32.434
Possessing the head of a monkey,

308
00:16:32.434 --> 00:16:34.734
body of a badger, paws and legs of a tiger

309
00:16:34.734 --> 00:16:35.934
and the tail of a snake.

310
00:16:35.934 --> 00:16:38.934
The story of a beast called Nue.

311
00:16:38.934 --> 00:16:39.934
Nue?

312
00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:43.034
The legendary monster that lets out an eerie cry

313
00:16:43.034 --> 00:16:45.434
and appears along with black smoke.

314
00:16:45.434 --> 00:16:46.734
Legendary?

315
00:16:46.734 --> 00:16:48.334
Don't tell me you don't know about it?

316
00:16:48.334 --> 00:16:50.334
Please calm down, will you?

317
00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:55.934
You're all talking as if that monster has revived or something

318
00:16:55.934 --> 00:17:00.034
but it actually existed here in this Kurogane Forest.

319
00:17:00.034 --> 00:17:02.334
The beast called Nue.

320
00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:03.834
-What? -What?

321
00:17:03.834 --> 00:17:07.834
There was an eye-witness report 16 years ago too, wasn't there?

322
00:17:07.834 --> 00:17:10.434
Of a Nue.

323
00:17:10.434 --> 00:17:12.134
Yes.

324
00:17:12.134 --> 00:17:15.634
A foreigner on the excavation team

325
00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:17.634
was trapped in a cave-in

326
00:17:17.634 --> 00:17:21.634
and wrote the word Nue before he died.

327
00:17:21.634 --> 00:17:24.234
But I've already told them about that...

328
00:17:24.234 --> 00:17:26.334
See, just like I said.

329
00:17:26.334 --> 00:17:31.634
Nue's been hiding in this forest for 16 years!

330
00:17:31.634 --> 00:17:33.134
Hey, Kudo.

331
00:17:33.134 --> 00:17:34.234
This inspector is not much different

332
00:17:34.234 --> 00:17:36.734
from the klutz at the Gunma Prefectural police.

333
00:17:36.734 --> 00:17:38.134
You can say that again.

334
00:17:38.134 --> 00:17:39.634
At any rate!

335
00:17:39.634 --> 00:17:43.434
We, the police will protect all of you.

336
00:17:43.434 --> 00:17:46.834
So please stay in in a room and wait till further notice.

337
00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:52.234
I will contact my superiors to see

338
00:17:52.234 --> 00:17:54.134
is we can mobilize the self-defense force.

339
00:17:55.434 --> 00:17:58.534
I thought it was going to rain,

340
00:17:58.534 --> 00:18:00.234
but it hasn't yet.

341
00:18:00.234 --> 00:18:01.934
What?

342
00:18:01.934 --> 00:18:04.934
Well, the second time the grass caught fire,

343
00:18:04.934 --> 00:18:07.534
a raindrop fell on my cheek

344
00:18:07.534 --> 00:18:10.434
along with a sizzling sound like

345
00:18:10.434 --> 00:18:14.634
that of the cap of a carbonated drink being opened.

346
00:18:14.634 --> 00:18:16.234
Carbonated drink?

347
00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:18.434
It wasn't me.

348
00:18:18.434 --> 00:18:22.034
I did ask for carbonated soda

349
00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:25.234
so that I could make sizzling wine,

350
00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:28.234
but if I poured it out the window,

351
00:18:28.234 --> 00:18:31.734
the village head wouldn't have been the only one who got wet.

352
00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:34.934
Besides, I wouldn't do something

353
00:18:34.934 --> 00:18:36.934
as low-class as to drink near the window like him

354
00:18:36.934 --> 00:18:39.034
Well, sorry I'm low-class

355
00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:42.134
because I was abandoned by my parents when I was a kid.

356
00:18:42.134 --> 00:18:44.834
I wasn't raised properly.

357
00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:47.634
But, that water wasn't me either.

358
00:18:47.634 --> 00:18:51.034
Because no matter how much I shook the coke from my room,

359
00:18:51.034 --> 00:18:53.534
it wouldn't have reached the village head.

360
00:18:53.534 --> 00:18:55.134
Heiji.

361
00:18:57.234 --> 00:18:58.434
Look.

362
00:18:59.534 --> 00:19:04.134
There are small round clumps all over the grass.

363
00:19:04.134 --> 00:19:05.134
Hey!

364
00:19:05.134 --> 00:19:07.934
If this is what I think it is,

365
00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:10.334
no match or lighter would've been needed to...

366
00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:12.334
Light a fire, right?

367
00:19:12.334 --> 00:19:15.134
If so, all we need to figure out now

368
00:19:15.134 --> 00:19:17.834
is the trick of that humongous monster...

369
00:19:17.834 --> 00:19:20.934
And the poisoning in the locked room.

370
00:19:22.634 --> 00:19:24.634
First of all, the locked room.

371
00:19:24.634 --> 00:19:26.534
Mr. Tanzawa who was poisoned to death

372
00:19:26.534 --> 00:19:29.534
moved into the room at the very left on the third floor

373
00:19:29.534 --> 00:19:31.334
where we originally were, right?

374
00:19:31.334 --> 00:19:32.434
Yeah.

375
00:19:32.434 --> 00:19:34.134
Based on the position of the rooms,

376
00:19:34.134 --> 00:19:35.634
the most suspicious would be

377
00:19:35.634 --> 00:19:38.134
Ms. Masuko who was right below him

378
00:19:38.134 --> 00:19:39.834
because if Mr. Tanzawa who was surprised by the fire,

379
00:19:39.834 --> 00:19:42.034
stuck his head out of the window,

380
00:19:42.034 --> 00:19:43.934
she could've used a long stick with a poisoned needle on the tip

381
00:19:43.934 --> 00:19:45.734
and struck him with it, right?

382
00:19:46.834 --> 00:19:48.334
Since for some reason,

383
00:19:48.334 --> 00:19:50.834
only one side of the window would open in that room,

384
00:19:50.834 --> 00:19:52.434
she could've have known beforehand

385
00:19:52.434 --> 00:19:54.334
where Mr. Tanazawa would stick his face out.

386
00:19:54.334 --> 00:19:58.734
But when we went to get Ms. Masuko's cell phone,

387
00:19:58.734 --> 00:20:02.034
she let us check her room,

388
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.734
but there was no stick or the like inside.

389
00:20:04.734 --> 00:20:05.834
Yeah.

390
00:20:05.834 --> 00:20:08.534
The only objects of interest were...

391
00:20:08.534 --> 00:20:13.234
the two 1L bottles of carbonated soda,

392
00:20:13.234 --> 00:20:15.934
a bottle of white wine, a wine glass,

393
00:20:15.934 --> 00:20:17.434
and a sommelier knife that she asked the village head for.

394
00:20:17.434 --> 00:20:20.034
As well as a ball pen and stationery

395
00:20:20.034 --> 00:20:22.334
that she had in her bag together with paper tape,

396
00:20:22.334 --> 00:20:26.934
a sewing set and a notebook.

397
00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:30.134
Then, how about that reportage writer?

398
00:20:30.134 --> 00:20:32.734
When Mr. Tanzawa moved to our room,

399
00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:36.734
he also moved to the room next door on the third floor.

400
00:20:36.734 --> 00:20:41.434
Maybe only one side of the window of the room opened

401
00:20:41.434 --> 00:20:43.634
so that it wouldn't block the writer

402
00:20:43.634 --> 00:20:46.234
from blowing a poisoned blow dart at Mr. Tanzawa.

403
00:20:46.234 --> 00:20:49.734
But, the windows of both rooms

404
00:20:49.734 --> 00:20:56.234
were about 10 m apart with one window between them,

405
00:20:56.234 --> 00:20:59.234
and he couldn't have shot Mr. Tanazawa under the chin from the side.

406
00:20:59.234 --> 00:21:02.734
Besides, Mr. Tsurumi didn't have a blowpipe.

407
00:21:02.734 --> 00:21:04.334
Right.

408
00:21:04.334 --> 00:21:06.834
The things we found in his room were...

409
00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:11.334
three 500 ml PET bottles of coke,

410
00:21:11.334 --> 00:21:13.434
two bags of potato chips,

411
00:21:13.434 --> 00:21:15.734
a folded knife, a selfie stick,

412
00:21:15.734 --> 00:21:17.934
cigarettes and a lighter

413
00:21:17.934 --> 00:21:22.334
and a plastic model kit that he said he bought to kill time.

414
00:21:22.334 --> 00:21:25.434
He went out of his way to buy himself some glue too.

415
00:21:25.434 --> 00:21:28.534
Well, he didn't have anything

416
00:21:28.534 --> 00:21:30.434
that he could've used to poison someone.

417
00:21:30.434 --> 00:21:33.934
The only one left, is the village head but...

418
00:21:33.934 --> 00:21:37.134
The only thing he had was a deck brush.

419
00:21:39.834 --> 00:21:42.334
What're you guys doing there?

420
00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:44.934
Weren't you told to stay put in your rooms?

421
00:21:44.934 --> 00:21:48.434
But, we were worried about the doggie.

422
00:21:48.434 --> 00:21:51.534
When the Nue cried a while ago,

423
00:21:51.534 --> 00:21:55.934
the dog barked and we heard it scratching the wall.

424
00:21:55.934 --> 00:21:59.534
We thought that maybe it was hungry and wanted to leave the room.

425
00:21:59.534 --> 00:22:02.834
So, we made it some dog food in the kitchen and brought it over but...

426
00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:04.934
It wouldn't eat at all.

427
00:22:06.134 --> 00:22:09.734
Now that you mentioned it, the first time the Nue cried...

428
00:22:09.734 --> 00:22:11.734
The dog barked.

429
00:22:12.934 --> 00:22:16.134
But when that monster appeared...

430
00:22:16.134 --> 00:22:17.834
It didn't bark!

431
00:22:18.834 --> 00:22:20.934
So, that's what it was.

432
00:22:20.934 --> 00:22:23.834
I'm beginning to see the picture.

433
00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:26.434
And, the only one who could've carried this out is...

434
00:22:26.434 --> 00:22:28.734
None other than...

435
00:23:54.734 --> 00:23:57.534
"Next Episode" -We're going to lure...

436
00:23:57.534 --> 00:23:59.834
That beast out one more time.

437
00:23:59.834 --> 00:24:01.734
That's impossible...

438
00:24:04.134 --> 00:24:05.634
This is...

439
00:24:05.634 --> 00:24:08.534
the cry of the Nue.

440
00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:17.134
Heiji, where are you?

441
00:24:17.134 --> 00:24:18.734
Help!

442
00:24:18.734 --> 00:24:20.334
Next Conan,

443
00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:24.334
"Conan and Heiji's Nue Legend (Solved Edition)"

444
00:24:24.877 --> 00:24:26.977
Next Conan's Hint:

445
00:24:26.977 --> 00:24:29.277
"PET bottle"

446
00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:30.677
-We're afraid of the Nue. -We're afraid of the Nue.

447
00:24:30.677 --> 00:24:32.377
-What about the Self-Defense Force? -Well, just wait and see.

448
00:24:32.377 --> 00:24:33.977
We'll extinguish the flames of the case.
