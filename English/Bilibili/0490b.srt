1
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:05,822
What? Mr. Minowa, the actor committed suicide?

2
00:00:05,822 --> 00:00:07,624
Is that true, Heiji?

3
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:09,225
Don't talk too loud!

4
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,727
It still hasn't been publicized.

5
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,629
But, how'd something like that happen?

6
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:14,698
Beats me, I don't know yet.

7
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,100
It's dubious whether it's really suicide or not, too.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,302
It's the same as the incident that occurred 4 years ago.

9
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:22,105
Then, isn't it suicide?

10
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,908
That's why I came to confirm it on video.

11
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:29,112
How is it? Did you find anything, Heiji?

12
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:33,416
Just as I thought. This is homicide.

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:36,720
That video is sure popular.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,721
Popular?

15
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:39,723
There was another person

16
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:42,826
who asked to see that video besides you.

17
00:00:42,826 --> 00:00:45,028
Don't tell me that he was an intermediate school student too?

18
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:47,297
Yes, one of them was.

19
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,199
One of them? You mean there were others?

20
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,501
Way before that boy came...

21
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,704
A dandy man with a mustache came.

22
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,806
A man with a mustache?

23
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:00,410
Another Snow Woman legend...

24
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,612
Is that the hint for solving the incident?

25
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:03,913
Well, as for the questions,

26
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:06,516
ask me after you hear me out.

27
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:09,819
Long time ago, on a stormy blizzard night,

28
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,322
there was a man named Shigekichi,

29
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,325
who was rushing back home from these mountains.

30
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,826
Part way home,

31
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:22,298
he ran into a long haired, beautiful woman wearing a silver kimono.

32
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:27,404
The woman lifted her head, and said with pleading eyes...

33
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:29,906
I sprained my ankle while walking along the mountain path

34
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:32,509
and can walk no farther.

35
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,513
Will you please take me to my house?

36
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,616
When Shigekichi asks her where her house is,

37
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:44,621
the woman silently points a dark forest where there is no road.

38
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:48,425
But, no matter how far he walks,

39
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:50,727
only the snow gets deeper and there is no house anywhere in sight.

40
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:53,396
Therefore, the man finally asks the woman...

41
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:56,599
Is this the right road?

42
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,202
The woman nods without saying a word.

43
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:04,307
The woman was waiting for the man to throw her down.

44
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:07,110
Yes. Because the identity of the woman

45
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,714
was "Snow Woman" who would eat the soul of the man

46
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,217
when he ran out of strength.

47
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,920
The man's steps eventually become slow.

48
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,721
After a while, the mouth of the woman

49
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,624
who had been silent up to now slightly moves.

50
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,226
Young lady.

51
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,428
The woman smiles as if she had been waiting

52
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,797
for the time to come and answers.

53
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:30,500
Yes, what is it?

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,602
Shigekichi is heaving heavily

55
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:35,205
but squeezes out what he has to say...

56
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:37,107
Aren't you cold?

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,211
The woman is flustered by the man's unexpected question,

58
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,413
and is at a loss for words.

59
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,216
Shigekichi endures the cold and exhaustion he feels

60
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:49,919
and walks on with all his might.

61
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,023
"Isn't it clustered inside the basket? Aren't you hungry?"

62
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:55,925
He tells her that there's only a little more to go,

63
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,828
so to hang in there.

64
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,698
Although the woman answers him,

65
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,200
her voice gets weaker and weaker.

66
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,903
Then, finally her voice is not heard.

67
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:09,906
Shigekichi gets worried and stops.

68
00:03:09,906 --> 00:03:13,409
He puts the basket down and looks inside.

69
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,411
The woman is nowhere in sight.

70
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:20,917
But a large amount of snow was found wrapped in a silver cloth.

71
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:24,721
I see. Shigekichi's warm heart

72
00:03:24,721 --> 00:03:27,924
melted the cold Snow Woman's heart.

73
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:31,327
-Yeah. -And, so what's the hint?

74
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:34,697
So I guess the load is too heavy for you, after all.

75
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,099
But, for him,

76
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,201
I guess it would be a good problem solving exercise.

77
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,503
-Him? -I'm sure that he's watching the movie

78
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:43,606
that Mr. Minowa appeared in at the hotel right now,

79
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:45,608
being that he's our son.

80
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:48,812
See, it's just as I thought.

81
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,714
Mr. Minowa's style of skiing that we saw this afternoon

82
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,016
is different from his style of skiing in the movie, right?

83
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,117
You think so?

84
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,119
I think they're both good, like that of a professional.

85
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:59,222
That's how people evaluate his skiing.

86
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,323
Take a look at this scene

87
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,326
where Mr. Minowa comes to rescue the heroine.

88
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,896
He comes skiing from the top until he frames out...

89
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:08,698
See, his cap strap is on.

90
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,600
But after he frames in again

91
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,002
when he carries her up, it's not on anymore.

92
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,004
And it's supposed to be a cut that is connected.

93
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,005
True.

94
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,607
Don't tell me that he's using a double.

95
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:21,010
-Maybe he can't ski? -No way.

96
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,113
He was skiing just a while ago and it was awesome!

97
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:26,015
Was it really him?

98
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,517
Of course.

99
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,519
I filmed it on video.

100
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,224
-See. -Hey, Sonoko.

101
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,925
While Mr. Minowa was skiing his way here,

102
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:38,728
do you know where he had this bag?

103
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:41,798
Mr. Minowa put it in front of his fans himself.

104
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,399
He told them to watch it for him until he got back

105
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:46,202
because he had important things inside it.

106
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,904
What? This bag?

107
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:49,806
An intermediate school boy came to look at it?

108
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,208
-When was that? -Just now.

109
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,410
He didn't buy it though.

110
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,012
If that's too small,

111
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:59,415
we have one with the same design a size larger.

112
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:00,617
Is that right?

113
00:05:00,617 --> 00:05:03,519
The belt stretches this much and it's quite convenient.

114
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,821
True.

115
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:06,522
What's so convenient.

116
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:08,625
Hey, Heiji. What're you angry about?

117
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,226
It's only natural.

118
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,997
Some intermediate school kid is one step ahead of me each time.

119
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:16,799
He borrowed the video from the hotel before I did,

120
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:19,502
and a queer mustached man also seems involved.

121
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:22,605
If things go as is, they'll solve the case before I do.

122
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:25,308
Which means that you still have no idea, Heiji?

123
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:28,611
I do. I know who the killer is and the method that was used.

124
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,813
I found out when we went to that store a while ago.

125
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:33,316
Then, why not report it to the police right away?

126
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:35,118
But there's something I can't solve.

127
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,020
The loops on the poles that were on upside down

128
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,123
and the reason the bag was filled with snow.

129
00:05:40,123 --> 00:05:43,726
My deduction cannot be proven unless I solve these problems.

130
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:45,328
What is it, Shizuka?

131
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:49,299
I thought I told you not to make private calls to me at work.

132
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,100
What, a case?

133
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:55,305
-I found it! This is it! -What's that?

134
00:05:55,305 --> 00:06:00,310
Remember the gunshot like noise that Mr. Minowa might've heard

135
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,412
before reaching the top on the lift.

136
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:05,515
The fact that this hasn't been retrieved yet,

137
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:08,718
means that the killer is still somewhere unable to make a move.

138
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,722
My, you sound like you know it all already.

139
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,425
No, the most important trick that was used in the murder

140
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:17,327
is still not solved completely.

141
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,528
The scratch that was left

142
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,229
on the left side of the corpse on the lift...

143
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,798
I can't figure out what it is.

144
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,901
I figured out the snow packed bag and the killer,

145
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,302
but they don't connect right.

146
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,304
You've figured out who the killer is?

147
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,406
Yeah. There are four suspects

148
00:06:30,406 --> 00:06:32,508
who are being interrogated by the police now.

149
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:36,112
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa.

150
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,114
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was riding the lift

151
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,916
right behind Mr. Minowa.

152
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,317
Stuntman Mr. Mimata, who was at the ski slope

153
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,820
to call the director and the others.

154
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,023
And Ms. Tateishi who failed to make it off the lift.

155
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:49,625
Wait, I can see that you know where Director Oyama was riding,

156
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:53,896
but how do you know where the other three were riding?

157
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,399
Do your really know who the killer is?

158
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,101
Mrs. Kudo!

159
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,004
I got to hear what the police

160
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,206
was questioning them about, you see.

161
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:05,808
What? But, how, why?

162
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,512
It just so happened that our trip and Shinichi's ski class

163
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,813
coincidentally turned out to be the same place.

164
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:13,015
I mean, you deliberately came here.

165
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,919
But Shinichi, you were 30 minutes late.

166
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,524
An intermediate school boy just like you was here just a while ago.

167
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,327
What?

168
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:28,097
You mean there's another deduction freak just like Shinichi.

169
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,700
That's new to me!

170
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,202
Talking about another, do you know?

171
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,005
About the other Snow Woman legend.

172
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,509
No god, it's pitch dark already.

173
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,612
The killer is being interrogated now and can't move just yet.

174
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:45,314
But if he's released, he will hide the evidence.

175
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:46,616
Heiji!

176
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,117
What is it, Mom?

177
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,720
Rain makes puddles.

178
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,822
But with snow, you can make a snowman.

179
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:56,926
If that becomes ice, a large statue can also be made.

180
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:01,697
But Yusaku says that this is the key to solving the mystery.

181
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,501
Don't let outward appearance fool you.

182
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:07,403
By Heizo.

183
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,805
What's he trying to get at anyway?

184
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:12,008
Why talk about snowmen now?

185
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,609
Heiji?

186
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:24,220
Will you cut it out?

187
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,023
I'm sorry, but can you answer the phone for me?

188
00:08:28,023 --> 00:08:30,025
-It's in the pocket of my coat. -Yes, sir.

189
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,026
Who is it?

190
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:32,928
His hands are tied right now.

191
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,831
I've figured everything out.

192
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:40,536
I've figured out who killed Mr. Minowa under the pretense of suicide.

193
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,537
What?

194
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:44,240
As well as the trick that made the murder possible.

195
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,342
-Everything! -Huh?

196
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:48,511
An intermediate school boy again.

197
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:50,513
I'll bet you want to say that all four of us

198
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:53,716
were capable of shooting Mr. Minowa, right?

199
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:56,519
Like I said before, it's impossible for us to have done it!

200
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,220
Since he was riding the lift alone,

201
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,523
we couldn't have made him hold the gun.

202
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:04,426
Maybe the ex-cop and now detective could've done it,

203
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:07,229
but we could never aim and shoot at his head

204
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:08,430
in a blizzard like back then.

205
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,834
Hey, hey, even an ex-cop can't do something like that.

206
00:09:11,834 --> 00:09:14,537
Because the blizzard was so bad

207
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:16,138
that you couldn't even see the lift in front of you.

208
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,640
True.

209
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,510
Murder would've been impossible in that situation

210
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,015
if Mr. Minowa was really riding the lift alone.

211
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:29,718
What?

212
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:31,720
Hey, hey, don't tell me that

213
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,924
you're going to say that somebody was inside that bag?

214
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:37,927
But that bag was packed with snow,

215
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,129
and no adult would've possibly been inside.

216
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:43,933
No, no, a bag this size was inside.

217
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:47,736
The same kind of bag that is one size larger

218
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:49,738
and of the same design was sold at the shop of the hotel.

219
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,840
It can't be.

220
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,511
Are you saying that Mr. Minowa was carrying a bag

221
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,413
with the killer inside it when he got on the lift?

222
00:09:57,413 --> 00:10:00,516
No, the one who was in the bag wasn't the killer,

223
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,718
but Mr. Minowa himself.

224
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,720
No, that can't be!

225
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,622
Then, the person who was carrying the bag was?

226
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:08,624
The killer.

227
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:11,627
Most of Mr. Minowa's face is hidden by his hair,

228
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:14,730
and he was wearing sunglasses back then.

229
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,332
If someone else were to wear a wig, a knitted cap,

230
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,034
sunglasses and ski wear,

231
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:21,937
people would be deluded to think it were Mr. Minowa.

232
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:26,242
But he talked to me and his fans.

233
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:29,111
It was Mr. Minowa's voice, of course.

234
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:32,615
-How? -That's because Mr. Minowa himself

235
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:37,019
was listening closely from inside the bag and responding to everyone.

236
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:42,324
That's why everybody thought that he disguised killer was Minowa.

237
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,827
-Oh no... -I see.

238
00:10:44,827 --> 00:10:49,431
That's why he was silent until he carried that bag.

239
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,933
You've got to be kidding.

240
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:55,437
A person as proud as he, would never go inside a bag.

241
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,639
That's probably because...

242
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,340
He was a proud person.

243
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,142
That's why he went inside.

244
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:03,212
The fact that his skiing was of a professional level

245
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:06,315
was just a front and fake.

246
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,017
It was probably all a lie.

247
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,718
A lie?

248
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:12,221
I guess he could ski a bit,

249
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:14,223
but not good enough like a professional.

250
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:16,525
I watched the movie, that Mr. Minowa appeared in,

251
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:20,329
"The Snow Woman's Love" and the "Mystery of Snow Woman"

252
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:21,830
back at the hotel a while ago.

253
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,633
Then there was a scene where he ran over to the heroine on skis

254
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:29,238
and framed out once. Then he zoomed back into the scene.

255
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:32,541
Moreover, when he was skiing, the cap trap was on.

256
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,910
When he zoomed, it wasn't there.

257
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,914
This means that someone else skied for him.

258
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,116
Isn't that right, director?

259
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:44,920
Yeah. It wasn't that he couldn't ski,

260
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,324
but he hurt his leg in the first movie.

261
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:52,328
But he insisted on skiing himself,

262
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:55,631
so in order to persuade him, I secretly used a stuntman in his place.

263
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,835
That ski scene was ironically evaluated highly.

264
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:03,339
So, I used a stuntman secretly in the 2nd movie, too.

265
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:04,540
You did?

266
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,042
That's why, when the fans asked him to ski,

267
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,111
he let his substitute ski for him

268
00:12:09,111 --> 00:12:11,714
and went into the bag and waited below.

269
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:14,216
Then, when his substitute came and carried the bag,

270
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:18,120
he conversed with the fans to act out his role.

271
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,723
Hey, hold it.

272
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:23,525
Don't tell me that the substitute is...

273
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,028
Yeah. The one who had that role,

274
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:30,432
carried the bag that Mr. Minowa was inside, and killed him is...

275
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,839
Stuntman, Mr. Mimata!

276
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,041
No one else but you could've done it.

277
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,810
-Mr. Mimata? -Is it true?

278
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,113
But I think that the one who did the stunt

279
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:48,817
for the movie 4 years ago was the late Mr. Mizukami,

280
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:52,221
because the skiing in the movie and today's skiing was different.

281
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,623
It's most likely that before Mr. Mizukami died,

282
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,726
Mr. Mimata secretly took on the role,

283
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:01,630
and he used it to his advantage to carry out the murder on the lift.

284
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,133
Right! He took only Mr. Minowa's head

285
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:07,436
out of the bag on the lift and held it down,

286
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,338
stuck the gun at his temple and fired.

287
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:13,041
He then took Mr. Minowa out of the bag and sat him down

288
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,710
and made him hold the gun.

289
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,614
He then carried the bag and jumped off.

290
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:20,716
There are two places where the space

291
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:25,120
between the lift and the ground is only about 3 meters.

292
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,023
The scratch that was found on the seat of the lift

293
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:30,325
was one that was made when he shot Mr. Minowa.

294
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:34,029
And the fact that Mr. Minowa was sitting on the left when on the lift,

295
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,932
but was found sitting on the right side when found dead

296
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:39,935
is evidence that this is what actually happened.

297
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,737
It sure is difficult

298
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,040
to shift the position of a dead person on a lift.

299
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,042
But, when the gunshot was heard,

300
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:49,011
Mr. Mimata was talking to me.

301
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,413
That was probably the sound of a rocket fire cracker.

302
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,015
After he wore the ski wear

303
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:55,517
that he had ready by the place he got off the lift,

304
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,619
he probably ignited the fuse of the rocket fire cracker

305
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,822
with a lighted cigarette and poked it into a PET bottle.

306
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:02,124
He fired it shifting the time a bit to make a witness for his alibi,

307
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:08,730
by skiing down and talking to somebody when the sound is heard.

308
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,733
But, where did he get the bag that was packed with snow?

309
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,936
I just said that there are two places

310
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,239
where that lift is only 3 meters away from the ground.

311
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,641
That's where the bag with the upside down ski pole

312
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,611
hooked onto it was place, and later carried up to the lift.

313
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,214
I see. 3 meters to the ground...

314
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:28,317
Ski poles are approximately 1 meter and 20 centimeters.

315
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,919
If the string one side is hooked on to the other pole and connected,

316
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,522
stretching over for it may make it reachable,

317
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:36,325
but would it be possible to pick it up in that blizzard?

318
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:39,228
No, no! Only one ski pole was used,

319
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:41,029
and the remaining 1 meter...

320
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:44,133
was made by wetting the string of the cloth bag

321
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,435
with water and freezing it.

322
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:49,238
That's how the remaining one meter was compensated for.

323
00:14:49,238 --> 00:14:51,640
The loops of both poles were upside down

324
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,942
because just one being upside down would draw attention.

325
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:57,412
But I wonder if you can see that bag from on top the lift?

326
00:14:57,412 --> 00:14:59,014
I mean the blizzard was so bad

327
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,215
that even the lift ahead couldn't be seen, right?

328
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,818
Did you know that the space between one lift and the other

329
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,320
has to be more than 6 seconds apart?

330
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,222
The speed at which a lift moves

331
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:09,825
is from 1.5 meters to 2 meters per second,

332
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,127
which means that the space between one lift and the other

333
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,129
is about 10 meters apart.

334
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:16,331
Even if it is hard to something that is 10 meters apart,

335
00:15:16,331 --> 00:15:19,434
the bag that was only 3 meters apart could easily be seen.

336
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:22,738
More so, if you know that the bag is already there...

337
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,139
But, what proof do you have?

338
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,041
I've got proof, too.

339
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:28,010
If Mr. Mimata met with Ms. Tateishi

340
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,914
and went directly to be interrogated in the lodge,

341
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,216
he still should have it on him.

342
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:39,321
The same ski wear that Mr. Minowa was wearing.

343
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,325
Maybe you even have the bag that Mr. Minowa inside, too?

344
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:47,229
I was enduring all this time.

345
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:49,531
It was so hot.

346
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,133
Mr. Mimata!

347
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,734
So, you the one who did it, after all.

348
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,437
Which means that you knew, director.

349
00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:56,638
Yeah.

350
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:59,942
I thought that your skiing had improved in the end,

351
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:04,313
but when I saw him dead, I realized it was you.

352
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,014
But, why?

353
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:07,916
I avenged the death of Mr. Mizukami

354
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:11,019
who was supposed to become your husband.

355
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:13,922
I killed Minowa using the same trick

356
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,325
that was used to kill Mr. Mizukami 4 years ago.

357
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,726
Just what do you mean?

358
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,429
Remember 4 years ago, that day,

359
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,031
Minowa was troubled surrounded by his fans,

360
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:26,735
Mr. Mizukami said we can work something out.

361
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,236
He meant that

362
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:31,740
he would secretly put Minowa inside a bag and carrying him over.

363
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,711
But Minowa took advantage of Mr. Mizukami's kindness and killed him.

364
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,512
He killed Mr. Mizukami who was planning on quitting his job as a stuntman

365
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:40,015
and become an actor!

366
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:43,318
He told me when I held him at gun point.

367
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,221
There's no way he can make a living as an actor.

368
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:47,322
I'm sure that when he gets desperate,

369
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:49,424
he is going to write a book on me and disclose everything!

370
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:52,327
I guess he was scared.

371
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,729
How ironic

372
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:58,033
that a movie that is just the thing to carry out the revenge is to be shot.

373
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:00,535
The fact is, I too, thought that the killer of the incident

374
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:03,138
that happened 4 years ago was Minowa.

375
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:05,941
That's why I decided to make this movie.

376
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,909
I didn't reveal anything yet,

377
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,411
but the real killer of this movie

378
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,813
was scheduled to be Minowa, who was acting the role of a detective.

379
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,815
The trick used is the same as was used 4 years ago

380
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,817
as Mr. Mimata had just mentioned.

381
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:20,322
I figured that he would give himself in if I showed him the script.

382
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:24,626
I know that it's not for me, who quit being an officer to say,

383
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,528
but if you knew so much,

384
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:30,132
I would've wanted you to prevent this stupid murder.

385
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,334
Revenge only breeds revenge,

386
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:35,237
and the feeling of accomplishment vanishes on the spot...

387
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,939
It's just like the snow that falls onto the palm of your hand.

388
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:47,316
Well, we'll hear you out at the station.

389
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,217
You'll come along too, won't you?

390
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:53,522
Inspector, what about the intermediate school boy on the phone?

391
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:56,325
He is telling of the exact same deduction of as that boy

392
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,428
with the exact same timing.

393
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:02,631
-What? -What?

394
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:06,234
Heiji, why aren't you going with him?

395
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:07,736
Idiot! If I leave,

396
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:10,739
who's going to piggy back you back to the hotel down below?

397
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,140
Doh-doh.

398
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,343
I finally figured out that

399
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,113
the belt of the bag was frozen only after dad dropped me a hint.

400
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,915
That's why as far as the intermediate school boy

401
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:21,516
that solved this case alone,

402
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,518
I don't want to see him.

403
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:24,820
Why not?

404
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,321
Why should I go when you're the one who solved the case?

405
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,323
Take the PET bottle along with you,

406
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:32,327
and tell him that you solved the case by yourself.

407
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,628
I only figured everything out

408
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:35,430
after dad told me the story of the Snow Woman

409
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,734
who pretended that she sprained her leg and went into the basket.

410
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:41,636
That's when I figured out that Mr. Minowa who wanted to pretend

411
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:44,539
that he was a good skier went into the bag himself.

412
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,142
But your deduction was correct, wasn't it?

413
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:50,112
No, this case was solved by the intermediate school boy

414
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,814
who figured everything out himself, not me.

415
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,916
-Hey. -Quiet.

416
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,318
That's what you get for coming along with me,

417
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,619
despite having sprained your leg!

418
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,122
I'll bet you sprained your leg when practicing

419
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:03,024
just so you could brag that you're an advanced skier.

420
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:04,826
Well, thanks to you showing off,

421
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:08,330
I figured out why Mr. Minowa went into the bag right away,

422
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,332
and you also helped with a lot of things

423
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,033
so I guess I'll forgive you.

424
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,936
Idiot. I didn't practice

425
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,839
because I wanted to show everybody how good I was.

426
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:23,311
I wonder why there are two different stories about the Snow Woman?

427
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:27,315
I'll bet it's because the storyteller was a mother.

428
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:29,017
It's said that the folk tale of Snow Woman

429
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:32,921
was created as a warning to people to stay indoors during blizzards,

430
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,924
and while mothers continued telling their children this story,

431
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,927
they began feeling empathy for her

432
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,430
and gradually changed the story.

433
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,633
In other words, it first started as a story

434
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:47,436
of her killing her victims after exchanging her silver clothing,

435
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,639
but it changed to a story in which, she did not take the soul,

436
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,441
but rather, just melted into snow.

437
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,443
That's why the stories of Snow Woman

438
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,212
are sad and sound quite familiar.

439
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,122
I couldn't see very well because of the snow.

440
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,925
But I'll bet it's him that intermediate school boy.

441
00:20:09,925 --> 00:20:12,928
Well, even if I don't see him, if he's a detective...

442
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:15,730
We'll get to see each other one day on some mysterious stage.

443
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:49,257
So, that super intelligent detective left

444
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:52,460
without giving the police his name.

445
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,464
How about it? Unlike the detective that I know before he shrunk,

446
00:21:56,464 --> 00:22:00,168
this guy is intelligent and modest!

447
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:02,871
I mean, you know, that's me.

448
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,821
Next Conan's Hint:

449
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:55,123
"Coin Locker"

450
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,324
This is the closet we get to the Black Organization.

451
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:57,826
Oh, no, Shinichi and we suddenly approach each other rapidly.

452
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:00,128
Why is Conan involved?
