1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,110
Then, isn't it suicide?

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,910
That's why I came to confirm it on video.

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,110
How is it? Did you find anything, Heiji?

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,410
Just as I thought. This is homicide.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,710
That video is sure popular.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,710
Popular?

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,710
There was another person

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,810
who asked to see that video besides you.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,010
Don't tell me that he was an intermediate school student too?

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,310
Yes, one of them was.

11
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,210
One of them? You mean there were others?

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,510
Way before that boy came...

13
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,710
A dandy man with a mustache came.

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,810
A man with a mustache?

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,410
Another Snow Woman legend...

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,610
Is that the hint for solving the incident?

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,910
Well, as for the questions,

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,510
ask me after you hear me out.

19
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,810
Long time ago, on a stormy blizzard night,

20
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,310
there was a man named Shigekichi,

21
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,310
who was rushing back home from these mountains.

22
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,810
Part way home,

23
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:02,310
he ran into a long haired, beautiful woman wearing a silver kimono.

24
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,410
The woman lifted her head, and said with pleading eyes...

25
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,910
I sprained my ankle while walking along the mountain path

26
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,510
and can walk no farther.

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,510
Will you please take me to my house?

28
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,610
When Shigekichi asks her where her house is,

29
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,610
the woman silently points a dark forest where there is no road.

30
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,410
But, no matter how far he walks,

31
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,710
only the snow gets deeper and there is no house anywhere in sight.

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,410
Therefore, the man finally asks the woman...

33
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,610
Is this the right road?

34
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,210
The woman nods without saying a word.

35
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,310
The woman was waiting for the man to throw her down.

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,110
Yes. Because the identity of the woman

37
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,710
was "Snow Woman" who would eat the soul of the man

38
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,210
when he ran out of strength.

39
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,910
The man's steps eventually become slow.

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,710
After a while, the mouth of the woman

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,610
who had been silent up to now slightly moves.

42
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,210
Young lady.

43
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,410
The woman smiles as if she had been waiting

44
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,810
for the time to come and answers.

45
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,510
Yes, what is it?

46
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,610
Shigekichi is heaving heavily

47
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,210
but squeezes out what he has to say...

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,110
Aren't you cold?

49
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,210
The woman is flustered by the man's unexpected question,

50
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,410
and is at a loss for words.

51
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,210
Shigekichi endures the cold and exhaustion he feels

52
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,910
and walks on with all his might.

53
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,010
"Isn't it clustered inside the basket? Aren't you hungry?"

54
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,910
He tells her that there's only a little more to go,

55
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,810
so to hang in there.

56
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,710
Although the woman answers him,

57
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,210
her voice gets weaker and weaker.

58
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,910
Then, finally her voice is not heard.

59
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,910
Shigekichi gets worried and stops.

60
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,410
He puts the basket down and looks inside.

61
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,410
The woman is nowhere in sight.

62
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,910
But a large amount of snow was found wrapped in a silver cloth.

63
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,710
I see. Shigekichi's warm heart

64
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,910
melted the cold Snow Woman's heart.

65
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,310
-Yeah. -And, so what's the hint?

66
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,710
So I guess the load is too heavy for you, after all.

67
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,110
But, for him,

68
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,210
I guess it would be a good problem solving exercise.

69
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,510
-Him? -I'm sure that he's watching the movie

70
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,610
that Mr. Minowa appeared in at the hotel right now,

71
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,610
being that he's our son.

72
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,810
See, it's just as I thought.

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,710
Mr. Minowa's style of skiing that we saw this afternoon

74
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,010
is different from his style of skiing in the movie, right?

75
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,110
You think so?

76
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,110
I think they're both good, like that of a professional.

77
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,210
That's how people evaluate his skiing.

78
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,310
Take a look at this scene

79
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,310
where Mr. Minowa comes to rescue the heroine.

80
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,910
He comes skiing from the top until he frames out...

81
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,710
See, his cap strap is on.

82
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,610
But after he frames in again

83
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,010
when he carries her up, it's not on anymore.

84
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,010
And it's supposed to be a cut that is connected.

85
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,010
True.

86
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,610
Don't tell me that he's using a double.

87
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,010
-Maybe he can't ski? -No way.

88
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,110
He was skiing just a while ago and it was awesome!

89
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,010
Was it really him?

90
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,510
Of course.

91
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,510
I filmed it on video.

92
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,210
-See. -Hey, Sonoko.

93
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,910
While Mr. Minowa was skiing his way here,

94
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,710
do you know where he had this bag?

95
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,810
Mr. Minowa put it in front of his fans himself.

96
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,410
He told them to watch it for him until he got back

97
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,210
because he had important things inside it.

98
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,910
What? This bag?

99
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,810
An intermediate school boy came to look at it?

100
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,210
-When was that? -Just now.

101
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,410
He didn't buy it though.

102
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,010
If that's too small,

103
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,410
we have one with the same design a size larger.

104
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,610
Is that right?

105
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,510
The belt stretches this much and it's quite convenient.

106
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,810
True.

107
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,510
What's so convenient.

108
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,610
Hey, Heiji. What're you angry about?

109
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,210
It's only natural.

110
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,010
Some intermediate school kid is one step ahead of me each time.

111
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,810
He borrowed the video from the hotel before I did,

112
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,510
and a queer mustached man also seems involved.

113
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,610
If things go as is, they'll solve the case before I do.

114
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,310
Which means that you still have no idea, Heiji?

115
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,610
I do. I know who the killer is and the method that was used.

116
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,810
I found out when we went to that store a while ago.

117
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,310
Then, why not report it to the police right away?

118
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,110
But there's something I can't solve.

119
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,010
The loops on the poles that were on upside down

120
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,110
and the reason the bag was filled with snow.

121
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,710
My deduction cannot be proven unless I solve these problems.

122
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,310
What is it, Shizuka?

123
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,310
I thought I told you not to make private calls to me at work.

124
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,110
What, a case?

125
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,310
-I found it! This is it! -What's that?

126
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,310
Remember the gunshot like noise that Mr. Minowa might've heard

127
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,410
before reaching the top on the lift.

128
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,510
The fact that this hasn't been retrieved yet,

129
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,710
means that the killer is still somewhere unable to make a move.

130
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,710
My, you sound like you know it all already.

131
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,410
No, the most important trick that was used in the murder

132
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,310
is still not solved completely.

133
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,510
The scratch that was left

134
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,210
on the left side of the corpse on the lift...

135
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,810
I can't figure out what it is.

136
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,910
I figured out the snow packed bag and the killer,

137
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,310
but they don't connect right.

138
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,310
You've figured out who the killer is?

139
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,410
Yeah. There are four suspects

140
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,510
who are being interrogated by the police now.

141
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,110
Director Oyama, who was riding the lift in front of Mr. Minowa.

142
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,110
Mr. Katashina, the detective who was riding the lift

143
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,910
right behind Mr. Minowa.

144
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,310
Stuntman Mr. Mimata, who was at the ski slope

145
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,810
to call the director and the others.

146
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,010
And Ms. Tateishi who failed to make it off the lift.

147
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,610
Wait, I can see that you know where Director Oyama was riding,

148
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,910
but how do you know where the other three were riding?

149
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,410
Do your really know who the killer is?

150
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,110
Mrs. Kudo!

151
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,010
I got to hear what the police

152
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,210
was questioning them about, you see.

153
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,810
What? But, how, why?

154
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,510
It just so happened that our trip and Shinichi's ski class

155
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,810
coincidentally turned out to be the same place.

156
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,010
I mean, you deliberately came here.

157
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,910
But Shinichi, you were 30 minutes late.

158
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,510
An intermediate school boy just like you was here just a while ago.

159
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,310
What?

160
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,110
You mean there's another deduction freak just like Shinichi.

161
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,710
That's new to me!

162
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,210
Talking about another, do you know?

163
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,010
About the other Snow Woman legend.

164
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,510
No god, it's pitch dark already.

165
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,610
The killer is being interrogated now and can't move just yet.

166
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,310
But if he's released, he will hide the evidence.

167
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,610
Heiji!

168
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,110
What is it, Mom?

169
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,710
Rain makes puddles.

170
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,810
But with snow, you can make a snowman.

171
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,910
If that becomes ice, a large statue can also be made.

172
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,710
But Yusaku says that this is the key to solving the mystery.

173
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,510
Don't let outward appearance fool you.

174
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,410
By Heizo.

175
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,810
What's he trying to get at anyway?

176
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,010
Why talk about snowmen now?

177
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,610
Heiji?

178
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,372
Since he was riding the lift alone,

179
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:22,672
we couldn't have made him hold the gun.

180
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:26,572
Maybe the ex-cop and now detective could've done it,

181
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,372
but we could never aim and shoot at his head

182
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:30,572
in a blizzard like back then.

183
00:08:30,572 --> 00:08:33,972
Hey, hey, even an ex-cop can't do something like that.

184
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,672
Because the blizzard was so bad

185
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,272
that you couldn't even see the lift in front of you.

186
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:39,772
True.

187
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:43,672
Murder would've been impossible in that situation

188
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:48,172
if Mr. Minowa was really riding the lift alone.

189
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:51,872
What?

190
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,872
Hey, hey, don't tell me that

191
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:57,072
you're going to say that somebody was inside that bag?

192
00:08:57,072 --> 00:09:00,072
But that bag was packed with snow,

193
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,272
and no adult would've possibly been inside.

194
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:06,072
No, no, a bag this size was inside.

195
00:09:06,072 --> 00:09:09,872
The same kind of bag that is one size larger

196
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,872
and of the same design was sold at the shop of the hotel.

197
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:13,972
It can't be.

198
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:17,672
Are you saying that Mr. Minowa was carrying a bag

199
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,572
with the killer inside it when he got on the lift?

200
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:22,672
No, the one who was in the bag wasn't the killer,

201
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:24,872
but Mr. Minowa himself.

202
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:26,872
No, that can't be!

203
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:28,772
Then, the person who was carrying the bag was?

204
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:30,772
The killer.

205
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:33,772
Most of Mr. Minowa's face is hidden by his hair,

206
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,872
and he was wearing sunglasses back then.

207
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:38,472
If someone else were to wear a wig, a knitted cap,

208
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:41,172
sunglasses and ski wear,

209
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:44,072
people would be deluded to think it were Mr. Minowa.

210
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:48,372
But he talked to me and his fans.

211
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:51,272
It was Mr. Minowa's voice, of course.

212
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:54,772
-How? -That's because Mr. Minowa himself

213
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:59,172
was listening closely from inside the bag and responding to everyone.

214
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:04,472
That's why everybody thought that he disguised killer was Minowa.

215
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,972
-Oh no... -I see.

216
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:11,572
That's why he was silent until he carried that bag.

217
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,072
You've got to be kidding.

218
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:17,572
A person as proud as he, would never go inside a bag.

219
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:18,772
That's probably because...

220
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:20,472
He was a proud person.

221
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:22,272
That's why he went inside.

222
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:25,372
The fact that his skiing was of a professional level

223
00:10:25,372 --> 00:10:28,472
was just a front and fake.

224
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:30,172
It was probably all a lie.

225
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,872
A lie?

226
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:34,372
I guess he could ski a bit,

227
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:36,372
but not good enough like a professional.

228
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:38,672
I watched the movie, that Mr. Minowa appeared in,

229
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,472
"The Snow Woman's Love" and the "Mystery of Snow Woman"

230
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:43,972
back at the hotel a while ago.

231
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:46,772
Then there was a scene where he ran over to the heroine on skis

232
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:51,372
and framed out once. Then he zoomed back into the scene.

233
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:54,672
Moreover, when he was skiing, the cap trap was on.

234
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,072
When he zoomed, it wasn't there.

235
00:10:57,072 --> 00:11:01,072
This means that someone else skied for him.

236
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,272
Isn't that right, director?

237
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:07,072
Yeah. It wasn't that he couldn't ski,

238
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:10,472
but he hurt his leg in the first movie.

239
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:14,472
But he insisted on skiing himself,

240
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:17,772
so in order to persuade him, I secretly used a stuntman in his place.

241
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:21,972
That ski scene was ironically evaluated highly.

242
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,472
So, I used a stuntman secretly in the 2nd movie, too.

243
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:26,672
You did?

244
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:29,172
That's why, when the fans asked him to ski,

245
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,272
he let his substitute ski for him

246
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:33,872
and went into the bag and waited below.

247
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,372
Then, when his substitute came and carried the bag,

248
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:40,272
he conversed with the fans to act out his role.

249
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:42,872
Hey, hold it.

250
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:45,672
Don't tell me that the substitute is...

251
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,172
Yeah. The one who had that role,

252
00:11:48,172 --> 00:11:52,572
carried the bag that Mr. Minowa was inside, and killed him is...

253
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:58,972
Stuntman, Mr. Mimata!

254
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:01,172
No one else but you could've done it.

255
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:03,972
-Mr. Mimata? -Is it true?

256
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,272
But I think that the one who did the stunt

257
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:10,972
for the movie 4 years ago was the late Mr. Mizukami,

258
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:14,372
because the skiing in the movie and today's skiing was different.

259
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:16,772
It's most likely that before Mr. Mizukami died,

260
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:19,872
Mr. Mimata secretly took on the role,

261
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,772
and he used it to his advantage to carry out the murder on the lift.

262
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:26,272
Right! He took only Mr. Minowa's head

263
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:29,572
out of the bag on the lift and held it down,

264
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:31,472
stuck the gun at his temple and fired.

265
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:35,172
He then took Mr. Minowa out of the bag and sat him down

266
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,872
and made him hold the gun.

267
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:40,772
He then carried the bag and jumped off.

268
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:42,872
There are two places where the space

269
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:47,272
between the lift and the ground is only about 3 meters.

270
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:50,172
The scratch that was found on the seat of the lift

271
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,472
was one that was made when he shot Mr. Minowa.

272
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,172
And the fact that Mr. Minowa was sitting on the left when on the lift,

273
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:59,072
but was found sitting on the right side when found dead

274
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:02,072
is evidence that this is what actually happened.

275
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,872
It sure is difficult

276
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:07,172
to shift the position of a dead person on a lift.

277
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:09,172
But, when the gunshot was heard,

278
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:11,172
Mr. Mimata was talking to me.

279
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,572
That was probably the sound of a rocket fire cracker.

280
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,172
After he wore the ski wear

281
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:17,672
that he had ready by the place he got off the lift,

282
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,772
he probably ignited the fuse of the rocket fire cracker

283
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:21,972
with a lighted cigarette and poked it into a PET bottle.

284
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,272
He fired it shifting the time a bit to make a witness for his alibi,

285
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:30,872
by skiing down and talking to somebody when the sound is heard.

286
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:33,872
But, where did he get the bag that was packed with snow?

287
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:36,072
I just said that there are two places

288
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:39,372
where that lift is only 3 meters away from the ground.

289
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:41,772
That's where the bag with the upside down ski pole

290
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,772
hooked onto it was place, and later carried up to the lift.

291
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,372
I see. 3 meters to the ground...

292
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:50,472
Ski poles are approximately 1 meter and 20 centimeters.

293
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:53,072
If the string one side is hooked on to the other pole and connected,

294
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:55,672
stretching over for it may make it reachable,

295
00:13:55,672 --> 00:13:58,472
but would it be possible to pick it up in that blizzard?

296
00:13:58,472 --> 00:14:01,372
No, no! Only one ski pole was used,

297
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,172
and the remaining 1 meter...

298
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:06,272
was made by wetting the string of the cloth bag

299
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:08,572
with water and freezing it.

300
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:11,372
That's how the remaining one meter was compensated for.

301
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,772
The loops of both poles were upside down

302
00:14:13,772 --> 00:14:16,072
because just one being upside down would draw attention.

303
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:19,572
But I wonder if you can see that bag from on top the lift?

304
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,172
I mean the blizzard was so bad

305
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:22,372
that even the lift ahead couldn't be seen, right?

306
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:24,972
Did you know that the space between one lift and the other

307
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:27,472
has to be more than 6 seconds apart?

308
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:29,372
The speed at which a lift moves

309
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:31,972
is from 1.5 meters to 2 meters per second,

310
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,272
which means that the space between one lift and the other

311
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:36,272
is about 10 meters apart.

312
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:38,472
Even if it is hard to something that is 10 meters apart,

313
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:41,572
the bag that was only 3 meters apart could easily be seen.

314
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:44,872
More so, if you know that the bag is already there...

315
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:46,272
But, what proof do you have?

316
00:14:46,272 --> 00:14:48,172
I've got proof, too.

317
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,172
If Mr. Mimata met with Ms. Tateishi

318
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:54,072
and went directly to be interrogated in the lodge,

319
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:56,372
he still should have it on him.

320
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:01,472
The same ski wear that Mr. Minowa was wearing.

321
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:05,472
Maybe you even have the bag that Mr. Minowa inside, too?

322
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,372
I was enduring all this time.

323
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:11,672
It was so hot.

324
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,272
Mr. Mimata!

325
00:15:13,272 --> 00:15:14,872
So, you the one who did it, after all.

326
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,572
Which means that you knew, director.

327
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:18,772
Yeah.

328
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:22,072
I thought that your skiing had improved in the end,

329
00:15:22,072 --> 00:15:26,472
but when I saw him dead, I realized it was you.

330
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:28,172
But, why?

331
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:30,072
I avenged the death of Mr. Mizukami

332
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:33,172
who was supposed to become your husband.

333
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:36,072
I killed Minowa using the same trick

334
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:38,472
that was used to kill Mr. Mizukami 4 years ago.

335
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:39,872
Just what do you mean?

336
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,572
Remember 4 years ago, that day,

337
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:45,172
Minowa was troubled surrounded by his fans,

338
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:48,872
Mr. Mizukami said we can work something out.

339
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:50,372
He meant that

340
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:53,872
he would secretly put Minowa inside a bag and carrying him over.

341
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:57,872
But Minowa took advantage of Mr. Mizukami's kindness and killed him.

342
00:15:57,872 --> 00:15:59,672
He killed Mr. Mizukami who was planning on quitting his job as a stuntman

343
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:02,172
and become an actor!

344
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:05,472
He told me when I held him at gun point.

345
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:08,372
There's no way he can make a living as an actor.

346
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:09,472
I'm sure that when he gets desperate,

347
00:16:09,472 --> 00:16:11,572
he is going to write a book on me and disclose everything!

348
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:14,472
I guess he was scared.

349
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:15,872
How ironic

350
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:20,172
that a movie that is just the thing to carry out the revenge is to be shot.

351
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:22,672
The fact is, I too, thought that the killer of the incident

352
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:25,272
that happened 4 years ago was Minowa.

353
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:28,072
That's why I decided to make this movie.

354
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,072
I didn't reveal anything yet,

355
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,572
but the real killer of this movie

356
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:33,972
was scheduled to be Minowa, who was acting the role of a detective.

357
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,972
The trick used is the same as was used 4 years ago

358
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:37,972
as Mr. Mimata had just mentioned.

359
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:42,472
I figured that he would give himself in if I showed him the script.

360
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,772
I know that it's not for me, who quit being an officer to say,

361
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,672
but if you knew so much,

362
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:52,272
I would've wanted you to prevent this stupid murder.

363
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:54,472
Revenge only breeds revenge,

364
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:57,372
and the feeling of accomplishment vanishes on the spot...

365
00:16:57,372 --> 00:17:00,072
It's just like the snow that falls onto the palm of your hand.

366
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,472
Well, we'll hear you out at the station.

367
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,372
You'll come along too, won't you?

368
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:15,672
Inspector, what about the intermediate school boy on the phone?

369
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:18,472
He is telling of the exact same deduction of as that boy

370
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,572
with the exact same timing.

371
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,772
-What? -What?

372
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:28,372
Heiji, why aren't you going with him?

373
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:29,872
Idiot! If I leave,

374
00:17:29,872 --> 00:17:32,872
who's going to piggy back you back to the hotel down below?

375
00:17:32,872 --> 00:17:34,272
Doh-doh.

376
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:36,472
I finally figured out that

377
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,272
the belt of the bag was frozen only after dad dropped me a hint.

378
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:42,072
That's why as far as the intermediate school boy

379
00:17:42,072 --> 00:17:43,672
that solved this case alone,

380
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:45,672
I don't want to see him.

381
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:46,972
Why not?

382
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:48,472
Why should I go when you're the one who solved the case?

383
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:50,472
Take the PET bottle along with you,

384
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:54,472
and tell him that you solved the case by yourself.

385
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:55,772
I only figured everything out

386
00:17:55,772 --> 00:17:57,572
after dad told me the story of the Snow Woman

387
00:17:57,572 --> 00:18:00,872
who pretended that she sprained her leg and went into the basket.

388
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,772
That's when I figured out that Mr. Minowa who wanted to pretend

389
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:06,672
that he was a good skier went into the bag himself.

390
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:09,272
But your deduction was correct, wasn't it?

391
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:12,272
No, this case was solved by the intermediate school boy

392
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:14,972
who figured everything out himself, not me.

393
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,072
-Hey. -Quiet.

394
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:18,472
That's what you get for coming along with me,

395
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,772
despite having sprained your leg!

396
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:22,272
I'll bet you sprained your leg when practicing

397
00:18:22,272 --> 00:18:25,172
just so you could brag that you're an advanced skier.

398
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,972
Well, thanks to you showing off,

399
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,472
I figured out why Mr. Minowa went into the bag right away,

400
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:32,472
and you also helped with a lot of things

401
00:18:32,472 --> 00:18:34,172
so I guess I'll forgive you.

402
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:37,072
Idiot. I didn't practice

403
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:39,972
because I wanted to show everybody how good I was.

404
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:45,472
I wonder why there are two different stories about the Snow Woman?

405
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:49,472
I'll bet it's because the storyteller was a mother.

406
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:51,172
It's said that the folk tale of Snow Woman

407
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,072
was created as a warning to people to stay indoors during blizzards,

408
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:58,072
and while mothers continued telling their children this story,

409
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:01,072
they began feeling empathy for her

410
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:04,572
and gradually changed the story.

411
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:06,772
In other words, it first started as a story

412
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,572
of her killing her victims after exchanging her silver clothing,

413
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,772
but it changed to a story in which, she did not take the soul,

414
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:14,572
but rather, just melted into snow.

415
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:16,572
That's why the stories of Snow Woman

416
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,372
are sad and sound quite familiar.

417
00:19:26,972 --> 00:19:29,272
I couldn't see very well because of the snow.

418
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:32,072
But I'll bet it's him that intermediate school boy.

419
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:35,072
Well, even if I don't see him, if he's a detective...

420
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:37,872
We'll get to see each other one day on some mysterious stage.

421
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:11,172
So, that super intelligent detective left

422
00:21:11,172 --> 00:21:14,372
without giving the police his name.

423
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:18,372
How about it? Unlike the detective that I know before he shrunk,

424
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:22,072
this guy is intelligent and modest!

425
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,772
I mean, you know, that's me.

426
00:21:42,772 --> 00:21:44,672
Next Conan's Hint:

427
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:46,972
"Coin Locker"

428
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,172
This is the closet we get to the Black Organization.

429
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,672
Oh, no, Shinichi and we suddenly approach each other rapidly.

430
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:51,972
Why is Conan involved?
