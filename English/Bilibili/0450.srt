1
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:03,524
Even a gigantic wall that seems to block the path.

2
00:00:03,524 --> 00:00:05,224
Turns out to be a large door if viewed from a different angle.

3
00:00:05,224 --> 00:00:07,124
A murder is committed using the illusion that is the talk of the town!

4
00:00:07,124 --> 00:00:09,724
A mystery on stage. A double trick mystery!

5
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:11,124
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:12,724
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,618
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

9
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,318
This looks amazing, doesn't it?

10
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,218
The sign looks like a haunted house

11
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,018
which you really like!

12
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:07,718
What? No way, Conan!

13
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:13,218
Well, Genyo Fuyuki's magic show is unlike Sanada Kazumi's cheerful one.

14
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:15,718
It is known for having a dark feel to it.

15
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,118
Why would Mr. Fuyuki want to see you immediately, Dad?

16
00:02:19,118 --> 00:02:20,718
Anyway, let's go and see.

17
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:23,618
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

18
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:33,618
"Trick Versus Magic (Part 1)"

19
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:36,318
"Genyo Fuyuki"

20
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:37,618
Yes. Please come in.

21
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:39,018
Excuse me.

22
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,518
Hello, Mr. Mouri.

23
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:44,418
Please forgive me for having a renown detective like you

24
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:46,418
"Genyo Fuyuki (35)" -come all the way here.

25
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,318
I'm Fuyuki.

26
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:50,018
I'm Mouri.

27
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:51,618
She's my daughter.

28
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,318
Hello. I'm Ran Mouri.

29
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,618
And this is the freeloader Conan.

30
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,618
Freeloader?

31
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:00,318
Talk about rude.

32
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:01,718
Hello.

33
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,218
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:06,918
When I told them that you called, they insisted on coming along

35
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,318
and wouldn't take no for an answer.

36
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,818
That's perfectly okay.

37
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:11,818
Do you both like magic?

38
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,918
Yes, I love it!

39
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:17,818
We often go to see magic shows, too.

40
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:21,218
But those were only little demonstrations.

41
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:24,918
Okay then.

42
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:43,918
You can see the trick by changing the base angle.

43
00:03:57,418 --> 00:03:58,418
Fantastic!

44
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:01,318
Well, I guess he's got technique.

45
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,618
By the way,

46
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:08,518
I asked you to come here, Mr. Mouri,

47
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:13,318
because there is someone in this troupe that is after my life.

48
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:19,318
I would like you to figure out who it is, Mr. Mouri.

49
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:22,318
Were you blackmailed or something?

50
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:24,418
Recently, twice when I was rehearsing,

51
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:28,518
equipment came falling from above and I barely made it.

52
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,818
If it only happened once, I would've thought it was just a coincidence.

53
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:33,818
But when it happened consecutively...

54
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:36,018
Was anybody near you at that time?

55
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:38,118
No. I was alone.

56
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:40,918
How many troupe members are there other than you, Mr. Fuyuki?

57
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:43,718
Hey, just what are you doing asking questions?

58
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,818
I'm sorry. And how many are there?

59
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:50,618
There are five of us besides me.

60
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:59,718
First, my assistant Misa Uehara.

61
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,818
"Misa Uehara (26)" -She's my ex-girlfriend

62
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:05,318
that I one-sidedly broke my marriage engagement with three years ago.

63
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,318
She still has a grudge against what I did.

64
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:09,318
One-sidedly?

65
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,518
Yes.

66
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,318
And likewise, another assistant Chiaki Nakagawa.

67
00:05:14,318 --> 00:05:18,118
"Chiaki Nakagawa (24)" -She is my ex-wife that I divorced by consent.

68
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:22,518
However, she hates me to this day for my repeated extra-marital affairs.

69
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:26,518
And next is Kazuma Ishida, who is in charge of filming videos.

70
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,418
"Kazuma Ishida (19)" -He's my disciple

71
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:32,218
and I'm making him take videos deliberately so that he can study magic.

72
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:33,618
In charge of taking videos?

73
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:35,618
He has the talent for becoming a magician

74
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:37,418
on top of being an obedient nice boy.

75
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:39,618
He's the only one I trust.

76
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:42,418
Beside him is the stage director, Mr. Shingo Shoji.

77
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:45,218
"Shingo Shoji (37)" -He used to once be my disciple,

78
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:49,818
but he lacked talent as a magician, so I hired him as our stage director.

79
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:54,218
He does not agree with me with my stage performance,

80
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,818
so I'm thinking of having him quit after the performance today.

81
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:58,518
You mean you're firing him?

82
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,018
That's right.

83
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:03,018
The last one is the crane operator, Minoru Hasegawa.

84
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:06,318
"Minoru Hasegawa (45)" -He loves to gamble and he owes me a lot of money.

85
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:09,218
So if I die, all his debts will be gone.

86
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:13,918
In other words, those who have the motive to come after my life...

87
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,718
Are four people leaving aside Mr. Kazuma Ishida.

88
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:19,318
Yes, that's right.

89
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:22,518
Mr. Mouri.

90
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:23,718
Yes?

91
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,218
Here.

92
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,218
These are tickets for tonight's show.

93
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:28,818
Oh, I see.

94
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:32,518
I don't think anything will happen during the performance,

95
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,618
but I will be doing life endangering magic, too.

96
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:38,618
Let's decide what the signal will be in case of emergency.

97
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:40,018
Signal?

98
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:42,918
When I show you this signal,

99
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,718
please come up on stage even if I'm still performing and save me.

100
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:51,718
But why don't you just cancel the performance?

101
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:53,518
I can't do that.

102
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:57,218
I have pride as a professional magician.

103
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,018
Okay.

104
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:03,818
I'll do the best I can as a professional detective, too.

105
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:05,218
Please do that

106
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,918
and please make sure that none of the members find out about this.

107
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:09,318
I understand.

108
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:14,618
There's still some time before the show starts.

109
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:16,318
Why don't you guys go somewhere till...

110
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:18,518
What's the matter, Ran?

111
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:24,718
Ran, I bet that you're disappointed about Mr. Fuyuki, right?

112
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:30,818
Well, him saying things like he broke his marriage engagement one-sidedly,

113
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,318
or he got divorced because of his repeated extra-marital affairs.

114
00:07:33,318 --> 00:07:36,418
He says it like it means nothing.

115
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:39,718
Well, a lot of things happen in the adult world.

116
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:42,118
Just like you and Mrs. Kisaki.

117
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:44,418
Conan!

118
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:48,018
-That hurts... -You keep your mouth shut!

119
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:49,918
I've got to work.

120
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,018
So you guys can go somewhere and kill the time! Understand?

121
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:55,718
Conan, are you all right?

122
00:07:58,518 --> 00:07:59,918
Huh?

123
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,618
If something were to happen during the show,

124
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:05,318
it would be when the magic trick is performed.

125
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,918
What are you doing here?

126
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,518
So this is how it is.

127
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:12,818
Hey, you!

128
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:14,618
Hey, stop ignoring me!

129
00:08:14,618 --> 00:08:16,618
-Somebody is coming. -What?

130
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:18,918
This is not good. Let's hide, Conan.

131
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:20,718
-This side! -Okay!

132
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:23,818
Lie down on this. I'll put the lid on for you.

133
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:25,118
Okay, will do!

134
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:29,318
Hey, Conan.

135
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:32,518
Don't tell me that this is the beauty slicing box?

136
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:34,418
Don't worry.

137
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:35,818
Your body parts will be connected again.

138
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,718
No! That's not the point.

139
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,518
-Put your feet inside! -Yes!

140
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,518
Quiet. Somebody's coming.

141
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:45,018
Is Kogoro Mouri a detective?

142
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:47,418
Yeah, I think he hired him.

143
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:50,018
I heard him on the phone.

144
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:52,718
Hey, who do you think dropped it?

145
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:53,818
Beats me.

146
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:56,618
But if you plan on doing anything, you've got to use your head a bit more.

147
00:08:56,618 --> 00:08:57,818
True.

148
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:01,518
If both of us work together, it'll be easy and unfailing.

149
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:03,618
Hey!

150
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:06,618
Cut out that stupid talk!

151
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:09,918
It's true that the troupe leader has a personality flaw,

152
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:11,918
but we're making a living

153
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,518
thanks to him.

154
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:17,218
Yes. We've got to be grateful to him.

155
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:18,718
Just what are you talking about?

156
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,418
The only reason why you're sticking up for him

157
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,918
is because you're borrowing money from him, right?

158
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:24,818
Shut up.

159
00:09:24,818 --> 00:09:26,218
Even you, Kazuma.

160
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:28,818
I know that deep down inside you hate him

161
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,418
because he won't let you be on stage as a magician yet.

162
00:09:33,418 --> 00:09:35,518
I don't hate him or anything.

163
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:37,018
Then, let's go.

164
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:38,418
Yeah.

165
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,818
I don't care what you're doing, but why don't you at least shave?

166
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:43,418
You look like a vagabond.

167
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,618
Please wait!

168
00:09:50,718 --> 00:09:51,918
Just who do you think you are?

169
00:09:58,918 --> 00:09:59,918
Darn it!

170
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:05,718
Are you okay, Pops?

171
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:09,118
Of course I'm not okay.

172
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:12,918
What a bummer.

173
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:15,018
Pops, to do that magic,

174
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,418
you're supposed to lie on your back and hold your knees with your hands.

175
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:20,718
What? Lie on my back and hold my knees with my hands?

176
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:25,718
Then, you'll be okay even if the box were cut into two, right?

177
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,418
I see.

178
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:33,718
Now we know that all the troupe members have a motive to kill Mr. Fuyuki.

179
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:36,418
I've got to be very careful in handling this case.

180
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:37,718
All right!

181
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:40,118
Did you check what kind of trick was used for the magic?

182
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:43,118
I couldn't tell even if I did check.

183
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,218
Come on, let's go!

184
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:46,418
Oh, I see.

185
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:55,218
"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

186
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:01,218
Ladies and gentlemen,

187
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:04,218
thank you for coming to "Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show".

188
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:07,118
Please enjoy the magical world of mysterious illusion tonight

189
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:09,418
to your heart's content!

190
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:13,418
It seems that she is enjoying herself.

191
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:45,118
Oh, no.

192
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:48,518
Oh, no.

193
00:12:56,918 --> 00:12:58,318
Impossible!

194
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:00,818
I'm glad.

195
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:34,018
Fantastic, isn't it, Dad?

196
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:37,018
Yeah, he's indeed a master of knife throwing.

197
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:40,518
All Mr. Fuyuki is doing is pretending to throw knives.

198
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:41,618
What?

199
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:44,118
But the knives really poked in.

200
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:45,818
It only looks that way

201
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,318
by using a special trick.

202
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:50,218
I saw them do it a while ago,

203
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:52,018
at the warehouse backstage.

204
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:55,618
While I was hiding together with Pops.

205
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,218
Dad?

206
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,718
Look! The next one is about to start.

207
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:15,718
Those needles are real.

208
00:14:15,718 --> 00:14:18,918
You don't have a chance if you're skewered with something like that.

209
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:23,318
That belt is just fixed on using magic tape.

210
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:25,118
After he is covered with the curtains,

211
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:28,018
he escapes to the small space besides the table.

212
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:35,518
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

213
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:36,718
What?

214
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:37,918
It looked that way to me, too!

215
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,018
Wait!

216
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:12,427
Hey, wasn't that the signal just now?

217
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:13,527
What?

218
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:14,927
It looked that way to me, too!

219
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,027
Wait!

220
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:25,227
Mr. Fuyuki!

221
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:27,927
Conan!

222
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:35,227
Mr. Fuyuki!

223
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,627
Well, well.

224
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:58,427
Aren't you the famed detective Mr. Kogoro Mouri?

225
00:16:01,027 --> 00:16:03,527
And? Did something happen?

226
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,027
No, well...

227
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:06,627
It seems that Mr. Mouri

228
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:12,027
has ran up here thinking that these two beauties here have killed me.

229
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:13,927
But please don't worry,

230
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:17,327
because as you can see, I am alive.

231
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:18,927
It seems so.

232
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:25,027
But I have to be on guard,

233
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,727
because there's more life risking magic during the second half of the show.

234
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:31,027
I'm counting on you.

235
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:32,627
Well, sure.

236
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:34,927
Ladies and gentlemen,

237
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,627
please give Mr. Mouri a big hand!

238
00:16:37,627 --> 00:16:39,627
Thank you, thank you.

239
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:44,627
"Genyo Fuyuki" -I am so sorry for the trouble.

240
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:48,627
I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of my signal,

241
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:50,827
so I decided to try it out.

242
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:53,527
There are things you should and should not do.

243
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:56,227
Thanks to you, I've been greatly embarrassed.

244
00:16:56,227 --> 00:17:00,727
I'm sorry, but what I said on stage is true.

245
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,127
There will be danger on the start of the second half show.

246
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:07,727
Fuyuki, what was that magic all about?

247
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,327
Nothing in my stage directing plans

248
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:12,727
call for such screaming and blood splattering out.

249
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,327
I thought that up.

250
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,927
Thanks to that, I was able to deceive a famed detective, right?

251
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:22,627
That's a different story.

252
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:26,927
I thought you were taken by a demon or something.

253
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:28,327
Kazuma.

254
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:29,427
Yes, sir.

255
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:37,927
From now on,

256
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:41,127
I will not only perform a flamboyant or elegant stage,

257
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,927
but rather an even more exciting stage performance.

258
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,027
Yes, that's what I'll do.

259
00:17:47,027 --> 00:17:49,127
Okay, suit yourself.

260
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:51,627
Your performance is not exciting,

261
00:17:51,627 --> 00:17:53,027
but just grotesque!

262
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,527
I'm sorry for the unpleasant confrontation.

263
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,427
Do you want anything?

264
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,627
It's nothing.

265
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:27,527
I wonder where Conan is?

266
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:30,227
He hasn't come back from the restroom.

267
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:31,427
Never mind him.

268
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:34,227
Keep your eyes on Mr. Fuyuki though.

269
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:37,027
For some reason, I have a strange feeling about this.

270
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:44,627
From here, I can immediately see if something goes wrong.

271
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:04,527
Sonny, you shouldn't be watching from here.

272
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,727
Go back to your seat.

273
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,427
But...

274
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:09,727
Now.

275
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:11,027
All right.

276
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:01,627
Dad.

277
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,527
No, that's his performance.

278
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:04,827
He's not giving any signal.

279
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:37,027
Hey, it's taking too long.

280
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:40,327
Don't worry, it's that kind of magic.

281
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:41,727
I think.

282
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,727
When the curtain goes up again,

283
00:20:43,727 --> 00:20:46,427
Mr. Fuyuki should be standing on top of the aquarium.

284
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:04,827
What the...

285
00:21:08,827 --> 00:21:09,927
Shoots!

286
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:12,127
Shoots!

287
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,327
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

288
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:25,527
Just what are you doing?

289
00:21:25,527 --> 00:21:27,327
Hurry and unlock the lid!

290
00:21:30,527 --> 00:21:33,027
The curtains! Lower the curtains!

291
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:35,127
Hasegawa, pull up the lid!

292
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:48,227
Did something happen?

293
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:49,427
The ambulance!

294
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:51,427
-Call the ambulance! -Yes, sir!

295
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:56,027
-Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

296
00:21:56,027 --> 00:21:58,627
-Mr. Mouri, please do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation! -Yeah.

297
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:00,027
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

298
00:22:02,827 --> 00:22:05,227
Mr. Fuyuki! Mr. Fuyuki!

299
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:15,527
Leader...

300
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:17,227
-Mr. Fuyuki... -Leader!

301
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:18,727
-Mr. Fuyuki! -Mr. Fuyuki!

302
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,827
Mr. Fuyuki!

303
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,827
-Leader! -Get a hold of yourself, Fuyuki!

"Genyo Fuyuki Magic Show"

305
00:24:03,427 --> 00:24:06,027
"Next Episode" -It doesn't matter if it's for investigation purposes,

306
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,927
we can't reveal how the magic is performed.

307
00:24:09,227 --> 00:24:12,627
Well...

308
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:15,527
We can't tell you from our side.

309
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,827
Try to remember that magic.

310
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,627
This latch...

311
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:24,927
I got it.

312
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:26,127
All I need now is proof!

In the next episode, the trick is revealed!

317
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,727
Is it murder or is it magic?

318
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,327
I'm not telling you.
