1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,740
That day, I got up after being haunted by a nightmare.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,940
Come to think of it,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,040
it could've been a warning for the worse to come.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,040
"Mouri Detective Agency"

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,140
It's okay, isn't it?

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,740
"Sayuri Tokomae (40)" -Mr. Mouri, pretty please.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,440
If you're worried that a robber's after you,

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
why don't you take off all that expensive looking accessory and run?

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,440
But, I want to show my accessories off.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Please keep me company an hour every day

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,740
when I go jogging to keep me from getting fat.

12
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,540
Mr. Mouri...

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,540
She says Pops looks like her late husband.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,940
That's no job for a detective.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,840
Dad really can't handle it, can he?

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Please, please, pretty please, keep me company.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,340
Yes, yes, yes.

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,940
Yes, this is the Mouri Detective Agency.

I'm Ryozo Gamo.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,340
I want you to look for a witness who can prove my alibi.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,540
Yes, this is indeed the kind of job for a detective.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,240
Yes. Tomorrow at 7 pm,

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,740
at Fugu Taisho.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,740
Okay!

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,640
Let's talk of the details then.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm sorry, Mrs. Tokomae.

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,440
I have urgent business to attend to.

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,240
I was here first.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,340
Frightening.

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,340
I don't think she needs a bodyguard.

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,540
See, talk about bad things happening.

32
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,140
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,540
Saturday nights are for mystery.

34
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,840
A mistaken deduction finally brings destruction.

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,140
Is it truly the end for Detective Mouri.

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

37
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540

41
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:44,385
He's going to be late because of an emergency?

42
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:48,285
Yes. Mr. Gamo called and told me to tell you

43
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:49,585
that he's sorry he's going to be late,

44
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:52,185
but to start without him.

45
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:54,085

00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,085
Delicious!

00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,885
Sir, he's here.

48
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:08,685
It's that man over there.

49
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:09,885
Here you go.

50
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:11,385
Thank you always.

51
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,885
Mr. Gamo.

52
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,485
"Ryozo Gamo (70)" -I'm sorry for being late.

"Sakae Isado (56) is found stabbed to death" -What is this?

57
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:25,685
Of course I know about this case.

58
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:27,185
About half a month ago,

59
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:31,385
the owner of an antique shop at Tsukimicho,

60
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:33,785
Sakae Ikasa was killed.

61
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,785
The police suspect me as being the killer.

62
00:04:38,785 --> 00:04:40,285
I've got a motive too.

63
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:44,085
Five years ago, he deceived me and took a lot of money from me.

64
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:47,585
When an officer came to check my alibi,

65
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:52,585
I inadvertently answered that I was home.

66
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,585
But, the fact is...

67
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,685
"Akebonocho Station" -I was walking around Akebonocho.

68
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:00,885
But I was alone so I have nobody to prove it.

69
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:02,485
I thought that they would suspect me

70
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,785
if I told them that I was out so I lied.

71
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:11,185
If the police find out that I lied,

72
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,185
the more they'll suspect me.

73
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:14,985
So, Mr. Mouri...

74
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:18,385
I would like you to find somebody who can testify

75
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:21,085
that I was at Akebonocho on the day of the crime.

76
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:24,685
You can count on me to find a witness to prove your alibi.

77
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,285
I can do that hands down.

78
00:05:27,985 --> 00:05:31,085
You're sure dependable just as you're reputed to be.

79
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:34,885
Since I go out a lot and don't carry a cell phone,

80
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:38,785
I'll call you to find out what you come up with.

81
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,985
So, let's drink and eat!

82
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,485
Thank you.

83
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,885
Mr. Gamo, I hope to be seeing you again soon.

84
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,585
Mr. Gamo, thanks for treating me the other day.

85
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:57,785
Mr. Gamo, won't you drop by.

86
00:05:57,785 --> 00:06:01,585
You're sure popular, Mr. Gamo.

87
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:06,585
Would you like to go to another shop?

88
00:06:06,585 --> 00:06:08,685
Yes. Let's go, let's go.

89
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:10,185
Let's drink up.

90
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:17,885
"Akebonocho Station" -I started working from the next morning.

91
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:22,285
But investigation turned out to be quite difficult then I first thought,

92
00:06:22,285 --> 00:06:26,085
and I got a call from Mr. Gamo every night pushing me for results.

93
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:32,885
Give me a break.

94
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:35,785
Then, on Friday night, the sixth day.

95
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:40,285
Did you find it?

96
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:41,585
Dad?

97
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:44,985
Yoko Okino is appearing from 8 pm.

98
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:49,785
It's like regular courier service.

99
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:50,985
Talk about bad timing.

100
00:06:50,985 --> 00:06:53,185
-Yes. -This is Gamo.

101
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:55,585
I was asking around all day today too, but...

102
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:57,785
You got no results?

103
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:01,185
You, the renown detective is my only hope and yet...

104
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:02,785
I'm doomed.

105
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:06,285
What do you mean you're doomed?

106
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:09,285
Talk about exaggerating.

107
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:21,985
The estimated time of his death

108
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,485
is between 7 pm to 9 pm last night.

109
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,385
It seems that there are no traces of the corpse

110
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:28,685
having been moved after death.

111
00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:31,685
Inspector Megure,

112
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,485
I've brought Mr. Mouri with me.

113
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:35,185
Thank you for the trouble.

114
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:38,885
What did you want with me, Inspector Megure?

115
00:07:39,885 --> 00:07:41,685
Well, although it looks to be suicide,

116
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:46,385
at the feet of the corpse, this was found crumpled up.

117
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:48,885
The phone number of my agency.

118
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:52,785
I'm going to take a peek at his face.

119
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,385
Mr. Gamo?

120
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,685
Then what he said about him being doomed

121
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:07,085
to you on the phone yesterday was true?

122
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:09,485
What do you mean by that?

123
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:14,785
I brought him here to confirm the corpse.

124
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,185
"Kyosuke Arai (42)" -He's Mr. Gamo's nephew,

125
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:18,285
Mr. Kyosuke Arai.

126
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,885
What did he mean when he said he was doomed?

127
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:28,985
I see.

128
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:31,085
So, that's why.

129
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:34,685
Now, we've grasped Mr. Gamo's tracks of what he did last night.

130
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:37,685
Mr. Gamo who was a suspect for having killed Mr. Sakae Kinugasa,

131
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,685
owner of the antique shop

132
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,285
called Mr. Mouri at 8 pm last night

133
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:45,285
and was depressed to find that

134
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,285
there had been no progress regarding his request,

135
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:49,685
drove over here with his car and committed suicide.

136
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:53,685
It takes approximately an hour from the Gamo residence to here,

137
00:08:53,685 --> 00:08:56,085
so he committed suicide at 9 pm.

138
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,485
It also matches the estimated time of death.

139
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:01,885
But inspector, if he was really innocent,

140
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:04,085
I don't see any reason as to why he would have to get depressed

141
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,185
over not being able to find someone who witnessed his alibi.

142
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:07,285
"Police Detective Hisamoto (50)" -Mr. Gamo...

143
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,985
went through a bitter experience

144
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:10,785
of being arrested despite being innocent.

145
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,285
Mistakenly arrested?

146
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:17,985
Five years ago,

147
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:20,685
the victim of this incident, Mr. Kinugasa was attacked in the dark,

148
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,985
and through eye-witness reports,

149
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:27,185
an officer of the Josai Police Department,

150
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:29,485
in our jurisdiction arrested Mr. Gamo.

151
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,085
However, several days later,

152
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:33,485
it was found that Mr. Gamo had an alibi.

153
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,285
I remember.

154
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,585
Uncle told me that he was taken away

155
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,285
by the police against his will and really scared.

156
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:44,285
He feared that he was going to have to go through what he did before,

157
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:45,785
therefore, felt doomed.

158
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,385
We tried to be as careful as possible

159
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,285
with the investigation so as not to repeat Takeoka's mistake.

160
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,685
Takeoka?

161
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,685
You mean, Isao Takeoka?

162
00:09:55,685 --> 00:10:00,385
Yes, he felt responsible for his mistake back then and quit.

163
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:02,585
Is it the Mr. Takeoka I know?

164
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,885
Do you know him?

165
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:07,485
He used to come over sometimes to spend time with dad.

166
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:09,985
You mean that Takeoka that entered police school

167
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,385
together with you.

168
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:15,985
It's me.

169
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,385
Okay, I'll head back right away.

170
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,885
It seems they just arrested the murderer who killed Mr. Sakae Kinugasa.

171
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:24,885
What?

172
00:10:24,885 --> 00:10:27,385
I'll report back on the details later.

173
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:32,285
If the killer was arrested a bit earlier,

174
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,785
uncle didn't have to take such rash action.

175
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:38,685
This place sure is spooky at night

176
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,285
because there aren't any lights anywhere.

177
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:43,585
True.

178
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:46,585
This area is supposed to be pitch dark at night.

179
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:50,285
Yes, that's why there was a flashlight

180
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,685
at the feet of Mr. Gamo's body.

181
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,285
Why would he prepare something like that

182
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,385
and bring it along with him,

183
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:56,585
coming all the way out to a place like this?

184
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:58,985
He could've committed suicide at home.

185
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,785
True.

186
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,385
There was a reason that it had to be here

187
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,985
for the killer that is.

188
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:07,885
The killer?

189
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:10,585
Inspector, this is a homicide case.

190
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:12,685
Homicide?

191
00:11:14,785 --> 00:11:18,285
In the last phone call I received from Mr. Gamo

192
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,685
saying that he was doomed,

193
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:23,185
I'm sure that the killer decided to use those words to his advantage

194
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:25,685
to make Mr. Gamo's death look like suicide.

195
00:11:30,185 --> 00:11:32,685
It's no use doing something like this.

196
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,985
But, we can't totally disregard the possibility of homicide.

197
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,285
But, if it's as Mr. Mouri deduced,

198
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:40,685
it would mean that the killer was here last night.

199
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:45,885
It seems that Mr. Gamo complained to a bread manufacturer.

200
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,185
Complained?

201
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:50,085
We received a complaint call from him the other day

202
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,285
regarding our Smiley black bean bun.

203
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:56,985
Receiving a complaint about a black bean bun

204
00:11:56,985 --> 00:12:01,685
is no motive for murder, is it?

205
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:03,585
Mr. Mouri, how long do you insist on

206
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:05,685
saying that this is a case of homicide?

207
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:07,785
Until I'm totally convinced it's not.

208
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,985
Uncle committed suicide!

209
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:14,385
Of course, I don't mean to rush to conclusions but...

210
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:15,485
Inspector Megure.

211
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:23,285
I hear that you've been having arguments with Mr. Gamo recently.

212
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,385
Oh, no.

213
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:26,585
It's just a little something over trivial matters.

214
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:28,385
Something like you asked him to lend you money,

215
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:30,885
but refused you flatly?

216
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:40,885
-Mr. Mouri! -Mr. Mouri!

217
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,785
It seems that you fantastically saw through a homicide

218
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,885
that was set up to look like suicide.

219
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:47,085
You already know who the killer is, don't you?

220
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:49,985
I solved the case a bit too fast, in spite of myself.

"Yamane (30)" -I think you're running from your responsibility

222
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,985
by insisting this case of suicide a case of homicide.

00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:57,985
"Toyo Sports Newspaper"

224
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,685
You were asked by him to search for a witness to his alibi

225
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:01,985
but you couldn't,

226
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,685
and your client who felt doomed committed suicide.

227
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:06,685
Where did you get that story from?

228
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,085
Who cares?

229
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:11,585
Why does he know about it?

230
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:13,985
The police would never tell him about it either.

231
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,685
Please tell me.

232
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:17,185
How do you intend to take responsibility

233
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:20,185
for cornering your client to kill himself, Mr. Mouri?

234
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:22,685
Mr. Gamo did not commit suicide!

235
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:24,085
It's homicide!

236
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:26,685

263
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:55,885
and quit the police force.

264
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:57,685
Just as I thought.

265
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:09,449
Since way back,

266
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,849

Gamo didn't commit suicide.

271
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,049
The feeling that I got when I interrogated him five years ago, was...

272
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:25,849
he's not that type of guy.

273
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,049
Let me help you.

274
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:29,649
You're not the type to leave things as is,

275
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:31,749
after your client's been killed either.

276
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:32,849
It could be a grudge

277
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,949
or someone who was in conflict with him that killed him.

278
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:38,149
If it's somebody that hated him, I know one.

279
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,949
Who is it?

280
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:42,549
The guy right in front of you.

281
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:45,649
I know, I wasn't being sensible, but I did hate him.

282
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,249
I have a motive.

283
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:49,749
Where were you the night before yesterday?

284
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,949
What's the estimated time of death?

285
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:53,849
Just around 9 pm.

286
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,149
Too bad.

287
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,749
I met an acquaintance at 8:30 pm

288
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,249
and stayed with him till midnight.

289
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:03,349
Immovable alibi.

290
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:06,649
Okay. Let's go, Takeoka.

291
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:07,649
Yes.

292
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:11,149
It's just like the old days.

293
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,849
Kogoro.

294
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:20,949
So, it seems that you finished the work that you were asked to do.

295
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,849
Nothing's finished at all.

296
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,349
Things are just starting.

297
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,549
So, the guy Gamo disappearing doesn't work.

298
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:34,249
What've you been doing for these five years?

299
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:36,549
You didn't contacting me at all.

300
00:16:36,549 --> 00:16:37,849
I was dead.

301
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,849
A man who only knew how to be a police detective

302
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:41,749
threw what he had away.

303
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:44,349
You could've become a detective too.

304
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:46,549
You'd be of use right away.

305
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:49,649
I'll think about it.

306
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,449
Although we worked in different jurisdiction

307
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:54,449
and sections back in the old days,

308
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:58,449
we used to work as partners during investigation.

309
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:03,449
Although he used to sometimes be hated unreasonably by his customers,

310
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,049
but the owner, Mr. Gamo...

311
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,349
"Reiji Tsuchida (43)" left everything up to me,

312
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,549
the hired president of this company.

313
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:12,349
Has he ever been hated aside of work?

314
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:15,349
He didn't talk to me about personal things.

315
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,049
Why don't you ask his nephew?

316
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,849
He seems to be the only one with blood ties with him.

317
00:17:26,749 --> 00:17:29,849
Are you intending to make me the killer at all cost?

318
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:33,349
I would just like to confirm some things.

319
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,649
The night before last,

320
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:36,149
I was drawing pictures for a series

321
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:37,749
that is published in a weekly magazine.

322
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:39,649
Any witnesses?

323
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,749
There isn't any because I live alone.

324
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:47,149
You sure seem to have loans here there and everywhere, don't you?

325
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,349
I heard an interesting story about you at a neighborhood bar.

326
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:52,949
You were wasted and babbling away saying,

327
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:58,049
"I would get inheritance if only uncle dies!"

328
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,349
I mean, I was drunk back then.

329
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:03,649
Mr. Arai, let me just say one thing.

330
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,849
There is not one criminal who escaped the hands of me,

331
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:10,249
Kogoro Mouri, the renown detective.

332
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:13,449
Go home!

333
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:24,849
"Mouri Detective Agency"

334
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,049
And?

335
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,949
So, you got nothing after all?

336
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:31,049
Yes, only for today.

337
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:33,149
Come to think of it, that man called Mr. Arai

338
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:36,449
seemed to want the case to be a suicide, didn't he?

339
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,249
If it turns out to be a homicide,

340
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:40,249
he would be investigated from head to toe.

341
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:42,849
Then, all his shortcomings may be exposed.

342
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:47,749
Hello.

343
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:50,049
Takeoka.

344
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:52,949
What? Something crossed your mind?

345
00:18:52,949 --> 00:18:55,349
"Toyo Newspaper Agency" -You know that I can't tell you

346
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:59,049
where I got information about Mr. Gamo calling you to work for him.

347
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,749
So, you can't give me info on the news source.

348
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:04,649
Well, it's not that I have no idea.

349
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:06,649
If it's not the police,

350
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,449
the only person left is his nephew, Mr. Kyosuke Arai.

351
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,349
If you know, why come ask?

352
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:18,349
Prepare an article of apology for this fake info!

353
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:21,349
Just as you deduced,

354
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:23,649
Arai was the one who let the info out.

355
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:27,049
He gets the entire estate to himself.

356
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:28,749
He has zero alibi.

357
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:32,349
Moreover, he uses the press to interfere with investigation.

358
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:34,149
I'll make him spit it out.

359
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:41,149
Don't tell me he got away.

360
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,349
"Arai"

361
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:51,249
Arai.

362
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:59,349
It seems that Mr. Arai's estimated time of death

363
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:02,849
is around 9 pm to 10 pm last night.

364
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:04,549
It's suicide.

365
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:10,349
And, it's also proof that he's the guy who killed Mr. Gamo.

366
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:12,449
I totally agree too.

367
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:18,349
Inspector, this is his neighbor.

368
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:20,049
On the night that Mr. Gamo passed away,

369
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,149
she says that Mr. Arai was at home in his room.

370
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:23,249
What?

371
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:24,549
Just what do you mean?

372
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:25,749
Since he was making a lot of noise,

373
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:28,149
I was going to complain to him.

374
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:30,349
I looked into his room from the veranda,

375
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:32,349
and saw him walking around in his room,

376
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,849
screaming something at the top of his lungs.

377
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,749
But, he cooled down in no time,

378
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:38,549
so I didn't say anything.

379
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,949
What time was it?

380
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,849
A little before 8 pm.

381
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,049
8 pm?

382
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,649
It'll take at least an hour

383
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:48,349
and a half to get from here to the murder site.

384
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:50,749
If he was in his room at 8 pm,

385
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,149
he wouldn't have made it there at the estimated time of death

386
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:54,349
no matter how much he rushed.

387
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:56,149
Mr. Arai is innocent.

388
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:59,349
If so, there's only one possible reason

389
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:02,249
why he committed suicide.

390
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:04,649
I suspected him despite him being innocent

391
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:07,949
cornered him and lead him to kill himself.

392
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:08,949
Thanks to your one-track mindedness,

393
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:12,749
I guess you did something that cannot be undone, Mr. Mouri.

394
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:15,249
I have no words to defend myself.

395
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:17,149
No, I'm the one who asked him

396
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:19,549
to go look for the killer together against his will.

397
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:24,249
I'll take responsibility for the outcome.

398
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:26,749
Mouri.

399
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:31,549
There're a lot of them again today.

400
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:33,049
I'm sorry, Mouri.

401
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:35,849
Don't worry about it.

402
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:41,149
I was happy just to be able to pair up with you like old times.

403
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:42,649
See you again, someday, then.

404
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:50,249
Mr. Arai who was falsely accused by you,

405
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:54,249
tried to prove his innocence by killing himself, didn't he?

406
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:55,449
Answer me, Mr. Mouri!

407
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:59,149
You lead an innocent person to his death!

412
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,349
Inspector, this is Mouri.

413
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:44,749
I'm going to remove the sign of my detective office from today.

414
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:46,049
Dad.

415
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:48,349
Dad.

416
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:52,249
Mr. Mouri is...

417
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:53,949
Going to resign?

418
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:56,949
He's going to resign his job as a detective?

419
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:58,749
Please, dad.

420
00:23:58,749 --> 00:24:00,949
Think it over.

421
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:02,349
Dad!

422
00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,949
After all, you've kept going for the past ten years.

423
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:09,649
I'm sure you're exhausted.

424
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,349
Mother.

"Saturday, 7 pm, Fugu Taisho, Mr Gamo" -Everything began

426
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:15,049
when he got a job request from his client.

427
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:16,549
It can't be...

428
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:18,249
But, if I piece them together that way...

429
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:20,949
I got it.

430
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:24,349
I guess I cannot resign my job as a detective.

431
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:28,149
Moreover I'm not tired!

432
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:30,349

Mr. Mouri's going to quit being a detective?

Who's going to be solving the cases from now on, then?
