1
00:00:00,466 --> 00:00:02,566
Inspiration flashes piercing through to the truth.

2
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:04,266
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,566
Summer vacation just started.

4
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,666
What kind of boyfriend will Sonoko catch?

5
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,466
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:12,666
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,866
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,279
The three of us went to Izu to do some swimming,

9
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:59,379
Ran and I are witness to a strange summer event!

10
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,579
Can you believe it?

11
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,779
Sonoko gets herself a boyfriend, his name is Masahiko Michiwaki!

12
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,179
But while she's in seventh heaven

13
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:10,679
waiting for him to pick her up for their dinner date,

14
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,979
someone attacks her!

15
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:22,879
Is it my imagination or are we being watched?

16
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,979
The guy that Ran said she'd seen somewhere before.

17
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,579
The guy wearing the glasses is bothering me.

18
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,179
There's also Sonoko's attacker to consider.

19
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,379
Was that really...

20
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,679
just an average burglar?

21
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:43,079
"Sonoko's Dangerous Summer Story (Part 2)"

22
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,579
There it is!

23
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,279
What a lovely restaurant!

24
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,779
But it doesn't seem to have many customers, do they?

25
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:11,179
Maybe we got here too early?

26
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:14,079
Are you sure you aren't coming, Sonoko?

27
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,279
Go on!

28
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,979
I couldn't sleep last night,

29
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,479
thinking about that man kept me awake,

30
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,179
I'll rest here!

31
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:24,979
All right. But what a waste...

32
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:30,079
Here! There are drinks in this cooler box,

33
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,679
help yourself.

34
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,879
Thank you so much.

35
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,979
I'll see you later, Sonoko.

36
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,379
Okay. Have a nice time.

37
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,179
After your nap and if you're feeling up to it,

38
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,879
join us in the restaurant.

39
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,979
I will.

40
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,079
I'm so sleepy...

41
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,279
The seafood here is delicious.

42
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,579
I wanted Sonoko to try it.

43
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,179
What a pity.

44
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,079
I wonder if she'll be okay.

45
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,579
Sleeping inside a hot car.

46
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,979
Don't worry, I turned the air conditioner on.

47
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,179
Wow, look at this!

48
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:20,079
Is this for one person?

49
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,579
Certainly! There's quantity and the price is low!

50
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:25,279
That's the secret to this restaurant's success!

51
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,379
Hey... A full course meal for lunch?

52
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,979
See! Didn't I tell you the food was great?

53
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,679
You were right! It was delicious!

54
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:51,779
I'm completely stuffed.

55
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,379
Thank you very much!

56
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,979
I feel bad for Sonoko though.

57
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,779
You're from the inn.

58
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,379
Do you come here often too?

59
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,679
No. This is my first time.

60
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,779
By the way, where's your brown haired friend?

61
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,979
I haven't seen her anywhere.

62
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,079
You mean Sonoko, she didn't get enough sleep last night.

63
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,079
She's in the car parked outside.

64
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,979
Look!

65
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:20,079
Isn't that your car, Michiwaki?

66
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,179
What? Why is it moving?

67
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:24,879
Oh, no! There's a cliff up ahead!

68
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:34,679
Please come again...

69
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,079
What?

70
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,979
Hold on, sir. You haven't paid your bill.

71
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,279
Those are lock opening tools!

72
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:57,179
The side brake is disengaged!

73
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,879
Wake up, Sonoko! Sonoko!

74
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,579
I can't put full strength in while I'm running!

75
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,679
Oh, no! We're almost there!

76
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:10,079
Conan, get away from the car!

77
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,379
Ran.

78
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,579
Sonoko! Grab hold of me!

79
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,679
Hey! Are you all right!

80
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:49,279
Yes! Just barely?

81
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,479
That was close!

82
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,479
I'm glad you're safe!

83
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,879
Hey, you!

84
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,479
Why didn't you put the side brakes on?

85
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,079
Don't be ridiculous! I had them on!

86
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,679
If they weren't on,

87
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:04,479
the car would have fallen off the cliff a long time ago!

88
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,179
Someone released the side brakes!

89
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:08,779
What?

90
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:13,279
Someone broke into the car using lock picking tools!

91
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,179
Someone who wanted Sonoko dead.

92
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,779
I see...

93
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,979
So someone broke into the car

94
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,279
while Sonoko was asleep inside

95
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,079
and released the side brake

96
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,479
causing the car to move down this gentle grade

97
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,879
and fall over the cliff, is that right?

98
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,979
Here's the divers' report!

99
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,279
The side brakes of the car in the water were disengaged!

100
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:47,479
And we found this lying on the road.

101
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,979
These are lock picking tools!

102
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,479
Is this a professional hit?

103
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,879
It's been wiped clean of prints!

104
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,279
Did you find anything else?

105
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,179
No...

106
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,679
The only other thing we found was

107
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,779
a puddle of water that leaked out of the cooler box

108
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:06,179
where the car was parked in the parking lot.

109
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:11,679
Sonoko, did you see anyone suspicious lurking around the car?

110
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,679
I wouldn't know.

111
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,179
I didn't sleep much last night

112
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:18,479
so I was fast asleep in the car.

113
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,279
But ever since arriving in Izu,

114
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,879
we're being followed for some unknown reason.

115
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,179
The person who is following us is over there.

116
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:33,579
Would you mind identifying yourself?

117
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,779
I work at the inn the girls are staying at.

118
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,379
The inn is not busy during the afternoon and I had some free time

119
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,879
so I came here today to have some tea.

120
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,979
He's not the one!

121
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:49,779
When the car started moving,

122
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:55,679
he was already in the restaurant with us!

123
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,679
If he had broken into the car,

124
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,679
released the side brake and then come into the restaurant,

125
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,579
I could have seen him walk in.

126
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,579
I tried asking the waiter of the restaurant,

127
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:13,279
he told me the backdoor is always kept locked.

128
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,779
We first noticed him when he came out of the toilet

129
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:22,179
but there's no window leading out from inside the toilet!

130
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,079
And of course, Michiwaki is in the clear too!

131
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,779
He was having lunch with us at the time

132
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,179
and he never left the table.

133
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,679
Which means...

134
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,779
the most likely suspect is the man following us!

135
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,879
Who is he anyway?

136
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:49,168
Listen up, we'll take all your statements down at the station!

137
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,968
So please get into the cars!

138
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:52,968
Did you say car?

139
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:57,068
I don't feel like riding a car just yet.

140
00:09:57,068 --> 00:09:58,968
It scares me.

141
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:02,368
Then why don't you and I walk to the police station?

142
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,468
It's not far from here.

143
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,768
The view's nice, it'll refresh you.

144
00:10:07,768 --> 00:10:09,068
What do you say?

145
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:11,368
Yes, I'd like that!

146
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:13,468
Wait... Just a minute!

147
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:16,268
What if she's attacked again?

148
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:18,468
Sonoko does have brown hair, you know!

149
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:22,068
It's possible her assailant is also the murder suspect!

150
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:24,368
You have nothing to worry about!

151
00:10:24,368 --> 00:10:27,868
No one would be fool enough to attack her in broad daylight.

152
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,868
But there's always the possibility!

153
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,868
Don't worry, officer!

154
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:38,268
Michiwaki will be with me and so will Ran!

155
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:40,568
All right then, but don't stop off anywhere.

156
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,368
Please come straight to the station!

157
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:44,168
Yes, sir.

158
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:56,268
I can't believe it.

159
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:57,868
The attack at the inn last night

160
00:10:57,868 --> 00:10:59,468
and then the car incident just now.

161
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:01,868
What's with you anyway...

162
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:04,568
Sonoko... Are you sure you don't know what's going on?

163
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:06,568
No. I have no idea.

164
00:11:06,568 --> 00:11:10,168
Maybe it's because you're so charming?

165
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:13,268
Why is he after her?

166
00:11:13,268 --> 00:11:15,868
And if he wanted to kill her,

167
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:20,268
why didn't he do it when he broke into the car?

168
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:22,268
He didn't have to go through all that trouble

169
00:11:22,268 --> 00:11:24,168
of having the car go over the cliff.

170
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:27,968
There's no need to use such a roundabout way.

171
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:32,168
We planned on leaving Izu as soon as we had lunch

172
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:34,368
so we put all our bags in the car,

173
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,468
they are all gone up in flames now.

174
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:40,368
Darn it! Why is all of this happening?

175
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,168
All you lost was your luggage.

176
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,468
I lost my car too

177
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,268
Yes, you're right.

178
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,168
Just because you got involved with me,

179
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:50,368
I guess I brought you bad luck.

180
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:52,568
No, I don't think of it that way.

181
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:55,668
If not so unlucky, you lost was your memorable photos,

182
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:57,968
you can't replace those once they're gone.

183
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:02,468
All that's left is that one picture now.

184
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:03,568
Only one picture left?

185
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,868
You know, the one I'm going to show Shinichi.

186
00:12:06,868 --> 00:12:09,268
I have it on me at all times, you have nothing to worry about!

187
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:12,168
Eh? You still have it?

188
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:15,068
Get rid of it, you're making me mad!

189
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,168
That's it, it's that picture!

190
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:21,468
He wants to get rid of that picture!

191
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:24,068
That's why he had to send both the car over the cliff,

192
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,368
to get rid of both Sonoko and her luggage!

193
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:30,568
But I don't understand.

194
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:35,668
Why does he think Sonoko took an incriminating picture of him?

195
00:12:36,768 --> 00:12:42,268
There wasn't a single unusual photo in the bunch.

196
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:45,968
Or did I overlook something?

197
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:58,168
It's him again!

198
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,368
I think we're being followed.

199
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:03,068
What? Is it the killer?

200
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,368
Can you run?

201
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:05,368
Sure...

202
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,568
All right then, here we go!

203
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,068
Let's go too!

204
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:22,968
You're putting her into more danger by going into the woods!

205
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,368
No! This is more thrilling!

206
00:13:25,368 --> 00:13:27,168
-Right? -Oh, yes

207
00:13:27,168 --> 00:13:30,268
Let's split up and lose that guy!

208
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:38,768
That's strange...

209
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,368
If he's Sonoko's attacker,

210
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,568
why is he still after her?

211
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:44,568
All the pictures were burned.

212
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:51,168
A train?

213
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:52,768
That's right.

214
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:55,968
This is the woods where they found the body yesterday.

215
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,768
Then we passed this place the other night.

216
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:00,568
I'm sure a train went by.

217
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:04,468
What is this?

218
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,168
I'm missing something here.

219
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:23,868
Darn it. I lost them.

220
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:26,368
The situation's turning bad.

221
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,868
Give it up!

222
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:33,868
If you thought we'd keep running,

223
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:35,268
you made a big mistake!

224
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:41,368
It's your fault for wearing sandals

225
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,468
when you run in the woods.

226
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:45,168
Sandals?

227
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,968
It was you, right?

228
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:48,868
You attacked Sonoko last night at the inn

229
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,468
and then today you sent the car over the cliff!

230
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:53,768
Hold on there! That's...

231
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,068
No use lying.

232
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,868
Your hairy arms are proof enough!

233
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,468
Let's have a look.

234
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:01,768
There should be bite marks

235
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,568
where Sonoko bit you last night!

236
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:06,068
What? It can't be...

237
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:07,468
There's no bite marks!

238
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:09,668
Maybe on the other arm!

239
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:12,068
What? There are no marks on this arm either.

240
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:13,568
What's going on?

241
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,268
Who are you anyway?

242
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,268
Well, actually...

243
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:19,868
I'm a police officer of the Chiba Prefecture Police Department.

244
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,668
You're just showing me the cover,

245
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:24,368
I'm not stupid enough to fall for that trick.

246
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:27,068
My father was once a police officer,

247
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:28,668
you can't fool me!

248
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,668
When an officer has to identify themself,

249
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:37,368
they must display the first pace of their police identification!

250
00:15:37,368 --> 00:15:39,368
Shoji Terabayashi at your service.

251
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:40,568
Oh, my?

252
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:42,468
It's the real thing.

253
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:45,668
I've been following a suspect in a certain case...

254
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:47,068
A suspect?

255
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:48,268
Ran!

256
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,568
When you wear sandals,

257
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:52,868
you don't usually wear socks, do you?

258
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,768
I guess so.

259
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:57,368
Oh, no! Sonoko's in danger!

260
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,568
It hurts...

261
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:01,868
I stepped on a branch.

262
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:05,368
I guess wearing sandals in the woods wasn't such a good idea.

263
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:07,168
Are you all right?

264
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,568
Bite marks?

265
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,668
Why are you so surprised?

266
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:25,468
There's nothing to be so surprised about, is there?

267
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:29,268
After all, this is...

268
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:31,868
the bite mark you gave me last night.

269
00:16:37,368 --> 00:16:40,168
Yes! So, that's it!

270
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:43,368
Sonoko didn't bite an arm last night,

271
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,468
she bit his calf.

272
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,668
It was so dark, she couldn't make it out.

273
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:49,068
He thought Sonoko took his picture

274
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:54,168
because the sparks the train's pantograph produces,

275
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:56,968
lit his back at the time of the murder.

276
00:16:56,968 --> 00:17:00,668
When Sonoko passed by holding a camera,

277
00:17:00,668 --> 00:17:02,868
he jumped to the wrong conclusion.

278
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:06,568
He thought there'd be a shot of him with the victim!

279
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:10,768
That's right and I remember his saying...

280
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:14,368
Don't worry. You look good in anything.

281
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,968
Whether it's a yukata or a bathing suit!

282
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:18,568
The only time she wore a yukata

283
00:17:18,568 --> 00:17:21,268
was to the fireworks display two nights ago.

284
00:17:21,268 --> 00:17:23,168
We only met him yesterday,

285
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:26,068
how could he know what she looks like in a yukata?

286
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:28,468
Darn it! Why didn't I...

287
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,368
Why didn't I figure it out sooner?

288
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:33,968
What are you doing?

289
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:36,868
Give me that picture.

290
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:40,568
The picture you were going to have some detective to look at!

291
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:43,868
You probably thought you took a picture of a couple making out

292
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:46,868
but I was in the midst of committing murder!

293
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,668
Just like now!

294
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,468
Four? He killed four girls?

295
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,968
If he was responsible for the murder the other night...

296
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:56,368
Then she's probably the fourth.

297
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,768
For some reason, he kills only girls with brown hair!

298
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:02,868
I've had him marked for a long time.

299
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:06,168
I got him on a stolen vehicle charge once

300
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,068
but there wasn't enough proof on the murder charge.

301
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:12,368
I came to Izu because I heard there had been a similar case

302
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:15,568
and behold, there he is...

303
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:19,168
But by then he already killed someone!

304
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:21,068
I don't understand though.

305
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:23,068
He was in the restaurant the whole time,

306
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,568
why'd the car start moving on its own?

307
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:26,868
It was the ice.

308
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:31,268
-What? -He had a cooler box.

309
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:34,068
He took a wedge-shaped piece of ice out.

310
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,368
Put it under the left front tire

311
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:38,168
so it wouldn't move.

312
00:18:38,168 --> 00:18:42,968
Then pretended to talk to Sonoko who was inside

313
00:18:42,968 --> 00:18:45,568
and released the side brake.

314
00:18:45,568 --> 00:18:49,768
Then he left some lock picking tools on the ground!

315
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,068
To divert the Investigation.

316
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:53,768
I see...

317
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:57,568
That's why he left two spaces open when he parked,

318
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:01,268
so there'll be no cars obstructing his car's path when it moves.

319
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:04,368
On top of that, the melted ice could just appear to be water

320
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:07,568
that leaked out of the cooler box!

321
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:08,968
But why?

322
00:19:08,968 --> 00:19:11,768
Why does he kill only girls with brown hair?

323
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:13,168
I told you, didn't I?

324
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:15,368
A girl jilted me in a cruel way.

325
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,768
That's why... That's the reason...

326
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:20,368
Whenever I see flirty girls like you,

327
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,768
I get so mad.

328
00:19:22,768 --> 00:19:25,468
Girls with brown hair remind me of her,

329
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:28,568
how she ruined my life?

330
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,468
Look over there, isn't that Sonoko?

331
00:19:30,468 --> 00:19:31,568
What?

332
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:33,868
Oh, no!

333
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,468
Why? I don't get it!

334
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:41,368
Why all the men that get close to me are so weird!

335
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,768
I hate you, God!

336
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,168
Are you all right?

337
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:56,168
I'm fine. How about you?

338
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:57,868
Oh, this?

339
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:08,968
Now I remember!

340
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:11,468
I knew I'd seen that guy with the glasses before,

341
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:13,068
it was at the tournament!

342
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:14,368
What?

343
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:18,068
He's captain of the Haido High School Karate Club!

344
00:20:18,068 --> 00:20:19,868
He is the Kick Attack King!

345
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:27,068
Makoto Kyougoku.

346
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:29,368
Amazing!

347
00:20:29,368 --> 00:20:32,668
You're a very reckless lady.

348
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:35,368
You're just lucky I had some free time

349
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:36,768
and just happened to be close by.

350
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,368
Free time?

351
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:41,168
Do you mean you were following me all this time?

352
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:44,468
That's right, I was following you!

353
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,668
Until I lost sight of you in the woods.

354
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:50,768
I knew you might think I was a stalker.

355
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:55,668
Before he met you,

356
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:58,368
he'd been flirting with a few other girls,

357
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,668
it got me worried.

358
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:02,368
Why did you worry about me?

359
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:04,368
You didn't even know me...

360
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,368
You didn't notice me

361
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:10,668
but I'd seen you once before, at a karate tournament.

362
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:14,568
You were cheering like mad for your friend.

363
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:18,268
I never dreamed you'd reserve a room in our inn.

364
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:23,368
Oh, and...

365
00:21:23,368 --> 00:21:26,168
I suggest you stop wearing outfits

366
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:28,368
that looks like child clothes,

367
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:31,368
it arouses the guys more than necessary.

368
00:21:31,368 --> 00:21:32,668
Of course!

369
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,368
You're free to ignore my advice

370
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:37,868
and pass it off as just another casual remark

371
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,968
made by one of your many suitors.

372
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:29,468
"Teitan High School" -What? Makoto's gone abroad to study?

373
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:30,968
But why?

374
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:33,768
You and he were getting along so tell since then, weren't you?

375
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:36,868
He said there was no one strong left in Japan

376
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:39,368
so he went off to train abroad.

377
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,068
"Mouri Detective Agency, 3 days later"

378
00:23:41,068 --> 00:23:45,968
Ran, let's go see the baseball team's practice game!

379
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:48,468
The other team's ace is a sophomore,

380
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,968
I hear he's so cute and just so adorable!

381
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:55,668
Good grief. I thought you were going to wait for Makoto to return.

382
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:56,968
That was then.

383
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,468
This is now.

384
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:02,168
I knew it.

385
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:06,068
"Next Episode"

386
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:15,468
There's a key in the water...

387
00:24:15,468 --> 00:24:17,068
A window?

388
00:24:17,068 --> 00:24:18,268
No...

389
00:24:18,268 --> 00:24:22,868
No one could get in and out through there!

390
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:24,968
What trick did the killer use to lock this room?

391
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:27,868
There's a key in the water...

392
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,368
Next Conan,

393
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,389
"Case Of The Key Underwater In A Locked Room"

394
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,370
Next Conan's hint:

395
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,270
"Crayon"

396
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,670
In the next episode, the key is the key!

397
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,070
-What does that mean? -I don't understand.

398
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,470
Will you keep quiet?
