1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.340
So, you like tennis?

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.740
Oh, yes! It's quite thrilling!

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.740
Thrilling you say? Lucky you.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.140
Well, you can expect a greater thrill soon.

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.440
What?

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.340
A person is about to be murdered,

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.040
somewhere in London...

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.640
Right before your eyes.

9
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.540
Tell Scotland Yard

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.140
that's my revelation.

11
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.540
If it doesn't make sense, go to Holmes.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.040
You must be true to yourself.

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.840
Conan Edogawa is cornered.

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
Ran can't find out about this!

16
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.540
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.940
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:36.291
We end up going to London

20
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.291
because of a coincidental encounter with

21
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.391
an English woman called Diana, who invites us over.

22
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:46.391
Of course I can't leave the country as Conan Edogawa,

23
00:02:46.391 --> 00:02:48.191
so I returned to being Shinichi Kudo temporarily

24
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:50.991
using the drug that Ai gave me,

25
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.791
and headed for London separate from Ran and Pops.

26
00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:59.291
The sanctuary of Sherlock Holmes, the one I adore.

27
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:01.891
I've got so many places I want to go to that I'm in a fix!

28
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.991
But, waiting for us there

29
00:03:06.991 --> 00:03:09.991
was the premonition of a gravely serious crime.

30
00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:14.491
Apollo, the little brother of a famous tennis player, Minerva Grass

31
00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:15.491
was given a piece of paper with a mysterious code

32
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:17.591
written on it by a suspicious man.

33
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.891
Along with the words, "Someone will die right before your eyes"...

34
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:28.091
on the piece of paper were mysterious coded sentences.

35
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:32.991
"I will awake at the loud sound of the ringing bell."

36
00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:36.891
"I'm a long nosed wizard that lives in a castle."

37
00:03:36.891 --> 00:03:41.591
"I fill myself up with boiled eggs as cold as a corpse."

38
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:45.791
"All I need to do now is bite on a whole pickle."

39
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:50.291
"That's right, I have to order a cake for celebration."

40
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.791
"The sound of the bell stirs up hate in me."

41
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.591
"Finish everything off,"

42
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:59.291
"stab and pierce the white back with two swords."

43
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.991
What is the man trying to relay, anyway?

44
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.691
I went on behalf of Apollo

45
00:04:05.691 --> 00:04:08.891
and delivered the piece of paper to Scotland Yard.

46
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.991
There we found out that a lot of other children

47
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.191
had also received the same coded sentences.

48
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.491
Somebody's going to die in front of all these children.

49
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.691
Don't tell me

50
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:22.991
this is a coded advanced warning of a massacre?

51
00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:31.391
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Love is 0)"

52
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:40.191
The Great Britain Museum.

53
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:46.691
The Buckingham Palace.

54
00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:50.291
Hyde Park.

55
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:56.091
Well...

56
00:04:56.091 --> 00:04:59.491
We tried going to places where a crowd of people would gather, but...

57
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.091
There were no suspicious places.

58
00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:05.091
There was no person passing out strange leaflets either.

59
00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:08.591
Well, it was good that we could take a city tour of London, though.

60
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:10.391
Don't be silly!

61
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:13.991
I was concentrating on finding suspicious characters

62
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.391
that I didn't enjoy touring at all!

63
00:05:16.391 --> 00:05:17.691
My God.

64
00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:20.591
I'll go get us something to drink, so you wait here!

65
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:21.991
Okay.

66
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.791
A code...

67
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.491
I tried taking a picture of it with my cell phone too, but...

68
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.291
It's all Greek to me.

69
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:38.091
But I'm sure that Shinichi would be able to solve it.

70
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:41.691
I'd like to call him and ask him for advice,

71
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:43.291
but I wonder if I should.

72
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:46.891
What's with you, Shinichi, you punk!

73
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:51.191
I hung up on him after shouting at him.

74
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:52.891
But...

75
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.591
I guess it's understandable that he would be in a bad mood.

76
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.791
I'm sure it sounded like I was bragging

77
00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:59.391
about coming to the land that he adores

78
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:02.691
all by myself without him.

79
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.691
How stupid of me.

80
00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:06.891
To get carried away all by myself...

81
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.691
I went as far as to check something like this

82
00:06:09.691 --> 00:06:11.391
on the net and made it, and yet...

83
00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:16.091
I'm really... stupid.

84
00:06:17.891 --> 00:06:20.091
Love hurts, doesn't it?

85
00:06:26.891 --> 00:06:28.591
Doesn't it?

86
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:30.691
Well, no...

87
00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:33.991
Yes, something like that.

88
00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:37.791
You can't ask him for advice, then.

89
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:41.291
He's not an expert in that field, I'm afraid.

90
00:06:42.691 --> 00:06:45.591
-Who is he? -Up there.

91
00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:52.891
Sherlock Holmes!

92
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:55.091
I see!

93
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:59.391
I came back to Baker Street again without being aware.

94
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:02.191
Oh, you're Japanese?

95
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:04.791
Yes.

96
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:08.391
-Right. -How nostalgic, the Japanese language.

97
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.591
I used to live in Japan, too.

98
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:14.491
Because my mother underwent eye surgery in Japan,

99
00:07:14.491 --> 00:07:18.291
and was hospitalized there for a while.

100
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:21.291
Are you by any chance...

101
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.691
Ms. Minerva Grass?

102
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.491
The tennis player!

103
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:26.691
If people start making a fuss,

104
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.591
I won't be able to come here anymore!

105
00:07:35.591 --> 00:07:37.691
Do you come here often?

106
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:38.891
Yes.

107
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:41.891
For sure before competing in the Wimbledon finals.

108
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:43.891
In order to draw on Holmes' powers of observation

109
00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:47.291
and discernment to lead me to victory.

110
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:49.491
You like Holmes, don't you?

111
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:52.791
Well, I guess I was strongly influenced by my mother.

112
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:56.591
My father is German, but my mother is English.

113
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.491
She's a Sherlockian through and through.

114
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:01.491
My mother lost her vision,

115
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:05.191
so now she can only read Conan Doyle in Braille, though.

116
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:06.991
And 8 years ago,

117
00:08:06.991 --> 00:08:09.291
my father died in a traffic accident

118
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:11.991
along with my sister who was 6 years younger than me.

119
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:16.191
Minerva!

120
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:17.691
When my father died,

121
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:20.391
the one who was in my mother's stomach was Apollo, over there!

122
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:24.791
So, at present, I'm the breadwinner for the Grass family!

123
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.491
I thought he was still around here

124
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:29.491
because he hadn't called.

125
00:08:29.491 --> 00:08:31.091
But he isn't.

126
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:33.691
Oh, that's too bad.

127
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:37.591
He really a disciple of Holmes!

128
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:39.491
Wait.

129
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:42.391
How did you know?

130
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:45.591
That I was troubled over love?

131
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:51.391
Because you had the same look on your face

132
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:56.091
that I saw in the mirror of myself some time ago.

133
00:08:56.091 --> 00:08:59.391
Which means, that you're also troubled over love?

134
00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:02.591
But I'm not troubled anymore.

135
00:09:02.591 --> 00:09:04.391
Like Holmes also says,

136
00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:07.191
love is an emotional thing.

137
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:12.091
It is does not go hand in hand with calm, logical thinking,

138
00:09:12.091 --> 00:09:14.591
that I respect above all things.

139
00:09:15.891 --> 00:09:18.091
You know, the same goes for tennis.

140
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.091
Love is 0 (Zero).

141
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:23.191
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

142
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:25.291
the end result is miserable defeat.

143
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:33.591
Wrong!

144
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:36.091
This isn't the place!

145
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:38.591
This isn't it, either!

146
00:09:40.091 --> 00:09:41.591
Darn it!

147
00:09:41.591 --> 00:09:45.991
There is no place near a castle where there are two clock shops,

148
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:48.791
a food shop and cake shop,

149
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:51.291
along with a shop that sells weapons cluttered together!

150
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:55.291
Hey, hey. It's already 8:00 at night!

151
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:57.391
Just what're you talking about?

152
00:09:57.391 --> 00:09:59.291
It's still this bright.

153
00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:01.391
I see!

154
00:10:01.391 --> 00:10:03.391
At this time of season, the vicinity of London

155
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.491
doesn't get dark until after 9:00 at night.

156
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:14.391
Ran, what's up?

157
00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:16.691
What do you mean, what's up?

158
00:10:16.691 --> 00:10:18.291
I told you that we were going to have dinner

159
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:21.991
at the hotel restaurant at 8:00, didn't I?

160
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:24.791
I'm sorry, Doc and I were absorbed

161
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.791
in trying to decipher the code, so...

162
00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:30.091
We've already started eating, you know!

163
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:33.091
Then, Doc and I'll pass up the dinner.

164
00:10:33.091 --> 00:10:35.691
We can go get some fish and chips around here.

165
00:10:35.691 --> 00:10:36.891
Hey, hey.

166
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:38.991
Hey, where are you anyway?

167
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:41.691
I wonder where this is.

168
00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:44.691
Isn't there any landmarks or something nearby?

169
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:46.791
Let's see...

170
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:49.491
There's a big Ferris Wheel right nearby!

171
00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:50.991
The London Eye!

172
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:52.891
So, that's the story.

173
00:10:52.891 --> 00:10:54.291
Wait...

174
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:02.491
London Eye, my foot!

175
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:05.591
We're near the Big Ben!

176
00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:07.391
I had no choice, did I?

177
00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:08.691
If she comes to get us,

178
00:11:08.691 --> 00:11:11.991
we'll have to quit investigating on this dangerous code.

179
00:11:11.991 --> 00:11:15.691
But I think Ran will be worried.

180
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.391
Don't worry! We'll be back at the hotel

181
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:20.091
about the time they finish having dinner!

182
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:24.891
May I be excused?

183
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:27.491
I'll call my company.

184
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:29.191
Oh, you will.

185
00:11:30.191 --> 00:11:32.891
Wait here! I'll go get the two and bring them here!

186
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:35.291
What?

187
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:36.891
Hey!

188
00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:43.091
Now, can I ask about your successful adventures?

189
00:11:43.091 --> 00:11:45.191
Mr. Sleeping Detective.

190
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:49.991
What speaking now?

191
00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:54.991
As you can see, I've brought a party of friends tonight.

192
00:11:54.991 --> 00:11:58.891
Since I learned you're a famous detective in Japan...

193
00:11:58.891 --> 00:12:02.391
Now, start your story, okay?

194
00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:04.991
Okay.

195
00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:09.491
The London Eye...

196
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.991
It's quite a distance away.

197
00:12:11.991 --> 00:12:13.391
I've got no choice.

198
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:14.991
I'll run over there.

199
00:12:14.991 --> 00:12:17.391
It's not far enough to take a cab besides.

200
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:21.391
I tell you, that Conan,

201
00:12:21.391 --> 00:12:23.191
to be absorbed in making deductions

202
00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:24.891
to the point of forgetting that he's hungry.

203
00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:26.491
He just like...

204
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:30.991
He's just like...

205
00:12:30.991 --> 00:12:32.991
Holmes said,

206
00:12:32.991 --> 00:12:36.591
that your brain works better on an empty stomach!

207
00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:45.091
I guess I'll try calling Shinichi after all.

208
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:49.091
It really looks like an urgent code in need of deciphering.

209
00:12:49.091 --> 00:12:52.691
But I just can't make myself call him.

210
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:56.091
But...

211
00:12:56.091 --> 00:12:58.291
In other words,

212
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:01.391
a lot of people may be killed at once, right?

213
00:13:07.991 --> 00:13:09.791
This code may not be

214
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:14.391
indicating a store that's selling things.

215
00:13:14.391 --> 00:13:15.691
Yeah.

216
00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:17.791
The first line says,

217
00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:21.691
"I will awake with the sound of the bell ringing."

218
00:13:21.691 --> 00:13:22.791
The next goes,

219
00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:26.291
"I am a long nosed wizard that lives in a castle."

220
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:31.791
"I fill my stomach up with boiled eggs as cold as a corpse."

221
00:13:33.391 --> 00:13:37.391
"All I have to do is bite on a whole pickle to finish it off."

222
00:13:38.891 --> 00:13:42.891
"That's right, I've got to order a cake for celebration."

223
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:47.091
"The sound of the bell ringing stirs up hate in me."

224
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:52.191
And finally, it says, "Finish everything off.

225
00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:55.791
Stab and pierce the white back with two swords."

226
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:58.791
It all sounds totally Greek to me.

227
00:13:58.791 --> 00:14:01.591
If I can only decipher the first line

228
00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:02.991
that reads, "The sound of the ringing bell",

229
00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:05.091
then maybe it would serve as a clue.

230
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:11.291
It's Ran again.

231
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:14.591
Let me concentrate on the code.

232
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:15.891
Hello?

233
00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:18.691
Sorry, Shinichi?

234
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.591
It's me.

235
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:23.791
Oh no! It's Shinichi's cell phone!

236
00:14:23.791 --> 00:14:25.191
You were still sleeping, weren't you?

237
00:14:25.191 --> 00:14:27.991
Since it's 5:00 in the morning yet in Japan, right?

238
00:14:27.991 --> 00:14:30.491
No, I was awake.

239
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:32.291
I was thinking something over.

240
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:33.891
I'm sorry about a while ago

241
00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:37.191
for shouting at you and hanging up the phone.

242
00:14:37.191 --> 00:14:40.291
I'm here in the land that you always wanted to come to

243
00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:42.691
and got carried away all by myself.

244
00:14:42.691 --> 00:14:44.791
It sounded as if I was just bragging.

245
00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:47.091
It didn't really bother me!

246
00:14:47.091 --> 00:14:49.891
My hands were really tied back then.

247
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:52.891
I see. I'm sorry!

248
00:14:52.891 --> 00:14:56.891
I have a code that I'd like you to decipher.

249
00:14:58.391 --> 00:15:02.391
If it's that code, Conan the kid forwarded it to me.

250
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:05.691
The fact is, I stayed up all night thinking about that code.

251
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:12.191
But I'm stuck at the part, "The ringing bell..."

252
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:15.691
The ringing!

253
00:15:15.691 --> 00:15:17.391
Sound of the bell.

254
00:15:41.438 --> 00:15:44.138
I get it. It's Big Ben! Big Ben!

255
00:15:44.138 --> 00:15:47.138
-Huh? -You can hear it, can't you?

256
00:15:47.138 --> 00:15:49.738
The chime of this Big Ben.

257
00:15:49.738 --> 00:15:53.138
This is what the ringing sound of the bell is indicating!

258
00:15:53.138 --> 00:15:55.338
This Big Ben...

259
00:15:57.138 --> 00:16:00.138
Hey, Shinichi, just what is the meaning of this?

260
00:16:00.138 --> 00:16:01.438
Well...

261
00:16:01.438 --> 00:16:03.638
Don't tell me you're here? In London?

262
00:16:03.638 --> 00:16:09.238
On TV, there's a live broadcast of London airing just now.

263
00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:12.338
You're here, aren't you?

264
00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:16.038
Well, another call's coming in! See you then!

265
00:16:20.538 --> 00:16:23.538
I see.

266
00:16:23.538 --> 00:16:26.138
That's why he acted so indifferent

267
00:16:26.138 --> 00:16:27.238
and wanted to hang up right away acting as if

268
00:16:27.238 --> 00:16:29.738
I got him at the wrong time when I called him last.

269
00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:32.438
It was because he's here in London!

270
00:16:39.238 --> 00:16:41.738
Oh no! Ran's coming!

271
00:16:41.738 --> 00:16:46.838
Hey, we're supposed to be near the London Eye, you know?

272
00:16:46.838 --> 00:16:50.138
At any rate...

273
00:16:50.138 --> 00:16:51.438
Let's get out of here.

274
00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:53.638
I guess so!

275
00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:02.638
Well, that's the way I threw the culprit over

276
00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:04.838
using the Judo technique of one arm shoulder throw.

277
00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:06.638
Oh, baritsu!

278
00:17:06.638 --> 00:17:10.538
Baritsu? No, no. Judo!

279
00:17:10.538 --> 00:17:12.438
That's baritsu.

280
00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:15.638
Which Holmes performed on Professor Moriarty when they fell!

281
00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:19.538
Mastering baritsu means you're a brilliant detective!

282
00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.738
I don't know what's going on.

283
00:17:21.738 --> 00:17:26.638
Oh, yes! I am strong detective!

284
00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:33.138
I thought it was funny

285
00:17:33.138 --> 00:17:35.738
that Shinichi didn't sound envious!

286
00:17:35.738 --> 00:17:37.738
I won't let him get away, never!

287
00:17:39.238 --> 00:17:40.938
Excuse me.

288
00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:46.838
Have you seen a Japanese boy?

289
00:17:46.838 --> 00:17:48.338
Yes, I have!

290
00:17:48.338 --> 00:17:52.338
I do believe he was rushing to the bridge over there.

291
00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:56.438
No joke. You mean the bridge I just crossed?

292
00:17:56.438 --> 00:17:58.738
He crossed the other side on the opposite side.

293
00:18:03.438 --> 00:18:05.738
Shinichi!

294
00:18:07.738 --> 00:18:08.938
Oh no!

295
00:18:08.938 --> 00:18:10.338
We've got to spend time somewhere

296
00:18:10.338 --> 00:18:11.938
or she'll catch up with us!

297
00:18:11.938 --> 00:18:14.138
Two Japanese together will stand out!

298
00:18:14.138 --> 00:18:16.138
Once we cross the bridge, let's split up and flee!

299
00:18:16.138 --> 00:18:18.138
I guess so!

300
00:18:21.038 --> 00:18:23.338
Hey. Are you okay?

301
00:18:23.338 --> 00:18:25.538
That hurts.

302
00:18:25.538 --> 00:18:28.838
The lid for this drain came off.

303
00:18:30.438 --> 00:18:32.938
There're some words beside the drainage.

304
00:18:34.438 --> 00:18:38.038
The Valley of Fear.

305
00:18:38.038 --> 00:18:40.938
It's one of the titles of Holmes' story.

306
00:18:40.938 --> 00:18:43.538
Come on, hurry!

307
00:18:43.538 --> 00:18:45.138
Yeah.

308
00:18:48.238 --> 00:18:50.338
Why was it in a place like that?

309
00:18:57.438 --> 00:19:00.438
Did you see a Japanese boy?

310
00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:03.338
Yes, I did. I saw him running over there!

311
00:19:06.538 --> 00:19:08.138
Excuse me!

312
00:19:08.938 --> 00:19:10.338
Excuse me!

313
00:19:11.138 --> 00:19:12.938
Excuse me!

314
00:19:13.938 --> 00:19:16.338
I just passed him.

315
00:19:18.438 --> 00:19:20.438
Excuse me!

316
00:19:20.438 --> 00:19:23.738
Have you seen a Japanese boy?

317
00:19:23.738 --> 00:19:25.838
That boy has...

318
00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:28.438
run into a phone booth just now.

319
00:19:30.338 --> 00:19:31.738
Thanks.

320
00:19:31.738 --> 00:19:33.738
Oh no!

321
00:19:34.738 --> 00:19:36.338
If she finds me now,

322
00:19:36.338 --> 00:19:38.938
she'll find out that I'm Shinichi!

323
00:19:44.938 --> 00:19:47.638
Darn it! I've got no choice but to!

324
00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:55.338
Shinichi.

325
00:19:55.338 --> 00:19:58.038
You can't run away from me anymore.

326
00:19:58.038 --> 00:20:00.638
You'd better have a good explanation.

327
00:20:01.438 --> 00:20:03.638
Shinichi!

328
00:20:27.138 --> 00:20:29.038
Explanation, nothing.

329
00:20:29.038 --> 00:20:32.038
It just so happened I came here to London too.

330
00:20:33.338 --> 00:20:35.538
Hey, hey. Don't tell me you drank the antidote

331
00:20:35.538 --> 00:20:37.638
that you were going to drink upon departure?

332
00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:41.738
Then, why'd you run away?

333
00:20:41.738 --> 00:20:44.038
That's well...

334
00:20:44.038 --> 00:20:48.338
I missed the chance to tell you about it,

335
00:20:48.338 --> 00:20:50.738
so I felt sort of uncomfortable.

336
00:20:50.738 --> 00:20:53.338
Why didn't you tell me?

337
00:20:53.338 --> 00:20:56.038
You had a lot of chances to tell me, didn't you?

338
00:20:56.038 --> 00:20:57.638
So that's...

339
00:20:57.638 --> 00:20:59.838
So stupid.

340
00:20:59.838 --> 00:21:01.538
How stupid of me.

341
00:21:01.538 --> 00:21:04.838
Getting carried away all by myself.

342
00:21:04.838 --> 00:21:07.038
I checked on a lot of things

343
00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:09.338
and worried more than I could handle.

344
00:21:10.638 --> 00:21:12.838
I feel so stupid!

345
00:21:14.938 --> 00:21:17.438
It's just like she said.

346
00:21:17.438 --> 00:21:19.338
Love is 0.

347
00:21:19.338 --> 00:21:20.738
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

348
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:22.638
the result is miserable defeat.

349
00:21:22.638 --> 00:21:25.138
Just what're you talking about?

350
00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:27.938
Minerva Grass said so!

351
00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:30.238
Minerva Grass, you mean...

352
00:21:30.238 --> 00:21:32.938
You met the Grass Queen?

353
00:21:32.938 --> 00:21:35.638
I met her! On Baker Street!

354
00:21:35.638 --> 00:21:36.738
Does it bug you?

355
00:21:36.738 --> 00:21:38.438
Baker Street?

356
00:21:38.438 --> 00:21:41.438
Wasn't there a child nearby then?

357
00:21:41.438 --> 00:21:42.738
Yes, there was.

358
00:21:42.738 --> 00:21:45.038
She said he was her younger brother.

359
00:21:45.038 --> 00:21:47.738
He... Didn't that boy say anything?

360
00:21:47.738 --> 00:21:50.438
Like, he remembered something so he came back?

361
00:21:51.838 --> 00:21:54.638
Hey, cool head.

362
00:21:54.638 --> 00:21:57.038
Cool head?

363
00:21:57.038 --> 00:21:58.938
Don't you get it?

364
00:21:58.938 --> 00:22:01.438
You're a detective, aren't you?

365
00:22:01.438 --> 00:22:02.438
If you're a detective,

366
00:22:02.438 --> 00:22:04.838
why don't you deduce how I'm feeling inside?

367
00:22:04.838 --> 00:22:07.638
Idiot!

368
00:22:07.638 --> 00:22:09.238
Hey, hold it!

369
00:22:09.238 --> 00:22:10.338
Ran!

370
00:22:11.938 --> 00:22:13.338
I'm telling you, wait!

371
00:22:16.738 --> 00:22:18.038
Ran!

372
00:23:58.338 --> 00:24:00.838
"Next Episode" -Mazarin Stone.

373
00:24:00.838 --> 00:24:02.838
Mazarin Stone.

374
00:24:02.838 --> 00:24:06.838
It seems that they came up with a suspect from fingerprints

375
00:24:06.838 --> 00:24:09.238
that were found on the piece of paper that the code was written on!

376
00:24:09.238 --> 00:24:11.138
He seems to be exploding all the hospitals

377
00:24:11.138 --> 00:24:12.638
that refused to perform surgery on his mother.

378
00:24:12.638 --> 00:24:16.338
Explode... You mean by using bombs?

379
00:24:16.338 --> 00:24:18.038
Talking on the phone's getting us nowhere!

380
00:24:18.038 --> 00:24:19.838
I'll be over right away!

381
00:24:19.838 --> 00:24:21.238
Huh?

382
00:24:22.738 --> 00:24:28.217
Next Conan, "Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (Satan)"

383
00:24:29.206 --> 00:24:31.306
Next Conan's Hint:

384
00:24:31.306 --> 00:24:33.606
"Alphabet"

385
00:24:33.606 --> 00:24:35.606
Oh no! Ran looks really angered.

386
00:24:35.606 --> 00:24:36.706
If it were an "anchor",

387
00:24:36.706 --> 00:24:38.102
we could sink it into the water, but with anger...
