(Congratulations Yuichiro Asakura)

5
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,680
Now then, Governor Asakura.

6
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,310
Please say a few words to the audience.

7
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,690
(Yuichiro Asaura (66) Tokyo Governor)
Ahem.

8
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,060
To the 13 million people of Tokyo,

9
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,670
and to railroad fans around the nation,

10
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,350
it's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

11
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:30,990
(Congratulations on Starting of Toto Line Subway Service)

12
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,110
The 15th line of the Metropolitan Subway,

13
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,230
will now begin its inaugural journey!

14
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,010
Blackmail?! The Tokyo Governor?

15
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,890
It was sent yesterday afternoon

16
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,480
to Mr. Asakura's residence.

17
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,830
There is no sender listed.

18
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,070
This is fate punishing you

19
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,690
for the arrogance your administration
has displayed these past four years.

20
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,880
Arrogance...?

21
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Hasn't Mr. Asakura's first term

22
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,530
been well received?

23
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,700
Well, everyone interprets
things their own way.

24
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,660
There will always be people who are
angry or dissatisfied, even for no reason.

25
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,800
Yes. Shiratori-kun is right.

26
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,580
Tomorrow, Mr Asakura

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,230
will attend the inaugural ceremony
for the new subway line.

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,860
We've been assigned

29
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,360
to protect the governor at the ceremony.

30
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,060
Don't let your guard down.

31
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,550
The governor has now boarded the train.

32
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,420
I'm looking forward
to the outer space exhibition.

33
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,360
There's even a space-flight simulator.

34
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,650
I wanna try that!

35
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,110
But it seems one of us
has his mind on something else.

36
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,950
Huh?

37
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,240
You're worried, aren't you?

38
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,160
It must be the blackmail letter
sent to the governor

39
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,560
that Inspector Megure told Mouri about.

40
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,130
Yes... I hope it turns out to be nothing.

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,350
Huh?

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,070
Is that so?

43
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,530
Yes.

44
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,450
From this point,
we enter the Shin Yamate Tunnel.

45
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Ah!

46
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,380
That reminds me.

47
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,890
- This tunnel intersects the Toto line.
- That's right.

48
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,480
(Toto Line, Shin Yamate Tunnel)
After the two lines come together, we'll pass beneath the subway.

49
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,090
We'll be parallel with the subway
for about 1 km.

50
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,000
Here's the curve.

51
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,970
After this turn,
we'll converge with the Toto line.

52
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,230
What's wrong, Conan-kun?

53
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,430
Huh? Oh...

54
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,540
What was that figure just now?

55
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,340
There were no cars or motorcycles stopped
in the emergency lane

56
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,850
and they seemed to be holding something...

57
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,270
Don't tell me!

58
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,640
Professor! Stop the car!

59
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,750
Huh? What is it?!

60
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,850
A bomb.

61
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,980
There's a bomb set in the tunnel!

62
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,780
- What?!
- A b-b-bomb?

63
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,040
A bomb, you say?

64
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,380
B-but...

65
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,270
We can't stop until we reach
the next emergency lane.

66
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,550
Conan-kun!

67
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,370
They activated the bomb!

68
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,020
Damn!

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,430
Yes? This is Megure.

70
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,690
It's me, Kudo.

71
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,970
Please stop the train, immediately!

72
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,170
A bomb is about to go off!

73
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
A bomb?!

74
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Takagi-kun!

75
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,100
Stop the train!

76
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,090
There's a bomb!

77
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
What?!

78
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,650
Was that an earthquake?

79
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,010
No. Worse.

80
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,530
A train!

81
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,690
That's the Toto Line!

82
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,670
Kudo-kun!

83
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,820
Oh no, I think there's a curve up ahead!

84
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,870
- Stop!
- Come on, stop!

85
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,540
Stop!

86
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Stop!

87
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,070
Please stop!

88
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Are they saved?

89
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,530
Governor! Are you injured?

90
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,750
I-I'm fine.

91
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Thank you.

92
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,990
I'm the high school student detective
Shinichi Kudo.

93
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,140
I had come to an amusement park with my
childhood friend and classmate Ran Mouri,

94
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,080
when I saw a man in the Black Organization
making a suspicious transaction.

95
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,200
I was so focused on witnessing the trade,

96
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,080
that I didn't notice his companion
approaching me from behind.

97
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,800
The man forced a poison pill
down my throat

98
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,300
and when I awoke,

99
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,800
my body had shrunk.

100
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,140
If my enemies figured out
that I'm still alive,

101
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,930
they might come after me again

102
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,770
and those around me would be in danger.

103
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,350
At the advice of Professor Agasa,
I decided to hide my true identity,

104
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,480
and when Ran happened to ask my name,

105
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,230
I immediately replied Conan Edogawa.

106
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,500
Then, to gain information on my foes,

107
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,240
I moved into the home of Ran,
whose father is a detective.

108
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,100
These are my classmates now.

109
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,250
Genta, Mitsuhiko, Ayumi.

110
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,080
Together, they formed the Detective Boys
and forced me to be a member.

111
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,130
Finally,

112
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,400
this old man is Kogoro Mouri.

113
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Huh?

114
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,990
I don't need to explain any more, do I?

115
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,520
These two mechanical devices
were invented by Professor Agasa.

116
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
Since I shrunk in size,

117
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,520
he's made me lots of unique inventions.

118
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,520
Like this belt that can
produce balls anywhere.

119
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,280
It's an amazing device

120
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,490
that inflates and shoots balls
at the press of a button.

121
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,280
And the highlight of our current case.
A highly advanced snowboard

122
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,360
that can move, even on flat ground,
whenever the accelerator is pressed.

123
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,750
Of course, it also has
the same turbo engine as my skateboard.

124
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
By the way,

125
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,420
the professor is not the only one

126
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,050
who knows my true identity.

127
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,730
Ai Haibara.

128
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,590
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

129
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,310
At one time,

130
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,410
she was an ally of the Black Organization.

131
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,750
But after a certain incident,
she tried to take her own life

132
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,520
and drank the same poison
that made me small.

133
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,230
After that, she moved in with the Professor

134
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,690
and the two of us began to live
as first graders.

135
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,350
Even if our bodies have shrunk,
our brains remain the same.

136
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,400
No maze is too great
for a great detective...

137
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,390
and only one truth will prevail!

138
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,800
The bomb was made with plastic explosives.

139
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,120
It was detonated via remote control,

140
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,840
and was also equipped with a timer.

141
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,660
About the timer...

142
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,200
According to Conan Edogawa,
a boy who saw the culprit,

143
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,240
the bomber waited
until the subway passed above him

144
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,350
and then activated
the bomb with the remote.

145
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,440
The subway runs at a maximum speed
of 60 km per hour.

146
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,150
There was a distance of 250 meters
between the emergency lane and the bomb.

147
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,200
This means the timer must have been set
to go off in 15 seconds.

148
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,140
If the conductor had not
applied the emergency brake,

149
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,270
the impact of the blast

150
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,250
would have created a major disaster.

151
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,380
Who was it that phoned Inspector Megure
and told him to stop the train?

152
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,420
Oh, that was...

153
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,760
We'll just say it was someone

154
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,060
who collaborates with the police.

155
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,620
Either way, no passengers were injured,

156
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,180
including Governor Asakura.

157
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,950
Inspector, as always,

158
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,570
please refrain from using my name.

159
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,300
I wouldn't want my case load
to get any bigger.

160
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,170
His case load...?

161
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,830
He's a high-school student...

162
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:30,290
In addition, thanks to the young boy Conan,
no cars were damaged by the blast.

163
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,790
We can only call it a miracle.

164
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,170
How was it that the boy Conan Edogawa

165
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,420
was able to notice the bomb?

166
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,460
It's because he was told
to be on the lookout

167
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,260
by Kogoro Mouri, who is here with us today.

168
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,580
Huh? Wait...

169
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,350
- The Great Detective Mouri does it again!
- No, I... Did I say that?

170
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,120
Mouri-san, do you have any words
for the culprit?

171
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,270
What? Oh, uh...

172
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,780
Well... this crime was clearly intended

173
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,940
to harm the life of Governor Asakura

174
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,660
before his second term,
as well as the new subway line

175
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,660
that is one of the milestones of
his first term!

176
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,950
It's unforgivable!

177
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,190
What do we know
about the bomber at this point?

178
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,280
Unfortunately,

179
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,100
the surveillance cameras inside the tunnel

180
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,050
did not cover the emergency lane.

181
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,380
We also believe the bomber
used the emergency exit

182
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,780
and fled via the slope that leads
to the expressway above.

183
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,100
At this time,
we have not located any witnesses.

184
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,560
Conan-kun, too,

185
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,950
could not discern the bomber's age,
gender, or any other specifics.

186
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,940
The police department believes

187
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,980
it was someone with their own private
grudge or dissatisfaction

188
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,920
at the past four years

189
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,320
of Governor's Asakura's administration.

190
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,570
We will begin our investigation
from that angle.

191
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No further questions.

192
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,750
You have just seen a live broadcast
of the Metropolitan Police Department.

193
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,630
What? It's over already?

194
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,810
They didn't say anything

195
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,660
about the Detective Boys.

196
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,930
How lame.

197
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,190
- Come on, let's go play video games.
- Good idea!

198
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Hey!

199
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,230
Looks like finding
the culprit will be difficult.

200
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,820
About that blackmail letter...

201
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,590
I wonder if it was intended

202
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,930
to camouflage the culprit's real motive?

203
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,280
Huh? Camouflage?

204
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,670
Say, Professor...

205
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,550
Governor Asakura used to work
in the Ministry of Infrastructure, right?

206
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,950
While he was Minister,

207
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,200
he demolished a village in Niigata

208
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,270
in order to make a dam.

209
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,430
Yes, I remember.

210
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,300
If I remember correctly,
it was the Kitanosawa Dam.

211
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,760
At that time, Minister Asakura

212
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,720
traveled himself to the village,

213
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,510
promised to pay proper compensation

214
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,930
and arrange for new land,

215
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,100
stayed for a week in the village,

216
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,930
and had conversations
with each individual villager.

217
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,940
Only after he earned the villagers' trust,
the project went forward.

218
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,940
Construction of the new village
took three years,

219
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,460
while construction of the dam itself took
only five years from start to completion.

220
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,160
It was a major achievement.

221
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Yes...

222
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,790
Sounds about right.

223
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,570
Even then,

224
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,040
they say that one of the villagers
opposed the dam to the very end.

225
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
I see!

226
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,720
So you think that anger
over the dam construction

227
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,110
is the bomber's real motive.

228
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,880
And that would mean the culprit
is one of the villagers

229
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,010
or someone related to the project.

230
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,260
Well, it's just one possibility.

231
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,390
Next Sunday,

232
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,560
a ceremony will celebrate the anniversary
of the new village's completion.

233
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,110
The Governor was scheduled
to spend a night there too.

234
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,490
Although, it's been canceled now
because of the bombing.

235
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,210
I get it!

236
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,290
You want to go to the village

237
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,920
and investigate personally, don't you?

238
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,660
Yes, Professor.

239
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,930
Will you take me?

240
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,320
- Take you where?
- Oh, uh...

241
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,140
Take us, too!

242
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,210
Conan gets to have all the fun!

243
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,090
I thought you guys were busy
playing video games?

244
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,590
If the Professor's going, I'll go too.

245
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Haibara...

246
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,170
That belly of yours balloons
the moment I let you out of my sight.

247
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,630
Huh...? Oh, uh...

248
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,460
It balloons, you say?

249
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,060
It can't balloon much more
than it already has.

250
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,560
(Kitanosawa Dam)

251
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,480
(Kitanosawa Village)

252
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,210
(Snow Festival)

253
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,520
We're up soon.

254
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,870
I'm getting butterflies.

255
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,620
It's so cold!

256
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,260
But the snow is nice and fluffy!

257
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,870
This is awesome!

258
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,370
Okay. Let's go again.

259
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,760
Yeah!

260
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Those kids seem to be having fun.

261
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,380
Yeah, you're right.

262
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,340
Unbelievable... should we really have
brought them along?

263
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,930
Bringing them is one thing...

264
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,730
Come on, Ran! Let's go!

265
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,580
Whoa, hey Sonoko!

266
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,310
Don't push me like that!

267
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,620
Sorry, sorry.

268
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,480
Sheesh... why Ran and Sonoko too?

269
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,910
Not only that...

270
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,290
Found it. The mythical outdoor bath.

271
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,930
Even better...

272
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,130
it's an outdoor bath for men and women!

273
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,670
I've been dreaming of this!

274
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,130
Will it be sexy ladies waiting for me...

275
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,390
or fair maidens?

276
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,740
Time to found out!

277
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Here we go!

278
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Oops!

279
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Ehem...

280
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, the water feels so good.

281
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,170
Who knew it could feel so refined

282
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,640
bathing in a hot spring under the open sky
and gazing at a winter wonderland.

283
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,430
Right, My Lady?

284
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,920
Screech!

285
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,080
What should I have?

286
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,160
It all looks so good.

287
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,820
The takoyaki is great!

288
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,610
The grilled squid, too!

289
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,080
And the isobe yaki!

290
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
Alright!

291
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,920
I'll try each, one at a time!

292
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,100
Ehem.

293
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,710
Before you do that, a quiz.

294
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,000
What?

295
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,760
Which meal offered at the booths
in the powder snow area

296
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,320
is the most appropriate?

297
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,810
Number one:

298
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,290
Grilled yams.

299
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,220
Number two:

300
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,400
Isobe yaki.

301
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,940
Number three:

302
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Grilled squid.

303
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,530
Number four:

304
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
Takoyaki.

305
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,640
What's powder snow, anyway?

306
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,350
It means snow as soft as flour.

307
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
As soft as flour?

308
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
Snow like flour...

309
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,700
Flour... flour...

310
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,010
I know!

311
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,910
It's gotta be number four. Takoyaki!

312
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,650
Huh? Why?

313
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,780
Because takoyaki is the only one
that needs flour.

314
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,280
My mom makes it a lot!

315
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,900
And the phrase "kona mon!"
in the Kansai dialect

316
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,700
is the same as the Japanese word for flour.

317
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
I see.

318
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,670
But isn't that too easy?

319
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,420
There's should be more of a twist.

320
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,960
Gee, sorry there was no twist.

321
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,680
In that case, here's one from me.

322
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,570
Which of those meals
is the most appropriate for the Professor?

323
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,570
- Huh?
- The answer is none of them!

324
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,390
They'll all puff that belly out.

325
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Boohoo...

326
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,560
That's not even a quiz!

327
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,970
- Now then...
- Where we shall we eat?

328
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,380
I'm hungry enough
to eat the Professor's portions.

329
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,610
- We should eat too.
- Right.

330
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,530
Including the Professor's portions!

331
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,950
Ai-chan, Conan-kun... what about you?

332
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,430
I'll pass.

333
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,470
Me too.

334
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,710
I'm going to take a walk
around the village.

335
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,230
I'll go with Conan-kun, then.

336
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,970
Not so fast. You're coming with me.

337
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,680
(Happy 5th Anniversary!) (KitanosawaI Town Hall)

338
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,390
A map of Kitanosawa village?

339
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,380
Yes.

340
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,700
That and a guide to the dam, please.

341
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,060
Got it. Hang on a second.

342
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,900
Hey, Yamao...

343
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,160
It looks like that ski resort
went out of business.

344
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,270
Yeah, I heard just now.

345
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,440
They had a lot of avalanches, it seems.

346
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,610
Sorry to keep you waiting.

347
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,530
This is the map of Kitanosawa.

348
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,640
And this is a map of Old Kitanosawa Village
at the same scale.

349
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,930
Sorry, my friend here was determined
to find the house where he was born.

350
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,020
He wanted to know
what part of the dam it sunk into.

351
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,330
Is that so...

352
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,500
Anyway, let's go.

353
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,420
Right.

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Huh?

355
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,570
Damn it...

356
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,890
Hey, Onii-san.

357
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,600
Isn't that a stun gun?

358
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,140
You've got a good eye, kid.

359
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,230
It's for self protection.

360
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,270
When you work as an
insurance adjustor in Tokyo,

361
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,730
you often run into dangerous situations.

362
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,960
I always carry one with me
when I'm outside.

363
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,860
Anyway, thanks for your help.

364
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,650
Sorry to keep you waiting.

365
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,170
- Huh?
- Now, then.

366
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,490
A map of Kitanosawa
and a dam guide, right?

367
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,840
Here you go.

368
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,970
Thanks.

369
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,440
Say, there was a person who opposed the dam
until the very end, right?

370
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,310
- Huh?
- Do they live in the new village?

371
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,670
Why would you ask that?

372
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,970
Oh, I just...

373
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,220
It's for a school research report.

374
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,840
What grade are you in?

375
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,260
First grade.

376
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,060
In that case,
don't you think there are better topics?

377
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,660
For instance... I know.

378
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,810
At Lake Sawajiri,
which is nearby the village,

379
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,400
you can see lots of swans.

380
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,030
(Swan Lake, Lake Sawajiri)
Nothing beats watching swans.

381
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,530
There are hot springs bubbling
nearby the lake,

382
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,160
so even in winter,
the water doesn't freeze.

383
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,450
Maybe you're right. I'll think about it.

384
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,290
I guess he won't talk about that
with a little kid.

385
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,410
(Walk-in Clinic)
Oh, that hurts.

386
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,920
Okay, here's your medicine.

387
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,090
Thank you very much.

388
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,550
Take that and you'll get better right away.

389
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,630
Your belly will recover too.

390
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,420
Unbelievable.

391
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,610
That's what you get for trying
to eat ten plates of takoyaki.

392
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,870
I'm flattered,
but there's no need to exaggerate.

393
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,030
That wasn't a compliment.

394
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,190
Sorry.

395
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,640
What grade are you kids in?

396
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,270
- First grade!
- Me too.

397
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,420
I see... first grade, huh?

398
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,470
That's right.

399
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,190
(Thank you for staying at Lodge KitanosawaI)

400
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,050
That was so good.

401
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,590
Sure was.

402
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,120
If they'd had broiled eel and rice,
I'd give them a perfect score.

403
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,540
Wait, after all you ate at lunch,
how is there even room in there?

404
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,500
Genta-kun's stomach is made of iron.

405
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,470
I can fit a lot more in!

406
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,480
Oh, that's right.

407
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,400
We should buy some souvenirs
for Kobayashi-sensei.

408
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,430
Good idea.

409
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,020
- Can I get some eel pie for myself, too?
- Unbelievable. He still wants more?

410
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,330
Wanna come with us, Conan-kun?

411
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Sure.

412
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,940
I'll head to my room.

413
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,200
(Seeking participants for a snow shoe trek!)
Snow shoe trekking?

414
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,950
Lake Sawajiri, huh?

415
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,120
Hey, Onee-san!

416
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,380
What can I do for you?

417
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,000
Will this snow shoe hike

418
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,590
go by the dam?

419
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Hmm...

420
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,750
If the guests request it,
it can go there too.

421
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,100
Are you interested in the dam, little boy?

422
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
I guess.

423
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:13,690
What should we get?

424
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,520
(Famous Kitanosawa specialty, bear-shaped sweet buns)
Gotta go with these Bear-shaped sweet buns.

425
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,470
No, these wooden owls are better!

426
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,540
They're quite elegant.

427
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,620
Hmm...

428
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,190
Ai-chan, what do you think?

429
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,020
A... coffee mug?

430
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,630
(I Love Swans)
I love swans?

431
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,560
Ah! It says "I love Shiratori"!

432
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,720
Hachoo!

433
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,120
Huh? What is it, Shiratori-kun?

434
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,870
- Got a cold?
- No...

435
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,960
Until I get my next star,

436
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,960
I can't afford to catch a cold.

437
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,240
Hmm...

438
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,510
I wonder if I can finish
before next winter.

439
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,190
Hey, Ran!

440
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,800
How about this one?

441
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,510
What about it?

442
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,600
As a souvenir for Makoto-san.

443
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,230
Oh, nice idea. It's cute.

444
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,070
It kind of looks like you, too.

445
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,570
Huh? Really?

446
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,000
- And what about you, Ran?
- Huh?

447
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,780
What do you mean?

448
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
You know!

449
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,410
A souvenir for Shinichi.

450
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,220
Oh, I don't need anything for him.

451
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,630
Even if I bring something home,

452
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,990
he'll be so busy with his next case,
he won't even notice.

453
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,210
If you let him run around like that
without a collar,

454
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:29,670
some other woman
might put one on him first.

455
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,380
A collar...?

456
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,750
What am I, a dog?

457
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,460
Then again,

458
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,820
Makoto-san's not much different.

459
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,720
Umm...

460
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,350
Maybe I'll give him a call.

461
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,620
Uh-oh!

462
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,440
Oh... hello?

463
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,550
Shinichi?

464
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:58,710
Can you guess where I am, right now?

465
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
Huh?

466
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,450
I'm in Niigata Prefecture! A town named Kitanosawa.

467
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,870
We all came for the Snow Festival...

468
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,690
Oh... wow!

469
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,780
What is it?

470
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:10,670
The lights they put up are amazing.

471
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,000
With the snow falling all around,
it's like a dream.

472
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,050
I wish you could see it, Shinichi.

473
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,930
Right...

474
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,860
If it's that amazing,

475
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,610
I wish I could have.

476
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,670
What do you want for a souvenir?

477
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,030
Huh? Oh...

478
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,620
Um, anything will do.

479
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,150
That doesn't help!

480
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,860
Just pick something.

481
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,820
Geez... In that case, what do they have?

482
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,210
Lots of stuff.

483
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,740
You know, like bear-shaped sweet buns.

484
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,870
And owl-shaped wood carvings.

485
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,290
Oh and swan mugs.

486
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,000
Swans...?

487
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,010
What's that about?

488
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,860
(Bears, owls, swans)
Hmm... the owl then.

489
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,470
Got it. The owl.

490
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,130
Um... I don't know when I can receive it,

491
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,630
so just leave it in
my living room somewhere.

492
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,690
How rude. You should come home
from time to time, you know.

493
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,240
I know.

494
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,850
Where are they going at this hour?

495
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,700
Shinichi? Are you listening?

496
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,540
Oh... sorry. I've gotta go.

497
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,640
Talk to you soon.

498
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,000
Huh? Shinichi!

499
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,410
Why you...

500
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,910
Just in case...

501
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,240
(Changed to silent mode)

502
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,710
Ah, wait!

503
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Oh no...

504
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,820
Hey, these are...

505
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,260
the souvenirs I mentioned just now.

506
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,760
The owl, then.

507
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,480
Don't tell me...

508
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,480
Shinichi...

509
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,060
We're going too fast!

510
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,730
I always wanted to ride one of these.

511
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,370
Yeah! It's great!

512
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,100
This is so cool!

513
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,750
It's like a roller coaster.

514
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,340
Full power!

515
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,660
Not even close!

516
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,550
- Hey, Genta-kun!
- You're gonna crash!

517
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,430
It's fine. Just leave it to me.

518
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,920
- Genta-kun! Watch where you're going!
- What?

519
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,820
(Ski Course)

520
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,260
Hey, Genta-kun...

521
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,180
Is it possible we've gone off course?

522
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,960
What? Oh..

523
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,420
This is bad.

524
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,550
You're not allowed
to drive these things on public roads.

525
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,060
Huh? Really? We'd better go back then.

526
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,060
Hey! You alive?

527
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,540
Umm... somehow.

528
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,310
The snow must have cushioned our fall.

529
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,120
We're in trouble now.

530
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,240
The three of us can't
put that thing back together.

531
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,780
What do we do...?

532
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:30,200
The snow doesn't look like stopping
anytime soon

533
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,950
and we're too far away to walk back.

534
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,460
But I doubt any cars
will pass through, either.

535
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,460
Hehehe, don't worry.

536
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,500
We have this, don't we?

537
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,450
Unbelievable... those kids...

538
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,430
Going off on their own...

539
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,100
Still, it's a good thing

540
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,190
that you had your skateboard
redesigned for snow.

541
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,310
Well, I guess.

542
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,370
Huh?

543
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,190
Over there...

544
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,800
What's taking Conan so long?

545
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,110
Still, it's actually pretty warm
inside an igloo, right?

546
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Yeah.

547
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Huh?

548
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,170
- Did you hear something?
- Huh?

549
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,120
- Ah!
- It's Conan!

550
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,000
You're too slow, Conan!

551
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,940
Ai-chan came too!

552
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,720
None of us are used to the snow

553
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,090
and it was too dangerous
for Edogawa-kun to go alone.

554
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,560
Oh, I see.

555
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,930
This is hopeless
without help from an adult.

556
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,520
We should call the Professor

557
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,890
and have him come pick us up.

558
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,910
What?

559
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,210
I called you, because I didn't want
the Professor and the others to find out...

560
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,690
What choice do we have?

561
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,650
- Besides...
- This is your fault, Genta!

562
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,070
We warned you that was too fast!

563
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,530
You were enjoying it, Mitsuhiko!

564
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,640
Still, there are limits.

565
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,600
You have to think before you act!

566
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,600
What's that?

567
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,200
Hey, stop it you two...

568
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,820
You make it sound
like I don't think at all!

569
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,610
Am I wrong?

570
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,980
Of course you are!

571
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,730
At least I'm not a know-it-all, like you!

572
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,390
W-What's that supposed to mean?

573
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,270
- I hate you, Genta-kun!
- Back at ya, Mitushiko!

574
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Enough!

575
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,980
Neither of you should say anything more.

576
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,810
Once words leave your mouth,

577
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,020
you can never take them back.

578
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,410
- But...
- But...

579
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,610
Words are like swords.

580
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,570
If you use them wrong,

581
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,320
they can be a deadly weapon.

582
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,670
When you say things you don't mean,
you can ruin a lifelong friendship.

583
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,980
Once you part ways,

584
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,400
you might never see each other again.

585
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Huh?

586
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,380
Ah, there's a car!

587
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,470
Right.

588
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,140
We'll be home soon,

589
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,430
so tell everyone not to worry.

590
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,490
Got it. Be careful!

591
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,360
Right!

592
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,960
You all better apologize once we get back.

593
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,460
- Yeah, yeah...
- Okay...

594
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,530
Sorry about before, Mitsuhiko.

595
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,910
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

596
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,250
You all were quite lucky.

597
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,940
If I hadn't made plans
to meet someone at the lodge,

598
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,340
I wouldn't have passed by that place
at this hour.

599
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,190
You don't live
in Kitanosawa Village, Mister?

600
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,300
I live alone in a cabin I built
on the other side of the mountain.

601
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,260
I carve owls there.

602
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,420
- Huh? The owl wood carvings?
- You made them, Mister?

603
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,940
The small ones were made at my cabin.

604
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,190
I make the big ones
at my workshop, near the dam.

605
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
The dam?

606
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,650
I used to live in the village,

607
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,240
but now it's sunk to the bottom
of that fancy dam.

608
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,510
Say,

609
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,610
are you the one

610
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,490
who opposed the dam until the end?

611
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,990
Yep. That's me.

612
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,310
At first, there were others like me
and even my parents opposed it,

613
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,540
but they all moved
to that alternate village site.

614
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,210
That worthless village!

615
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,590
Sorry.

616
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,720
- Why you little...
- Now now, Mouri-kun...

617
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:22,390
All three of them are sorry.

618
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,970
- But that's...
- What's more, look.

619
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,020
Thank you very much.

620
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,790
Driving us all the way here...

621
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,380
It's nothing. I had plans to come
to the lodge, anyway.

622
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,670
Is that so?

623
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,200
Now then, I will take my leave.

624
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,860
Right... thank you very much.

625
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,410
Kids! Say thank you!

626
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,790
- Thanks!
- Thank you very much.

627
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,350
Don't make the grownups
worry like that again, okay?

628
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Yes sir.

629
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,130
Okay, everyone inside.

630
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,710
You must be cold.

631
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,400
- Yeah.
- I thought we would freeze to death.

632
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,080
Whose idea was it
to ride the snow mobile, anyway?

633
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,480
- It was you, Genta-kun!
- You!

634
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,280
Hey, Muto!

635
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,810
Over here.

636
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,390
Sorry I'm late.

637
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,940
Oh, it's that nurse from this afternoon!

638
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
Whoa, you're right.

639
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,930
Thank you for before.

640
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,950
Good evening.

641
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,670
Are you kids hungry?

642
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,400
We're fine.

643
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,150
Huh? Those two...

644
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Excuse me...

645
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,950
Are you by any chance
the famous Detective Kogoro Mouri?

646
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
Huh? Well...

647
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,890
Ahem.

648
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,920
That's right.
I'm the great detective Kogoro Mouri.

649
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Huh?

650
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
I knew it!

651
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:35,090
So then... are you here on a case?

652
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,520
Umm...

653
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,570
We came for the Snow Festival.

654
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,070
He wouldn't bring children
with him on a case.

655
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,140
I see. I guess that's true.

656
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,690
Of course!

657
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:49,020
Still,

658
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,660
it's amazing
to meet a great detective here...

659
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Right?

660
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,650
Allow me to introduce you.

661
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,710
(Keisuke Yamao, 34)
Sitting next to me is

662
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,840
Keisuke Yamao.

663
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,200
(Mizuki Tono, 33)
Sitting across from us are Mizuki Tono

664
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,370
(Fuyumi Tachihara, 33)
and Fuyumi Tachihara.

665
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,390
(Takehiko Muto, 34)
Lastly, this is Takehiko Muto

666
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,830
(Shogo Hikawa, 34)
and I'm Shogo Hikawa.

667
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,310
All of us were born and raised
in the old Kitanosawa village.

668
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,810
Myself and Yamao

669
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,790
came here from Tokyo to participate
in the anniversary ceremony.

670
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,760
Are you all childhood friends, then?

671
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,520
That's right. Since elementary school.

672
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,560
Although it was a satellite campus.

673
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,440
We five were the only students.

674
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,210
A class of only five?

675
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,370
That's right.

676
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,440
It's been eight years
since all of us were together.

677
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,200
Eight years?

678
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,700
Now that's what I call a reunion!

679
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Still...

680
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,410
Why did it take you eight years
to meet again?

681
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,410
Huh? Oh, well that's...

682
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
It's because of this.

683
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Ah!

684
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,440
(Hit and Run Incident in KitanosawaI)

685
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,670
Hey, stop it Hikawa-kun!

686
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,630
Huh? That's...

687
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,550
Eight years ago,

688
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,470
this guy was living in Tokyo.

689
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,260
On his way back to the village
where his grandmother lived alone...

690
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Ah!

691
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,260
He got scared

692
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,960
and fled the scene to the village.

693
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,630
But a few hours later,

694
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,350
he repented and turned himself in.

695
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,470
Huh? You turned yourself in?

696
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Yes.

697
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,140
My car was pretty damaged, anyway.

698
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,560
It was only a matter of time
before I was caught.

699
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,940
In those days,

700
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,360
our friend here had built up
a large gambling debt

701
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,440
and his life was falling apart.

702
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,820
At the trial,

703
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,020
he was charged with speeding,
drunk driving, hit and run,

704
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,580
and even had time added on for a
suspended license.

705
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,370
He was finally released this summer.

706
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,540
So then, while Yamao-san was in jail...

707
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,020
Talk began about the dam construction

708
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,020
and the village was submerged.

709
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,210
Yamao-kun's grandmother had collapsed
from the shock of his crimes

710
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,510
and passed away soon after.

711
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,680
So she never had a chance
to live in the new village?

712
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,600
The worst part is

713
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,040
the person he killed
was an 18 year-old girl.

714
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,480
Mizuki's younger sister, Natsuki.

715
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:44,380
- Huh?
- What?!

716
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Eh?

717
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
Yamao-kun...

718
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Even now,

719
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,150
I haven't forgiven you.

720
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,000
I haven't forgiven you either.

721
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,410
- Hikawa!
- Huh?

722
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,420
When the dam construction was brought up.

723
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,740
you agreed immediately, sold that
new land you got for a high price,

724
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,280
and left for Tokyo.
You and your whole family are scum.

725
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,780
Hey, wait Muto...

726
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,430
I know you were the one
pulling the strings!

727
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:17,360
You sold our birthplace to those bastards!
Don't you realize what you've done?

728
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,390
Please!

729
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,410
You need brains to survive in this world.

730
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,860
I think that's enough, kids.

731
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,330
Let's go back to our rooms.

732
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,790
Right.

733
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,320
We should leave these folks in peace.

734
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,450
Everyone, back to your rooms.

735
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Right.

736
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,500
We're sorry to have bothered you.

737
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,510
That woman...

738
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,710
The one named Fuyumi...

739
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,720
Something happened to her, too.

740
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,210
Yeah...

741
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,880
Even elementary school classmates,

742
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,640
eventually take different paths in life.

743
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,020
Yes... you're right.

744
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,000
Don't worry!

745
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,810
I'm sure you two will be fine.

746
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,260
Huh? Why do you say that?

747
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,330
It's obvious.

748
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,070
I can tell what's on your mind, Ran.

749
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,050
"Oh no... will the future be like that

750
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,910
for Shinichi and me?"

751
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
Right?

752
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
Th-that's not it...

753
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,430
I was just thinking
about those people just now.

754
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,900
It's got nothing to do with him.

755
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,050
And then... if what you said
about the souvenirs is true,

756
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,090
you really think Shinichi
is in the village?

757
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
Yes...

758
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,180
But he doesn't seem to be staying
at this lodge.

759
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,350
It's just that...

760
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,980
I feel like he's nearby, somehow.

761
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,410
Huh?

762
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,280
Actually...

763
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,360
I feel that way all the time.

764
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,830
You sold our birthplace to those bastards!
Don't you realize what you've done?!

765
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,210
I wonder if that Muto guy
has something to do with the bombing.

766
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,270
And then...

767
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,420
what about his classmates?

768
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,490
Snow! Snow!

769
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,800
Let's have a snowball fight!

770
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,880
Yeah!

771
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,380
Okay!

772
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,460
Conan-kun and Ai-chan, too! Come on!

773
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,330
I'll pass.

774
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,860
If you don't keep an eye on those kids,

775
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,170
who knows what they'll do next.

776
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,190
Whoa!

777
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,220
Huh?

778
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,990
Gotcha!

779
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,640
You asked for it!

780
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,270
Things are about to get real!

781
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,080
Get back here!

782
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,980
- Ah!
- We've been spotted!

783
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,430
Run!

784
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,010
Take that!

785
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,030
You won't get away!

786
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,620
Over here!

787
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,610
- Take that!
- And that!

788
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,550
Hey, someone's watching.

789
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,460
Looks like he wants something from us.

790
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,060
Good morning!

791
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,730
Oha...

792
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,270
I...

793
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,210
I...

794
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,950
Oh, excuse us.

795
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,520
We accidentally stumbled
onto your property.

796
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,030
C... Can I

797
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,050
play too?

798
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,960
W...

799
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,590
with you...

800
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,110
I want...

801
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,080
to join... the snowball fight.

802
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,250
Is there something wrong with that kid?

803
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,630
Yeah... he doesn't seem to act his age.

804
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,650
Huh?

805
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,360
T...

806
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,080
Toma...

807
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,570
You're awake!

808
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,000
Toma!

809
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,410
Toma!

810
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:15,830
Toma!

811
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,550
Huh...?

812
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,030
M... Mom?

813
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,170
Thank goodness.

814
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,660
I found you!

815
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
Toma...

816
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,210
Thank goodness...

817
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,310
(Toma Tachihara, 15)

818
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,920
Fuyumi's son Toma...

819
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:36,250
One morning, eight years ago,

820
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,970
he fell off a cliff into a stream
near the old village.

821
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,950
He was found unconscious.

822
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,060
They took him
to a nearby hospital right away,

823
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,520
and were able to save his life.

824
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,370
But he's been unconscious
for eight years, since that day.

825
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,530
Eight years...

826
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,870
It was the same day
as when Yamao had his hit and run.

827
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:58,890
Huh?

828
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,130
The same day?

829
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,290
Yes...

830
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,460
For such terrible accidents
to occur on the same day,

831
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,290
in a village this peaceful...

832
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,500
It left the whole town in an uproar.

833
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,950
How do you know what happened
to Toma was an accident?

834
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,130
The police investigated
and that was their conclusion.

835
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,550
The cliff was nearby the swan lake
that Toma liked very much.

836
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,150
When he was found,

837
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,760
he had binoculars hanging from his neck.

838
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,670
They thought he must have slipped
while watching the swans.

839
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,700
The one who found him

840
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,730
was the neighbor's dog.
Toma and the dog were friends.

841
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,400
Where were Fuyumi and her husband
at that time?

842
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,190
Fuyumi is a single mother.

843
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:44,000
She was on call and got summoned
to take care of a patient at the hospital.

844
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,970
Doesn't he have any grandparents?

845
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,330
No... long ago, Fuyumi's parents
were both caught up in an avalanche.

846
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,350
Huh?

847
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,620
Did they pass away?

848
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,650
What?!

849
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,880
They were found 30 minutes
after the avalanche.

850
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:01,920
If the discovery had been 15 minutes
earlier, they might have been saved.

851
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:02,950
Right...

852
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,230
When people are caught in an avalanche,

853
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,110
they say the time limit for rescue
is around 15 minutes.

854
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,010
15 minutes?

855
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,480
Yes. A mere 15 minutes
is the difference between life ad death.

856
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,640
That's not much time at all.

857
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
In that case,

858
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:21,860
you can take a break
from the clinic for a while.

859
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,320
Go and stay at Toma's side.

860
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,570
Yes.

861
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:28,590
Thank you very much.

862
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,000
How is he, Fuyumi?

863
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,670
Mizuki... Muto-kun...

864
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:41,400
For the time being,

865
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,440
there is nothing
physically wrong with Toma.

866
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,860
I see...

867
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
But...

868
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,530
Mentally...

869
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,510
He has no memory of the day
he fell from the cliff.

870
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,540
Huh?

871
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,700
And because of that...

872
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:59,480
He doesn't understand why he had to
sleep for eight years.

873
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,150
Still, I'm happy for you Fuyumi.

874
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,210
I really am.

875
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,050
Huh? Hey!

876
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,150
Pardon me,

877
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,780
but have you ever thought
about contact lenses?

878
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Huh?

879
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,470
A beautiful woman like you

880
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,790
will look better
with contacts than glasses.

881
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,020
Oh...?

882
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,380
Eye glasses just make you seem cold.

883
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:27,840
I've never been fond of them.

884
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,350
Stop it, Dad!

885
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,330
Unbelievable...

886
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,400
You're suspicious, aren't you?

887
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,690
About the fact that Toma's accident

888
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,320
was on the same day as Yamao's accident...

889
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,550
Yes...

890
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,830
Could it be a coincidence?

891
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,130
Or is it...

892
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,050
Auntie!

893
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,420
Is it true that Toma woke up?

894
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,540
You all came to see him...

895
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,300
Please, come inside.

896
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,150
Will he... be okay?

897
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,160
Eh?

898
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,590
Isn't it to soon for him
to meet his friends?

899
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,530
Yeah...

900
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,180
Huh?

901
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,480
Toma, look...
It's Kaori-chan and the others.

902
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,600
Hey there. How ya feeling?

903
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,980
It's been so long, Toma-kun.

904
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,170
Let's take a short break.

905
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,390
Okay!

906
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,000
Wow! There's so many swans!

907
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,300
Huh? Uh...

908
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,500
Mizuki-san...!

909
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,780
That's right.

910
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,270
I tried switching to contacts.

911
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,360
I actually had some already.

912
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,120
They're much better.

913
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,620
They take your beauty to another level.

914
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,830
Dad, you're incorrigible.

915
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,850
Say,

916
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,750
doesn't it look like she changed
her hair style too?

917
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:22,590
What?

918
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,290
Maybe she actually has a thing for him.

919
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,250
Cut it out, Sonoko!

920
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,260
Even on third look,
you really are quite beautiful.

921
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,270
Hey, hey!

922
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,330
- Huh?
- What?

923
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,010
This point on the map is the lake, right?

924
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,190
That's right.

925
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,930
Where is the cliff
that Toma fell from?

926
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,660
Huh? Toma-kun?

927
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,830
Yeah.

928
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,820
Umm...

929
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,050
It's right here.

930
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,060
What? That's strange.

931
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,610
If he came down this road,

932
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,360
he was going in the wrong direction.

933
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,240
That just means he got lost, right?

934
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,550
Butt out, already...

935
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,120
In that case, where did Yamao-san
have his accident?

936
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,370
Was it this curve?

937
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,050
Yes, but...

938
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,500
Why would you ask that?

939
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,250
Get lost, will ya!

940
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:10,320
Conan-kun!

941
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:13,260
Oh, it's snowing.

942
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:14,770
You're right.

943
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,140
Jerk...

944
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,330
Something's bothering you again?

945
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,470
Sort of...

946
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:21,880
I just wonder

947
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,850
whether Toma was really
going to see the swans.

948
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,790
It's beautiful!

949
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,420
I bet it will pile pretty high.

950
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,750
Don't worry.

951
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,990
It'll stop soon enough.

952
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,070
Let's resume our hike.

953
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,910
It really did stop.

954
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,870
The locals really do know things we don't.

955
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,180
Mizuki-san,

956
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,790
won't you come visit us
in Tokyo, some time?

957
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,740
I'll guide you anywhere
you want to go.

958
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,170
- In that case... Sky Tree.
- Eh?!

959
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,760
I uh... a-anywhere but there...

960
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,100
Are you afraid of heights, Mouri-san?

961
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,770
I'm afraid so...

962
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:05,020
Do you have any phobias, Mizuki-san?

963
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,330
Hmm... I don't like dark, narrow spaces...

964
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,450
Why are you getting between us?

965
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,770
What do you care?

966
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Ah!

967
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,530
What's wrong, Mizuki-san?

968
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,760
Wait...

969
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,100
That looks like Hikawa-kun's jacket.

970
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,280
Huh?

971
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,450
Hey, Hikawa-kun!

972
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:27,250
Maybe he can't hear me...

973
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:29,230
What could he be doing out there?

974
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,350
Hey, doesn't something seem off?

975
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,440
Yeah.

976
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,010
Everyone, hold on a second.

977
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,590
Hikawa-kun!

978
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,890
What are you doing over there?

979
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,400
Dad...

980
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:42,430
Right.

981
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,600
I'll go take a look.

982
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,970
Hikawa-kun, what's wrong?

983
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,820
Hikawa-kun?!

984
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,770
Mizuki-san! What is it?

985
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,860
Something's wrong with him.

986
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:58,220
- Stand back.
- Right...

987
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,240
Hikawa-san, are you okay?

988
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,180
Hikawa-san! Hikawa-san!

989
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,890
Dad!

990
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,450
Get back! Don't come closer!

991
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:21,180
It's no use.

992
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,400
He's dead.

993
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,500
Are you okay?

994
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:26,790
Um...

995
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,480
I don't see any external wounds...

996
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,110
Hypothermia...? No, a heart attack...

997
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,040
Now that you mention it, Hikawa-kun...

998
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,990
He's had a weak heart since he was a kid.

999
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,540
I knew it.

1000
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,660
Ran, call the police.

1001
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,200
Got it.

1002
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,510
Hey, something's not right.

1003
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,440
Huh?

1004
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,820
His stun gun is gone.

1005
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,390
Damn you! Stay out of this, boy!

1006
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,230
Hikawa-san told me

1007
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,040
that he always
carries a stun gun for self defense.

1008
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,050
- Huh?
- But if that's gone...

1009
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,470
Someone must have been
with him and taken it.

1010
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,500
- No, I don't think so.
- Eh?

1011
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,180
Why?

1012
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,450
Look at these.

1013
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,150
There's only one set of shoe prints.

1014
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:16,270
These were definitely made
by these snow shoes.

1015
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,900
In other words, Hikawa-san...

1016
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,910
walked from the village
to the swamp by himself

1017
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,200
and as he was walking in the snow,

1018
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,700
he had a heart attack and died.

1019
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,410
That must be it.

1020
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,080
Then what about the stun gun?

1021
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,630
Maybe he just left it in the lodge.

1022
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:36,540
That can't be right.

1023
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,340
But the shoe prints...

1024
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,340
Maybe it's a trick
engineered by the culprit.

1025
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:44,290
Eh?

1026
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,320
What?

1027
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,180
Well, it happens a lot, right?

1028
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,970
Riddles about shoe prints in the snow.

1029
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,600
You too?

1030
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,540
Huh? Shoe prints...

1031
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,560
in the snow?

1032
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,580
I've got it!

1033
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,530
It's definitely a trick
engineered by the culprit!

1034
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,660
What?!

1035
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,280
Listen. The culprit had already met
Hikawa at the stream,

1036
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,870
killed him with some kind of poison

1037
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,160
and made it look like a heart attack.

1038
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,110
They arranged to have

1039
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,770
the same type of snow shoes
and after changing into them,

1040
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,520
the killer carried him
on their back to this spot.

1041
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,710
There, they dumped Hikawa-san's body

1042
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,300
and took his stun gun.

1043
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:26,470
On the way home, they used the snow shoes

1044
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,900
to walk backwards the whole way.

1045
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,500
Walked backwards?

1046
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,320
Is that even possible?

1047
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,430
Sure it is.

1048
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,720
Okay! Watch and learn.

1049
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,710
Why is there so much snow in his hood?

1050
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,100
So that's it.

1051
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,230
I've got it, Mister!

1052
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,630
The culprit used a super-simple trick.

1053
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,660
What?

1054
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,180
Think back. It was snowing just now, right?

1055
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:11,720
The culprit walked with Hikawa-san
from the stream to here.

1056
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,680
At this spot, they killed him
and made it look like a heart attack.

1057
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,930
Then when the snow fell,

1058
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,900
it erased both their footprints.

1059
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,650
They waited for the snow to stop

1060
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,430
and then put on the same snow boots

1061
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,700
as the ones Hikawa-san is wearing.

1062
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,240
Then they returned to the swamp
walking backwards,

1063
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,600
without having to worry
about where they stepped.

1064
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,180
See?

1065
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:36,380
If you do it like this,

1066
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,810
only one set of shoe prints remains.

1067
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,920
Ah...

1068
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,390
Here's the proof.

1069
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,420
There's a bunch of snow piled up

1070
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,460
inside the hood of Hikawa-san's coat.

1071
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:48,230
I'll bet that after the snow stopped,

1072
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,600
the culprit shook off only the snow
from their head and shoulders

1073
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:56,180
to make it look like they came here
after the snow stopped.

1074
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,690
But a trick like that

1075
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:02,660
wouldn't work unless we found the body
right away, right?

1076
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,780
If the body was left here
and it started snowing again...

1077
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,240
the time spent making the footprints
would be for nothing.

1078
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:10,240
In other words, whoever it was

1079
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:14,740
knew that we would pass by here, eh?

1080
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,890
Either that...

1081
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,040
or they led us here...

1082
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,540
If someone looked at the schedule
for the snowshoe hike,

1083
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:28,160
I bet they could guess
what time we would pass by.

1084
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,970
I'll bet you're right.

1085
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,540
Say, Mizuki-san.

1086
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,020
Is there anything in the direction
where these footprints lead?

1087
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,310
Muto-kun's cabin is that direction.

1088
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,940
Muto-san's?

1089
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,330
But...

1090
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,440
There's a road that cars can travel
that connects the village to the cabin.

1091
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:49,220
Oh, that must be the path

1092
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,530
that we traveled by snow mobile yesterday.

1093
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,370
I wonder why Hikawa-kun

1094
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:56,660
didn't use that road?

1095
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:01,800
No... Hikawa-san and the culprit
intentionally avoided traveling that road.

1096
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,090
They passed by the stream and walked
over the snowfield to avoid being seen.

1097
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:08,380
Why?

1098
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:15,230
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1099
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,390
Hikawa-san's body

1100
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,100
is being examined

1101
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:22,060
by the coroner at the university
medical hospital.

1102
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,730
(Detective Watanabe, Niigata PD　Detective Sasamoto, Niigata PD)
We've confirmed that it was a heart attack,

1103
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,820
but we won't know whether it was from
natural causes or someone else's doing

1104
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,740
until they conduct
a full autopsy and tests.

1105
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,530
Someone else's doing...

1106
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,330
Are you saying that Hikawa was murdered?

1107
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:39,780
It's too early to say.

1108
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,890
Yamao-san,

1109
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,750
at 2 PM today,
where were you and what were you doing?

1110
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,110
I wasn't with Hikawa this afternoon.

1111
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,110
I took a walk in the forest
on the eastern side of the lake.

1112
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,040
- Alone?
- Yes.

1113
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,910
- Did you cross paths with anyone?
- No...

1114
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,390
Very well.

1115
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,520
Next...

1116
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,650
Tachihara-san.

1117
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,360
Toma fell asleep

1118
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,630
after this morning's tests
and I stayed with him.

1119
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,430
We were in a room of my house.

1120
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,820
Can anyone vouch for that?

1121
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:18,510
No.

1122
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,880
Hmm...

1123
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,700
And you, Muto-san?

1124
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:26,270
I was at my workshop near the dam,
working on a new piece.

1125
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,070
Your workshop?

1126
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,170
Not the mountain cabin
nearby where Hikawa's body was found?

1127
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,880
- Correct.
- Is there anyone who can vouch for you?

1128
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,480
No.

1129
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,350
I don't meet anyone while I'm working.

1130
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,800
However,

1131
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,650
if that's the case,

1132
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:47,690
why was Hikawa-san traveling
in the direction of your cabin?

1133
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,870
How am I supposed to know?

1134
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,690
Were you really not
in your mountain cabin?

1135
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
What?

1136
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,210
Perhaps you summoned Hikawa to your cabin
and murdered him there?

1137
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,990
You might have told him
you wanted to talk about Mizuki.

1138
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,700
Hmm? What do you mean by that?

1139
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,790
When Hikawa was younger,

1140
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:08,250
he proposed to Mizuki and was turned down.

1141
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:09,890
Huh?

1142
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,800
But Hikawa never gave up.

1143
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,680
If you had mentioned her name,
there's no doubt he would have come.

1144
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,220
I see.

1145
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:21,490
And here I thought

1146
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,720
Muto-san was the one who liked her.

1147
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,850
What reason would I have to kill Hikawa?!

1148
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,150
Well, I heard a lot happened
between you because of the dam!

1149
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,940
I'm not going to dignify that
with a response.

1150
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,400
Then that leaves...

1151
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,450
Tono-san.

1152
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,070
Right...

1153
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,870
She was with us.

1154
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,890
She has an alibi.

1155
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,500
Is that so?

1156
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,250
Very well.

1157
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,060
That will do for today.

1158
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,560
All of you...

1159
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:55,260
If we find out
that Hikawa-san was murdered,

1160
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,300
we'll have more questions.

1161
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,180
Excuse me, what about
searching their belongings?

1162
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,780
We can't force them to comply
with a search at this point.

1163
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,120
And even if they
took something from the victim,

1164
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,610
they surely must have hidden it by now.

1165
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,690
Everyone, thank you for your time.

1166
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,990
- That old man sure talks slow.
- Yeah.

1167
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,610
I thought I'd fall asleep.

1168
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,880
Man, it's cold.

1169
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:36,210
Do we really have to suffer all this
just to go see the sunrise?

1170
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,050
You'll live.

1171
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,510
I wonder who it was...

1172
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,720
The person who killed Hikawa-san...

1173
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,640
Right... if it was Muto-san,

1174
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,640
judging by those shoe prints,

1175
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:52,190
it wasn't at the cabin.
He must have waited out in the snowfields.

1176
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,900
And then after the murder,
he would have walked back to the stream.

1177
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,570
But then, we still don't know

1178
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,320
why Hikawa-san would have been walking
out of sight in the snowfields.

1179
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,040
Even if Muto-san
had instructed him to do so,

1180
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:06,380
don't you think it's strange?

1181
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,470
I suppose.

1182
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,000
If it were me, I would have gone by car.

1183
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,490
Even so...

1184
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,620
Is Hikawa-san's murder really related
to the bombing?

1185
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,130
If it is, I doubt things will end here.

1186
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,590
Something else is sure to happen.

1187
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,160
Huh?

1188
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:27,290
(Incoming call from Ran Mouri)
Not again...

1189
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:28,730
(Voicemail message)

1190
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:30,730
I'm unable to answer the phone right now.

1191
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,690
He still won't pick up...

1192
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,900
Did you get Shinichi's voicemail again?

1193
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:35,990
Yeah...

1194
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,070
I wanted to talk to him
about Hikawa-san...

1195
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,400
Do you really think he's in the village?

1196
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,690
That mystery geek...

1197
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,910
Hear that?

1198
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,220
Let her be.

1199
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:49,040
(Call missed, Ran Mouri)
How can she call me at this hour, anyway?

1200
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,330
Hey, isn't that Toma-san?

1201
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,380
(Kuro's grave)
Kuro...

1202
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,020
- Toma-kun!
- Toma!

1203
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,570
What's wrong, Toma-kun?

1204
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,140
Kuro's... grave.

1205
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,640
Is that the same Kuro that found you
eight years ago?

1206
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:12,770
Why...

1207
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,520
Is Kuro really dead?

1208
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:16,950
Toma!

1209
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:19,730
What are you doing out here?!

1210
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:20,940
Mom...

1211
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,200
How could you just leave
without telling me?!

1212
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,550
Now now, Miss.

1213
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,620
Why did this happen to me?

1214
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:29,440
Why did this have to happen?

1215
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,450
I don't understand.

1216
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:34,160
All my friends are strangers...

1217
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,750
Kuro is dead...

1218
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,750
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

1219
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,630
I don't understand!

1220
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Kuro...

1221
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:46,090
Kuro!

1222
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,120
Toma...

1223
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,140
Who could blame him...

1224
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,180
His body may be 15,

1225
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,980
but his heart is still seven.

1226
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,160
It would be difficult for him
to understand the reality of it.

1227
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:59,800
It's like the opposite
of what happened to us.

1228
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,370
Toma!

1229
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,580
Mom...

1230
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,130
Whoa!

1231
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,400
Look! The snow is glowing!

1232
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,170
Actually, this isn't snow.

1233
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,400
It's diamond dust, right?

1234
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:23,890
Diamonds?!

1235
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,920
Jewels are falling from the sky?

1236
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:27,150
No, that's not it.

1237
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,890
It's a phenomenon where the moisture
in the atmosphere freezes

1238
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,450
from the cold and forms tiny ice crystals.

1239
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,860
See?

1240
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,520
Toma, too! Look!

1241
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,870
It's beautiful.

1242
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,770
Awesome! This is a real treasure!

1243
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,450
Toma?

1244
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:08,970
What's wrong?

1245
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,760
Toma, are you okay?

1246
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,350
His memory...

1247
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,150
Why? I feel like
I've seen this light before...

1248
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:20,650
It's no good! I can't remember!

1249
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:22,260
- Toma!
- Toma-kun!

1250
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,880
- Toma-san!
- Toma!

1251
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,290
I can't... remember.

1252
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:40,210
That diamond dust sure was pretty.

1253
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,920
I felt like I was in a fairy tale.

1254
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,710
Hey miss! Seconds, please!

1255
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:49,930
- Say, the memory Toma started to recall...
- Right...

1256
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:51,970
It might have been a fragment

1257
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,350
from eight years ago
when he fell off the cliff.

1258
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:55,890
I looked it up...

1259
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,480
On that day, it snowed until dawn.
There wouldn't have been any diamond dust.

1260
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:02,410
In that case...

1261
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:04,840
What was it he saw, then?

1262
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,060
Hey, that reminds me.
Where are Genta and the others?

1263
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,630
They went to visit Toma-kun.

1264
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:12,660
Huh?

1265
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:16,080
Just great... They better not
be planning something again.

1266
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,100
Hey, how far are we going?

1267
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:23,330
If I go too far away, my mom will get mad.

1268
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:24,960
Say, Toma-kun...

1269
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:28,580
Why don't we try
going near the cliff where you fell?

1270
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,840
If you do that,
you might remember some things.

1271
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,020
But...

1272
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,930
Don't worry, we'll go with you.

1273
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:36,180
Okay...

1274
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,600
- Right?
- Right.

1275
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,990
Don't be afraid. Let's go!

1276
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,020
Okay!

1277
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Let's go!

1278
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,500
Alright!

1279
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,470
(KitanosawaI Lodge)

1280
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,160
Now then...

1281
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,450
where did those kids disappear to?

1282
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,370
Maybe they went back to the camp?

1283
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,580
The anniversary ceremony
will be there, right?

1284
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,970
Yes. They said it starts at 10 AM.

1285
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,840
That's in a little more than an hour.

1286
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:12,800
I hope they're not
getting into trouble, again.

1287
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,570
If they are, I won't go easy
on them this time.

1288
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,100
Hey, those are the dam workers.

1289
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:21,390
Maybe they came down
to take part in the ceremony?

1290
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,630
Even so,

1291
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:25,300
is it really okay
to leave the dam unattended?

1292
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,440
Don't worry about that.

1293
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,690
We have two staff members
who stayed behind.

1294
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,920
Oh, did you hear that...?

1295
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:34,020
At least allow us a cup of coffee.

1296
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,610
Sorry to worry you!

1297
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,780
Watch you mouth, Sonoko!

1298
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,660
Go on ahead.
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1299
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,370
If you run, you're bound to fall!

1300
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,400
Got it!

1301
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:46,460
Hello!

1302
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:50,460
Onee-san, you're a classmate of Toma's, right?

1303
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:52,290
Did you come to visit Toma?

1304
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,050
Yes... there's something
I wanted to show him.

1305
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,710
- But he doesn't seem to be home.
- What did you want to show him?

1306
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,650
Wow!

1307
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,020
Is this a photo from 8 years ago?

1308
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,730
We must have been
about the same age as you.

1309
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,060
Hey, wait... these binoculars...

1310
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:11,850
This is at school, right?

1311
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:12,910
Yes.

1312
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,320
Did he wear those to school, too?

1313
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:16,350
Yes.

1314
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,340
They were Toma-kun's trademark.

1315
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:20,030
He always had them when he was outside.

1316
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,300
So then...

1317
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,580
We can't be sure that he was
going to see the swans that day.

1318
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,520
Oh...

1319
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,900
That was a gift from Toma-kun to me.

1320
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:31,920
(Kuro)
He really loved playing with Kuro.

1321
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:34,060
I wanted to show him these

1322
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:36,770
and see if that made it easier
for him to talk.

1323
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,920
Ah! Do you think it would actually
make things more painful for him?

1324
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:50,110
That time, Hikawa-san unfolded a printout
and showed us the outside.

1325
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:51,830
But usually,

1326
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:56,610
you would keep the printout clean
by folding it to the inside.

1327
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:00,870
- Is there something wrong with the drawing?
- No, not at all.

1328
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:03,020
Thank you for showing these to me.

1329
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:06,810
I have to go back to the lodge, now.

1330
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,410
If you run, you're bound to fall!

1331
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:09,660
I'm okay!

1332
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:15,710
Say, are we not allowed
to change the sheets here?

1333
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,860
Hey, did you open this door?

1334
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,400
Huh? Was I not supposed to?

1335
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:22,850
Of course not!

1336
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,220
The police have to take fingerprints
and footprints from here.

1337
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,930
What? Oh no...

1338
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:31,020
Now they're going to suspect me.

1339
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,160
That's right. They'll arrest you.

1340
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,600
Huh? Hey, don't scare me!

1341
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,060
This is it.

(Robbery-murder at Jewelry Store)

1343
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,080
A jewelry story robbery...?

1344
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,300
On the 15th, around 11 PM,

1345
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,650
in the Yayoi-cho area
of Tokyo's Shinjuku district,

1346
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,210
someone broke into the Misuzu Jewelry Store

1347
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,080
and killed 51 year-old owner Eiko Misuzu,
who was working overtime,

1348
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,680
by stabbing her with a knife.

1349
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,940
The killer then stole
one billion yen worth of jewelry and fled.

1350
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,040
This crime...

1351
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,480
If I remember correctly,
it happened when I was in third grade

1352
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,070
and the culprit has never been caught.

1353
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:22,160
But why would Hikawa-san
be carrying this article?

1354
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,280
Wait a second... the date...

1355
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:26,930
I knew it.

1356
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,830
It's the night before
Yamao-san's hit and run.

1357
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,970
That reminds me...

1358
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,210
Yamao-san was sitting next to Hikawa-san.

1359
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,920
He wouldn't have seen the side we saw,

1360
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,840
he would have seen the printed side.

1361
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,970
That means his frown was a reaction
to this article.

1362
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:46,610
Could this mean...

1363
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,740
Kudo-kun?

1364
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,040
I can't get ahold
of Tsuburaya-kun and the others.

1365
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,250
What?

1366
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,460
And th-

1367
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,020
Huh? Hello?

1368
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,250
Isn't that near the cell phone tower?

1369
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,540
It's both of them!

1370
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:20,630
The land lines aren't functioning either!

1371
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,380
Cell phone and land line connections
have been severed.

1372
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:24,690
Give me a break.

1373
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,550
Of all days for an accident!

1374
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:29,060
No, this was no accident.

1375
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,280
Huh? I've got no cellular service.

1376
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,730
- Me neither.
- Haibara, can you hear me?

1377
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,040
I hear you.

1378
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:36,520
What's going on?

1379
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:38,730
People have lost their cell phone service

1380
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,190
and there's a bit of a panic.

1381
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,270
I knew it.

1382
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,040
About the kids...

1383
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:45,630
Someone saw them together with Toma-kun.

1384
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:46,410
Eh?

1385
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:49,280
The four of them
went off somewhere together.

1386
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:52,680
Come back here, right away.

1387
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:53,910
Got it.

1388
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,610
Those fools... don't tell me...

1389
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,510
This is the way, right?

1390
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,440
Yeah, I think so.

1391
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,280
You guys are too loud!

1392
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:10,440
We know we're loud!

1393
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:12,810
What do you think?

1394
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:14,600
Are they still there?

1395
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,830
They're there, alright.

1396
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:21,610
What's the deal?

1397
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:24,460
- What are you two talking about?
- Everyone, run!

1398
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,650
Indeed!

1399
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:27,650
Huh? Wait!

1400
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,410
Hurry! We'll explain later!

1401
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:30,870
Just please run!

1402
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,880
What's going on?

1403
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,520
How long have they been there?

1404
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,270
I don't know.

1405
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,090
We just noticed them suddenly.

1406
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:43,230
Is it a bad guy?

1407
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,900
Who knows!

1408
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,520
I'm scared!

1409
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:48,400
That's why we're running!

1410
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:01,020
I was running on that day, too.

1411
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,230
Did you hear that?

1412
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:30,300
Yes.

1413
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,140
- This is bad. You had better...
- No way I'm waiting!

1414
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,210
Don't do anything stupid, kid.

1415
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,440
Yeah, yeah...

1416
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,190
Look! A cave!

1417
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,580
- Let's hide in there.
- Right!

1418
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:16,990
Hurry up!

1419
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:22,350
Wait! Kids, don't!

1420
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,560
- Not good. Haibara, stop them!
- Right.

1421
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,510
Unbelievable. What do they
think they're doing?

1422
01:14:30,290 --> 01:14:31,290
Keep going.

1423
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:34,200
Hey, this thing goes pretty far.

1424
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:37,160
- Hold it!
- Oh! Haibara! Hurry inside!

1425
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,450
You shouldn't be in here!

1426
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,250
Do you wanna die in a place like this?

1427
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,790
But that guy won't be able to come in here!

1428
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:45,080
Toma-kun got in, didn't he?

1429
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:48,270
Not only that, what will you do if
they shoot from the cave entrance?

1430
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,310
Oh no!

1431
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,430
Incredible!

1432
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:51,570
You brats!

1433
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,510
How could you be so stupid?

1434
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,530
I already scolded them.

1435
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,240
We'll have to go
to the far end of the cave now.

1436
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:58,310
I guess so.

1437
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:03,690
Huh? You were running away
from someone on that day?

1438
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:06,360
Yeah, I finally remembered.

1439
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,620
I knew it...

1440
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,690
Everything is clear now.

1441
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,700
Oh no... if my reasoning is correct.

1442
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,660
- Hey...
- What's wrong?

1443
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:18,280
Quick! We have to get out of here
and reach the dam before they do!

1444
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:19,570
What's at the dam?

1445
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,120
You're not making any sense.

1446
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:23,160
Explain, please!

1447
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,670
I don't have any proof yet,

1448
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:26,920
and it's just my deductions at this point,

1449
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,750
but the culprit behind all of this

1450
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,480
is Yamao-san.

1451
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:36,880
If he's the one who broke into a jewelry
store in Tokyo eight years ago,

1452
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:41,910
killed the owner,
and stole one billion yen worth of jewels,

1453
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,930
(OizumiI Exit)
it all adds up.

1454
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:47,810
Yamao-san was deep in debt to loan sharks,

1455
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,000
and fled to his grandmother's home

1456
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,430
(Kitanosawa 5km)
in his hometown of Kitanosawa.

1457
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,570
And then, on the way...

1458
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:57,570
His car hit Natsuki-san
at the village entrance.

1459
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,490
Yamao-san panicked.

1460
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,490
If he were arrested by the police now,

1461
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,450
he would be caught
as the jewelry store murderer.

1462
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:06,960
After all, the jewels
were still in his car.

1463
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:13,090
Usually, when a driver hits a pedestrian,
they stop and check on the victim.

1464
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,090
While he was examining Natsuki-san
beneath the cliff,

1465
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,490
that must be when he ran into you.

1466
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,100
Toma-san...

1467
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,530
Huh? Me...?

1468
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:25,380
Toma-san, on that day...

1469
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,560
you went to meet your mom on the way
home from her night shift, right?

1470
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:32,270
You were on your way to the hospital
and walked over the snowfield.

1471
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:35,500
- That's why...
- Ah... huh?

1472
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,660
Mom?

1473
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:39,710
Thank goodness...

1474
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,220
I found you.

1475
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,830
In that moment, Toma picked up
from where he left off eight years before.

1476
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,100
Yes.

1477
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,890
Yamao-san could have
easily knocked Toma out

1478
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,050
and put him in the car.

1479
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,590
He kept driving because

1480
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:58,130
he was conflicted about what to do.

1481
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,050
However, you saw the truth.

1482
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:08,190
Toma-san, you witnessed the diamonds
he stole, floating through the air.

1483
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,920
Then that means that
what you started to remember

1484
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:15,280
- when we saw the diamond dust was...
- A real treasure!

1485
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,490
As long as you witnessed the jewels,

1486
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,530
Yamao-san would have felt he had no choice.

1487
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,250
Are the jewels at his grandmother's house?

1488
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,880
He must have hid them there.

1489
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:38,970
That's right. Yamao-san
was looking for a map to his old house.

1490
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,590
He turned himself in

1491
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,220
because he thought
he would be released in a few years.

1492
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,600
But then,

1493
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:47,600
his punishment was worse than he expected

1494
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,560
and the village was sunk by the dam
while he was in prison.

1495
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:53,000
In order to reclaim those jewels,

1496
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,110
he has to sap all the water from the dam.

1497
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,110
- Sap...
- The water?

1498
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,070
He made today's ceremony his target.

1499
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,530
But why?

1500
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,700
Because the dam staff
will participate in the ceremony.

1501
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:05,910
There are only two staff left behind.

1502
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,790
None of them would dream
of someone blowing up the dam.

1503
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,920
But if he does that, the village...!

1504
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,080
Everyone will die!

1505
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:15,610
We have to get to the dam before him.

1506
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:17,830
Look! Light!

1507
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:18,950
That's the exit!

1508
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,950
Yay! The exit!

1509
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:25,030
All clear.

1510
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,110
It's safe to come out.

1511
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:31,120
That's the discharge pipe.
If we go in there...

1512
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:36,980
(Kitanosawa Dam Lake, Caves)
It's definitely the fastest route.

1513
01:18:41,210 --> 01:18:43,420
So then, the one who killed Hikawa-san...

1514
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:45,820
- Yes, it was Yamao.
- What?!

1515
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:49,290
The were only two things
standing in the way of his plan.

1516
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:51,620
One was Hikawa-san.

1517
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,640
As his former classmate from the village

1518
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,250
and as an insurance adjuster,

1519
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:01,420
he was able to figure out
that Yamao-san was the jewel thief

1520
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,270
and in exchange for not turning him in,

1521
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,720
he asked for a cut of the profit.

1522
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,530
If Yamao-san pretended to play along

1523
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:14,590
and decided to kill Hikawa-san
before blowing up the dam,

1524
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,750
it all makes sense.

1525
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:20,900
After all, Hikawa-san didn't seem to be
merely threatening Yamao-san.

1526
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,380
And then,

1527
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,560
in need of someone to frame
for the dam explosion

1528
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,670
and Hikawa's murder,

1529
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,830
Yamao-san chose Muto-san as his patsy.

1530
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:30,850
Huh?!

1531
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,910
As someone who hated Hikawa-san
for selling their hometown

1532
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:36,350
and also opposed to the dam,
Muto-san was a good target.

1533
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:40,270
But I wonder what he said
to lure Hikawa-san to that spot.

1534
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,010
Well, it's just a theory
at this point, but...

1535
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:45,340
What? Muto...?

1536
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,180
He seems to have caught on to our plan

1537
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,640
and asked me to meet him.

1538
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,930
If things go wrong,
we'll have to kill him first.

1539
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,960
He must have said something like that
and tricked Hikawa-san into playing along.

1540
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:02,950
That's why the two of them walked
out of sight over the snowfield.

1541
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,630
And then there was one more obstacle.

1542
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:08,840
He found on that the Governor
would participate in the ceremony.

1543
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,550
With the Governor there,

1544
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,520
there would inevitably
be lots of media and journalists.

1545
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:15,410
Even if the explosion

1546
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,060
took out cellular and land phone lines,

1547
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:21,150
there would be no way to stop news
of the dam from reaching the outside.

1548
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,230
I see. Even if he submerged the village,

1549
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,220
he would still need time

1550
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,690
to find the place
where the jewels were hid.

1551
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:31,490
To stop the Governor
from coming to the village,

1552
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,580
and as a bomb test, he blew up the tunnel.

1553
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:41,500
However, I'll bet
Toma-san regaining consciousness

1554
01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:44,000
was something he didn't plan for.

1555
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:48,260
By chance, Toma-san had no memory
of the day of the crime,

1556
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,540
so he was temporarily relieved.

1557
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,780
But after the diamond dust fell,

1558
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,670
Toma started to remember

1559
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:56,720
and Yamao decided to kill him
along with all of you.

1560
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,830
What?!

1561
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:00,390
Now he just has to find
the jewels and fly away.

1562
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,150
I imagine he's already
arranged a secret plane.

1563
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,520
- Right...
- What's wrong, Toma?

1564
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:07,510
Are you tired?

1565
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:08,610
No...

1566
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,730
Is there a flaw in my theory?

1567
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,550
Yeah... something's not quite right.

1568
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:14,740
I don't know what.

1569
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,390
Sorry, but we really need to hurry.

1570
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,230
Yamao-san lost time
when he attacked Toma-san.

1571
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:23,710
I'm sure he hasn't
set the bomb at the dam, yet.

1572
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,860
- Right.
- The staff were still present, earlier.

1573
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,960
In that case, there's still hope.

1574
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:31,900
Are we there yet?

1575
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,240
Why are we constantly going uphill?

1576
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,360
All clear. Come on up.

1577
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:42,620
Careful!

1578
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:46,600
Man, I'm tired.

1579
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,990
Toma, you're almost there. Keep going!

1580
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,970
We made it inside the dam in one piece.

1581
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,140
Man, I don't feel like I'm in one piece.

1582
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,330
Are you okay?

1583
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,460
I'm beat...

1584
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,320
I don't have strength
for even one more step.

1585
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,520
I guess not.

1586
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,540
You all stay here and keep Toma-san safe.

1587
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,190
I'm going to find the staff
who stayed behind.

1588
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,380
What?!

1589
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,570
- Got it.
- Just leave it to us.

1590
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,320
I'm going to check Muto-san's workshop.

1591
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,120
It must be nearby.

1592
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,820
Right. But be careful.

1593
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,670
Yamao-san might have gone there first.

1594
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:22,480
Understood.

1595
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,690
You guys better hide, too.

1596
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:26,330
Okay!

1597
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,810
This is...

1598
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:58,930
Are you okay?

1599
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,260
Hang in there, please!

1600
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,470
No external wounds...

1601
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,380
He must have been knocked out
with the stun gun.

1602
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,130
Wait.

1603
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:09,570
Huh?

1604
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:10,740
It can't be...

1605
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,040
Those are the same bombs
used to blow up the tunnel!

1606
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,720
Damn it! How?!

1607
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:19,550
Did he use a car or snow mobile?

1608
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,880
What is it?

1609
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:27,450
Kudo-kun, I've arrived at the workshop,
but something terrible has happened.

1610
01:23:27,490 --> 01:23:29,600
Muto-san's been knocked unconscious.

1611
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:30,790
I knew it.

1612
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,900
The dam workers have passed out too.

1613
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:36,870
They must have been attacked
by surprise with the stun gun.

1614
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,520
Huh...? Wait!

1615
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,670
- This isn't right.
- What?

1616
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:42,830
The work has been done far too quickly.

1617
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,590
Whoa!

1618
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,880
Kudo-kun? What's wrong?

1619
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,590
Answer me! Kudo-kun!

1620
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:53,410
Don't tell me...

1621
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:54,940
A bomb?!

1622
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,380
Not so loud!

1623
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:59,140
We're telling you
because you're the Great Detective Mouri.

1624
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:02,140
If anyone else hears, there will be panic.

1625
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,430
Huh? Oh, sorry...

1626
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:08,140
And then, are you sure it's a time bomb?

1627
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:09,300
We've received reports

1628
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,970
that a timer was found
among the fragments.

1629
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:15,590
We're going back to the dam.
I'm worried about the two workers on duty.

1630
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:18,030
We can't contact them from here, anyway.

1631
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,650
Can we use our cell phones from the dam?

1632
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,080
There's another tower nearby.

1633
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:26,060
We might be able to reach
Conan-kun's cell phone.

1634
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:27,350
Right.

1635
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,670
We'll go too.

1636
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:32,250
More gunshots.

1637
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,590
Is Conan-kun okay?

1638
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,940
I'm worried.

1639
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,470
Ah, I can't take it anymore.

1640
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:39,710
Let's go!

1641
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:40,740
Yeah!

1642
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:54,480
Stupid kid.

1643
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,590
If you had just gone
to enjoy the Snow Festival,

1644
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,200
you could have died without suffering.

1645
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,250
Now then, spit it out.
Where are the others?

1646
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,740
There are no others.

1647
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:07,580
Looks like you'll have to suffer a bit more

1648
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:09,610
before you get it.

1649
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,700
Huh? Why you...

1650
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,110
Damn you!

1651
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,480
Little brat!

1652
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,500
Who do you think you are?

1653
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:35,030
I don't have time for games!

1654
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:37,880
I'm in a hurry,

1655
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:40,360
so I'll assume you're telling the truth
about coming alone.

1656
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,630
Don't worry.

1657
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:45,390
When the blast starts in 15 minutes,

1658
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,980
you'll go straight to heaven.

1659
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:50,950
Have a nice trip.

1660
01:25:51,530 --> 01:25:52,530
Kid!

1661
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,620
Mizuki-san...

1662
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,060
That was a different gun from before.

1663
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:12,100
We have to hurry!

1664
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,390
Hang in there!

1665
01:26:19,420 --> 01:26:20,490
Everyone!

1666
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,690
Thank god. You're alright.

1667
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,880
Haibara-san!

1668
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,880
Mizuki... you bitch.

1669
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:33,790
Give it up, Yamao-kun.

1670
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:36,150
Are you okay, Conan-kun?

1671
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:39,670
Yes... but what you doing here?

1672
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,180
I had a bad feeling

1673
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:46,110
and came to check things out.

1674
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,540
Is that gun yours?

1675
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,500
Yes...

1676
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,310
I have a hunting license.

1677
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,350
I'm a good shot.

1678
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,150
I guess so.

1679
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,280
Mizuki-san, look out!

1680
01:27:03,210 --> 01:27:04,910
Drop it, Mizuki!

1681
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,130
- Toma-san?
- Hey!

1682
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,160
What is it?

1683
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:27,500
That day...

1684
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:29,680
The woman I saw...

1685
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:32,670
You had on glasses then,
but I know it's you!

1686
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,020
You don't understand anything
about my dreams, Sis!

1687
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:40,200
What are you doing?

1688
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,420
It hurts...

1689
01:27:42,990 --> 01:27:44,220
What are you trying to do?!

1690
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,100
I see.

1691
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:59,340
The one Toma-san saw eight years ago...

1692
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,050
was you, Mizuki-san.

1693
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,730
That's why you didn't
follow us into the cave.

1694
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:07,140
You told Uncle Kogoro, yesterday.

1695
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:10,010
I don't like dark, narrow spaces.

1696
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:13,740
Mizuki!

1697
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,300
What's the meaning of this?!

1698
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,790
- Conan-kun!
- You just mentioned the cave.

1699
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:21,860
What?! You don't mean...

1700
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:22,960
That's right.

1701
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,980
The one chasing us earlier

1702
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,210
was Mizuki-san.

1703
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,240
What?!

1704
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:30,660
Knowing that Toma witnessed the accident,

1705
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,870
Mizuki was afraid of him
regaining consciousness.

1706
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,400
For that reason,

1707
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:39,790
she began working at the front desk of the
lodge built in front of Toma's new house.

1708
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:43,420
She's been watching to see
if Toma would wake up for eight years.

1709
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:46,300
Is that true? Mizuki...

1710
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:49,930
Once Toma regained consciousness,

1711
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,890
she traded her glasses for contacts

1712
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,930
and changed her hairstyle a little.

1713
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:57,850
It was all to make sure
Toma wouldn't remember her when he saw her.

1714
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:01,310
She used Uncle Kogoro's advice as an excuse.

1715
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:04,400
I tried switching to contacts.

1716
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,950
After that,

1717
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:10,220
as Toma began to recover his meMouries,

1718
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:14,240
she knew she had to silence him
before it all came back.

1719
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,540
Not only that,
you're not much of Onee-san.

1720
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:20,490
Pushing your little sister
in front of a car...

1721
01:29:22,730 --> 01:29:24,960
I didn't mean to kill her!

1722
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:28,980
I just gave her a push.

1723
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:31,050
I only wanted to hurt her a little.

1724
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:34,320
But after she fell,

1725
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,600
Yamao-kun's car came rushing by!

1726
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:42,160
If anyone found out, I couldn't stay here.

1727
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:47,500
I got scared, and before I realized
what I was doing, I was holding the rifle.

1728
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
But...

1729
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:51,780
I just wanted to keep Toma-kun
away from me.

1730
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,890
I never really intended to kill him!

1731
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,060
I know.

1732
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:04,850
Mizuki-san, I know that you don't want to
hurt anyone again.

1733
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:10,470
After all, if you could shoot
Yamao's shoulder from that distance,

1734
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:13,930
and had the precision
to shoot the rifle on the ground,

1735
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:17,180
you could have easily shot us then.

1736
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,490
I'm sorry...

1737
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:23,730
I'm so sorry!

1738
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:27,440
But it's for the best, isn't it Mizuki?

1739
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:34,530
Now you can wake up from the eight-year
nightmare you've suffered.

1740
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:38,830
And I even got to see how beautiful you are
without your glasses.

1741
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:42,960
Muto-kun...

1742
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:45,540
I'll be waiting patiently

1743
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:49,200
until you return.
As long as it takes.

1744
01:30:58,290 --> 01:30:59,290
Edogawa-kun!

1745
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:01,350
The lamp is blinking!

1746
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,870
- What?!
- Eh?!

1747
01:31:10,540 --> 01:31:12,360
Oh no... that's right.

1748
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:18,870
Yamao-san said I had 15 minutes.

1749
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,180
Damn it...

1750
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:22,830
Everyone, run! It's going to explode!

1751
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:27,540
Don't dawdle! Quickly!

1752
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:35,450
Toma, hurry!

1753
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:41,780
- Ayumi-chan!
- Don't stop!

1754
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,220
- We have to keep running!
- Are you okay? Then run!

1755
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,300
Not good...

1756
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,240
If the explosions continue like this,

1757
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:49,630
the dam will collapse.

1758
01:32:04,100 --> 01:32:07,710
Oh no, that sound...
The outer walls are crumbling.

1759
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:10,930
I have to do something fast!

1760
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,510
Total collapse is only a matter of time.

1761
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:15,750
If the dam water is released all at once,

1762
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,180
the village will be drowned for sure.

1763
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:21,850
There has to be a way...
A way to save the village!

1764
01:32:24,230 --> 01:32:25,230
The ski slopes...

1765
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:34,630
Is anyone injured?

1766
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,240
Everyone's here, right?

1767
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,850
Conan is missing!

1768
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,070
We're missing one boy.

1769
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:41,380
What?

1770
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,580
He disappeared after rescuing me.

1771
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:45,780
Conan-kun...

1772
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,120
What could have happened?

1773
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:58,930
What? There are still more bombs left...

1774
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:05,500
Damn it!

1775
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,410
This is bad. The dam's going to collapse!

1776
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,020
Everyone, get back!

1777
01:33:10,050 --> 01:33:11,810
We can't! Conan-kun's still inside!

1778
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:14,210
We won't move until Conan-kun comes back!

1779
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:15,360
Conan!

1780
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:17,860
What are you doing, Kudo-kun?!

1781
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:38,180
Alright!

1782
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,100
Go Conan, go!

1783
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,560
Huh? Where is he...?

1784
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,850
He's trying to stop the water!

1785
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:46,450
What?!

1786
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,710
That's crazy! A child could never...!

1787
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,920
If he gets caught in the blast,
we won't be able to save him.

1788
01:33:55,940 --> 01:33:57,140
- He can do it!
- Huh?!

1789
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,900
If anyone can do it, Conan can!

1790
01:33:59,060 --> 01:34:01,670
Nothing is impossible
for the Detective Boys!

1791
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:04,970
We're counting on you...

1792
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:06,390
Kudo-kun!

1793
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:12,340
If I'm correct,

1794
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:14,850
there was an unused ski course
in front of the village.

1795
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,460
If I slide over that fresh snow,

1796
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:19,260
I might be able to make it.

1797
01:34:23,070 --> 01:34:24,570
What was that?!

1798
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,470
It... it can't be!

1799
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,950
The d-dam...

1800
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,430
We're in danger! We have to run!

1801
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:30,460
Huh?!

1802
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,230
Damn it! I won't make it at this rate!

1803
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:39,740
It's dangerous,
but I'll have to go through the forest.

1804
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:04,610
Okay... whoa!

1805
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:07,590
That was close!

1806
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,530
Please! Hold on just a little longer!

1807
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:38,600
Damn! If that water comes all at once,

1808
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:40,150
what will happen to the village?!

1809
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,050
The results will be awful.

1810
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:43,760
What does that mean?!

1811
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:45,630
- There's no doubt...
- Huh?

1812
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:47,220
The village will drown.

1813
01:35:47,270 --> 01:35:48,110
What?!

1814
01:35:48,130 --> 01:35:50,230
B-but that's...!

1815
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:02,370
I see it.

1816
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:11,350
Conan-kun!

1817
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:15,810
What's he trying to do?

1818
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:26,900
An avalanche! By causing an avalanche,

1819
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,090
he's trying to change
the direction of the water!

1820
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:33,370
Conan-kun!

1821
01:36:39,130 --> 01:36:40,820
Damn it... why now?

1822
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:43,850
Conan-kun!

1823
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:45,330
Oh no!

1824
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:46,610
Damn it!

1825
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:48,300
Damn!

1826
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:49,500
I was so close...

1827
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:51,740
Damn it!

1828
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:53,910
No!

1829
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:15,390
Uh-oh.

1830
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,790
The boy really did it.

1831
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:19,950
Run!

1832
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:25,570
Please make it in time!

1833
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,820
Look out!

1834
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,990
Ran...

1835
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,440
No!

1836
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,960
Conan-kun!

1837
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,390
Conan!

1838
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:26,280
- Conan!
- Conan-kun!

1839
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:32,710
I can hear everyone calling.

1840
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:36,350
I guess that means they're safe.

1841
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:39,140
I have to get out of here too.

1842
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:44,750
Damn it... I can't move at all.

1843
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,040
Somehow...

1844
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,290
I have to...

1845
01:38:49,940 --> 01:38:51,860
Conan-kun! Conan-kun!

1846
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:53,870
Conan-kun! Conan-kun!

1847
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:59,390
Where are you, you little devil?

1848
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:02,160
How long? How many minutes
has he been down there?

1849
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:04,560
- If I had to guess...
- 11 minutes, 50 seconds.

1850
01:39:05,060 --> 01:39:08,140
That's when the avalanche happened.
It will be 12 minutes soon!

1851
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,880
- What?!
- But that means...

1852
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,940
Our time limit is 15 minutes.

1853
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:13,330
We only have three minutes left!

1854
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:14,890
No!

1855
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:16,900
Everyone search for Edogawa-kun!

1856
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,940
- Eh?
- Don't tell me Conan...

1857
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:21,060
What?! He was caught in the avalanche?!

1858
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,260
Eh?!

1859
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,440
Please ring...

1860
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:30,170
(Calling Conan Edogawa)

1861
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:31,370
(Ringing)

1862
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:32,390
It's ringing!

1863
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,030
Everyone, quiet!

1864
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:38,210
Listen for the kid's cell phone ring!

1865
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,830
Conan-kun, where are you?

1866
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:47,340
Where are you?!

1867
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:54,310
- I hear the phone!
- What?!

1868
01:39:54,650 --> 01:39:56,090
Conan-kun,

1869
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:57,250
where are you?

1870
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,280
- Conan!
- Conan-kun!

1871
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,890
There it is! Conan-kun's cell phone!

1872
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:12,290
Please.

1873
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,520
Please be here, Conan-kun.

1874
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:17,450
Over here!
Everyone search this area!

1875
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Conan-kun...

1876
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:25,990
Damn it!

1877
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,910
- He's not here either...
- No...

1878
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:28,830
That can't be!

1879
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:30,190
Where are you, Conan-kun?

1880
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,740
Where are you?

1881
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:33,730
Come out, please!

1882
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:35,350
My hands are bleeding!

1883
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:36,500
Why?!

1884
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,850
Why aren't you here, Conan-kun?!

1885
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:41,880
Conan-kun...

1886
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,350
Will we never see him again?

1887
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:44,370
Eh?!

1888
01:40:45,490 --> 01:40:47,100
Once you part ways,

1889
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,480
you might never see each other again.

1890
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,760
That's...

1891
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,690
You can't be serious!

1892
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:54,780
Conan-kun,

1893
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,150
you can't die!

1894
01:40:58,050 --> 01:41:00,240
There's only one minute
until the time limit.

1895
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,630
Ran...

1896
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:04,560
We can't give up yet!

1897
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:05,580
What is it, Ran?

1898
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:09,830
(Calling Shinichi Kudo)
Shinichi...

1899
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,800
Please...

1900
01:41:15,230 --> 01:41:17,090
If you really are nearby,

1901
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:20,340
if you're watching over me, then help.

1902
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,680
Help us, Shinichi!

1903
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,030
Shinichi!

1904
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,420
Shinichi!

1905
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,990
Shinichi!

1906
01:41:39,750 --> 01:41:41,340
Just now... that was Ran's voice.

1907
01:41:41,950 --> 01:41:44,580
I have to let her know where I am.

1908
01:41:54,770 --> 01:41:56,210
Th-that's...

1909
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,370
A soccer ball!

1910
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,680
D-Don't tell me!

1911
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:00,180
Conan-kun!

1912
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:02,960
Conan-kun!

1913
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,440
Conan-kun!

1914
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:14,570
Found him!

1915
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:15,950
He's over here!

1916
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:18,070
Conan-kun! Hang in there, Conan-kun!

1917
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,090
Conan!

1918
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,530
Conan-kun!

1919
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:24,520
Please, Conan-kun...

1920
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:27,080
Open your eyes.

1921
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:29,830
Conan-kun...

1922
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,480
Conan-kun!

1923
01:42:37,890 --> 01:42:40,610
Ms... Ran...

1924
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:42,530
Thank god.

1925
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,910
Conan-kun, you're okay!

1926
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:52,050
As stubborn as ever...

1927
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,130
That afternoon,

1928
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:19,910
the area where Yamao's former home
had been sunk,

1929
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:23,000
was searched and the suitcase
that held the jewels was found.

1930
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:27,440
With all the evidence assembled,
Yamao-san confessed to everything.

1931
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,300
The case was closed.

1932
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,590
Mizuki turned herself in for the death
of her sister eight years earlier

1933
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,550
and was questioned by the police.

1934
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:41,680
Toma hasn't recovered all his meMouries.

1935
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:42,700
However,

1936
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,600
there is little doubt he'll remember

1937
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:49,730
and recover the smile
he once had soon enough.

1938
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:56,510
We sent your luggage to this address.

1939
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,100
Thank you very much.

1940
01:47:58,130 --> 01:47:59,470
We appreciate your kindness.

1941
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:03,510
Even though those horrible events occurred,
we hope you will visit us again someday.

1942
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:04,610
- Right.
- We will!

1943
01:48:04,630 --> 01:48:05,970
We'll definitely come again!

1944
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:11,340
Hey, kids!

1945
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,800
Hurry up!

1946
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:14,680
If you keep dawdling, I'll leave you here!

1947
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:17,450
What's Uncle Kogoro's rush?

1948
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,860
- Hmm...
- Oh no!

1949
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:21,580
I forgot to buy that souvenir for Makoto-san!

1950
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:23,040
Me too!

1951
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:24,530
Hey, wait! Where are you...

1952
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:26,190
We don't have much time!

1953
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:29,000
That reminds me...

1954
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:31,110
What was I supposed to buy?

1955
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:35,300
Ah! We haven't bought our
souvenir for Kobayashi-sensei either!

1956
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:37,700
Should we go with the bear
sweet buns, then?

1957
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,080
What are you talking about?

1958
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:41,140
We agreed on the swan cup.

1959
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:43,160
I want one of those owls.

1960
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,020
Wait, this is...

1961
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,470
What a pain. Why not get one of everything?

1962
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:48,980
The Professor's paying, anyway.

1963
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Hey!

1964
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:51,280
I see.

1965
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,010
