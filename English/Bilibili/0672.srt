1
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:04,466
A request that seemed at first glance to be a simple one,

2
00:00:04,466 --> 00:00:07,666
came in on the newly opened website.

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,266
However, Pops receives mail from the client asking

4
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:11,766
to change the meeting place,

5
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:17,966
so Pops takes me, Ran and his disciple, Amuro, over to the place,

6
00:00:17,966 --> 00:00:20,866
but the client doesn't show up.

7
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:22,866
Therefore, we all returned to the agency after that.

8
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:25,266
Then, the client contacts Pops again,

9
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,366
and we were just about to leave the agency a second time.

10
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:32,066
Everyone, please be quiet.

11
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,566
This is probably what this is all about.

12
00:00:34,566 --> 00:00:38,466
There is a person who doesn't want the client to meet with Mr. Mouri.

13
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,966
So that person sends Mr. Mouri a fake mail

14
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:43,266
asking to change the place of meeting to get him out of the agency.

15
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,766
Then, that person acts as if he is an employee of the agency

16
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:48,166
and meets with the client.

17
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,266
But why would that person do something like that?

18
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:53,666
All the client wanted was for Dad to look for the coin locker, right?

19
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,666
Maybe something unthinkable is in that locker?

20
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:57,666
I wonder about that.

21
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,366
Why don't we...

22
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:03,666
ask the person himself?

23
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:04,866
The person himself?

24
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:06,266
Don't tell me that...

25
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,666
You got a reply mail just as you were about

26
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,866
to go to the restroom, didn't you, Sensei?

27
00:01:10,866 --> 00:01:14,066
And, just when Conan was about to go to the restroom too.

28
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:17,066
Moreover, on the floor of the restroom

29
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:20,166
there was a trace of something having been dragged along.

30
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,266
Right.

31
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,966
Most probably that someone for some reason,

32
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:29,966
has the client with him and is still here

33
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:32,466
hiding inside the restroom.

34
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:37,366
Don't tell me...

35
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,266
What?

36
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:51,366
The woman that was confined in the restroom was Ms. Kei Kashizuka.

37
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:55,366
She claims that she has never seen the man that was found dead beside her.

38
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,766
The belongings of the man was his cell phone

39
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,166
which had no other data in it

40
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,166
except for the mail that had been sent to Pops.

41
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,766
5,000 yen worth of loose change,

42
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:05,566
and a wallet with quite a number of bills in it.

43
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:07,666
Ms. Kashizuka went through a brief questioning,

44
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,466
after which she was allowed to go home.

45
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:12,366
Amuro gives Ms. Kashizuka who finishes interrogation a lift home.

46
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:17,766
Ms. Kashizuka, is this the road?

47
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:18,766
Yes.

48
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,866
By the way, why are you guys riding together?

49
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:23,566
It's cramped in here.

50
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:24,666
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:28,066
This car isn't made to seat 3 people in the backseat, you see.

52
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,366
It's okay.

53
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,266
Why are you riding with us, Dad?

54
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:36,566
I was worried about Ms. Kei, that's why.

55
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:40,666
That man. I wonder if he really committed suicide.

56
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:43,966
But, there seems to have been no gun discharge residue

57
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:48,966
detected from Ms. Kashizuka's body

58
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:52,066
and what's even stranger is his cell phone.

59
00:02:52,066 --> 00:02:53,066
Why was everything, except the mail

60
00:02:53,066 --> 00:02:55,166
that was sent to Pops the received/sent history,

61
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:58,266
including the address book all blank?

62
00:02:58,266 --> 00:03:00,366
Besides, the things that were left back in his pocket,

63
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:03,366
the loose change and bills, that were in his wallet.

64
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:08,566
Why did he have to carry around so many bills and change?

65
00:03:08,566 --> 00:03:10,266
One more thing.

66
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:14,366
She's hiding something.

67
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,166
The vivid colored memories of summer

68
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,066
solve mysteries all season round.

69
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,866
The high-class condo of the client.

70
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,166
Something is strange and something smells.

71
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,766
He sees through the one and only truth.

72
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,866
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

73
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:30,266
His name is Detective Conan.

74
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:23,065
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Kidnap)"

75
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:32,865
This is a nice condo.

76
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,765
I'll bet the rent is quite expensive, no?

77
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:36,665
Yes, sort of.

78
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:38,165
But I depended on my parents to help me out

79
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:40,765
and was living here with my older brother so...

80
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:43,965
About here would be fine, you know.

81
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:46,665
I've already found that no one is ambushing me so...

82
00:05:46,665 --> 00:05:48,565
I guess so.

83
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,465
Okay, I guess we'll get going then.

84
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:53,465
I forgot that I had to use the restroom!

85
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,565
What shall I do? I'm going to pee in my pants.

86
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,465
Please, miss! The restroom, please let me use the restroom!

87
00:05:58,465 --> 00:06:01,965
Please, I can't hold it any longer!

88
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:05,165
Okay. Hold on one second.

89
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:10,765
This smell. Don't tell me that...

90
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:13,665
The restroom is on the right after you go in the front door.

91
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,465
Yes, thank you.

92
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:20,265
Excuse me. Actually, I've been holding back too.

93
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:22,465
Me too.

94
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:27,865
Good grief. Would you like to all drop by for a while, then?

95
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:29,765
All I've got to serve you is tea, though.

96
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,265
I'm sorry, Ms. Kei.

97
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,465
Don't be, it can't be helped.

98
00:06:33,465 --> 00:06:36,665
Like they say, necessity has no law.

99
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:38,465
Dad!

100
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:51,365
Oh my, my there're sure a lot of dishes out here.

101
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,965
Did you have a party or something last night?

102
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:57,665
Yes, several of my college friends got together here.

103
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,965
I'm sorry it's messy.

104
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,065
No, no problem.

105
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:03,165
Let see.

106
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:07,365
Kei, can I help you?

107
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:10,165
Could you clear the table off for me, then?

108
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,365
All right.

109
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,165
Today at around 16:00,

110
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:17,165
in the restroom of the Mouri Detective agency located on 5-Beika St.,

111
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,565
a shocking case of a man committing suicide

112
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,665
shooting himself to death, occurred.

113
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,865
No joke! It's already being aired on the news.

114
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:24,965
Looks to be so.

115
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:28,365
-The identity of the man is still unknown. -No! I'll bet Mom's worried.

116
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,265
After all, I had my cell phone switched off.

117
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:34,065
Hello?

118
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:35,965
Why did you have the phone switched off?

119
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:37,665
You worried the wits out of me!

120
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,665
Masumi?

121
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,765
I'm sorry, so sorry, we were busy here investigating on a case here.

122
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,665
And, are Conan... Kogo... okay?

123
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,865
I'm sorry. Your voice is choppy,

124
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:50,165
and it's hard to make out what you're saying.

125
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:55,365
Hello, Masumi? Can you hear me all right on your side?

126
00:07:57,765 --> 00:07:59,765
-Ms. Kei! -Yes?

127
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:03,865
Maybe this room is being wiretapped.

128
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:08,065
But, how do you know?

129
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:11,165
Because of Ran's cell phone a while ago, right?

130
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,265
If a wiretap is set up,

131
00:08:13,265 --> 00:08:16,365
there are times that cell phones have bad connection.

132
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,165
Just as would be expected of you, Mouri Sensei.

133
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,965
Ms. Kei, I will go through each of the rooms now

134
00:08:20,965 --> 00:08:23,365
and check where the wiretaps are set up,

135
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:24,965
so I hope you don't mind?

136
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:25,965
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,865
Could wait just 5 minutes.

138
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:30,565
They are all messed up.

139
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:33,065
I'd like to put away my underwear so...

140
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,965
Where are you going?

141
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:51,065
Miss.

142
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,865
I ran out of tea leaves,

143
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,265
so I'm going to the convenience store to buy some.

144
00:08:54,265 --> 00:08:56,965
I'll go with you, then.

145
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:59,165
I want something too.

146
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:01,165
Would you like me to go get Ran, too?

147
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,065
No need! Let's go, just the two of us.

148
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,265
Yep.

149
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:12,565
10 minutes have passed already, but Ms. Kei hasn't come back yet.

150
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:14,165
I wonder if she went to the restroom?

151
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:18,565
Okay then, why don't we start looking for the wiretaps ourselves?

152
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:22,565
Ran, please stand in the middle of the room

153
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:27,665
that I'm searching and play the music in your cell phone full blast.

154
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:30,265
I'm going to use the sound

155
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,165
to figure out where the wiretap is and crush it.

156
00:09:34,465 --> 00:09:38,065
You have a driver's license?

157
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:40,565
-Yes. -A driver's license is something

158
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:42,965
that helps identify you, right?

159
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:46,965
Why didn't you show it to the inspector a while ago?

160
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:49,065
I didn't want to show it to him

161
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:51,465
because my picture on it is ugly.

162
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,965
How do you like it?

163
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,865
The fruit juice that I got for you

164
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:57,065
at the vending machine on our way here.

165
00:09:57,065 --> 00:10:00,165
Yep. It's really delicious.

166
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:04,765
The third one already.

167
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,765
Here's one too.

168
00:10:06,765 --> 00:10:10,465
Another one?

169
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:13,165
What's with this room? It really smells!

170
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:16,165
What is it? This smell?

171
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:19,565
There seems to be a wiretap set up in this room too.

172
00:10:19,565 --> 00:10:20,865
You know what.

173
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:23,765
I haven't seen Conan or Ms. Kei anywhere since a while ago.

174
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:27,865
Never mind them for now. First, for the wiretaps.

175
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,565
It seems that the wiretap is under the bed.

176
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:51,065
There's a large suitcase shoved in under here.

177
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:52,265
Move aside, will you?

178
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,865
Yes, sir.

179
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:59,065
Darn! It's so heavy.

180
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,165
So the wiretap's in here?

181
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:07,065
It seems that the smell's coming from here too.

182
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:09,465
Let's open it, at any rate.

183
00:11:49,716 --> 00:11:52,716
It seems the wiretap's under the bed.

184
00:11:54,016 --> 00:11:56,516
There's a huge suitcase under the bed.

185
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,716
Move aside, will you?

186
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,316
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:04,816
Darn! It's so heavy.

188
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:09,416
So the wiretap's in here?

189
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:12,216
It seems that the smell's coming from here too.

190
00:12:12,216 --> 00:12:14,916
Let's open it, anyway.

191
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:26,116
Why is there a corpse in the suitcase?

192
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:29,416
Rather. Who is he anyway?

193
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,616
He's pretty small, isn't he?

194
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:33,616
He seems to have been beaten to death.

195
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:36,516
I guess he's been dead for a little more than a day.

196
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:40,516
Just as I thought. The wiretap is in here.

197
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:44,016
At any rate, let's ask Kei, the resident of this room about this.

198
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:47,616
But, I don't think she's here already.

199
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:53,916
When I went pass the front door a while ago, her boots were gone.

200
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:57,916
Back then, I thought she had put them back in the shoe box.

201
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,116
It's also thinkable that she fled

202
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:05,116
when she found out we were going to search the rooms for the wiretaps,

203
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:07,916
because she figured that we would eventually find this suitcase.

204
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,716
Then, are you saying that the one who killed this man is Kei?

205
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:14,416
I can't conclude it to be so yet, though.

206
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:19,416
But, I'm also bothered that Conan's shoes are gone too.

207
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,216
No! Why?

208
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:22,516
I wonder...

209
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:24,816
Maybe he went after her who fled

210
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:27,816
or maybe he was kidnapped by her.

211
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:30,916
I'll try calling Conan.

212
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,416
I text mailed Kei just now,

213
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,316
but I guess she wouldn't answer it if she fled.

214
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,616
Mail?

215
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,816
-From Kei? -Yeah.

216
00:13:42,316 --> 00:13:46,616
"I guess you found the corpse since you're mailing me.

217
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:49,916
I'm planning to let this boy go at daybreak

218
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:54,316
but if you interfere with me making a run for it and contact the police,

219
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:57,216
I cannot assure the safety of this boy."

220
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,416
Which means that Kei killed this man after all?

221
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,516
It could be that she also killed the man

222
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:06,016
who shot himself to death at the detective agency.

223
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:08,316
No.

224
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:12,716
But, there was practically no gun residue detected on her.

225
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:16,516
Which means that she didn't fire the gun, doesn't it?

226
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:20,216
That's only IF, maybe, that is.

227
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:22,316
But, we've got a problem on our hands, don't we?

228
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:24,216
We found another corpse

229
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:27,616
and the culprit's got Conan with her,

230
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,616
yet we can't do a thing till daybreak.

231
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:35,216
Only if that brat would secretly let us know where he is.

232
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:38,316
That's right! Maybe Dr. Agasa would be able to figure it out!

233
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:40,016
Dr. Agasa?

234
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:42,516
Who is he?

235
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,616
He's an acquaintance of Conan.

236
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:48,816
And Conan usually wears a detective badge, with GPS function.

237
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:53,016
Dr. Agasa has a pair of pursuit glasses that can pinpoint Conan's location.

238
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:58,016
If something so convenient exists, please by all means contact him.

239
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:03,416
The number you have called is either switched off

240
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,716
or out of service range.

241
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:13,716
What?

242
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:17,316
Conan's been kidnapped?

243
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,416
Moreover, by a murderer?

244
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:22,016
Yep. That's why I want you to pursue Conan's detective badge

245
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,216
with the pursuit glasses!

246
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,216
Okay.

247
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,916
I can pursue him with my spare glasses.

248
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,116
I'm sorry. I've got another call coming in.

249
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:31,416
Maybe it's from Conan.

250
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,416
Let me know when you find him!

251
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,116
Hello? Conan?

252
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,416
Why'd you hang up all of sudden?

253
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,416
Don't you like me or what?

254
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,116
Masumi.

255
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:44,416
Sorry! A lot have been going on and I'm a bit panicked, you see.

256
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,516
Conan seems to be in trouble!

257
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,316
Conan?

258
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:52,516
But, how on earth do you intend to pursue him?

259
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:55,716
Isn't your Beetle out for repair right now?

260
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:58,016
Yeah. Although it's something that can't usually be done,

261
00:15:58,016 --> 00:16:00,416
I guess we've got no choice but to ask the cab driver to go after him.

262
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,216
Would you like me to pursue him with my car, then?

263
00:16:04,816 --> 00:16:06,716
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,016
I wasn't eavesdropping or anything

265
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,616
but I came to share some of this cream stew

266
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:15,016
when I heard your disquieting conversation.

267
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,616
Subaru!

268
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,116
Come, let's hurry if we're going after him.

269
00:16:21,116 --> 00:16:22,316
But...

270
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:26,716
Okay. Just lend us your car key then.

271
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,916
Doc and I will go after him.

272
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,616
I could do so,

273
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,216
but that car's got a habit

274
00:16:32,216 --> 00:16:33,916
and has to be driven by me, otherwise.

275
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,816
Then, why don't I pursue him together with you, Subaru.

276
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:40,116
Yes, I don't mind.

277
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:42,816
If you don't mind staying back here all alone impatiently,

278
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:47,116
waiting for word on whether he's safe or not.

279
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:52,516
If it's okay with you, I'd recommend that you come along too.

280
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:55,716
Of course, I'm not forcing you to if you don't want to.

281
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:01,516
I see.

282
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:03,816
A woman called Kei Kashizuka was being held hostage

283
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:06,616
by a man who shot himself to death

284
00:17:06,616 --> 00:17:08,516
in the restroom of the Mouri Detective Agency.

285
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:12,216
You gave her a lift to her condo,

286
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:13,416
but when you got there you found

287
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,816
the dead body of another man inside a suitcase there.

288
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:19,816
By the time you realized it, she had kidnapped Conan.

289
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:22,416
Then, she mails and tells you that if you contact the police,

290
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,816
his safety would not be assured?

291
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:25,116
Yup.

292
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:27,716
I really don't know what's going on already.

293
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:30,816
Well, if that man's belongings and the circumstances at the site

294
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,616
are just as you've told me.

295
00:17:33,616 --> 00:17:35,916
I think he already knows what's going on.

296
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,316
He?

297
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:41,016
At any rate, I'll head on over right now.

298
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,516
Are you coming too, Masumi?

299
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:44,016
Yeah.

300
00:17:44,016 --> 00:17:49,616
I'd like to meet Mr. Kogoro's disciple that you've told me about too.

301
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:56,116
The smell's subsided a bit after the window was opened.

302
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,716
But, what shall we do?

303
00:17:57,716 --> 00:17:59,616
Should we contact the police, after all?

304
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,716
Yeah.

305
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,816
But, there's something strange about this room.

306
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:07,816
What do you mean strange?

307
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:11,016
There are only men's shoes in the shoe cabinet.

308
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:13,916
The same with the laundry and in the closet,

309
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,316
all there are, are men's clothes.

310
00:18:16,316 --> 00:18:18,816
Which means that the one who was living here

311
00:18:18,816 --> 00:18:21,216
was just Kei's older brother who passed away?

312
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:24,716
You mean you investigated all that in such a short time?

313
00:18:24,716 --> 00:18:28,216
I'm not sure yet, but it's for sure that the resident

314
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:30,016
of this room was very interested in a certain incident

315
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:33,216
that happened the other day.

316
00:18:33,216 --> 00:18:35,116
A certain incident?

317
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,516
True.

318
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:42,416
News and Talk and Variety shows are recorded one after the other.

319
00:18:43,616 --> 00:18:46,316
Moreover, only the articles concerning the bank robbery incident

320
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:49,716
the other day are cut out and edited.

321
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:51,816
This is the video footage that's been aired since this morning

322
00:18:51,816 --> 00:18:56,116
of the three bank robbers taken on the surveillance camera.

323
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:58,716
If I remember correctly, it was a threesome

324
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:01,316
consisting of a small guy, thin guy and hefty guy.

325
00:19:01,316 --> 00:19:03,616
That's right. The image of the hefty guy

326
00:19:03,616 --> 00:19:06,216
firing the gun was also aired.

327
00:19:06,216 --> 00:19:09,816
Although the person who was shot was out of the scene and not visible.

328
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,216
Now, the funeral of the man, Mr. Kenya Shono,

329
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:15,516
the bank clerk who intervened and was shot to death at this time,

330
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:16,916
was held last night.

331
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,716
The long line of people who were touched by his action,

332
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:22,716
and attended the funeral continued until after midnight.

333
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,416
This man is...

334
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,516
Kei's older brother who was on Kei's cell phone's standby display!

335
00:19:27,516 --> 00:19:31,016
But, why are their last names different?

336
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:32,516
Besides, isn't it strange?

337
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:35,216
If the person who was living here was Kei's older brother,

338
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,516
he couldn't have edited this morning's news?

339
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:40,916
Well, regardless of who was living here,

340
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,716
to think that the person kept a collection of this news

341
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,316
and talk and variety shows.

342
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:49,316
This person was most likely, a super crime freak,

343
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:50,916
the bereaved member of the deceased

344
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,016
who had his mind set on taking revenge, or more naturally,

345
00:19:54,016 --> 00:19:55,416
the bank robber himself.

346
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,616
True.

347
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:02,116
At any rate, let's investigate this room a bit more.

348
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,916
Even so, there's nowhere else to look

349
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,416
but the computer that is left in the bedroom already.

350
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,816
Oh, uh.

351
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:12,016
Why are you my father's disciple

352
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,816
when you're already a really sharp detective?

353
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:16,316
No matter how you look at it, you're way...

354
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:23,216
Although Mouri Sensei acts to be troubled like he is now,

355
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:26,116
the fact is that he has already seen through the truth,

356
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:28,816
and is just testing me.

357
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:32,416
It was the same during the DNA case the other day too,

358
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,116
and the tragedy of the man

359
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:36,916
who shot himself to death this afternoon occurred

360
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,716
because I haughtily exposed my deduction.

361
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:41,616
I'm sure that Sensei would've coped with it in a much better way!

362
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,716
I'm still a mere greenhorn yet.

363
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:06,616
I'm sorry to trouble you, Subaru.

364
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:10,016
Don't be. Then, shall we? Where to, first of all?

365
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:11,716
Hold it a sec.

366
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,316
For now, head over to Ooishi Highway please.

367
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,416
I'll inform you of the details when we get closer.

368
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,116
Roger.

369
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:25,116
Welcome!

370
00:23:25,116 --> 00:23:27,416
-Fill it up regular. -Yes, ma'am.

371
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,316
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to use the restroom.

372
00:23:49,316 --> 00:23:50,916
Yes, ma'am.

373
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:53,916
Go inside the station, and it's beyond to the right.

374
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,916
Thank you.

375
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,116
"Next Episode" -They've started moving again.

376
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:14,816
-Kid. -It seems that he went with her

377
00:24:14,816 --> 00:24:17,116
on his own initiative.

378
00:24:17,116 --> 00:24:20,416
I moved to this apartment today.

379
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:23,216
No. Maybe.

380
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,516
Gun residue.

381
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:26,516
Who on earth are you?

382
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:32,416
Conan Edogawa.

383
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,116
A detective.

384
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:35,416
Next Conan,

385
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:39,616
"Nocturne of the Detectives (Deduction)"

386
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:57,516
Next Conan's Hint:

387
00:24:57,516 --> 00:24:59,716
"Change"

388
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:01,116
Hey, Conan, are you okay?

389
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:03,216
Sleeping is reserved especially for me.
