1
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.100
A racing second hand,
a shimmering nebula!

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.720
Conan's logic is good medicine
for hearts dried by modern society!

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.230
Today's case is in a general
hospital! Old Mori's a killer?!

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.550
He sees the single
truth for what it is,

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.560
and looks like a kid
but has the mind of an adult!

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.020
His name?

7
00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.159
"The General Hospital Murder Case."

8
00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.129
East Beika General Hospital

9
00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.429
I'm so bored.

10
00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.549
Oh, Dad...

11
00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.969
This is the old man's
3rd week in the hospital.

12
00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.679
He broke his leg while
trying to catch a criminal...

13
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.719
...but naturally, I took him down instead.

14
00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.499
But, you've been so busy lately
that this is a good chance to relax.

15
00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.869
It's meal time!

16
00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.999
Food, at last!

17
00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.709
The famous detective
sure has an appetite!

18
00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.619
How I'd love some beer and sashimi...

19
00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:30.169
That's not how a famous
detective acts, Dad! How pathetic!

20
00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.329
Nakayama Kazumi (26) Nurse

21
00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.579
But everyone is gossiping about
wanting to see the famous Mori-san!
Nakayama Kazumi (26) Nurse

22
00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.719
But everyone is gossiping about
wanting to see the famous Mori-san!

23
00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.869
Nurses in white, gossiping about me?!

24
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:41.679
Yes!

25
00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.629
I'd love to hear some stories, myself!

26
00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.369
Shirai Mitsuo (40) Physician
I'd love to hear some stories, myself!

27
00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.609
I could learn a lot!
Shirai Mitsuo (40) Physician

28
00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.459
You're too kind, Dr. Shirai...
How embarrassing!

29
00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.869
Learn a lot of what?!

30
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.529
Be careful you're not made
into a guinea pig, Detective!

31
00:02:58.779 --> 00:02:59.869
How rude!

32
00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.039
Ooooh! What a scary look!
Eto Katsutoshi (40) Surgeon

33
00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:07.829
Detective, if I'm ever killed,
Dr. Shirai will have done it!

34
00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:16.089
Who was that?

35
00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.789
That was Eto-kun, a fellow surgeon.
We attended college together.

36
00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.019
He has a sharp tongue,
but he's a talented surgeon.

37
00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.479
He may be talented, but he's a jerk.

38
00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.619
It's started raining. Maybe we
should get going, Conan-kun?

39
00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:37.659
Okay.

40
00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.409
Mori-san, you can't have alcohol,
but you can have some coffee.

41
00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.869
Could I trouble you for a story?

42
00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.869
Sure!

43
00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:55.619
This latest case was a good one
I solved using my great skills!

44
00:03:55.619 --> 00:04:00.759
It was ripe with mystery, as the
killer had left not a thing behind!

45
00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.159
Yikes! He's got a real sweet tooth!

46
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:12.819
Huh? Where's Dr. Shirai?

47
00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.829
It's already this late?

48
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.989
A murder!

49
00:04:28.119 --> 00:04:29.629
Call the police!

50
00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.959
Someone's being murdered!
Call 110! Hurry!

51
00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.919
Right away!

52
00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.159
Wait, Mori-san!

53
00:04:47.269 --> 00:04:49.159
This room is empty!

54
00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.439
Huh? I could swear it was in here...

55
00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.739
The body disappeared?!

56
00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.789
That's the only possibility,
but I did see it...

57
00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:08.459
You sure there ever was one?!

58
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.459
Are you doubting me?!

59
00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:13.489
But it's a fact that
there was nothing--

60
00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:17.939
Now, now. It's late.
You'll disturb the patients.

61
00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:18.919
Let's call it a night--

62
00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.319
Doctor! I saw it with my own two eyes--

63
00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:25.609
You've been quite exhausted lately.

64
00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:30.519
Well, I guess I did fall asleep
while telling you my story...

65
00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:38.439
So, the famous detective was tired.
Talk about a panic monger...

66
00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:46.289
Well, we'll be leaving, too.

67
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:49.889
Thank you for your time!

68
00:05:55.769 --> 00:06:00.549
However, the old man witnessed the
same thing many more times!

69
00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:03.259
There's no doubt about it this time!

70
00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.269
110! Call 110!

71
00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:10.139
Again?

72
00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.309
That's impossible...

73
00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:19.359
Excuse me!

74
00:06:19.359 --> 00:06:22.779
What's with you, Dad?!
This is the fourth time!

75
00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.199
I'm not lying! I really did see it!

76
00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.169
Dad...

77
00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:38.269
I can only guess that the stress of
dealing with all those crimes

78
00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:43.179
has gotten to him and
caused him to hallucinate...

79
00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:46.259
No! Those were no hallucinations!

80
00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.099
Dad! Calm down!
Pull yourself together!

81
00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:51.159
What's happened to you?!

82
00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.229
Guess I'll check it out just to be safe...

83
00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:10.079
These blotches were recently made...

84
00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:15.539
It did rain twice during the
time he witnessed the murders...

85
00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:25.089
In other words,
this window was open then...

86
00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:29.719
His room is diagonal from here...

87
00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:35.189
No curtains... Is that an unused room?

88
00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:38.939
That's it! Now I see!

89
00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:40.899
If the lights are on
in that room at night,

90
00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:45.569
the dark building behind it will
cause the window to act like a mirror.

91
00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:48.189
And, depending on the
angle of the open window,

92
00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:50.279
it'll project into a certain room...

93
00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:52.739
...the old man's!

94
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:56.269
The real room isn't
visible from his window.

95
00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:57.459
What's in that room...

96
00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:59.629
...is reflected onto this window...

97
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:03.629
...and looks to him as
if it's happening in here!

98
00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.809
This is a mirror trick involving windows!

99
00:08:10.049 --> 00:08:11.689
Storeroom

100
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:12.509
This is it!

101
00:08:27.269 --> 00:08:29.779
A first-aid dummy...

102
00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:33.249
They used this to act it out...

103
00:08:34.439 --> 00:08:39.069
Is this just a prank, or is there
another reason behind it?

104
00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:48.429
I'm gonna stay with
him tonight to look after him!

105
00:08:49.189 --> 00:08:51.889
How nice of you!

106
00:08:54.269 --> 00:08:57.269
Well, Mori-san,
take these and get some sleep.

107
00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:02.359
It's really coming down.

108
00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:03.689
Well, good night!

109
00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:30.299
Old man!

110
00:09:30.609 --> 00:09:33.049
Conan! Did you see that, too?!

111
00:09:33.049 --> 00:09:35.679
Yeah! That was no hallucination!

112
00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:37.179
I didn't think so!

113
00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:38.979
Ok!

114
00:09:44.649 --> 00:09:46.069
Mori Kogoro's back!

115
00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:50.279
Storeroom

116
00:09:59.769 --> 00:10:03.059
There's nobody here,
and the dummy hasn't been used...

117
00:10:03.059 --> 00:10:04.609
What does that mean?

118
00:10:04.609 --> 00:10:06.669
Oh, no! This is bad!

119
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:11.649
Old man!

120
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:15.979
Dr. Eto!

121
00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:21.189
There are two stab wounds on the body,

122
00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:25.309
and there were no vital
reactions on the second one.

123
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:29.229
So, the first killed him...

124
00:10:29.229 --> 00:10:31.189
Mori-kun!

125
00:10:31.689 --> 00:10:33.489
What happened here?!

126
00:10:33.489 --> 00:10:35.659
I'm not entirely sure, myself...

127
00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:38.619
Someone suddenly hit me and...

128
00:10:38.619 --> 00:10:40.269
Dad!

129
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:42.329
What on earth's going on?!

130
00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.789
I'm not really sure...

131
00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:47.169
Conan-kun! What happened?!

132
00:10:47.169 --> 00:10:49.249
I don't know, either-

133
00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.139
Mori-san killed Eto-kun?!

134
00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:54.549
Doesn't surprise me...

135
00:10:54.939 --> 00:10:57.009
Pardon me, but who are you?

136
00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:01.219
Mori-san's doctor, Shirai.
I'm on night duty tonight...

137
00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:04.439
You said that this doesn't surprise you...

138
00:11:04.609 --> 00:11:10.189
Oh, Mori-san has been under a
lot of stress lately, you see...

139
00:11:10.189 --> 00:11:12.519
...he even had recurring hallucinations,

140
00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:16.869
so I was worried he might
do something like this...

141
00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:17.899
Oh...

142
00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:22.329
But I saw the murder
in the opposite room, too!

143
00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:24.899
I know how you feel, Conan-kun,

144
00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:28.519
but your testimony would be
deemed as a cover for Mori-kun

145
00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:31.799
and most likely won't hold up in court.

146
00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.899
You can't be serious...

147
00:11:33.899 --> 00:11:38.109
...come to think of it, my memory
does go blank sometimes...

148
00:11:38.109 --> 00:11:41.969
I could have easily committed
a murder during then!

149
00:11:41.969 --> 00:11:43.929
Old man...

150
00:11:43.929 --> 00:11:44.889
What?!

151
00:11:45.309 --> 00:11:48.769
Stop being stupid!
Pull yourself together, Dad!

152
00:11:49.439 --> 00:11:51.939
Now, now, Ran-kun...

153
00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:55.189
Anyway, from the locations
of the room, stairs, elevators,

154
00:11:55.189 --> 00:12:01.249
and nurse stations, it's unlikely
the killer snuck in from outside.

155
00:12:02.189 --> 00:12:07.539
Incidentally, I hear you and the
victim had heated disagreements?

156
00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:09.999
No, nothing that big!

157
00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:13.959
Nevertheless, could I have your alibi?

158
00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:18.359
Yes. It happened at 11:30, right?

159
00:12:18.359 --> 00:12:23.929
I was in my own room on
the 2nd floor of the north ward.

160
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:26.389
Can you prove this?

161
00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:31.359
Okita-kun. You delivered my
charts at about that time, right?

162
00:12:31.939 --> 00:12:35.279
Yes. It was around then.

163
00:12:35.439 --> 00:12:38.239
And you're certain he
was in the room at the time?

164
00:12:38.439 --> 00:12:40.849
Yes. He was on the phone, though...

165
00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.649
for quite some time.

166
00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:46.979
Dr. Shirai.
for quite some time.

167
00:12:46.979 --> 00:12:49.789
I brought your charts.
And some coffee.

168
00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:51.109
Oh, thanks!

169
00:12:51.109 --> 00:12:55.259
I'm on the phone, so could
you just leave 'em on the desk?

170
00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:56.179
Okay!

171
00:13:00.269 --> 00:13:03.389
It was just then that all this happened...

172
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:07.769
So, although you didn't see him,
you're sure you spoke with him

173
00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:09.609
and not a recording?

174
00:13:09.609 --> 00:13:10.349
Yes.

175
00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:13.309
So my alibi checks out, Inspector.

176
00:13:14.359 --> 00:13:16.189
But what kind of call was it?

177
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:18.779
Did you call them, or did they call you?

178
00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:20.249
What's that matter?

179
00:13:20.249 --> 00:13:21.449
Well?

180
00:13:21.609 --> 00:13:27.269
An anonymous person had called
to complain about my diagnosis.

181
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:28.909
You get them once in a while.

182
00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:32.249
In other words, we can't ID the caller.

183
00:13:32.249 --> 00:13:35.959
Which means Mori-kun
is the most suspect...

184
00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:37.419
What?!

185
00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:40.109
Is that really so?

186
00:13:40.109 --> 00:13:43.689
Dr. Shirai's alibi
does seem airtight. But...

187
00:13:47.849 --> 00:13:50.939
Dr. Shirai clearly opened
the old man's curtains

188
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.519
and set the alarm clock

189
00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:58.979
so he would witness
those murder scenes...

190
00:13:59.769 --> 00:14:01.649
But that alibi of his...

191
00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:03.019
Shirai

192
00:14:12.689 --> 00:14:15.459
A speakerphone...

193
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:23.259
He didn't use any sugar...

194
00:14:29.439 --> 00:14:34.019
That's it! Now I understand his alibi trick!

195
00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:37.479
No doubt about it!
The killer was Dr. Shirai!

196
00:14:37.859 --> 00:14:39.939
But I have no proof...

197
00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:43.829
Wait. Could this coffee cup...

198
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:47.659
Hey, Mister Examiner!

199
00:14:49.109 --> 00:14:52.519
Oh, the boy staying with Mori-san!

200
00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.539
Things don't look so good this time...

201
00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:59.629
Actually, Inspector Megure said
he wants you to check something.

202
00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:02.899
Shirai

203
00:15:04.769 --> 00:15:06.689
So?!

204
00:15:06.689 --> 00:15:09.429
Yeah, it was just like you said!

205
00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:11.189
I thought so!

206
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:16.649
I found proof on the coffee cup
that Dr. Shirai was the killer!

207
00:15:28.819 --> 00:15:30.399
Here it comes, Inspector!

208
00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:31.979
What?!

209
00:15:31.979 --> 00:15:33.499
What's going on, Megure-san?!

210
00:15:33.729 --> 00:15:38.319
Don't worry! This is the unique
pose "Sleeping Kogoro" takes

211
00:15:38.319 --> 00:15:39.879
when using his logic!

212
00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:45.339
This is a cleverly devised
two-step crime, everyone.

213
00:15:45.339 --> 00:15:48.979
The first step was to mentally
drive me into a corner enough

214
00:15:48.979 --> 00:15:53.769
to convince me and everyone
else that I committed a murder

215
00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:55.349
out of stress.

216
00:15:55.349 --> 00:15:59.319
The second step was
to commit that murder

217
00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:04.279
and then execute his alibi trick
to avoid being suspected himself.

218
00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:12.119
To do so, he first used the first-aid
dummy in the fourth floor storeroom.

219
00:16:12.119 --> 00:16:17.569
The killer opened the murder
room window at a certain angle

220
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:21.649
and made his fake murders
in the storeroom reflect off of it

221
00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:25.649
so that I would see it from the south ward.

222
00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:28.689
And then, at 11:30,

223
00:16:28.689 --> 00:16:32.469
he called the victim into
the room and murdered him.

224
00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:38.479
Just like his previous acts,
but this time for real.

225
00:16:38.479 --> 00:16:41.859
That's what Conan and I witnessed.

226
00:16:41.859 --> 00:16:45.819
But how could he get you
to witness it so conveniently?

227
00:16:45.819 --> 00:16:51.779
To do that, the killer visited
my room, opened the curtains,

228
00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:56.749
and had me take an adjusted
amount of sleeping medicine.

229
00:16:56.749 --> 00:17:02.209
In addition, he set the alarm clock
to 11:30, the time of the murder.

230
00:17:02.209 --> 00:17:06.799
He then knocked me out with a
blunt object after I rushed into the room

231
00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:09.759
and put the knife in my
hand to get my fingerprints on it.

232
00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:11.859
Who, exactly?!

233
00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:19.349
Don't tell me you did it...

234
00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.689
Isn't that what you want to say, Mori-san?

235
00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:28.019
Yes. Dr. Eto's murderer was you, Dr. Shirai!

236
00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:31.869
But I have an alibi, Mori-san.

237
00:17:32.479 --> 00:17:34.319
He's right, Mori-kun!

238
00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:39.769
He had her deliver the charts then,
and he even talked with her!

239
00:17:39.769 --> 00:17:41.829
It wasn't a recording, either!

240
00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:43.789
It was the cell phone.

241
00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:46.419
Cell phone?

242
00:17:46.419 --> 00:17:53.519
First, the doctor called his cell
phone from his room just after 11:00,

243
00:17:53.519 --> 00:17:57.559
turned on the speaker, and went
to the murder room in the north ward.

244
00:17:58.439 --> 00:18:02.149
He then murdered Dr. Eto,
who he had called there ahead of time,

245
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:07.019
used the body to act
out a murder at 11:30,

246
00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:12.519
and then used his cell phone to converse
with the nurse over the phone.

247
00:18:17.449 --> 00:18:21.709
Then, when I arrived on the scene,
he hit me with a blunt object,

248
00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:26.479
knocked me out, and put the knife
in my hands to put my prints on it.

249
00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:30.859
Finally, he returned to his
room during the commotion

250
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.319
and turned the phone off.

251
00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:37.519
He must have felt quite
relieved that it was all over.

252
00:18:37.979 --> 00:18:40.319
But he made one big oversight.

253
00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:44.069
The coffee the
nurse kindly brought him.

254
00:18:44.069 --> 00:18:49.439
I assume you all know
Dr. Shirai has a real sweet tooth?

255
00:18:49.439 --> 00:18:53.649
However, the coffee's
sugar hadn't been used at all.

256
00:18:53.649 --> 00:18:59.369
This means Dr. Shirai
hadn't drunk the coffee.

257
00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:04.439
Ridiculous. Even I take
it without sugar sometimes.

258
00:19:04.439 --> 00:19:06.959
I would hardly call that proof.

259
00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:10.049
So, then you did drink it?

260
00:19:10.479 --> 00:19:14.069
Yeah, but if you're going to say
how there was no saliva on it,

261
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:17.359
that might be because
I gave it a quick rinse.

262
00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:19.689
There's something else missing.

263
00:19:19.689 --> 00:19:21.979
Oh? What would that be?

264
00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:26.939
Your fingerprints.
There aren't any on the coffee cup.

265
00:19:26.939 --> 00:19:29.439
That's because I rinsed it...

266
00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:36.369
But the fingerprints of the nurse
who brought it are on the handle.

267
00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:44.269
Are you saying you washed off
your fingerprints from on top of hers?

268
00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:45.689
That'd be impossible.

269
00:19:45.689 --> 00:19:52.319
In short, when you rinsed the
coffee cup, you had gloves on.

270
00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:54.759
The surgical gloves you
had used during the murder...

271
00:19:54.759 --> 00:19:58.219
Why was he wearing gloves before then?

272
00:19:58.219 --> 00:20:01.649
When he returned to
his room after the murder,

273
00:20:01.649 --> 00:20:05.229
he probably still had
the weapon he hit me with.

274
00:20:05.229 --> 00:20:08.229
He couldn't get his prints
on it before he disposed of it.

275
00:20:08.649 --> 00:20:13.729
At any rate, once back in his room,
he felt he had to down the coffee,

276
00:20:13.729 --> 00:20:17.479
or else his alibi of being in
the room would seem suspect,

277
00:20:17.479 --> 00:20:23.989
so he hurriedly poured it out,
with gloves still on, and rinsed the cup.

278
00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:27.539
But only the inside.

279
00:20:27.539 --> 00:20:33.459
For that reason, only the nurse's
fingerprints remained on the cup.

280
00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:36.519
You said you drank the coffee.

281
00:20:36.519 --> 00:20:41.969
Are there any other reasons your
fingerprints weren't on the handle?

282
00:20:44.109 --> 00:20:45.229
How ironic.

283
00:20:45.229 --> 00:20:50.229
Leaving evidence because of the
gloves I wore to leave no evidence...

284
00:20:50.229 --> 00:20:52.319
So you admit to it?

285
00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:54.859
It's all as Mori-san said.

286
00:20:54.859 --> 00:20:57.319
Why? What was your motive?!

287
00:20:57.319 --> 00:21:01.649
Our chief surgeon is being
forced to retire next month.

288
00:21:01.649 --> 00:21:06.289
Eto and I were the
candidates for his position...

289
00:21:06.729 --> 00:21:11.359
But Eto blackmailed me into declining!

290
00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:14.759
I had no choice but
to accept his demand...

291
00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:19.979
He knew I had bought
my way into medical school.

292
00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:25.729
After all, the professor
I paid off was his father!

293
00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:31.689
Why did I ever pay out all
that money to get into school?

294
00:21:31.689 --> 00:21:38.609
In other words, crime and
dishonesty doesn't pay, Doctor.

295
00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:22.929
I hate this! I'm through
with this Sleeping Kogoro stuff!

296
00:23:22.929 --> 00:23:27.259
How come? You solved
that case easily enough!

297
00:23:28.169 --> 00:23:29.259
I did?

298
00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:30.219
That's right!

299
00:23:31.829 --> 00:23:37.189
I guess old Sleeping Kogoro
is still going strong after all!

300
00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:40.369
He never learns...

301
00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:52.149
Teacher! Sonoko!

302
00:23:52.529 --> 00:23:54.989
After she was knocked
out with chloroform,

303
00:23:54.989 --> 00:23:57.369
she was strangled with a rope!

304
00:23:57.779 --> 00:23:59.829
There are still tracks here!

305
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:01.829
The front door...

306
00:24:01.829 --> 00:24:06.909
That means the killer
is still inside this lodge!

307
00:24:08.199 --> 00:24:09.739
On the next Conan:

308
00:24:09.739 --> 00:24:13.179
