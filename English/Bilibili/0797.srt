1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,340
"Funako Nakai (22)" -A person went missing yesterday!

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,940
It would make me extremely happy if you could find him.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,240
I heard that yesterday and I refused.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,640
I'm busy, you see.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,340
No offense.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,940
But you look like you have a lot of time on your hands.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,240
What?

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,240
I don't believe I'm getting through to you.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,240
"Crime Plan" -So once again...

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,340
A "Crime Plan"?

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,340
I'm telling you that's a bunch of baloney.

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,740
Besides, you're not even acquainted

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,340
with that guy's who's missing, right?

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,840
Oh, well...

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,340
I just happened to run into him on the street and...

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,440
"The Mirage" -He was the split image of "Mr. Mirage"

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,840
a character that appears in the popular game for girls.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,440
So you followed him and snuck camera shots of him.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Sort of.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Like I said, detectives don't go helping stalkers.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,740
No one cares about your merge or whatever.

22
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,940
Go on home!

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,340
It's Mr. Mirage.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,040
Why don't you go to the police?

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,340
Your suggestion is more than sensible but I can't.

26
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,040
I don't have much time left.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,040
This could be my big break.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,940
For this could be the birth of Detective Funachi!

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,740
Solving mysteries with sharp deductions.

30
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,740
Love and cases come from the same origin.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,940
An odd client who calls herself "Funachi".

32
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,240
A mere missing person search leads to an unexpected case.

33
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,740
He sees through the one and only truth.

34
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,640
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,740
His name is Detective Conan.

36
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:34,461
"The Starry-Eyed Girl's Confused Deduction"

37
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:47,161
"Hikone"

38
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:54,361
Mr. Hikone. Are you there?

39
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:55,961
Mr. Hikone?

40
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,861
I, Funachi, can't go any farther than this.

41
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:03,361
Mr. Hikone? Is that the name of the man who disappeared?

42
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:07,061
You're the boy I just saw a while ago.

43
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:09,261
I'm Conan Edogawa.

44
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,061
I'm sorry. I haven't introduced myself.

45
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,761
I'm Funako Nakai.

46
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:16,561
If it's okay with you, please call me Funachi.

47
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:18,561
Miss Funachi.

48
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:20,061
No need for honorifics.

49
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,661
By the way, Funachi is the name of a heroine

50
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:25,761
that appears in a popular girly game who adores Mr. Mirage.

51
00:04:25,761 --> 00:04:27,261
And I'm borrowing her name, you see.

52
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:29,961
There may be copyright issues and such,

53
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:32,061
but I hope people understand that

54
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:33,661
it's only out of respect and inspiration that I do so.

55
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:37,761
Additionally, based on the game's world view and setting...

56
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,161
I can't keep up.

57
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,161
And?

58
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,561
Since when has he been missing, Mr. Hikone?

59
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,261
The day before yesterday when I visited him in the afternoon,

60
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:51,361
the door was unlocked and no one was in.

61
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:53,861
I think nobody's been here since.

62
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:56,161
Two full days.

63
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:57,661
What's this?

64
00:04:57,661 --> 00:05:00,461
The lock's been tampered with. Moreover, just recently.

65
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:03,661
I, Funachi, had noticed that too.

66
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,561
I wonder if it's a burglar after all?

67
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,761
"What are you?"

68
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,961
Where did tied up Mr. Mirage...

69
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:16,361
I mean Mr. Hikone disappear to?

70
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,461
Tied up?

71
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:20,561
Oh, maybe?

72
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,161
Please excuse me!

73
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,461
He's not here.

74
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:24,761
Not here.

75
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,061
Not here either.

76
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:27,261
He's not here!

77
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:29,461
Which means...

78
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,761
Hey, just what're you...

79
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,761
Mr. Edogawa, please help me!

80
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:39,661
Maybe Mr. Hikone is buried under here!

81
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:42,161
Mr. Edogawa?

82
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,461
You know what?

83
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:49,661
This is the second floor so I don't think it's likely at all.

84
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,361
Right.

85
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:54,161
Funachi, you goofed again.

86
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,961
A fantasist.

87
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,661
Mr. Mirage.

88
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:00,061
Stay here.

89
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:05,461
Hello.

90
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:08,161
"Takashi Kiyose (20), University Student"

91
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,561
-What? -Do you know where

92
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:13,861
your next door neighbor, Mr. Hikone, went?

93
00:06:13,861 --> 00:06:15,761
No, I don't.

94
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:18,261
But was that the name of my neighbor?

95
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,961
Did you notice something different about him or around him?

96
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,361
No, not really.

97
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,961
"Akio Nashida (40)" -Cut out the noise.

98
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:30,061
What's all the racket about?

99
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,161
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:35,161
I'm looking for your neighbor, Mr. Hikone.

101
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,961
Hikone?

102
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:40,161
Don't know him!

103
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,061
Wait...

104
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:47,161
"Kiyose"

105
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:48,861
"Nashida"

106
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,961
Just what's going on?

107
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,661
I was scared out of my wits for a moment.

108
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:04,161
Please close the door, Mr. Edogawa.

109
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,561
Okay.

110
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,461
What was that?

111
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:17,261
It felt like someone watching.

112
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:18,961
Is anything wrong?

113
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:20,761
Oh, nope.

114
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:23,461
Funachi, you said you can't go to the police

115
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:24,961
and you don't have time.

116
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,361
Does that have something to do with that notebook?

117
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:32,361
Could it be that Mr. Edogawa, you're a detective too?

118
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:36,261
Yes. I always help Pops out.

119
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,261
In other words,

120
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:40,561
my concerns over confidentiality have already been eliminated?

121
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:44,261
-Yeah. -Please take a look at it, then.

122
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,961
This is Mr. Hikone's?

123
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,861
Yes, I think it's handwritten.

124
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,961
"No, Funachi, not that!"

125
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,061
I scolded myself in this way.

126
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:57,161
But I was so worried about Mr. Hikone

127
00:07:57,161 --> 00:08:01,161
that I finally came in here yesterday and took it.

128
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:06,361
This is?

129
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:16,561
So, once a month the jewelries are exchanged for more expensive ones.

130
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:19,261
The date is October 24th.

131
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:20,561
It's today!

132
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:25,161
Today is indeed the day that the crime will be committed!

133
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:29,361
The way the jewelries will be delivered is also written in detail.

134
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,761
Don't tell me this is a real "Crime Plan"?

135
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,461
But no matter how hard I looked,

136
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:38,861
I couldn't find a jewelry store that matched the one in the notebook.

137
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:40,161
Wait a second.

138
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:45,861
I wonder what Mr. Hikone is doing at this time...

139
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:47,961
Wearing a mask and armed with a pistol.

140
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,461
"Quiet, or I'll kill you!"

141
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:50,861
"The jewelry, hurry up!"

142
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:54,961
"Put the jewelry in this bag!" -Maybe he threaten the salesclerk this way.

143
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:58,761
What should I, Funachi, do?

144
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:01,961
After taking a good look, isn't there something funny about this?

145
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:05,061
I'm stunned and lost at this point!

146
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,761
Over here and over here too.

147
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:08,861
They're all reversed.

148
00:09:08,861 --> 00:09:11,061
Reversed?

149
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:13,861
The door keys and the keys of the cases as well.

150
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,361
They're useless this way.

151
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:18,461
I see!

152
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:22,761
Maybe the name of the store too?

153
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,161
Isigami.

154
00:09:24,161 --> 00:09:26,061
I found it!

155
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:28,861
Moreover, it's right near here.

156
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,361
Only a two to three minute walk from here!

157
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:34,361
-Really? -You're fantastic, Mr. Edogawa!

158
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:38,161
Magnificent deduction and gathering of clues.

159
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,961
But, what shall we do?

160
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:42,361
Shall we make a call?

161
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:45,061
Or shall we go there?

162
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,061
If I do that, I may run into Mr. Hikone

163
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:49,061
when he's committing the robbery.

164
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:56,361
-Please don't, Mr. Hikone! -What is it? Something's not right.

165
00:09:58,461 --> 00:09:59,561
That's...

166
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:04,461
"Becoming an Author, How to Write Novels, Guide to Novels"

167
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:06,561
Maybe.

168
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:12,961
Here it is!

169
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:18,361
But the most important thing isn't here.

170
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,661
No, rather, it was here.

171
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:24,361
Maybe?

172
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:25,361
"Tenbun Publishing"

173
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,661
"Tenbun Publishing"

174
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,161
Yes, hello?

175
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:35,161
This is Tenbun Publishing's Tenbun Monthly editorial department calling.

176
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,261
I'd like to speak to Mr. Kazumasa Hikone, please.

177
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,961
Well, he's not in at the moment.

178
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:42,961
Oh, you must be his family.

179
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,961
Well, the novel "Crime Plan" he brought in the other day,

180
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,061
was evaluated at our editorial meeting

181
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,461
and we decided to publish it.

182
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:55,361
Will you please ask him to call us back?

183
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:58,261
The advent of a shocking truth!

184
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,861
I will. Goodbye.

185
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:04,261
Which means these are the papers he rewrote

186
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:08,061
and the things in the notebook are his interviews and research?

187
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:10,161
Yes, I think so.

188
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:15,361
In other words, everything is a coincidence, like always.

189
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,661
Like always, I, Funachi's...

190
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:22,361
Disappointment again.

191
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:25,561
Rather, what is it about Mr. Hikone's illusion as a novelist

192
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,261
that can make me mistake his world for reality?

193
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:29,761
It's what can be called God's territory.

194
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:32,961
I... I doubt that.

195
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,761
Rather, there are too many questions unanswered.

196
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,861
Most importantly, it's that the whereabouts of Mr. Hikone

197
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,861
have been unknown for a full two days already.

198
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,661
"Isigami Jewelry"

199
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:50,561
Quiet or I'll kill you!

200
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,761
Hurry, give me the jewelry!

201
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,479
Don't tell me?

202
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,479
Mr. Edogawa?

203
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,279
What do you mean by "don't tell me"?

204
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,279
Oh, no, it can't be?

205
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,479
Officer Takagi!

206
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,479
Conan?

207
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,079
A robbery?

208
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,479
Well, sort of...

209
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:39,179
Today's the jewelry renewal day, isn't it?

210
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,079
The robber who entered the basement broiler room

211
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,679
from the manhole of the sewer.

212
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:50,279
Stole all the jewelry that was just brought in, no?

213
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,279
How did you know?

214
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,979
Just as I thought.

215
00:12:55,979 --> 00:12:59,479
What I feared has come true.

216
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,779
Could this lie be real or could this reality be an illusion?

217
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,479
I, Funachi, can't figure it out.

218
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,879
Who is she?

219
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:20,079
We've just stationed officers in the sewers and all connected exits.

220
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,779
That's exactly what the perpetrator would want you to do.

221
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:23,879
What?

222
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,179
He's going to make it look as if he's going out the same way he got in

223
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,179
but no, he's going to flee above ground.

224
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,079
That's the plan.

225
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,679
Plan?

226
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,379
Right.

227
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,479
See.

228
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,679
This is...

229
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,279
It's a toy gun.

230
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,879
It's just as planned too.

231
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,379
Come to think of it.

232
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,879
Funachi, show me the notebook once more.

233
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,279
Oh, here.

234
00:13:58,579 --> 00:13:59,779
Here.

235
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,079
"I kill the crime planner somewhere nearby

236
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,079
and make everyone believe I fled far."

237
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:07,279
"Then go back to everyday life."

238
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,879
"This indeed is the perfect crime."

239
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,379
I see!

240
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,579
Could it be that the perpetrator is someone else?

241
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:20,179
-What? -Oh my! My Mr. Mirage is doomed!

242
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,779
I, Funachi, will not be defeated!

243
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,679
Mr. Edogawa, let's capture the real perpetrator!

244
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,579
Hey, wait, where are you going?

245
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,679
I wonder where to?

246
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,079
This way, Funachi!

247
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,779
Conan?

248
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,479
Officer Takagi, come with us too.

249
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:37,279
Okay!

250
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:47,179
What're you guys?

251
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,979
Mr. Nashida?

252
00:14:48,979 --> 00:14:51,379
Could you give us a minute?

253
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:52,479
Police?

254
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:55,079
What the heck did I do?

255
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,679
Hey, Funachi.

256
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,479
How come the paper flew up back then?

257
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,879
It's a mystery.

258
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,679
A wind suddenly came blowing.

259
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,179
But, the window of Mr. Hikone's room was closed, wasn't it?

260
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,179
That's why when we first opened the door, the paper didn't fly?

261
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,279
Maybe?

262
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:28,979
I found it!

263
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:32,279
The wind indeed blew in from there!

264
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,379
Mr. Nashida, you were watching Mr. Hikone writing his novel

265
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,979
from that space over there, weren't you?

266
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,479
Then you set your eyes on the computer that was here,

267
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,979
broke the lock, entered, and stole it.

268
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,379
What? Is it true?

269
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:54,979
You gotta be joking!

270
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,879
Why don't you search my room and all then!

271
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,779
If it's not in your room,

272
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:01,879
you probably pawned it off at a pawn.

273
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,179
If I'm not mistaken there's a pawn shop nearby, isn't there?

274
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:07,279
I'll bet you have the pawn ticket and the cash

275
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,779
in your pocket right this moment?

276
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:12,279
Isn't that why you're in such a good mood?

277
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,379
Then, you read this "Crime Plan", carried it out,

278
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,379
robbed the jewelry store

279
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,379
and even killed Hikone.

280
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,279
Wait! What?

281
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,779
Cut out the joke!

282
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:28,179
Then, please tell us the whole truth.

283
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:31,579
Like I said. I did steal the computer

284
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:33,379
and pawned it off.

285
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:36,979
But when I went in, the door lock was already broken.

286
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:38,079
I hope you're telling the truth?

287
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,379
I'm not lying!

288
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,279
I didn't rob any jewelry store. It's the truth!

289
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,479
Funachi, the papers that flew in the air

290
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:49,679
when Mr. Nashida closed the door, was that the first time?

291
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,979
There's one here too!

292
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:09,079
Right.

293
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,379
The eyes I felt were watching back then were coming from both sides.

294
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:15,279
And the real perpetrator is...

295
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,779
What on earth do you want?

296
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,279
Don't play dumb. I know you read it.

297
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,679
What?

298
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:40,779
Mr. Kiyose, may I talk to you for a while?

299
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:41,979
So, what?

300
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,179
So, if you peek in from there,

301
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,979
I'll bet you could see Mr. Hikone's back,

302
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,079
or rather, the computer screen?

303
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,579
Then you decided to rob the jewelry store and broke into his house.

304
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,879
You carefully and meticulously read the "Crime Plan"

305
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,479
and committed the crime, didn't you?

306
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:56,879
You gotta be joking!

307
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:58,279
Where's the proof?

308
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,679
You got so much mud on.

309
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,579
You should've kept your waders on right through.

310
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,479
I got it!

311
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,479
If you also used the sewer when returning home,

312
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,479
you wouldn't have gotten mud on yourself.

313
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,079
You got it on because you returned above ground, right?

314
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,379
Above ground?

315
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,079
There are two parallel roads that you can take

316
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,479
to come from the jewelry store to here.

317
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:23,679
We took one of those roads to make a round trip,

318
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,079
but we didn't run into you, Mr. Kiyose.

319
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,479
The other road that you took because it rained last night,

320
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:32,479
I believe had a lot of puddles.

321
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,279
What's this?

322
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:37,879
That's...

323
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:43,679
It's a match!

324
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,579
When you broke the door lock,

325
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:48,479
it must've chipped off and flew into the closet.

326
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,479
All that needs to be accounted for now are the jewelry.

327
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,179
I'll get a search warrant right away and...

328
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:56,679
As to that, it's probably...

329
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:59,779
Mr. Kiyose, that key for the coin locker

330
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:02,579
wasn't there a while ago, was it?

331
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,779
I see! There was a station on the way here.

332
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,279
You mean he put it in that coin locker?

333
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:12,179
I was fired from my part-time job.

334
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,379
Money. I wanted money!

335
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:18,879
But, that doesn't mean you can go and kill people, does it?

336
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:20,079
Don't be ridiculous!

337
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,479
I didn't kill anybody!

338
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:26,079
Then where could Mr. Hikone be?

339
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:32,179
Who are all you people?

340
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,079
No joke?

341
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,079
So, he was fine after all.

342
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,079
Are you Mr. Hikone?

343
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,379
Police?

344
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,979
How did you know he'd be all fine?

345
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:45,179
Because his room was clean.

346
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,179
I just didn't think it was possible that he was attacked here.

347
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,879
If he were to be attacked outside,

348
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,579
his keys would've been stolen,

349
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,279
and the room didn't have to be broken into, right?

350
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,779
In other words,

351
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,579
you're something Mr. Edogawa!

352
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:02,279
You're in God's realm! Rather, you're God!

353
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,279
I see.

354
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,479
I'm sorry to have caused you trouble.

355
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:36,279
But, where were you for a full two days?

356
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,579
I was fed up with my lack of talent,

357
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:40,779
so I was wandering here and there.

358
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:45,279
I ran out of money so I had no choice but to come on home again.

359
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,079
I feel wretched.

360
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,479
Writing's not my cup of tea. It's just a dream.

361
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,579
I've had enough of illusions.

362
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:54,379
I'm going back to my hometown.

363
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:58,379
However, that illusion, rather that dream that you had

364
00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:00,879
has become a reality.

365
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:03,479
You got a call from the publisher.

366
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:07,779
They say that your "Crime Plan" is going to be published.

367
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:10,379
Yeah, right

368
00:22:10,379 --> 00:22:11,679
No. Really?

369
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,679
Yeah.

370
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:17,279
I did it!

371
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:23,679
You're Ms. Funachi?

372
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,579
Do you know each other?

373
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,779
A while ago, I went to interview a game software store.

374
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,779
Back then, she explained everything in more detail

375
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,279
than the salesclerk there, you see.

376
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:42,679
You lied saying that you met him coincidentally on the street.

377
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:43,879
I, Funachi, no...

378
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:47,879
I just thought he wouldn't remember me.

379
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:51,679
Therefore, based on my calm and objective discretion...

380
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,879
Could it be that you saved me?

381
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:58,179
Are you from the police?

382
00:22:58,179 --> 00:22:59,379
What?

383
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,379
Or a detective?

384
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,779
I...

385
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:05,179
Thank you!

386
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:08,179
How about going out to eat together as a token of my appreciation?

387
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,579
May I write about you in my next novel?

388
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:13,779
Tell me more about yourself, Funachi!

389
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,379
Could this be what is called a happy ending, Funachi?

390
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:21,979
This was totally unexpected, you see!

391
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:25,079
I'm sorry to have to turn you down but,

392
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,679
To think that 2D will become 3D

393
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,879
and Mr. Mirage will turn out to be the real thing.

394
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:34,179
It's totally unbelievable for me!

395
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,779
Oh, wait, Funachi!

396
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:38,879
Funachi...

397
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:41,779
Wait!

398
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:43,779
How'd the case turn out?

399
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:49,479
The case gave birth to a detective of a girly game.

400
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,379
"Next Episode"

401
00:23:56,379 --> 00:23:58,579
Messed up in a suicide?

402
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:00,979
You were called out here by someone you don't know?

403
00:24:00,979 --> 00:24:03,879
To come in front of this building at 8:00.

404
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,179
Officer Takagi said that the point at which it was supposed to be dropped

405
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,179
and the actual place it was dropped were not the same.

406
00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:13,279
Don't tell me you're thinking of something absurd?

407
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,779
Something absurd?

408
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:21,179
Next Conan, "The Moving Target"

409
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,879
Next Conan's Hint:

410
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:41,279
"Love letter"

411
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,879
Pops, did you ever receive one?

412
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:43,979
Of course not.

413
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:45,179
I have!

414
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,279
What?
