1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,540
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,440
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,540
Deductions take shapes and styles in each and every car to be solved.

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,340
The case is solved by a person's feelings.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,340
I want to find out how Ran really feels.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,840
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,699
Pops' check up indicates that

10
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,599
he only has six months to go.

11
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,699
But it turns out to be Pops' mistake.

12
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:07,799
Pops was told to stay away from alcohol for six months.

13
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,199
Dr. Araide invites us to stay for dinner at his house.

14
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,299
However...

15
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,199
After an instant of black out,

16
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,099
Dr. Araide was found dead in the bath tub.

17
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,599
"Blind Spot in the Darkness (Part 2)"

18
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,799
You're a doctor and coach of a basketball club as well?

19
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:35,199
You can ask Ran about me.

20
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,899
I coach at Teitan High School, the school that she goes to.

21
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,799
Don't tell me that

22
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:46,599
Ran's going to that karate class everyday because...

23
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:49,799
She wants to see him?

24
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,899
I see.

25
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:53,499
Is that right, Ran?

26
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,499
Yes, you can verify the fact

27
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:57,799
if you contact the high school.

28
00:02:57,799 --> 00:02:59,299
I think that's prove my innocence.

29
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:02,199
-May I give the treatment? -Sure.

30
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:06,799
Oh, and I want you to come to the clinic too, Grandma.

31
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,399
You can't fool me.

32
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,499
I see you've been trying hide the fact that

33
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:12,099
something is wrong with your leg when you walk, since some time ago.

34
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,599
Leg?

35
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:19,599
What happened here?

36
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,299
When the lights went out and I came down here,

37
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,399
I stepped on something strange.

38
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,999
May I go to help him treat everyone?

39
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:31,899
Sure, go ahead.

40
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,299
Inspector. I've verified the person that

41
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,299
Yoko was talking to on the phone when the lights went out.

42
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,299
Oh, and?

43
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,799
According to the person she was talking to,

44
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,799
the time it took since Yoko told her that the lights went out

45
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,099
to the time she reported that the lights went back on,

46
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,999
was about a minute.

47
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,699
I'd like to hear from Yoko what they were talking about,

48
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,099
and see if they match.

49
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,399
Will you tell us?

50
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,999
Yes,

51
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,999
after I finish help him treat everyone.

52
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,299
Well...

53
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,099
if it's okay with you, I can go help him instead.

54
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,899
I'm pretty good at doing things like this.

55
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,999
Oh, then will you?

56
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,099
Huh?

57
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,799
The contents of what they talked about match.

58
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,499
A catch phone came in, and their conversation

59
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,899
was interrupted only for a matter of 6 to 7 seconds.

60
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,699
There is no doubt that Yoko was on the phone

61
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,599
right through the black out.

62
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:24,699
True.

63
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,199
Why, of course...

64
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,499
If you have the blueprint of this house,

65
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:30,899
I would like to take a look at it.

66
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,299
Yes, of course.

67
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,699
This is the bath tub where your husband

68
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,299
was electrocuted to death.

69
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:41,599
So, this is the kitchen where we are now.

70
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,499
Yes.

71
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,099
Uh, where's the breaker?

72
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:48,299
Go left the corridor in front of kitchen,

73
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:50,899
then go left twice, and turn right once.

74
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,899
It's over here.

75
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:57,199
Hikaru left the kitchen to check the breaker

76
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,999
at just about the same time that

77
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,699
you were telling Masae about the black out on the phone?

78
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:05,499
-Yes. -If so,

79
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:08,399
isn't one minute much too long?

80
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,099
It looks to me that it wouldn't take 30 seconds

81
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,899
to get to the breaker.

82
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,799
Hikaru is a newcomer here

83
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:16,499
and she's still not used to this house.

84
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:20,799
But, when the young doctor saw Hikaru's burn, he said,

85
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:24,099
"You're always too tolerant from before."

86
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,599
Oh.

87
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,099
Tomoaki was talking about his days back

88
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:30,199
when he was a medical student at Tohto University,

89
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,299
and Hikaru used to be one of his patients.

90
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,699
It seems that she was tolerated pain so much

91
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,299
that her appendix almost burst.

92
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:41,299
So, that's how Hikaru came to work for this house?

93
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,499
Yes. Since Mother is aged,

94
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:48,499
and it's hard of me to keep such a large house in order,

95
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,699
I was looking for a live-in maid.

96
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,799
I feel wretched,

97
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,399
because I hear Chiaki used to handle everything by herself.

98
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,799
Chiaki?

99
00:05:56,799 --> 00:06:00,299
Oh. You mean Tomoaki's mother who passed away.

100
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:03,499
The one who passed away of a traffic accident four years ago.

101
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,699
I hear she was drunk driving.

102
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,799
She wasn't a strong drinker, and she never really drank much.

103
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:12,099
So, I still can't believe it actually happened yet.

104
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,899
By the way, where is grandma's room?

105
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,799
Oh, it's upstairs.

106
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:20,499
You go up the stairs to the left of the kitchen

107
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:23,399
and the large room in the foreground is her room.

108
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,699
An elderly has a room that is upstairs?

109
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:28,799
Yes, mother likes the room where she can have

110
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:31,399
an overall view of the garden.

111
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,499
Hikaru's room is situated right next door,

112
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,199
so that when something happens, she could run right over.

113
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:42,199
Inspector, the killer probably used the catch phone.

114
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,899
While Yoko was distracted by the catch phone,

115
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,699
the killer went by the kitchen, went to the bathroom

116
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,699
and soaked the electric cord into the water.

117
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,699
You idiot. How's the killer going to get back out then?

118
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,899
I guess so.

119
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,299
What are you whispering to each other about again?

120
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,699
Uh, well...

121
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,199
Sir!

122
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,399
Why don't we see what everyone was doing

123
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,399
when it blacked out, by mimicking?

124
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,999
I guess you're right.

125
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:06,299
Let's have them act it out

126
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:07,999
while their memories are still fresh.

127
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,299
I'll go get everybody then.

128
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,999
You're pretty good at wrapping bandage too, aren't you?

129
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,099
Oh, yes.

130
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:20,899
When I was little,

131
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,299
there was this brat who used to always get hurt.

132
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:24,799
That's why I'm so used to.

133
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:27,599
This was really long ago though.

134
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:30,199
Hey.

135
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,199
Gosh, what a bummer,

136
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,999
the one who is treating the patient gets hurt.

137
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,999
Well, but all you need to do is wash the wound

138
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,299
and bandage it, then it'll be fine.

139
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,999
I...

140
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,999
I...

141
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,999
What's up, Conan?

142
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,499
The Inspector told me tell you all to come.

143
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,599
Okay, we'll go.

144
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,999
-Hikaru. -Yes.

145
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:59,599
Will get a band aid from that shelf over there for me?

146
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,599
Okay.

147
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,599
You idiot, why'd you have to show up?

148
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,599
Uh, where's the breaker?

149
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,099
It should be around the corner to the right.

150
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,799
There it is.

151
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,399
That must be it.

152
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,199
Hey, Conan.

153
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,299
Look out, because this is the place

154
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,699
that Hikaru cracked the flower vase.

155
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,199
I cleaned the pieces of glass of the flower vase with Hikaru,

156
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:36,599
but she sure had a tough time.

157
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,999
Dr. Araide bawled her out saying,

158
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:41,399
"Next time you goof, you're out."

159
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,999
Wait a sec.

160
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:46,599
Maybe this is...

161
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:50,499
Okay, are you all ready? Let's get started.

162
00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:52,999
Yes, everything's fine by the stairs.

163
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,399
I'm in position under the breaker.

164
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,999
Okay, Takagi lower the breaker.

165
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,099
Okay.

166
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,599
Hikaru, please go over to the breaker.

167
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:03,699
Yes.

168
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:20,199
34 seconds. She didn't take a minute after all.

169
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,799
Inspector.

170
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,599
Please take a look.

171
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,599
If you go across this garden,

172
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,999
you'd have to go pass Yoko to get to the tub.

173
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,799
Hey, hey, don't tell me that...

174
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,599
Yes, that person could've committed t crime.

175
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:38,799
-Hey. -That's enough.

176
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,199
Like I already said!

177
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,699
Everyone in this house has an alibi

178
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,599
just before the black out!

179
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:48,599
So, what's the use of checking on alibis after the black out?

180
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,199
So that's...

181
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,399
Wait.

182
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,799
All it looks to me is that

183
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,799
you guys are making a big thing out of nothing

184
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:57,099
and amusing yourselves over a mere accidental death.

185
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,599
Excuse me.

186
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,399
Did I goof again?

187
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:04,999
No.

188
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,899
An alibi?

189
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:10,699
Who of the four among them have an alibi

190
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:13,099
during the time that the killing can be carried out?

191
00:10:13,099 --> 00:10:15,299
That person's the only one.

192
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,299
Among the remaining three,

193
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,299
the most suspicious person is...

194
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,099
A piece of something?

195
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,499
I wonder if this red thing is blood.

196
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:31,799
And, what is this thing stuck on to it?

197
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,599
It can't be?

198
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,699
Just as I thought.

199
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,899
It was that person after all.

200
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,999
Which means that there is only one.

201
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:51,199
Only that person could be the killer.

202
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,788
It takes about 10 seconds to make a round trip.

203
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:01,288
It seems that she is

204
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:03,288
capable of committing the murder after all.

205
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,888
Then, the thing that we were concerned about...

206
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:07,988
Yes.

207
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:10,488
It doesn't seem like it had anything to do with this.

208
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:16,188
Hey, it's come to you?

209
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:20,688
Yes. I've just figured out what went on.

210
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:25,188
I'll explain, so please take me to the bath tub.

211
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:28,688
My legs have gone weak, since I've figured everything out.

212
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:32,688
What? Take a bath?

213
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:33,888
Mr. Mouri?

214
00:11:34,988 --> 00:11:36,988
He's wet with rain.

215
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,988
Besides, he says he wants to see if he can really

216
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:42,288
be electrocuted to death by using a shaver in the tub.

217
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:44,488
Huh? Where are the Inspector and the other officers?

218
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:48,088
They said they'd call it a day and left just a while ago.

219
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,388
Oh, what a waste.

220
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,788
What a waste?

221
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:57,088
Because Pops said that he'd be putting on a deduction show

222
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:59,688
after he finishes taking a bath.

223
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,188
Did Mr. Mouri really say so?

224
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:07,488
Yep. He says he's figured out who the killer is.

225
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:09,088
Killer?

226
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:11,088
Didn't my husband die of an accident?

227
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:14,088
Beats me. I don't know about it.

228
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,788
He says he wants to put his thoughts together

229
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,288
while taking a nice bath,

230
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:19,688
so he wants you all to wait awhile.

231
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:24,988
It's already been 20 minutes since he went in.

232
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:27,788
Mr. Mouri sure is late.

233
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:31,688
I can't take this anymore. That flimsy mustache dude.

234
00:12:31,688 --> 00:12:33,888
Come, come now, mother.

235
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,288
Ran...

236
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:43,488
Could it be...

237
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:47,188
Don't tell me it's another black out?

238
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:53,388
Hikaru. Will you please go check the breaker?

239
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:54,488
Yes.

240
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,788
I wonder why it blacked out again.

241
00:12:58,788 --> 00:13:00,988
Come to think of it, that man

242
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,788
was saying something about experimenting in the bath tub.

243
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,788
Don't tell me that something happened to Dad.

244
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,988
How quick. The lights went on already.

245
00:13:11,988 --> 00:13:14,088
No, it's too soon.

246
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:17,188
Officer?

247
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:23,888
So, you were the one after all,

248
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,988
Mrs. Yoko Araide.

249
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:31,488
Huh? That little boy and Yoko's not here.

250
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:33,188
A trap?

251
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:38,688
Inspector?

252
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,888
I'm the one?

253
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:43,388
Just what are you talking about?

254
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:44,888
I just came to check

255
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:47,988
because I was worried about Mr. Mouri doing his experiment

256
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:49,588
using the shaver in the bath tub.

257
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,588
You wanted it to look that way,

258
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:53,888
and kill me, who figured out what happened,

259
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:59,188
then, pose as the first one who had found me, isn't it so?

260
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,188
Don't be ridiculous.

261
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:05,088
I was on the phone all through the black out.

262
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:08,488
You rigged a timer somewhere,

263
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:12,088
so it would short circuit and black out.

264
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:14,888
And, using that pen light,

265
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,888
you found yourself through the darkness to the bath tub,

266
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:20,988
which after you soaked the extension cord into the tub

267
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,888
that your husband was soaking in.

268
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,988
You set it up so that when someone lifted the breaker,

269
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:29,688
your husband would be electrocuted.

270
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,688
Like I said, I was on the phone with my friend

271
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,888
throughout the black out.

272
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,788
How could I have done it?

273
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:40,188
It's simple if you hide the cordless phone of this house

274
00:14:40,188 --> 00:14:44,188
and a cellular phone into your pocket beforehand.

275
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:48,888
You used the cordless phone.

276
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,188
Moreover, the main phone has a built-in rechargeable battery

277
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:55,888
that makes it usable even during black outs.

278
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:58,788
Right after Hikaru left the kitchen,

279
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:00,488
you used the cordless in place of the receiver that you were holding

280
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:02,688
and went to the tub.

281
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:07,988
Then, you used your cellular to call that house again,

282
00:15:07,988 --> 00:15:10,788
and interrupted the conversation once.

283
00:15:10,788 --> 00:15:12,288
You went to the bath tub,

284
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:17,288
grabbed the extension cord that was plugged into the outlet

285
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:20,888
and put it quietly into the water.

286
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:27,188
At that time, you probably said something like be careful

287
00:15:27,188 --> 00:15:30,388
and lead your husband to grab the railing.

288
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,488
Then, you returned to the corridor before the kitchen

289
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,188
while talking on the phone using the cordless.

290
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:35,888
You switched from using the cordless to the receiver of the main phone

291
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:38,788
and waited for the light to go on.

292
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,988
Right after Hikaru lifted the breaker,

293
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:45,088
that is why the short circuit breaker was set off.

294
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:46,888
As soon as the breaker was lifted,

295
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:50,588
an over flow of electricity ran through the railing,

296
00:15:50,588 --> 00:15:54,688
and your husband died of shock.

297
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:55,988
But, Mr. Mouri,

298
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,388
I wasn't the only one who'd be able to do that, right?

299
00:15:58,388 --> 00:16:01,388
Right. According to your plan,

300
00:16:01,388 --> 00:16:03,588
you were supposed to set up your alibi by staying on the phone,

301
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,588
as well as set everyone else' alibi up

302
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:10,488
by blocking the corridor.

303
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:13,188
But, your calculations didn't work.

304
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:18,988
Since Hikaru took 30 seconds more to lift the breaker,

305
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:23,088
her alibi could not be established.

306
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:27,988
Why did she take so much time, then?

307
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,988
Do you know?

308
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,188
The chawanmushi.

309
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:36,988
When it blacked out, Hikaru cracked a dish in the kitchen.

310
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:38,788
She carried that dish under her arm,

311
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:40,688
and hid it in her room upstairs

312
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:44,988
before going over to the breaker.

313
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:47,688
She did so because your husband threatened her

314
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:52,088
saying that the next time she goofed, she's out.

315
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,388
That's how she got burnt, then?

316
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,288
Yes, she got burn wounds

317
00:16:56,288 --> 00:17:00,188
and Mitsu hurt her leg at that time.

318
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:03,088
Mitsu who went out in the dark,

319
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:08,388
stepped on the piece of glass that Hikaru had dropped.

320
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:10,988
If Hikaru makes a round trip to her room,

321
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,188
it would take her 30 seconds more,

322
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:16,988
and Mitsu was definitely upstairs at that time.

323
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:18,588
Tomoaki, who was grabbed by the arm by Ran

324
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:22,288
throughout the black out is out of the question.

325
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:25,188
You understand now, don't you, Yoko?

326
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:28,388
The only person who could've committed the crime back then

327
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:31,788
is you, Yoko.

328
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:35,788
Inspector. Let me go to the bath tub.

329
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,388
We're still investigating.

330
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:39,988
Setting up a trap, you call this investigation.

331
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,488
You've gotta be kidding.

332
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,188
What a stupid kid.

333
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,088
Hiding the dish won't help

334
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,888
because all one has to do is count the dishes to find out.

335
00:17:51,888 --> 00:17:54,388
If Hikaru didn't do something like that,

336
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,788
I wouldn't have been suspected either.

337
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:59,888
No. Even if she didn't hide the dish,

338
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:02,388
I took it to be you, anyway.

339
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:03,388
What?

340
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:06,188
The hand that you held the receiver in.

341
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:08,388
Before Hikaru left the kitchen,

342
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,988
you were holding the receiver in your left hand.

343
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,288
But, after the lights went on, you were for some reason

344
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:16,988
had switched it to your right.

345
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:22,888
So, I thought you may have walked away from the phone once.

346
00:18:22,888 --> 00:18:26,688
You went to the bath tub together with Hikaru

347
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,988
because you didn't want her to be electrocuted by accident.

348
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:33,888
If Conan didn't stop Tomoaki who came later,

349
00:18:33,888 --> 00:18:36,488
you were going to stop him too.

350
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:38,288
Yes, that's right,

351
00:18:38,288 --> 00:18:42,088
because the late Chiaki had asked me to take care of him.

352
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:45,788
Yes, four years ago, before the car accident,

353
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:48,288
she called me and told me,

354
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,788
"Protect Tomoaki for me,"

355
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:54,388
"so that he won't turn out to be like my husband."

356
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:57,288
I didn't know what she meant back then,

357
00:18:57,288 --> 00:19:03,188
after I married him and found her dairy, I understood everything.

358
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:06,088
That he was a man who slept with every woman he saw.

359
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:09,388
He had no morals.

360
00:19:09,388 --> 00:19:10,788
And that he was the very one who made cheerful Chiaki

361
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:15,488
drown herself in alcohol and drove her to death.

362
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,088
Hey!

363
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:21,188
If possible, I'd advise you to turn yourself in.

364
00:19:21,188 --> 00:19:23,488
Oh my, how kind of you.

365
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:27,488
No, it's not for your sake.

366
00:19:27,488 --> 00:19:30,188
But, for Hikaru's sake.

367
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,188
You don't understand anything.

368
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:37,388
You are the one who set the murder up,

369
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,188
but, Hikaru is the one who pulled the trigger

370
00:19:39,188 --> 00:19:41,788
when she raised the breaker.

371
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:46,588
If she ever finds out, she'll have to carry the burden for life.

372
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:49,088
You mean the you didn't mention that

373
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,588
the first black out was rigged because...

374
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:56,888
Yes, because we didn't want her to think she was responsible.

375
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:59,888
I'd like to make a suggestion.

376
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:01,788
Could you please confess that you soaked Mr. Araide in the water,

377
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,888
put him to sleep with medication

378
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:06,688
then, put a cord attached to a timer inside the water

379
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,188
and electrocuted him,

380
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:14,288
which after you retrieved the timer during the black out?

381
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:16,488
In other words, say that the black out

382
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:18,888
was not the cause of the murder.

383
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,588
Of course if you were to leak the fact

384
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,088
that asked you to confess as such,

385
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,988
we would be put in hot water too.

386
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:29,988
Yes, I'll do as you say.

387
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:35,488
I'm still not ready to give up having a heart yet.

388
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:07,388
I'm sorry to have kept you here for so long.

389
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:08,388
No problem.

390
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:10,088
I want you to relay something to your Dad

391
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:11,588
from the corner of the corridor for me.

392
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:12,988
Who, me?

393
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:14,588
Don't tell me that...

394
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:17,288
No.

395
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:20,888
I'm sorry that I got carried away like that a while ago,

396
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:23,888
and that I'd be willing to cooperate if he should need anything.

397
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,488
How silly of me.

398
00:22:25,488 --> 00:22:27,888
Excuse me.

399
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,988
I'm sorry to impose on you at a time like this.

400
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:31,688
But, if it's okay with you...

401
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:38,188
Could you lend me that hand knitted sweater for a while?

402
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:40,888
Sweater?

403
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:43,188
"Law Eri Kisaki"

404
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:45,588
It's like this over here.

405
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:50,788
-Uh, and here... -My, what's with that sweater?

406
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:53,388
I borrowed it because I liked the pattern.

407
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:54,988
My, look at the pattern.

408
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:56,888
It's difficult to knit.

409
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:59,988
That place is not right. Here, lend it to me.

410
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:03,688
Oh, don't. I'm going to knit this by myself.

411
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:06,988
Sure? It's not my fault if it doesn't come out right, okay?

412
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:09,488
Oh, that's why, if I don't know how to knit it,

413
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,288
knit it beside me again and show me.

414
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:15,688
I've already knitted two sweaters for you.

415
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:17,788
I sure would like to ask the owner of the sweaters

416
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:19,888
some gift or something as a token of appreciation.

417
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:21,988
Oh, come on.

418
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:24,488
He's doing the best he can too.

419
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:26,788
Oh my, how envious.

420
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:28,988
Uh, over here it's like this.

421
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,388
Oh, and as for the sweaters that I've knitted,

422
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:33,388
will you please get rid of them because I don't need them?

423
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:34,888
Okay.

424
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:36,688
"A few days later" -Did you get it?

425
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:40,088
Yeah, Dr. Agasa sent it to me yesterday.

426
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:41,688
And, did you try it on?

427
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,788
Yeah, I'm wearing it now.

428
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:45,888
Thanks.

429
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:49,388
What's so funny?

430
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:50,888
Oh, no, it's nothing.

431
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:53,588
Hey, what's so darn funny?

432
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,188
I'm not telling you.

433
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:10,388
What was that?

434
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:11,288
Sonoko?

435
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:13,188
What's up, Sonoko?

436
00:24:22,988 --> 00:24:24,488
Next Conan,

437
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:28,509
"Dying Message Revives (Part 1)"

438
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,806
Next Conan's Hint:

439
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:33,506
"Sound of fireworks"

440
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,106
The next episode takes place at a skating rink.

441
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,206
Step aside! Go away!
