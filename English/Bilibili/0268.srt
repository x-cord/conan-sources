1
00:00:01.324 --> 00:00:02.924
What lies in one's heart is a mystery to us all.

2
00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:05.224
Star and snow glitter on the two.

3
00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:06.924
It has been three days since the murder case happened.

4
00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.824
What's the destiny of Ran and Sonoko?

5
00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:10.424
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:12.424
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:14.624
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59.837 --> 00:02:01.337
We all came to a lodge called Suito Mountain Lodge

9
00:02:01.337 --> 00:02:03.237
located in a remote mountain area

10
00:02:03.237 --> 00:02:07.037
together with Sonoko who invited us.

11
00:02:09.737 --> 00:02:12.737
However, one of the guests staying at the lodge,

12
00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:15.137
a journalist named Yoshitaka Nigaki

13
00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:17.637
fails to return to the lodge

14
00:02:17.637 --> 00:02:19.737
after going into the woods despite a violent blizzard.

15
00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:25.137
After a while of searching for Mr. Nigaki in the woods,

16
00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:28.137
we found him dead.

17
00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:34.837
Just as I thought.

18
00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:37.537
I've figured out the case.

19
00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:41.637
Now I know why there were black pictures

20
00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:45.237
taken before the blood-stained picture.

21
00:02:45.237 --> 00:02:47.337
Who took the chocolate out

22
00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:49.337
and why it was put near the corpse.

23
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:54.137
And who killed Mr. Nigaki.

24
00:02:54.937 --> 00:02:59.437
It's that person!

25
00:03:00.837 --> 00:03:06.637
"Bloody Valentine (Case Solved)"

26
00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:14.937
Now, all I need is the evidence.

27
00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:18.037
The evidence of the one who took the chocolate out of here.

28
00:03:18.037 --> 00:03:19.937
So long as I can get some evidence

29
00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:22.237
of the one who killed Mr. Nigaki...

30
00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:28.937
Sonoko's chocolate is the one in the foreground.

31
00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.837
The checkered one next to it is Mika's chocolate.

32
00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:33.637
Then, Ran's is...

33
00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:40.237
Ran.

34
00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:53.037
Hey, what are you doing?

35
00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:56.537
Huh?

36
00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.337
How come he's here?

37
00:04:05.637 --> 00:04:07.137
What?

38
00:04:07.137 --> 00:04:09.237
You found out who the killer is?

39
00:04:09.237 --> 00:04:11.037
Are you serious, sonny?

40
00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:12.837
So, who is it?

41
00:04:12.837 --> 00:04:16.437
Is it that man with the black knitted cap?

42
00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:18.837
Well, Pops says he'll explain all that

43
00:04:18.837 --> 00:04:21.237
in the kitchen to you from now.

44
00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:30.837
All right. We're here, Mr. Detective.

45
00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:33.437
Now that you know who the killer is...

46
00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:35.537
Does that mean that you've figured out

47
00:04:35.537 --> 00:04:37.437
the identity of the man wearing the black knitted cap?

48
00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:42.037
No, there is no need to check on the identity of that man.

49
00:04:42.037 --> 00:04:46.337
Because the one who killed Mr. Nigaki is right here.

50
00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:47.537
What?

51
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.037
Are you kidding me?

52
00:04:49.037 --> 00:04:51.937
I thought we already told you that it was impossible for us

53
00:04:51.937 --> 00:04:54.237
to put the chocolate near the corpse

54
00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:55.437
under the situation we were in!

55
00:04:55.437 --> 00:04:57.737
Right, the chocolate.

56
00:04:57.737 --> 00:05:01.537
The key to solving that mystery was not us,

57
00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:04.037
but him.

58
00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:15.437
Saburo?

59
00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:20.637
Then, you mean the one who is holding the case

60
00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:22.737
is Saburo?

61
00:05:22.737 --> 00:05:25.637
Yes. Thanks to him,

62
00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:27.637
I've figured out the mystery of

63
00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:30.537
why the chocolate was near Mr. Nigaki's corpse.

64
00:05:30.537 --> 00:05:32.737
Are you saying that the dog was the one

65
00:05:32.737 --> 00:05:34.837
who brought the chocolate out here?

66
00:05:34.837 --> 00:05:37.537
After you guys left the chocolate here

67
00:05:37.537 --> 00:05:39.637
and went to look for Nigaki,

68
00:05:39.637 --> 00:05:42.637
that dog was brought outside by the boy with glasses, right?

69
00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:44.137
If the boy who was together with the dog

70
00:05:44.137 --> 00:05:46.837
was the first to find the corpse,

71
00:05:46.837 --> 00:05:49.637
how did the dog get the chocolate?

72
00:05:49.637 --> 00:05:53.337
Yes, it's true that the dog was with Conan.

73
00:05:53.337 --> 00:05:55.837
This Saburo definitely was.

74
00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:58.037
This Saburo?

75
00:05:58.037 --> 00:05:59.237
Yes.

76
00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:02.437
I realized this when I saw Saburo liking round things

77
00:06:02.437 --> 00:06:05.837
to the point of playing with the daruma

78
00:06:05.837 --> 00:06:11.537
showed no interest at all in the video that we watched last night.

79
00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:14.437
When I heard that the previous owner used to take

80
00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:18.537
Saburo and go visit the grave everyday,

81
00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:20.737
and taking into consideration that

82
00:06:20.737 --> 00:06:24.737
only specific graves were not attacked by wild animals.

83
00:06:24.737 --> 00:06:28.537
This assumption was easy to come by.

84
00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:33.037
The previous owner probably made Saburo keep watch over

85
00:06:33.037 --> 00:06:36.637
his wife's grave all day.

86
00:06:38.837 --> 00:06:40.637
Just what are you talking about?

87
00:06:40.637 --> 00:06:43.537
How did the dog that was being put back in his cage every night

88
00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:46.637
watch the grave?

89
00:06:46.637 --> 00:06:49.237
It is impossible as you say.

90
00:06:49.237 --> 00:06:50.737
If there is only one dog.

91
00:06:50.737 --> 00:06:52.737
-What? -What?

92
00:06:52.737 --> 00:06:55.237
You know about it, granny, don't you?

93
00:06:55.237 --> 00:06:58.937
About the dog that your husband told you died 12 years ago.

94
00:06:58.937 --> 00:07:02.337
Saburo and the existence of Jiro who had two nails.

95
00:07:03.937 --> 00:07:06.637
Well, I should've realized it

96
00:07:06.637 --> 00:07:10.237
when I saw the dent on the chocolate and the melted part of it.

97
00:07:10.237 --> 00:07:12.137
The fact that there were two Saburos,

98
00:07:12.137 --> 00:07:14.437
and that the marks on the chocolate

99
00:07:14.437 --> 00:07:17.137
was made by a dog holding it in its mouth.

100
00:07:17.137 --> 00:07:19.137
What?

101
00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:22.037
To put it accurately, one of them is Jiro.

102
00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:25.337
Each time they went to the grave,

103
00:07:25.337 --> 00:07:28.837
they watched over it alternately.

104
00:07:28.837 --> 00:07:31.437
The previous owner probably lied saying that Jiro had died

105
00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:34.437
out of his consideration for granny.

106
00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:35.937
I see.

107
00:07:35.937 --> 00:07:38.337
If that's how he was trained.

108
00:07:38.337 --> 00:07:40.137
Then he would eat only every other day.

109
00:07:40.137 --> 00:07:44.537
That's why he didn't eat when he couldn't go out on stormy days

110
00:07:44.537 --> 00:07:47.037
and change places.

111
00:07:47.037 --> 00:07:51.037
Then, the wolf that Mr. Nigaki said he saw in the woods was...

112
00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:54.737
Probably either Jiro or Saburo.

113
00:07:54.737 --> 00:07:58.337
They were also delivering chocolate to the victims of accidents.

114
00:07:58.337 --> 00:07:59.737
That's ridiculous!

115
00:07:59.737 --> 00:08:02.837
Why would a mere dog carry off chocolate?

116
00:08:02.837 --> 00:08:05.037
They are not "mere dogs".

117
00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:08.037
They are life saver rescue dogs,

118
00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:10.437
efficient enough to win awards for saving lives!

119
00:08:11.337 --> 00:08:14.237
It can all be explained if they were trained to give chocolate

120
00:08:14.237 --> 00:08:19.337
that is highly nutritious to accident victims.

121
00:08:19.337 --> 00:08:20.737
And that the actions of the dogs doing so

122
00:08:20.737 --> 00:08:22.637
was limited to this time of year

123
00:08:22.637 --> 00:08:28.037
when a large amount of chocolate was stocked.

124
00:08:28.037 --> 00:08:32.237
The blood on Mr. Nigaki's face was wiped off part way

125
00:08:32.237 --> 00:08:33.337
because the dog thought he was a victim of an accident

126
00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:37.037
and tried to lick him to wake him up.

127
00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:38.537
Hey, wait!

128
00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:40.537
If the dog was the one who took the chocolate,

129
00:08:40.537 --> 00:08:42.737
then anybody could've committed the crime.

130
00:08:42.737 --> 00:08:44.237
Just what are you talking about?

131
00:08:44.237 --> 00:08:45.637
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

132
00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:50.937
The blood stained picture I showed you during the day!

133
00:08:52.937 --> 00:08:54.137
In other words,

134
00:08:54.137 --> 00:08:55.337
the killer is one of you two who have no alibi

135
00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:56.937
during the day to back you up.

136
00:08:56.937 --> 00:09:00.037
Don't you think there's something odd about that picture?

137
00:09:00.037 --> 00:09:01.037
Huh?

138
00:09:01.037 --> 00:09:04.037
That picture was the last one in the film

139
00:09:04.037 --> 00:09:06.537
and it was wound after that.

140
00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:10.537
The killer would've most naturally heard

141
00:09:10.537 --> 00:09:13.737
the sound of the buzzing sound of the film being wound.

142
00:09:13.737 --> 00:09:18.037
But the killer did not take that film away.

143
00:09:18.037 --> 00:09:22.037
Despite the fact that the killer might be in the picture.

144
00:09:23.137 --> 00:09:24.437
True.

145
00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:27.037
But, why?

146
00:09:27.037 --> 00:09:31.837
That's because that picture was not taken at the time of the crime.

147
00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:37.237
It was a picture that Mr Nigaki had casually taken during the day.

148
00:09:37.237 --> 00:09:40.337
Unaware at that time that his blood stains

149
00:09:40.337 --> 00:09:43.037
were already on the lens from the night before.

150
00:09:43.037 --> 00:09:47.537
Last night? You mean the night he cut his finger with the knife?

151
00:09:47.537 --> 00:09:50.837
Yes. The blood that stained only the stomach part of the parker

152
00:09:50.837 --> 00:09:53.937
he was wearing back then is the evidence.

153
00:09:53.937 --> 00:09:55.837
It's most likely that the blood stained

154
00:09:55.837 --> 00:09:59.037
the camera lens that was hanging from his neck.

155
00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:01.237
Yes.

156
00:10:01.237 --> 00:10:04.037
The killer made Mr. Nigaki take pictures with the camera

157
00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:07.137
with blood stains on its lens during the day,

158
00:10:07.137 --> 00:10:10.037
and promised to meet him that evening.

159
00:10:10.037 --> 00:10:13.937
Hit and killed him then put his sunglasses back on him.

160
00:10:13.937 --> 00:10:15.737
This way, the killer made it look like Mr. Nigaki

161
00:10:15.737 --> 00:10:18.137
was killed during the day.

162
00:10:18.137 --> 00:10:20.137
In other words,

163
00:10:20.137 --> 00:10:23.137
no one else other than you can be the killer.

164
00:10:32.486 --> 00:10:33.586
In other words,

165
00:10:33.586 --> 00:10:36.486
no one else other than you can be the killer,

166
00:10:36.486 --> 00:10:37.986
Ms. Ako Amari.

167
00:10:37.986 --> 00:10:39.086
Huh?

168
00:10:40.586 --> 00:10:42.186
It can't be.

169
00:10:46.186 --> 00:10:49.186
How can Ako be the killer?

170
00:10:49.186 --> 00:10:50.386
It can't be!

171
00:10:50.386 --> 00:10:54.186
Because we went to look for him after the blizzard started,

172
00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.186
and the sun was still high!

173
00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:59.186
That's why you went to get him earlier.

174
00:10:59.186 --> 00:11:01.486
Because if the blizzard got worse

175
00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:02.986
and he decided to return to the lodge

176
00:11:02.986 --> 00:11:04.686
before the time he promised to meet her,

177
00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:07.386
everything would be in vain.

178
00:11:07.386 --> 00:11:08.586
By the way,

179
00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:11.386
the reason why there were two black pictures

180
00:11:11.386 --> 00:11:14.186
before the picture with the blood stain on it

181
00:11:14.186 --> 00:11:16.686
was to leave room for just one mere picture.

182
00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:18.786
If space for three more pictures are left,

183
00:11:18.786 --> 00:11:21.186
then the other two pictures would also have blood stains on them,

184
00:11:21.186 --> 00:11:25.186
and the pictures would turn out strange.

185
00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:28.886
She probably switched all the other films and video tapes

186
00:11:28.886 --> 00:11:32.686
to unused ones for the same reason.

187
00:11:32.686 --> 00:11:35.786
But I could've used the same trick too if I wanted to.

188
00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:39.186
No, only Ms. Ako could've done it.

189
00:11:39.186 --> 00:11:42.686
In order to keep the blood stained film inside the camera

190
00:11:42.686 --> 00:11:44.586
after the crime was committed,

191
00:11:44.586 --> 00:11:46.786
the trick wouldn't work unless all the films

192
00:11:46.786 --> 00:11:51.186
that he had in his backpack are completely were moved beforehand.

193
00:11:51.186 --> 00:11:53.586
If there are other used films in his knapsack

194
00:11:53.586 --> 00:11:55.886
after the crime is committed,

195
00:11:55.886 --> 00:11:57.286
it would be impossible to tell

196
00:11:57.286 --> 00:11:59.086
which film is the one with the blood stain.

197
00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:01.586
That's right.

198
00:12:01.586 --> 00:12:05.686
Since you were with him taking care of his wound,

199
00:12:05.686 --> 00:12:10.086
you're the only one who could've removed the films

200
00:12:10.086 --> 00:12:13.286
without being suspected at all.

201
00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:15.386
Would you like to take a look at them?

202
00:12:15.386 --> 00:12:17.486
The tapes that you collected and disposed of

203
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:19.186
after committing the crime?

204
00:12:19.186 --> 00:12:20.986
Huh?

205
00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:24.386
A picture of you that Mr. Nigaki took

206
00:12:24.386 --> 00:12:26.586
when you went to meet him in the blizzard.

207
00:12:26.586 --> 00:12:29.986
He delivered it to us.

208
00:12:29.986 --> 00:12:33.386
He probably thought that you had forgotten it

209
00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:36.886
and brought the bag with lots of video tapes in it back here.

210
00:12:36.886 --> 00:12:40.586
I haven't confirmed the contents of the tapes yet,

211
00:12:40.586 --> 00:12:43.886
but tapes from four years ago are among them, too.

212
00:12:43.886 --> 00:12:45.586
That is most likely...

213
00:12:46.986 --> 00:12:48.786
That's right.

214
00:12:48.786 --> 00:12:52.086
It's the scene of the previous owner

215
00:12:52.086 --> 00:12:55.286
trying to help my older brother who was hurt and couldn't move

216
00:12:55.286 --> 00:12:57.186
get buried under an avalanche.

217
00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:01.086
It's a cruel tape

218
00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:04.886
that was being filmed from the woods in the distance.

219
00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:10.186
Don't tell me that Mr. Nigaki kept rolling the film

220
00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:12.186
without going to help at all?

221
00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:13.386
Yes.

222
00:13:13.386 --> 00:13:17.886
Because my brother was against me going steady with him.

223
00:13:17.886 --> 00:13:21.786
I found that tape when I was looking for clothes for him

224
00:13:21.786 --> 00:13:24.586
to change in after Yoshitaka got hurt.

225
00:13:25.886 --> 00:13:28.186
After seeing the date of four years ago,

226
00:13:28.186 --> 00:13:32.286
I figured that this was the present he was going to give me

227
00:13:32.286 --> 00:13:34.086
and watched it in secret.

228
00:13:35.886 --> 00:13:39.086
That's why you were crying.

229
00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:47.086
I didn't think that Saburo was going to take my chocolate to him.

230
00:13:47.086 --> 00:13:51.186
Maybe Saburo already knew what I was going to do.

231
00:13:51.186 --> 00:13:53.986
He probably knew that I was the killer, too.

232
00:13:53.986 --> 00:13:56.986
As well as the fact that I really did love Yoshitaka.

233
00:13:58.086 --> 00:14:00.786
What a stupid thing to do.

234
00:14:00.786 --> 00:14:05.086
You don't even know if Mr. Nigaki really filmed it either.

235
00:14:05.086 --> 00:14:06.786
I know he did.

236
00:14:06.786 --> 00:14:09.986
There was some loud sound before the avalanche came,

237
00:14:09.986 --> 00:14:12.786
and his voice was in the tape too.

238
00:14:12.786 --> 00:14:16.386
He said, "Sorry, Natsuya. I'll be taking your little sister."

239
00:14:16.386 --> 00:14:18.586
Some loud sound?

240
00:14:18.586 --> 00:14:20.386
Hey, wait a second. That's...

241
00:14:24.286 --> 00:14:27.986
It's this sound that you heard on the tape, isn't it?

242
00:14:31.486 --> 00:14:32.686
Right.

243
00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:36.686
We're the ones who caused that avalanche.

244
00:14:36.686 --> 00:14:40.586
We mistook her older brother for a wolf and shot him.

245
00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:42.986
We were called out here

246
00:14:42.986 --> 00:14:44.986
by Nigaki as he wanted to blackmail us.

247
00:14:44.986 --> 00:14:46.186
He told us that

248
00:14:46.186 --> 00:14:47.986
if the whereabouts of the corpse was found through the video

249
00:14:47.986 --> 00:14:50.786
and a bullet is found in his body,

250
00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:52.886
we would be finished.

251
00:14:52.886 --> 00:14:56.286
Thanks for getting rid of him for us.

252
00:14:56.286 --> 00:14:57.686
Either way,

253
00:14:57.686 --> 00:14:59.986
we were going to cause an avalanche

254
00:14:59.986 --> 00:15:03.986
to stall him and kill him slow and easy.

255
00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.786
All of you, line up beside the detective!

256
00:15:06.786 --> 00:15:08.186
Hurry up!

257
00:15:08.186 --> 00:15:09.286
What do I do now?

258
00:15:09.286 --> 00:15:11.086
I've already used the anesthesia gun

259
00:15:11.086 --> 00:15:13.086
and I don't have my super kick shoes either.

260
00:15:14.086 --> 00:15:17.686
So, how shall we cook you guys?

261
00:15:19.486 --> 00:15:22.586
Somebody... somebody, please help us.

262
00:15:22.586 --> 00:15:27.386
Otherwise, I won't be able to give him this chocolate.

263
00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:29.686
Okay, the girl with the brown hair!

264
00:15:29.686 --> 00:15:32.586
Stab your friend with the knife that's behind you!

265
00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.686
What?

266
00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:36.986
Come on, quit stalling!

267
00:15:41.486 --> 00:15:42.486
Who is it?

268
00:15:42.486 --> 00:15:43.686
Hey, go take a look!

269
00:15:43.686 --> 00:15:45.386
Okay.

270
00:15:54.386 --> 00:15:56.386
Hey, is anybody there?

271
00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:04.486
Who are you?

272
00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:06.486
Stop!

273
00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:10.486
Don't move!

274
00:16:13.186 --> 00:16:15.786
Hey, I'm telling you, don't move!

275
00:16:17.086 --> 00:16:18.886
Don't move.

276
00:16:18.886 --> 00:16:21.286
Don't worry.

277
00:16:21.286 --> 00:16:22.586
If I concentrate on the direction of the gun barrel

278
00:16:22.586 --> 00:16:25.086
and his finger on the trigger,

279
00:16:25.086 --> 00:16:26.886
I can dodge the bullet.

280
00:16:28.786 --> 00:16:31.586
Darn you! Don't take me lightly!

281
00:16:31.586 --> 00:16:33.286
I'm not taking you lightly.

282
00:16:33.286 --> 00:16:34.886
I was just stating fact.

283
00:16:34.886 --> 00:16:36.386
Darn it!

284
00:16:36.386 --> 00:16:39.986
If you think you can dodge my bullet, go ahead and try!

285
00:16:51.986 --> 00:16:53.286
See?

286
00:16:53.286 --> 00:16:54.886
Makoto.

287
00:16:54.886 --> 00:16:56.286
You rat!

288
00:16:57.486 --> 00:16:58.786
Over here!

289
00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:00.986
Over here!

290
00:17:19.986 --> 00:17:23.086
That must've hurt.

291
00:17:23.086 --> 00:17:26.486
Makoto, what brings you heme?

292
00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:30.386
I came to check out the man you car for.

293
00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:34.386
To see if he is really good for you.

294
00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:35.686
Huh?

295
00:17:35.686 --> 00:17:37.486
Please don't play dumb with me!

296
00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:38.586
The one that you made the hand knitted sweater for,

297
00:17:38.586 --> 00:17:40.886
the one you bought the tea cup for,

298
00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:44.686
and the guy's whose going to receive the chocolate you made.

299
00:17:44.686 --> 00:17:48.286
Where is that lucky guy?

300
00:17:57.986 --> 00:18:00.086
It's you.

301
00:18:00.086 --> 00:18:01.186
Huh?

302
00:18:02.186 --> 00:18:03.486
See.

303
00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:10.386
By the way, although Sonoko quit knitting the sweater half finished,

304
00:18:10.386 --> 00:18:13.386
she did send you the tea cup.

305
00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:18.086
Oh, I thought that was a flower vase.

306
00:18:19.686 --> 00:18:21.886
Is everything clear now?

307
00:18:21.886 --> 00:18:23.486
Oh, yes.

308
00:18:27.486 --> 00:18:29.586
I guess I'll be on my way, then.

309
00:18:29.586 --> 00:18:31.086
Hey, wait a minute!

310
00:18:31.086 --> 00:18:32.386
You've come all the way out here,

311
00:18:32.386 --> 00:18:34.086
so please take this with you too!

312
00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:36.186
Here.

313
00:18:36.186 --> 00:18:37.886
Thank you so much.

314
00:18:40.386 --> 00:18:42.086
Amazing.

315
00:18:42.086 --> 00:18:44.786
Her love strategy is really working out well.

316
00:18:44.786 --> 00:18:47.186
By the way, Sonoko,

317
00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:50.386
I wonder about that animal pattern outfit that you're wearing.

318
00:18:50.386 --> 00:18:52.086
Really?

319
00:18:52.086 --> 00:18:54.586
I'm happy for you, Sonoko.

320
00:19:02.386 --> 00:19:05.686
The police arrived after day break.

321
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:07.686
The horror of the snowy mountain passed over

322
00:19:07.686 --> 00:19:11.086
together with the blizzard.

323
00:19:11.086 --> 00:19:13.886
Then, February 14th finally comes.

324
00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:17.786
Hey, why didn't you write anything on your chocolate?

325
00:19:17.786 --> 00:19:20.686
I was going to write something later secretly.

326
00:19:21.986 --> 00:19:26.186
I'm going to the airport to see Makoto off then, okay?

327
00:19:26.186 --> 00:19:27.786
Good luck!

328
00:19:27.786 --> 00:19:29.286
Bye!

329
00:19:31.686 --> 00:19:33.586
Sonoko.

330
00:19:33.586 --> 00:19:36.486
I can't write anything on it.

331
00:19:36.486 --> 00:19:40.586
Your feelings don't reach the one you want to give the chocolate

332
00:19:40.586 --> 00:19:42.686
if you give it after Valentine's Day.

333
00:19:44.086 --> 00:19:47.286
I can't make myself write the name of someone

334
00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:49.586
who don't even know the whereabouts of.

335
00:19:49.586 --> 00:19:51.086
I'm home.

336
00:19:56.586 --> 00:19:59.886
Maybe I should give this chocolate to dad.

337
00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:14.386
Ran, you sure are strong.

338
00:20:17.686 --> 00:20:21.486
I really wish I were all that strong.

339
00:20:25.486 --> 00:20:28.186
Don't cry, you fool.

340
00:20:28.186 --> 00:20:29.586
Don't cry.

341
00:22:24.786 --> 00:22:28.386
Huh? I wonder who put the coat over me.

342
00:22:28.386 --> 00:22:30.086
Oh, it's snowing!

343
00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:35.586
Oh, no! It's this time of night already!

344
00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:38.586
I better hurry and get dinner ready.

345
00:22:38.586 --> 00:22:40.386
I got a mail.

346
00:22:40.386 --> 00:22:41.986
There's an image attached to it?

347
00:22:45.686 --> 00:22:47.186
Huh?

348
00:22:47.186 --> 00:22:48.886
Hey, what's this?

349
00:22:48.886 --> 00:22:51.086
Isn't that me?

350
00:22:51.086 --> 00:22:54.286
"I got a shot of you sleeping, Detective Kid".

351
00:22:57.586 --> 00:22:58.886
Oh, yes!

352
00:22:58.886 --> 00:23:01.986
Good evening, this is Detective Kid.

353
00:23:02.986 --> 00:23:05.886
Shinichi?

354
00:23:05.886 --> 00:23:07.886
Shinichi, you're here?

355
00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:10.386
Yes, until just a while ago.

356
00:23:10.386 --> 00:23:12.286
If you had time to do a stupid thing like this,

357
00:23:12.286 --> 00:23:14.686
you should've woke me up!

358
00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:18.786
I'm sorry. But you were fast asleep while drooling, so...

359
00:23:18.786 --> 00:23:19.986
Drooling?

360
00:23:19.986 --> 00:23:22.686
Oh, right. While I was waiting for you to get up,

361
00:23:22.686 --> 00:23:24.486
I got hungry.

362
00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:27.386
So I ate the chocolate that was on the desk.

363
00:23:27.386 --> 00:23:28.686
What?

364
00:23:28.686 --> 00:23:30.686
Well, talk about rare,

365
00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:32.386
I mean a peach shaped chocolate.

366
00:23:32.386 --> 00:23:33.786
Peach shaped?

367
00:23:33.786 --> 00:23:38.286
Well, it didn't taste like peach, but it sure was good.

368
00:23:38.286 --> 00:23:39.486
Really?

369
00:23:39.486 --> 00:23:43.486
Yes, it was the best I've eaten so far.

370
00:23:43.486 --> 00:23:46.086
Where'd you buy that chocolate?

371
00:23:46.086 --> 00:23:49.686
No! I can't tell you.

372
00:23:49.686 --> 00:23:53.986
It's a great store that only I know of.

373
00:23:57.386 --> 00:23:58.486
But, Shinichi,

374
00:23:58.486 --> 00:24:00.886
calling yourself "Detective Kid" is kind of dorky.

375
00:24:00.886 --> 00:24:02.986
Yes, I thought so.

376
00:24:05.486 --> 00:24:07.386
"Next Episode"

377
00:24:07.386 --> 00:24:09.686
Just a minute!

378
00:24:09.686 --> 00:24:13.286
See, I've got a customer.

379
00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:16.686
I wonder what kind of case today is?

380
00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:17.786
Are you kidding?

381
00:24:17.786 --> 00:24:20.586
If you've lost something in the house go find it yourself!

382
00:24:20.586 --> 00:24:23.286
I'm the renown detective Kogoro Mouri!

383
00:24:23.286 --> 00:24:25.686
I can't be bothered with trivial stuff like that!

384
00:24:25.686 --> 00:24:29.086
We'll help you find your lost watch.

385
00:24:29.986 --> 00:24:31.286
Next Conan,

386
00:24:31.286 --> 00:24:35.307
"Forgotten Keepsake of a Crime (Part 1)"

387
00:24:35.704 --> 00:24:37.904
Next Conan's Hint:

388
00:24:37.904 --> 00:24:40.204
"Wristwatch"
