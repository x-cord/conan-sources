1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,480
On the way home from reporting on a case,
the old man met a man suffering from memory loss.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,020
His name was Esaka Ritsuo.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,440
His name was Esaka Ritsuo.

but when he fell down the stairs at a train
station, he forgot the life he lived as Koneru Taro.

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:16,530
but when he fell down the stairs at a train
station, he forgot the life he lived as Koneru Taro.

10
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,910
but when he fell down the stairs at a train
station, he forgot the life he lived as Koneru Taro.

Kinbara Tae (70)
Takuzo's Wife

15
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,090
but when he fell down the stairs at a train
station, he forgot the life he lived as Koneru Taro.

16
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,040
Instead, he remembered bits of his
memories as Esaka Ritsuo, but...

17
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,460
Instead, he remembered bits of his
memories as Esaka Ritsuo, but...
Missing Man Found Dead
Body Found in Wakabadai
Mountains Identified
Kisugi Akira-san (38) Found Dead

18
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,360
Instead, he remembered bits of his
memories as Esaka Ritsuo, but...

19
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,130
Esaka-san?

20
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,030
Judging by the circumstances,
it was almost certainly a suicide.

21
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,010
Suicide?

22
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,700
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,320
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

24
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,160
When the door to his lost memories opens,
what truth will he see beyond it?

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,620
Always determining the one truth

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,330
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

27
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,930
his name is Detective Conan!

The Blank Year

29
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,580

The Blank Year
(Part Two)

31
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,640
You're sure it was a suicide?

32
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,910
Yeah.

33
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,180
Takagi-kun.

34
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,220
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,190
This apartment, in which he drank
the poisoned coffee, was locked.

36
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,740
Both of the keys he received from the
landlord were inside the room. And...

37
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,620
What we believe is a suicide
note was left on that computer.

38
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,500
What we believe is a suicide
note was left on that computer.
Though it's been six months, I can't escape my guilt.
The only apology I can offer is death.

39
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,950
Though it's been six months, I can't escape my guilt.
The only apology I can offer is death.

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,810
Did he recall a mistake he made in the
past when his lost memories returned?

41
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,890
Ideally we'll learn something from
this, which was left on the table.

42
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,970
The new phone he just bought
to replace his lost phone?

43
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,720
Its history showed two calls made yesterday.

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,950
The first call was made to the Hida
Industries construction company.

45
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,980
That's the company he
worked at this past year.

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,480
That must Hida-san's company.

47
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,360
The other call was made to a
weather information service.

48
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,690
What? A weather information service?

49
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,330
Apparently he called to ask a question.

50
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,370
He wanted to know if six
months ago around June 10th

51
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,660
if any lightning strikes were reported
outside the city in Wakabadai.

52
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,100
The person answering the phone responded
that there were on the evening of the 10th.

53
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,620
He called Hida Industries to
confirm what site he worked

54
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,110
at six months ago on June 10th.

55
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,640
The manager Hida examined the records
and responded that he was at Wakabadai.

56
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,070
Both answers point to Wakabadai on June 10th.

57
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,400
Huh?

58
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,320
Isn't this...?

59
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,650
Missing Man Found Dead
Body Found in Wakabadai
Mountains Identified
Kisugi Akira-san (38) Found Dead

60
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,820
Missing Man Found Dead
Body Found in Wakabadai
Mountains Identified
Kisugi Akira-san (38) Found Dead
It's the day this incident occurred.

61
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,330
On that day, Esaka-kun went to
Wakabadai, where the crime took place.

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,460
If he's guilty of something that happened six
months ago, in the case of Kisugi Akira's murder...

63
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,460
He's...

64
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,880
The culprit?

65
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,880
In other words, on that day Esaka Ritsuo...

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,680
He was working in Wakabadai,
and for some reason,

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,240
he murdered Kisugi Akira and buried
the body in the nearby mountains.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,140
He'd forgotten that he'd done that.

69
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,650
But the thunder made him remember.

70
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,030
Also, he mentioned something.

71
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,270
I felt like I remembered a scene
of particular interest to me.

72
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,540
I wonder what it was. Thunder... dogs...

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,380
We still don't know the
significance of the dog, though.

74
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,610
He remembered something, but still
had doubts, so he called to ask.

75
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,550
And then, feeling remorseful
about killing a person...

76
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,480
That explanation does fit, but...

77
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,410
You said the room was locked.

78
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,230
Was the door chain on the
front door locked, too?

79
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,310
No, the chain wasn't locked,

80
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,990
but both keys were here.

81
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,370
One in the back of the desk drawer,
and one in that jacket pocket.

82
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,790
Hey, listen...

83
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,660
Shall I tell the Kisugi murder
investigation HQ about Esaka?

84
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,690
It's still only a possibility.

85
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,050
Kisugi Akira was a con artist. It's
possible he was one of his victims.

86
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,220
Let's review the information we have.

87
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,560
Hey, listen.

88
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,190
Remember the scene of interest
Esaka-san mentioned?

89
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,750
Maybe Esaka-san saw something
at Wakabadai that day,

90
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,820
like Kisugi Akira and the culprit fighting.

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,060
Huh?

92
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,510
That would also explain
the attempt on his life.

93
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,370
That was justâ€”

94
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,870
Remember what Hida-san and the others said?

95
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,120
You're probably imagining that
someone tried to kill you.

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,630
I can only assume that's the case.

97
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,210
But what if it were true

98
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,760
and the culprit was trying to silence
Esaka-san, the inconvenient witness?

99
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,050
What?

100
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,930
Their attempts hadn't worked until
now, but they succeeded yesterday.

101
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,570
After all, there was someone here when
Esaka-san drank the poisoned coffee.

102
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,440
What?

103
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,200
Only one of the cups is placed
differently on the shelf.

104
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,990
Y-You're right.

105
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,870
Which means...

106
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,120
The culprit probably put it there.

107
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,090
Esaka-san didn't kill himself.

108
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:35,550
He was murdered for his silence
and framed as the culprit.

109
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,840
Then the culprit fled.

110
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
They must've used some kind of
trick to lock the room, or else...

111
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,820
If Esaka-san let them into his home,
then maybe he knew the culprit.

112
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,430
But we need clues.

113
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,760
If Esaka-kun saw the culprit six months ago,

114
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,210
then there might be someone who saw that.

115
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,400
I'd like to ask you about
this man in the middle.

116
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,860
He came to the construction site
down the road six months ago.

117
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,110
Oh, I remember him.

118
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,090
Did you see something?

119
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,350
He was frantically fleeing from a dog.

120
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,720
A dog?

121
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,140
He came screaming and running and
jumped right up on that utility pole.

122
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm sorry!

123
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,660
Huh?

124
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,710
Dogs and thunder...

125
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,050
It happened then, right here.

126
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,000
He saw something off in
that direction, right?

127
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,380
I didn't see anything.

128
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,100
They passed by on that side street then.

129
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,200
They either came from this direction where
Kisugi Akira's residence is located,

130
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,410
or this direction from the temple.

131
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,620
In any case, Kisugi Akira and the culprit
must've passed through here while fighting.

132
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,090
And because Esaka-kun witnessed that...

133
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,620
Exactly who is the culprit?

134
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,310
Since the body they buried was discovered,

135
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,420
the culprit attempted to
silence Esaka-san in a hurry.

136
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,630
But why didn't they do it right away?

137
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,760
Come to think of it, he was nearly killed
three days after the body was discovered.

138
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,220
That's it. They couldn't kill him
because they didn't know where he was.

139
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,570
But because Esaka-san visited them three
days later, they made an attempt on his life.

140
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,010
Which means the culprit lives in Koneru.

141
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,080
That would explain it.

142
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,580
You knew that from that start, didn't you?

143
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,260
Metropolitan Police Department
Wakabadai Station

144
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,370
Metropolitan Police Department
Wakabadai Station
Residents of Koneru?

145
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,630
Yes, among the list of suspects.
Abandoned Murdered Body Case
Special Investigation HQ

146
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,570
There must be residents
of Koneru who were conned

147
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,130
by Kisugi Akira and had a grudge against him.

148
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,540
No, not a single one.

149
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,390
No?

150
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,330
But why?

151
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,980
There must be someone.

152
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,730
If they haven't found anyone, then
we'll just have to do it ourselves.

153
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,230
There's not much point in searching randomly.

154
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,240
You're not wrong.

155
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,370
Maybe the neighborhood
steward knows something.

156
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,370
You mean Kinbara-san.

157
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,110
I'm excited to watch it grow.

158
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,580
In a few years, we'll be able to view
flowers from within our own home.

159
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,220
A flower viewing in this yard...

160
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,930
I'm sure that'll be beautiful.

161
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,950
You'll be better by then, too.

162
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,360
Mori-san?

163
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,980
Kinbara Takuzo & Tae

164
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,360
Taro-kun is dead?

165
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,990
I'm sure she'll find out sooner or later, but
I didn't want your frail wife to hear about it.

166
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,370
It's possible he was killed for his silence.

167
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,170
But why?

168
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,420
A man was murdered in the
mountains of Wakabadai.

169
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:45,210
There should be victims of Kisugi Akira
here in Koneru who were conned by him.

170
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,850
Have you heard anything?

171
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,110
I haven't heard anything like that.

172
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,690
They killed Taro-kun?

173
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,300
Anyway, could we ask the
others about it, too?

174
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,220
What?

175
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,820
Taro-kun was killed?

176
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,700
Yes. I wanted to ask if there's
anything you can recall about him.

177
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,810
Recall about him?

178
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:14,620
Not off the top of my head.

179
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,080
I can't think of anything.

180
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,790
But if it's for Taro-san,
we'll do what we can to help.

181
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,800
Whoa, whoa.

182
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,080
We're not police or private investigators.

183
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,240
Yeah, but...

184
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,230
I know. Mori-san can teach us.

185
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,250
Please.

186
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,200
All right. Let's do what we can for Taro-kun.

187
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,920
I'd feel bad for Taro-san
if we left things like this.

188
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,110
We'll do our best.

189
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,660
Guys...

190
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,120
We'll begin by searching anywhere
you find even a little suspicious.

191
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,620
We'll find some trace of the
culprit who killed Esaka-san.

192
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,790
A bicycle parking lot?

193
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,690
The day before yesterday?

194
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,340
It was around 1PM.

195
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,820
Did you see anyone running
away from that traffic light?

196
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,330
There's no point in asking me.

197
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,230
I was out sick with a cold.

198
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,320
So you weren't here the day before yesterday.

199
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,450
I think Umino-san or
Kinbara-san was here instead.

200
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,460
Oh, right. Kinbara-san is
a bicycle attendant, too.

201
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,330
It must've been Umino-san or Kinbara-san.

202
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,710
Let's see. On that day...

203
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,160
Actually, I wanted to ask
you about something else.

204
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:55,850
Is there anyone named Doigaki-san
among Kisugi Akira's con victims?

205
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,480
Yakitori Izakaya

206
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,360
There should be one at a hardware store.

207
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,620
They do have one.

208
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,270
No clues, huh?

209
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,250
Probably because we're regular people.

210
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,900
Being a detective is hard work.

211
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,630
Hey, Hida-san.

212
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,190
What is it?

213
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,050
Yeah, I talked to him. What about it?

214
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,930
I don't know, but Kogoro-no-ojisan
wanted me to check with you.

215
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,180
Why can't we find anything?

216
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,190
Mister, apparently you were right.

217
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,450
About what?

218
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,770
By the way, did you all find anything?

219
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,680
Find-diddly-ind anything?

220
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,490
Is this...

221
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,830
The rumored...

222
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,740
Sleeping Kogoro?

223
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,130
First, I must apologize to all of you.

224
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,130
We never would've found the culprit
following the course I set you on

225
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:09,130
because it wasn't the culprit themselves who
was a victim of Kisugi Akira's con artistry.

226
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,360
What?

227
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,490
By the way, on June 10th, when
Kisugi Akira was murdered,

228
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,660
one of you was at Wakabadai
where the crime took place

229
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,630
in order to attend the second anniversary
ceremony of Doigaki Katsuhiro-san's death.

230
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,940
Doigaki?

231
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,950
Who's that?

232
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,450
He's your wife's younger brother,
isn't he, Kinbara Takuzo-san?

233
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,420
A bicycle parking lot employee remembered.

234
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,260
Let's see. On that day...

235
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,910
Kinbara-san took June 10th off, right?

236
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,400
I remember now.

237
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,430
Kinbara-san said a memorial
service for his wife's brother

238
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,830
was being held at a temple in Wakabadai.

239
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:03,560
He worried himself to death after an evil
man tricked him out of all of his savings.

240
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,940
It was a total coincidence that
your wife's family temple

241
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,430
was located in Wakabadai
where Kisugi Akira lived.

242
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,450
That's where you ran into him.

243
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,080
Kisugi Akira (38)
Serial Con Artist

244
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,280
I forgot something.

245
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,040
Wait for me at the temple tea house.

246
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,060
Okay.

247
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,970
You demanded that he apologize,
and you were seen by...

248
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,970
Huh?

249
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,680
Taro-kun?

250
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,550
As long as the body wasn't discovered,

251
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,170
you didn't need to worry that
Esaka-kun saw you fighting.

252
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,580
When Esaka-kun vanished suddenly
from Koneru six months later,

253
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,380
I'm sure you were secretly relieved.

254
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,890
But the body you buried was
discovered, and three days later,

255
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:27,470
you saw Esaka-kun, who you thought had
disappeared from the neighborhood.

256
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,290
Believing he'd come to ask you
about Kisugi Akira's death...

257
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,710
What happened?

258
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:47,230
While I was waiting for the light to
change, someone suddenly pushed my back.

259
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,990
I was nearly hit by a car.

260
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,130
You planned to silence him.

261
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,630
Your amnesia's been cured, and instead...

262
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,890
You lost your memories of the past year.

263
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,400
And though you learned Esaka-kun had
lost his memories of the past year...

264
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,770
I felt like I remembered a scene
of particular interest to me.

265
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,650
I wonder what it was. Thunder... dogs...

266
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,280
You realized he was dangerous.

267
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,660
When you heard from Hida-san that
he was asking weird questions,

268
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,730
you believed Esaka-kun was remembering
what happened and panicked.

269
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,790
I did tell him about the phone call, but...

270
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,900
That's when you came up with the idea of
framing him for Kisugi Akira's murder.

271
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,550
Last night you visited Esaka-kun.

272
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,440
You poisoned him and made
it look like a suicide,

273
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,230
and used a spare key to lock his apartment.

274
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,150
That key convinced me that you did it.

275
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,660
I believed that if you had a
spare key, you must've made it.

276
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,230
I'm going to pop home for a minute.

277
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,540
I'm worried if she's remembered
to take her medicine.

278
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,750
When I checked with the nearby hardware
store, you had indeed made a spare key then.

279
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,840
When I checked with the nearby hardware
store, you had indeed made a spare key then.
Minor Repairs & Spare Keys

280
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:26,740
Apparently a single hair was
stuck to Kisugi Akira's body.

281
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,010
It wasn't his.

282
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,730
The culprit's hair must've gotten stuck to the
body when they fought just prior to his murder.

283
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,990
I'm sure a comparison would
make it clear whose it is.

284
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:52,240
Today, when you said it was possible that
Taro-kun had been killed for his silence,

285
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,750
I knew it was over.

286
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,630
Everything you've said is correct, Mori-san.

287
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,250
Have you remembered that
scene that was bothering you?

288
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,260
A dog barked at me, and
then lightning struck.

289
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,890
I feel like I saw this man then, too.

293
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,400
Oh, sorry.

294
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,410
This man was fighting with someone.

295
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:26,660
Someone I know well.

296
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
So you do remember.

297
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,680
I doubt you'd be willing to let this slide,
but there's something I want to tell you.

298
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,430
Tell me what?

299
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,180
By the way...

300
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,700
I'm sorry for what I did to Taro-kun.

301
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,830
Then, why did you do it?

302
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,340
I was afraid of being arrested.

303
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,430
Not of being arrested and punished.

304
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,520
I was afraid of...

305
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,980
Leaving your frail wife alone.

306
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,330
I'll look after your wife until you're back.

307
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,190
Huh?

308
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,550
What's the last thing I remember?

309
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,190
Don't worry about it.
