1
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.730
Hello?

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.730
Thanks for today. Yeah.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.880
Yeah, that's right. I only went because
I was told they were all hot doctors.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.990
But it was like, where are all the hot guys?

5
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.690
What? Oh, sorry.

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.460
I can't. I'm busy doing
something else tomorrow.

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.540
No, it's not like that.

8
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.690
Yeah, something like that.

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.200
Yeah. I'll call you later.

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.150
Good night.

11
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.500
Man, what was up with today's game?

12
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.510
Seriously. Why'd they get so many
hits off during the final inning?

13
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.510
There was that, too, but why'd they
have him pinch hit at the very end?

14
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.910
Oh, that?

15
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.260
Hey, there's something lying on the ground.

16
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.500
Hey, miss! If you sleep out
here, you'll catch a co—

17
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490
Sh-She's dead!

18
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.620
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

19
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.580
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

20
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.040
The witness is a shut-in!

21
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.120
What is the truth they won't reveal?
Why can't they leave their home?

22
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.700
Always determining the one truth

23
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.290
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

24
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.980
his name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.430
The Wordless Witness

26
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.500
The Wordless Witness
"The Wordless Witness!"

27
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.980
The Wordless Witness

28
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.120
The murder victim is Shinozaki
Himeno-san, 26 years old,

29
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.980
a domestic helper who lived in the area.

30
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.950
According to the friend she was speaking
with on the phone before her death,

31
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.620
the victim was coming
home late after a mixer.

32
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.810
We believe the weapon was
a hard rod-like object,

33
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.990
but we still haven't identified it.

34
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.580
Another random attack?

35
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.640
C-Conan-kun? Mori-san and Ran-san, too?

36
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.640
You already got wind of the case?

37
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.900
They say every detective has his case.

38
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.910
I believe there were two similar
incidents in this area last week.

39
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.370
Yes. Young women dressed in flashy clothes
are being struck over the head at night

40
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.150
with the same rod-like
weapon used in this case.

41
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.000
It's safe to assume the
same person is responsible.

42
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.660
Fortunately, in the previous two cases,

43
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.500
the victims were only
injured, but this time...

44
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.130
You mean their crimes are escalating?

45
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.960
Yes.

46
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.140
In any case, we need to arrest
the culprit as soon as possible.

47
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.140
But this area is totally deserted at night.

48
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.410
There aren't any security cameras nearby.

49
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.840
Just like the previous two times, I doubt
we can count on any eyewitness testimony.

50
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.530
We didn't find anything notable
among her belongings either.

51
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.530
Did the previous victims say
anything about the incidents?

52
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.910
Well, actually...

53
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.360
Perhaps because they were
drunk like this victim,

54
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.290
neither of them remembered the incidents.

55
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.560
I see.

56
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.050
Hey!

57
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.880
Kids should stay out of this.

58
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.300
Behave yourself and wait over here.

59
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.250
Anyway, this seems like it'll
be a difficult investigation.

60
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.200
Yeah.

61
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.190
Hey, kid.

62
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.450
Do you know those police officers?

63
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.450
What? Uh, yeah. Sort of.

64
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.870
The random attacker left that
body behind, didn't they?

65
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.450
Uh, well...

66
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.790
Oh, come on. I can keep a secret.

67
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.220
More importantly, who lives in that house?

68
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.630
That's Komori-san's place.

69
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.820
A mother and her son live there.

70
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.260
Her son Hikaru-kun lives on the second floor.

71
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.640
Apparently Hikaru-kun failed to find a job.

72
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.680
He's been cooped up in there forever.

73
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.400
I believe it's been about three months.

74
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.400
I think they're called idol otakus?

75
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.220
Apparently he was following
Okino Yoko around.

76
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.410
That's probably why he failed to find a job.

77
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.750
I'm telling you, kids these days...

78
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.780
Huh?

79
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.340
Where are you going, son?

80
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.660
That brat!

81
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.420
Komori

82
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.670
Komori
You're looking for Hikaru?

83
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.170
Come in. He's up here.

84
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.920
But I don't think there's any
point in asking him questions.

85
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.430
He stayed in his room when
the police came here earlier.

86
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.800
You heard her.

87
00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.350
But maybe he'll talk to a great detective.

88
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.560
Well, yeah.

89
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.220
This is Hikaru's room.

90
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.610
Whoa!

91
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.640
Wow...

92
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.280
He's been a fan since her Earth
Ladies days. Outstanding.

93
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.290
Hikaru.

94
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.990
A detective wants to speak
with you about the incident.

95
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.670
I'm the great detective Mori Kogoro.

96
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.240
Hikaru-san, I'd like to
ask you some questions.

97
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.140
"I didn't see anything."

98
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.730
"Leave."

99
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.260
This is how he's been recently.

100
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.360
He won't even speak to me.

101
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.380
Hikaru-san.

102
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.580
Hikaru-san, open the door.

103
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.660
This is hopeless.

104
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.280
But why did he say he didn't see anything?

105
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.580
Huh?

106
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.040
What do you mean?

107
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.540
Regardless of whether or
not someone is the culprit,

108
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.410
wouldn't their first concern
be becoming a suspect?

109
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.550
Generally, yeah.

110
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.770
I'd understand "It wasn't me"
or "I don't know anything,"

111
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.300
but the first thing Hikaru-san
said was "I didn't see anything."

112
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.810
Maybe Hikaru-san did see something.

113
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.360
In the same way that the crime
scene can be seen from that room,

114
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.570
that room is visible from the crime scene.

115
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.070
Even if Hikaru-san didn't see anything,
maybe the culprit saw Hikaru-san.

116
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.780
This is taking too long!

117
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.690
Hey, open this door!

118
00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.120
Hey, Dad!

119
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.940
That's enough, please.

120
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.350
I just need to talk to him for a little bit.

121
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.340
I'm sorry, but...

122
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:16.950
Make sure you lock your windows
and doors, just in case.

123
00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:18.500
I will.

124
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.330
Are these Hikaru-san's leather shoes?

125
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.580
What? Yes, probably. Why?

126
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.210
They're dirtier than you'd expect
for someone looking for a job,

127
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.970
and they have a different feel
from the other shoes here.

128
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.210
You're right.

129
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.510
They've been here since last week.

130
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.610
That's when the random attacks started.

131
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.960
What do you mean by that?

132
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.350
What? Nothing.

133
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.380
In that case...

134
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.440
What happened to the shoes that were here?

135
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.820
What? There should be some
Okino Yoko sneakers there.

136
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.540
They seemed so important to him.

137
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.450
Where did he put those?

138
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.790
Maybe he gave up on following her
so he could focus on finding a job?

139
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.680
I hope you're right.

140
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.830
Come to think of it, we started
communicating via text last week.

141
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.960
I see.

142
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.810
Did you figure something out?

143
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.490
No, not at all.

144
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.340
Jeez.

145
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.350
Well, we got nothing out of that.

146
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.110
Do you think Hikaru-san
really didn't see anything?

147
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.110
It wouldn't be odd if he witnessed something,

148
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.690
but it doesn't matter if he won't talk to us.

149
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.740
How'd it go?

150
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.590
Is that boy connected to
the case somehow after all?

151
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.860
I knew he seemed suspicious.

152
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.830
Huh?

153
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.090
Hey, wait!

154
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.090
Come on, tell me. Here's my
address and phone number!

155
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.390
I'd do anything to help!

156
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.670
Mori Detective Agency

157
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.360
Mori Detective Agency
The series of random attacks have
finally resulted in a death.

158
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.660
The series of random attacks have
finally resulted in a death.
Series of Random Attacks

159
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.110
Series of Random Attacks
The police have not yet found
any convincing evidence,

160
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.070
The police have not yet found
any convincing evidence,

161
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:24.650
and the investigation's progress
is expected to be slow.

162
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.520
and the investigation's progress
is expected to be slow.
Random attacks like these are the
most challenging cases to solve.

163
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.120
Random attacks like these are the
most challenging cases to solve.

164
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.270
I'm certain Hikaru-san saw something.

165
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.130
The question is why does he so
stubbornly refuse to testify?

166
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.010
Here's our next story.

167
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.750
Okino Yoko Dome Tour

168
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.140
Okino Yoko Dome Tour
The Okino Yoko-san dome
tour that began last week

169
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.520
Okino Yoko Dome Tour
concluded last night amidst
tremendous excitement.

170
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.650
Yoko-tan!

171
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.680
The old man can hardly criticize others.

172
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.910
Wait a minute. Could it be?

173
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.700
Coffee Poirot

174
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.450
The truth is starting to become clear!

175
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.010
I'll be back late. You can
microwave your dinner.
Mom

176
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.520
Ow...

177
00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.150
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

178
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.880
Yeah, sorry.

179
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.010
You're that kid from this afternoon.

180
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.830
What?

181
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.850
Nothing.

182
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.840
You're Hikaru-san, right?

183
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.800
Did you run away from home?

184
00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.000
What?

185
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.160
Your suitcase.

186
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.320
Yeah, something like that.

187
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.870
You shouldn't do that.
Your mom will be worried.

188
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.430
What?

189
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.820
Come on, let's go home.

190
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.050
Hey, wait.

191
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.440
Seriously?

192
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.940
What is this?

193
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.700
What's going on?

194
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.800
We were too late.

195
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.540
What's going on here?

196
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:26.840
The random attacker took him away.

197
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.840
The real Hikaru-san.

198
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.580
Ow...

199
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.870
Where am I?

200
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.040
Wh-What are you talking about?

201
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.820
Hikaru is... I'm right here.

202
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.010
If you assume he swapped places with
someone, it explains everything.

203
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.510
Why he stopped speaking last week,

204
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.050
why his favorite sneakers
vanished around the same time,

205
00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.270
why those out-of-place shoes
appeared in their place.

206
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.900
And why the bottoms of those shoes were
worn down differently from the others.

207
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.650
The real Hikaru-san is a
hardcore Okino Yoko chaser.

208
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.160
Naturally, he wanted to go to her
dome tour that started last week.

209
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:40.360
But Hikaru-san was a shut-in. His mother
would never allow him to go to a concert.

210
00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.460
So Hikaru-san asked you, his
friend, for a favor, right?

211
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.500
He asked you to take his place
while he was at the concert.

212
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.430
Who are you actually?

213
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.940
I have to get out of here.

214
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.260
He escaped.

215
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.040
I'm Hikaru's friend Kageyama Shinobu.

216
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.470
Everything you said is correct.

217
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:45.460
I got to eat and live here for free,
so it was a great deal for me.

218
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.620
I never thought something
like this would happen.

219
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.790
Your identity's been discovered.

220
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.360
There's no reason for you to
refuse to testify anymore!

221
00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.880
Tell me. What did you see last night?

222
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.370
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.480
I'm not getting any more
deeply involved in trouble!

224
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.040
Are you sure you're okay with that?

225
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.960
Hikaru's life is in danger in your place.

226
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.810
If you make the wrong choice here,

227
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.820
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

228
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.080
I don't want anyone to go through that.

229
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.280
Who are you?

230
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.290
You're right. I saw the culprit.

231
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.770
But it was dark.

232
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.770
I only caught a glimpse of their face.

233
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.430
The only thing I saw clearly was...

234
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:13.560
Thanks.

235
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.030
That's plenty.

236
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.190
Let's go. We're going to rescue Hikaru-san!

237
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280
All right!

238
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.700
Why, you...!

239
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.700
You brat!

240
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.910
It's no use. He's not answering the phone.

241
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.000
Then he's already—

242
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.080
Don't give up!

243
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.080
Please let us make it in time.

244
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.720
Someone—

245
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.610
This is your fault...

246
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.940
for seeing something you shouldn't have.

247
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.110
Something I shouldn't have?

248
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.580
You saw me last night.

249
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.110
Doing what?

250
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.390
You saw me kill that woman from your room.

251
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.870
Last night, from my room?

252
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.380
I've got nothing to do with this anymore.

253
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.940
I see.

254
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.200
He didn't want to get
involved in any trouble.

255
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.280
I suppose that's how friends are.

256
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.650
I guess I got what I deserved.

257
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.280
Hikaru!

258
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.400
What are you muttering about?

259
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.420
It's fine. Kill me.

260
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.670
I failed to find a job, and
my friend abandoned me.

261
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.170
There's no point in me living anymore.

262
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:47.180
That's right. Because kids
like you keep screwing around,

263
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.680
the world's going to hell!

264
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.560
Listen to me, lady!

265
00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.320
He's not the one who saw
you last night! It was me!

266
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.570
What?

267
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.450
He didn't see anything!

268
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.840
I'm the one you have to kill!

269
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:11.450
Kageyama—

270
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.960
What the hell's going on?

271
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.000
Now!

272
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.800
Take this!

273
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.270
Hikaru!

274
00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.680
Are you okay?

275
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.190
Kageyama...

276
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.520
I'm so glad you're okay.

277
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.530
Mori Detective Agency

278
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.690
Mori Detective Agency
Look at this.

279
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.200
Apparently those two are establishing
a start-up company together.

280
00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.380
They're bound to fail.

281
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.700
You can't know that unless you try.

282
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.810
I'm sure they'll be fine.

283
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.460
By the way, what's he doing?

284
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:30.970
Apparently he's searching online
for a Mori Kogoro double.

285
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.190
While he's working, I can take it easy.

286
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.300
I'll use my double to make money.
