1
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:05,713
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:08,633
High school student Shinichi was
forced to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,203
Although smaller, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:12,713
Today's case is about John the dog!

5
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,713
He's a shepherd dog known
throughout the neighborhood!

6
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:18,463
Dogs may not speak, but
there's always only one truth!

7
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,210
John the Dog's Murder Case.

8
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,200
John!

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,770
Hey, John!

10
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,650
John!

11
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,230
Come here, John!

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,190
Here he comes!

13
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,980
John's so cute!

14
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,280
I wonder how old he is now?

15
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,310
He was still just a
puppy when I was a kid,

16
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,500
so I'd say around 8 or so...

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,460
What're you talking about, Conan?

18
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,810
Never mind!

19
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,310
That was close!

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,150
John. I'm not high school
student Kudo Shinichi anymore,

21
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,570
I'm grade school student
Conan Edogawa now.

22
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,850
Oh, it's you!

23
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,550
Hello!

24
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,060
We're back!

25
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,770
I don't mind at all!

26
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,820
Come on in!

27
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,980
OK!

28
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,520
Several days later

29
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,850
It's been so long since we ate out!

30
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,030
That restaurant was pretty good!

31
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,990
Hey, this is the place!
The house where John the dog lives!

32
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,400
I know this house!

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,520
When we were in grade school,

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,020
Shinichi used to stop by here
on his way home from school.

35
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,710
He would save some bread from
lunch and then give it to the dog!

36
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,730
Sakaguchi Masayoshi?

37
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,480
I've heard that name somewhere before...

38
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,200
He says he's a lawyer.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,180
Oh, that's right.

40
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,850
He's a famous lawyer who
specializes in cases involving minors.

41
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,270
Hey, Dad.

42
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,400
Wasn't this the house where that
middle school student killed himself

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,150
when I was in third grade?

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,950
What was that?!

45
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,700
Hey! What's going on?!

46
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,420
What happened?!

47
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,980
The dog!

48
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,170
What happened to John?!

49
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,750
He jumped at Takeshi!

50
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,380
Conan-kun!

51
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,220
Hey, you!

52
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,390
You're in the way! Get out of here!

53
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,070
John! It's me!

54
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,270
That tickles, John!

55
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,810
Hello? What's going on,
Takeshi-kun?!

56
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,600
Hello?!

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,480
It's me, Conan!

58
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,100
Eh? Conan-kun?!

59
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,920
Where are you now?!

60
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,270
I'm in Izu on business.

61
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,380
I just heard Takeshi-kun
scream-- what happened?!

62
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,510
Come home right away!
John's done something terrible!

63
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,690
The victim was Maehara
Takeshi, twenty-two years old.

64
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,270
He's a college student who lives
in the apartment complex next door,

65
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,820
and Sakaguchi-san asked him to
watch the place while he was gone?

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,770
That's right...

67
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,490
And Takeshi-san invited you,
Sugita Sanae-san, over.

68
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,710
Now then, could you give us the
details about what exactly happened?

69
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay...

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,550
It was around 8:00 when I came over.

71
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,060
I've never been in
such a huge living room!

72
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,600
Aren't you glad you came?

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,330
Super glad!

74
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,680
Oh no!

75
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,600
It was just getting fun!

76
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,570
Sakaguchi residence.

77
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,940
Oh, Sakaguchi-san.

78
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,110
Yes, everything's fine.

79
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,490
Eh? John?

80
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,700
He's at the top of the stairs,
behaving himself.

81
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,520
Eh? You want to talk to John?

82
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,350
Sure!

83
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,830
John! Hey, John!

84
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,460
Alright, whatever.

85
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,400
Here, your master
wants to talk to you.

86
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,980
And then we showed up...

87
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,710
But why would
the dog suddenly attack?

88
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,270
I don't know!

89
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,420
I can only think that he attacked
Takeshi for no reason at all!

90
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,880
No way! John would never
attack anyone for no reason!

91
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,470
But Takeshi didn't do anything!

92
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,680
What's going to happen
to the dog, Inspector?

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,810
I can't say anything for sure yet,

94
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,810
but if he really attacked
for no reason as she says,

95
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,730
then he'll probably
have to be put to sleep.

96
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,940
Put to sleep?
You're going to kill him?!

97
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,160
At any rate, we first need
to talk to Sakaguchi-san...

98
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,150
"First year middle school
student kills himself."

99
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,790
"Was bullying the cause?"

100
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,810
"...a classmate that
bullied Masato-kun--"

101
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,010
It doesn't give the bully's name!

102
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,230
John's been well trained,

103
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,940
and he'd never attack
anyone for no reason at all.

104
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,550
Wait a minute!

105
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,020
John attacked the victim immediately
after the phone was put to his ear.

106
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,150
What if Sakaguchi-san ordered
John to attack over the phone?!

107
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,130
But Sakaguchi-san always seems
so nice; he'd never do such a thing!

108
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,490
Where's John, Inspector?!

109
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,190
You didn't put him
to sleep already, did you?!

110
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,060
Don't worry!

111
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,690
He's been taken to
the police station for now;

112
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,460
it hasn't been decided that
he's to be put to sleep yet.

113
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,520
So, Inspector.
What did Sakaguchi-san say?

114
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,920
He says he can't believe
that John would attack anyone.

115
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,260
Neither can I!
There must be a reason why--

116
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,690
You keep quiet!

117
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,430
Please continue, Inspector.

118
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:22,270
I asked Mr. Sakaguchi
about his phone conversation...

119
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,650
To start off, what exactly did
you say to the victim over the phone?

120
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,350
I asked him if everything
was alright, how John was doing,

121
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,120
and then I asked him
to put John on the line.

122
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,080
Why did you do that?

123
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,440
I always say good night to him,
so I thought I'd say it tonight too.

124
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,350
So you told John good night?

125
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,630
Before that, I think I asked,
"How are you doing, John?"

126
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,230
Then suddenly I heard
John bark and Takeshi-kun scream...

127
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,640
Sakaguchi-san
didn't say anything else?

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,350
There's no mistake about it.

129
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,980
The girl who was
there confirmed his story.

130
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,610
You mentioned it last night,
didn't you, Ran-neechan?

131
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,320
That Sakaguchi-san's son
committed suicide a long time ago.

132
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,860
Oh. Yeah...

133
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,560
I asked him about
that at the station too.

134
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,660
He said a bully drove him to do it...

135
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,790
Maybe his son's bully
was Maehara Takeshi-kun?!

136
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,500
But it's still just a "maybe."

137
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,210
I thought so.

138
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,690
I heard this directly
from Sakaguchi-san himself.

139
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,230
His son Masato-kun
and Maehara Takeshi-kun

140
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,930
were classmates in middle school.

141
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,310
Masato-kun apparently wrote
about Takeshi-kun in his diary

142
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,350
shortly before
hanging himself in his room.

143
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,810
I hear that Mr. Sakaguchi loathed
Takeshi-kun after reading the diary.

144
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,820
Since his wife had died early on,
Masato-kun was all he had left.

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,940
But when he saw Takeshi-kun
crying and apologizing at the funeral,

146
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,780
he decided to forgive him.

147
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,910
Takeshi-kun was the only
one who bullied Masato-kun?

148
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,480
It would seem so.

149
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
Shortly after, Takeshi-kun
moved to western Japan

150
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,420
because of his father's job.

151
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,690
Then, two years ago, he moved
back to attend a university in Tokyo.

152
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,260
It was this spring that he
moved into an apartment complex

153
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,640
right next to the Sakaguchi residence.

154
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,100
It truly was an act of fate.

155
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,270
Apparently Mr. Sakaguchi was
surprised by the unexpected reunion, too.

156
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,770
But he no longer bore any
ill feelings toward Takeshi-kun.

157
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,740
I'm even told that he sometimes
invited him over for dinner.

158
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,320
But if he really does still
have a grudge against Takeshi-kun...

159
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
What are you trying to say?

160
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,150
Mr. Sakaguchi secretly
trained John to attack people

161
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,880
when a specific phrase is said to him!

162
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,980
And then last night, he said
that phrase to John over the phone!

163
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,840
How are you doing, John?

164
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,310
In this way, Mr. Sakaguchi
accomplished his revenge!

165
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,460
Wrong.

166
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,350
How come?

167
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,150
Have you forgotten?

168
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,650
When I questioned him last night,

169
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,950
he repeated what he said on
the phone, right in front of John.

170
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,870
John didn't react one
bit when he heard him.

171
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,910
Gah! I thought
I sounded so authoritative too!

172
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,620
Don't feel so down
in the dumps, Mori-kun!

173
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,400
Masato...

174
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,980
Thanks for coming, Conan-kun!

175
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,770
I thought you might be lonely
without John to keep you company!

176
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,730
Thanks!

177
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,190
Say, does John always
sleep at the top of the stairs?

178
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,530
Yeah, he does.

179
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,370
Why doesn't he sleep downstairs?

180
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,730
See that door there?

181
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,330
Yeah.

182
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,040
That was my son's room.

183
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,400
He absolutely loved John.

184
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,480
But his late mother said he
couldn't let the dog in his room,

185
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,050
so John always
slept in front of his door.

186
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,520
John's still waiting for him to open
the door and say good morning to him!

187
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,060
Even though it's been
eight years since my son died...

188
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,030
That's a big phone over there.

189
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,530
The receiver's
connected to it by a cord...

190
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,700
Say, wasn't there a
cordless phone there last night?

191
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,900
Yes. I sometimes switch
it with the phone in my study.

192
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,420
Why do you ask?

193
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,530
No reason!

194
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,220
This guy really did--

195
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,810
Wait a minute!

196
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,660
The clock must've struck
9:00 just before it happened!

197
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,100
That's it!

198
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,910
Now I see how Sakaguchi-san
ordered John to attack!

199
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,860
The phone was different?

200
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,400
Yeah.

201
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,320
The receiver on the big
phone is connected by a cord.

202
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,560
But last night he had a
cordless phone there, he said.

203
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,790
I wonder why?

204
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,120
Why? There's
probably no real reason--

205
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,020
No, there is a reason.

206
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,420
Sakaguchi-san absolutely
needed it to be a cordless phone!

207
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,420
What do you mean?

208
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,300
Listen. It would be impossible to
carry a regular phone up a staircase!

209
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,650
So Sakaguchi-san purposely
placed a portable cordless phone

210
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,100
in the living room!

211
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,850
So you still think that Sakaguchi-san
used John to commit a murder?

212
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,440
I'm absolutely certain of it now!

213
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,740
But I don't know the most important thing--
how he ordered the attack!

214
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,450
Hey, our clock doesn't chime, does it?

215
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,750
The clock in Sakaguchi-san's
living room chimes real loud every hour.

216
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,150
His clock?!

217
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,190
Come to think of it,

218
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,460
it was precisely 9:00 when
John attacked Takeshi-kun!

219
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,230
I've figured it out!

220
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,430
The great detective, Mori Kogoro,
has just solved the mystery!

221
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,930
Beika Police Station

222
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,560
What in the world are you going to do?!

223
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,150
Just a little test.

224
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,350
When I give the word,

225
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,610
repeat what you said to
John last night on the phone!

226
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,570
Okay...

227
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,890
Okay, Sakaguchi-san!

228
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,560
Right.

229
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,940
How are you doing, John?

230
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,320
Louder!

231
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,280
How are you doing, John?!

232
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,700
This can't be!

233
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,410
Were my deductions all wrong?!

234
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,210
I was so certain of it!

235
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,020
You overanalyzed things, Dad.

236
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,930
He would never use the dog
that his son loved to get revenge...

237
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,650
I can't say anything for certain,

238
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,850
but what we found out
from our investigation afterward

239
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,980
was that Sakaguchi-san supposedly
took John somewhere in his car

240
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,230
every Sunday for the last three months.

241
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,440
According to him, he took
John to the outskirts of town

242
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,810
and let him get a lot of
exercise in the empty fields.

243
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,070
Inspector! He obviously
trained John during those times!

244
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,980
But there's no proof.

245
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,480
And I'm sorry to have to say this,

246
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,040
but it's been decided that John
is to be put to sleep tomorrow evening.

247
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,880
What?!

248
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,690
Orders from above.

249
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,480
Mr. Sakaguchi understands as well.

250
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,310
Shinichi...

251
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,220
Where are you?!

252
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,440
John, the dog you liked so much,

253
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,560
is going to be killed
if we don't do something!

254
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,920
Please come back, Shinichi!

255
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,160
You're the only one who can save John!

256
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,500
So they're going
to kill John this evening?!

257
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,520
That's horrible!

258
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,210
Can't we do something?!

259
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,190
I was up all night
thinking about it too, you know!

260
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,100
But...

261
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,890
Alright! Next!

262
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,350
On your mark!

263
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,600
Get set!

264
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,440
That's it!

265
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,980
I've finally figured it out!

266
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,690
What do you think he figured out?

267
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,570
No idea...
No idea...

268
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,780
What now?!

269
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,750
I'd like to have another test.

270
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,090
On your mark...

271
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,100
Hello?

272
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,950
Get set!

273
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,650
Now say the words, if you would!

274
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,550
You got me!

275
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,770
So you admit you trained
John to attack Maehara Takeshi-kun?!

276
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,940
He didn't remember anything!

277
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,940
He didn't remember me, or Masato!

278
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,730
Yes!

279
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,660
He had completely forgotten about
the very person he drove to suicide!

280
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,120
And then he unwittingly moved
into the apartment complex next to you...

281
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,810
I'm a lawyer who specializes
in crimes committed by minors!

282
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,020
I took this job so that I could
help young people who lost their way!

283
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,900
So when I saw him crying and
apologizing at the funeral eight years ago,

284
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,650
I decided to forgive him!

285
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,840
He was still just a
1st-year middle school student,

286
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,690
and I felt that Masato's
death wouldn't be in vain

287
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,810
if he truly regretted it
with all his heart!

288
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,770
But when I met him
again eight years later,

289
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,980
he didn't remember a
single thing about the incident!

290
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,480
Not only that, he was no
different than he was eight years ago!

291
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,940
Give me my wallet back!

292
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,950
I'm just borrowing it!

293
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,160
Stop worrying! I'll pay you back
one of these days, when I feel like it!

294
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,850
Who knows when that'll be, though...

295
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,850
When I saw that,
I could feel my blood boil!

296
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,520
What was Masato's death for?!

297
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,260
Why did I ever forgive him?!

298
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,310
So then you used John--

299
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,350
That's right!

300
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,020
I decided that if the
law couldn't deal with him,

301
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,940
then I would take
justice into my own hands!

302
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,690
And I'm sure that John was happy
that he avenged Masato too!

303
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,400
That's horrible!

304
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,230
You weren't the only one who
was sad when Masato-kun died!

305
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,370
Do you have any idea how sad John was?!

306
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,230
You said so yourself!

307
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,310
Even now, John still waits
for Masato-kun in front of his door!

308
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,040
Do you honestly think that
Masato-kun would be happy

309
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,630
that you used his
loyal dog to kill someone?!

310
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,980
Sakaguchi-san.
Bullying is definitely wrong.

311
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,260
And I actually do understand your
ill will toward Maehara Takeshi-kun.

312
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,310
But did you ever once think
about the feelings of the dog

313
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,230
you stupidly used as a
murder tool to get revenge?

314
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,190
John's feelings?

315
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,070
Here you go, John.

316
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,230
Oh, John!

317
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,770
Sakaguchi-san.

318
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,790
John is saying that he still
cares for you, even now.

319
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,100
Please try to understand that feeling.

320
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,250
John!

321
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,220
Forgive me, John!

322
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,150
John!

323
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,070
So they didn't kill John?!

324
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,100
That's right!

325
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,030
He was taken in by one of
Sakaguchi-san's relatives!

326
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,490
That's great!

327
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,250
And it's all thanks to
Mori Kogoro, the great detective!

328
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,650
But John doesn't live
at that house anymore, huh?

329
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,420
That's too bad.
We really liked him a lot...

330
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,970
You can always make
friends with another dog!

331
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,680
See? Look at that one!

332
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,010
It looks just like John!

333
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,140
It does! Let's go!

334
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,430
Yeah!

335
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,400
You appear to have
quite an exceptional dog, Miss.

336
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,280
Actually, I'm a dog-lover myself...

337
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,310
What do you say we talk about
dogs at that coffee shop over there?!

338
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,530
No, thanks...

339
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,770
Don't say that!

340
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,490
Come on!

341
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,810
Sic 'im, boy!

342
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,100
Go get him!

343
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,310
Go start a relationship
with a dog instead.

344
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,350
You two took a bath together?!

345
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,640
Yeah!

346
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,900
That sure was fun,

347
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,520
scrubbing each other's back!

348
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,650
A nosebleed? The bath must've

349
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,940
rushed the blood to your head.

350
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,190
I'm dead if she finds out
who I really am!

351
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,400
