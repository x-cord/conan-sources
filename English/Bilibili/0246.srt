1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,740
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,740
And the light of truth pierces through the most mysterious case.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,840
It's summer and hot. Time to go to sea.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,840
At a beach, an incident is awaiting us.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,640
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,953
I'm bored.

9
00:02:01,953 --> 00:02:04,453
We came all the way to Izu Resort.

10
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:08,853
But, I can't swim the way I want with this body.

11
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:12,353
I really want my original body back.

12
00:02:12,353 --> 00:02:13,853
I got it.

13
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:19,353
Oh no.

14
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:21,853
Are you okay, little boy?

15
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:22,853
I'm fine.

16
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,053
-Sorry. -Yeah.

17
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:28,453
-Bye, bye now. -Take care.

18
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:33,053
All right, I guess I'll make do with this body for a while.

19
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,053
Hey, Conan.

20
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:38,653
Play seriously.

21
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:41,553
Conan, don't forget you're it.

22
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,153
Yeah, right.

23
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,553
Well, let's start again.

24
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:47,253
Please, count to thirty properly.

25
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,953
So?

26
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:55,953
Which one of the two do you like?

27
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:58,153
Come on. Don't hold out.

28
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,753
You were enticed by their bodies, weren't you?

29
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:03,653
That's silly. Who cares?

30
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:04,953
But the young woman behind me,

31
00:03:04,953 --> 00:03:07,353
wearing the blue striped swimsuit

32
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,453
is a different story...

33
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:10,953
I see.

34
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:12,953
You double exposed her body line

35
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:15,753
against the body line of you know who...

36
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:18,053
and were daydreaming about it, right?

37
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:21,153
-Cut it out. -Hey, is it you, Conan?

38
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:24,253
What're you doing here?

39
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:26,753
Ran.

40
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:30,653
Hey, why is the snot-nose kid here?

41
00:03:30,653 --> 00:03:31,653
I don't know.

42
00:03:31,653 --> 00:03:36,153
I remember that Ran said she would go away with Sonoko.

43
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:40,153
This is the beach that Dr. Agasa was talking about.

44
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,853
Yeah.

45
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:42,853
Oh, no. I feel sick.

46
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:45,353
We're always caught up in some incident every time we take this kid along.

47
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:47,553
That's why we didn't bring him this time.

48
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:48,753
It's fine.

49
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:51,853
I think the more, the merrier, right?

50
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:52,853
Yeah.

51
00:03:58,953 --> 00:04:04,553
"The Mystery Caught In the Net (Part 1)"

52
00:04:04,553 --> 00:04:06,753
Hey! It's no use running away.

53
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:08,053
Here goes!

54
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:10,853
It hurts.

55
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,053
Well, have you given up yet?

56
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:17,653
Darn it. I'll beat you next time.

57
00:04:17,653 --> 00:04:19,553
You're a strong player, Sonoko.

58
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:20,653
No, she is not.

59
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:22,953
She's just a bully who enjoys picking on younger kids.

60
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:24,753
Where's Ran?

61
00:04:24,753 --> 00:04:28,453
She went up to the shore with Conan

62
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,153
while you were getting the ball that drifted off.

63
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:33,353
Haibara said she's a little tired,

64
00:04:33,353 --> 00:04:34,753
so Ran went with her.

65
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:38,153
But she said she'd come back again after taking a little rest.

66
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:48,553
High body temperature, dry skin with no sweating.

67
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:52,153
And contracted pupils, a flushed face.

68
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:55,553
But her pulse is strong and rapid.

69
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:57,653
She's got heat stroke.

70
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:01,353
Then, we better bring her back to the hotel quickly.

71
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:02,953
She's all right.

72
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:05,053
In case of moderate heat stroke like this, just resting in the shade,

73
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:08,053
cooling the neck, the chest and the under arms with wet towels will do.

74
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,253
I'm sure she'll be fine soon.

75
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,653
Dr. Agasa!

76
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:16,353
I asked a shop worker for ice and water.

77
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:19,153
-Thank you. -And?

78
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,553
How is she now?

79
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,353
Well, her temperature is going down,

80
00:05:23,353 --> 00:05:25,253
so I think she will be fine.

81
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:26,553
That's great.

82
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:30,153
Please don't hesitate to let me know next time you feel sick.

83
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,253
Okay, Ai?

84
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,753
I'll go back to the beach where everyone is then.

85
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:36,953
Okay.

86
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:40,653
Oh, boy. I'm impressed by her insight.

87
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:47,053
Yeah. She was the first to notice something wrong with Haibara.

88
00:05:47,053 --> 00:05:49,453
But Ai, you sort of brought it upon yourself too.

89
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:53,753
Just sitting there without even going into the water.

90
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,853
If you felt tired,

91
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:58,453
you should have rested with Dr. Agasa under the parasol.

92
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,053
Right.

93
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,153
I didn't want to feel as if I were running away.

94
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,853
What do you mean, "running away," Ai? You mean running away from sharks?

95
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:12,053
How stupid. There are no sharks in this area.

96
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:15,453
Not from sharks,

97
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,253
but from dolphins.

98
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,053
Yeah. The dolphins, one of the most popular animals in the sea.

99
00:06:20,053 --> 00:06:23,253
The mean sharks that fled from the dark,

100
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:25,553
cold bottom of the sea,

101
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,053
they are no match for the dolphins.

102
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:31,353
Hey, what's all that mumbo jumbo about?

103
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:35,153
The dolphins? Aren't the sharks stronger than the dolphins?

104
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:38,553
You guys exhaust me.

105
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:40,453
Please leave me alone.

106
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:45,353
Hey, what do you guys think you're doing?

107
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:47,253
If you bump into other people on the beach,

108
00:06:47,253 --> 00:06:49,953
while lugging that boat around somebody may get very seriously hurt.

109
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:51,353
What's wrong?

110
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,453
This boat was abandoned on the beach,

111
00:06:53,453 --> 00:06:54,853
and the sea isn't rough at all.

112
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:57,353
So no big deal as long as we hold it steady. Right?

113
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,053
Hey, Sonoko.

114
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:03,153
I'm so sorry. We'll put it back where we found it right now.

115
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:04,253
Geez.

116
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:07,753
Hey, Noboru, don't talk so loud.

117
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:09,153
Yuuta.

118
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:12,053
Can't you see that the other customers look surprised?

119
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:14,953
"Yuuta Yoshizawa (34), Fisherman" -He's so upset now...

120
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:17,253
because he just got dumped by his girlfriend.

121
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:18,453
"Noboru Shimojo (34), Fisherman" -Don't be ridiculous.

122
00:07:18,453 --> 00:07:21,753
She didn't dump me, I dumped her, that chick.

123
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:25,553
We'll put the boat back then.

124
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:28,653
But we're the ones who took it out so...

125
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:30,453
Never mind.

126
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:35,353
It's also a part of our jobs as Life Guards to clean up the beach.

127
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:38,853
You're Life Guards.

128
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:42,853
I assumed you're fishermen but I guess it was my imagination.

129
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:46,553
Well, unskilled fishermen who cannot fish should just go back on shore

130
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,153
"Giichi Aramaki (51)" -and work part time jobs...

131
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:50,153
"Fisherman" -picking up garbage on the beach,

132
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:51,553
to support yourself.

133
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:53,353
Says you.

134
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:56,253
We cannot fish because of you!

135
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:58,753
Stop it, Noboru.

136
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:00,353
So, Mr. Aramaki,

137
00:08:00,353 --> 00:08:02,353
as we decided before, we'll meet in Tong-Poo

138
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:03,953
in the Queens Hotel at 8 o'clock tonight.

139
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:05,453
We'll be waiting for you.

140
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,453
Don't turn tail and run away from us.

141
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,353
Of course, I'll go.

142
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:12,353
Don't you guys chicken and run out on me either.

143
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:13,453
Hey, Ran.

144
00:08:13,453 --> 00:08:16,753
I think the restaurant we booked was...

145
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:19,353
Chinese restaurant, Tong-Poo...

146
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:24,653
Oh, dear, Dr. Agasa, I didn't know you guys were here.

147
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:28,453
Yeah, well... we're staying at this hotel.

148
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:29,853
Let's have dinner together.

149
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:32,353
Won't you sit down here with us?

150
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:33,553
Yes.

151
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,253
Where's Ai?

152
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:36,853
She's sleeping in her room now.

153
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,353
She says she isn't hungry so she doesn't want dinner.

154
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,653
I see.

155
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,153
What's this?

156
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:45,853
You seem to care deeply for that brown-headed girl, don't you?

157
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:47,953
I just wanted to talk to her.

158
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,553
I've barely spoken to her.

159
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,953
When our eyes meet, she always looks away from me.

160
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,653
I wonder if she doesn't like me?

161
00:08:55,653 --> 00:08:57,053
No. That's not true.

162
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:58,053
Oh, really?

163
00:08:58,053 --> 00:09:01,553
Because Ms. Haibara was telling Conan,

164
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:04,453
"Aren't you lucky that Ran's got great buttocks?"

165
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:09,353
Hey, Conan, just what is this all about?

166
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:13,353
Don't get me wrong. Ai said that of her own initiative.

167
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:17,253
Isn't having great buttocks supposed to be a compliment?

168
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:19,653
Some type of buttercups?

169
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:24,353
No, she doesn't like being buttered up.

170
00:09:24,353 --> 00:09:27,153
I see, it's not about butts.

171
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:34,353
Hey, hey, didn't she say anything about me?

172
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:36,353
Well...

173
00:09:36,353 --> 00:09:38,353
She said you've got a light ansty butt.

174
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,553
Oh, well...

175
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:43,253
Aren't you happy?

176
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:44,753
She's saying you're light, isn't she?

177
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,553
Aren't you the girls and kids that we met on the beach this afternoon?

178
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,153
Hi.

179
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:54,453
Hey, do you have the time?

180
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,953
My watch has stopped.

181
00:09:56,953 --> 00:09:59,353
It's 7:12 pm.

182
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:01,253
Darn.

183
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,453
I came too early.

184
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:05,853
All right.

185
00:10:05,853 --> 00:10:07,953
I think a fight's about to start soon.

186
00:10:07,953 --> 00:10:10,153
So, let's order quickly and eat.

187
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,953
It's not a fight.

188
00:10:11,953 --> 00:10:15,553
We're just gonna teach that outlaw a lesson.

189
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:17,253
A lesson?

190
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,753
Yeah, a lesson about the laws of nature

191
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,753
that should not be broken.

192
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:26,453
He draws a seine everywhere

193
00:10:26,453 --> 00:10:28,753
and takes whatever he can get his hands on.

194
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,653
Yeah. We try to limit our fish catches

195
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,753
and are also doing fish farming, but...

196
00:10:34,753 --> 00:10:36,853
We're not going to tolerate him coming along one day,

197
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:40,653
and doing everything his way. No way!

198
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:45,053
So tonight, we're gonna teach that guy Aramaki

199
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:50,253
how long it takes to restore the overfished sea

200
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:52,453
to its original state.

201
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:55,053
Can't you control him?

202
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,053
I guess we can't...

203
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:58,453
There are regulations concerning fishing,

204
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:00,853
but in this neighborhood they exist in name only.

205
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:03,953
So, in other words, he gets to take all he wants.

206
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:06,653
Yuuta. You're late.

207
00:11:06,653 --> 00:11:08,553
It's 8 o'clock sharp.

208
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:10,653
You're here too early, Noboru.

209
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,753
Where's Nobutsugu? Didn't he come with you?

210
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,553
He was growling that he was going to give the guy

211
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:16,853
a piece of his mind, right?

212
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,453
I got a call from Nobutsugu saying he'd be late

213
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:22,353
because he was going to visit his father's grave before coming here.

214
00:11:22,353 --> 00:11:28,153
Oh, yeah, today is the day our fathers died.

215
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:29,653
Our fathers?

216
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:32,253
Yeah. Our fathers...

217
00:11:32,253 --> 00:11:34,953
All of them died eight years ago

218
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:37,953
when their ship was wrecked in a storm.

219
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:45,653
Well, they were happy to die a fisherman's death, I guess...

220
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,753
You don't mince your words, do you girl?

221
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:50,653
Gee, they're sure getting along...

222
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:52,753
Hey, Sonoko! That's rude, you know?

223
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,053
What? Who cares?

224
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,753
Hey, come on...

225
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:58,053
Well, well...

226
00:11:58,053 --> 00:12:01,353
It's true that despite knowing the storm was imminent,

227
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,653
-our fathers ventured to sea to fish. -No!

228
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:05,753
It was not because of the storm.

229
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:09,453
"Nobutsugu Nezu (35)" -Our fathers' boat was sunk by that guy.

230
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:11,953
"Fisherman" -That is Aramaki's pirate ship.

231
00:12:11,953 --> 00:12:15,853
Hey. Nobutsugu, you're still talking like that?

232
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:18,053
How rude.

233
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:20,653
Anyway, where's that 'Pirate'?

234
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,553
He should be here by now.

235
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,753
It's already 8:40 pm.

236
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:28,753
I guess he forgot about us is drunk and already sacked.

237
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:30,153
You got to be kidding.

238
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:31,753
All right, I'm going to rout him up.

239
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,953
That's impossible.

240
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,453
I called him up a little while ago

241
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:35,853
but he didn't answer.

242
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:40,353
Hello?

243
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,753
Did he answer?

244
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:45,453
The call went through

245
00:12:45,453 --> 00:12:46,853
but there's no answer.

246
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,253
I only hear a strange sound.

247
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:50,853
-A strange sound? -A strange sound?

248
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,953
This is...

249
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,853
The sound of waves?

250
00:12:57,853 --> 00:12:59,253
Oh no. He hung up.

251
00:12:59,253 --> 00:13:00,753
Come to think of it...

252
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:06,053
This beach, a shortcut from Aramaki's house to this hotel, isn't it?

253
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,253
Yeah, I know.

254
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,453
But now in high water,

255
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,853
I think nobody can take the beach route.

256
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:15,753
Don't tell me that guy is enjoying night fishing,

257
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,953
while keeping us waiting.

258
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:19,053
It's not likely.

259
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:22,353
Okay then, why don't we go there after getting sober?

260
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,353
Oh, yeah.

261
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:50,161
I see, this person, Mr. Aramaki and all three of you

262
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:54,161
had arranged to meet at the Chinese restaurant,

263
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:57,561
'Tong-Poo' in that Queens hotel at 8 o'clock tonight.

264
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:01,061
Yet, he didn't appear at the expected time.

265
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:05,561
And an hour and a half after the appointed time, around 9:30 pm,

266
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,961
when you came here to check up on him,

267
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,761
Mr. Aramaki's drowned body,

268
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:13,161
wrapped in the net and was washed up ashore.

269
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,861
Is this right?

270
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:19,561
-Yeah. -Hey, You're getting too close to me.

271
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:21,361
We are not telling a lie.

272
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,761
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:27,661
You know, it's well known that you local fishermen

274
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:29,761
and this Mr. Aramaki were on bad terms.

275
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:33,361
So, I thought that you three could've drowned him here

276
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:36,761
and pretended that you found his body.

277
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:37,761
What did you say?

278
00:14:37,761 --> 00:14:41,461
They're telling you the truth.

279
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,861
Aren't you Sonoko and Ran?

280
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:46,561
We heard them confirming their appointment

281
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:50,261
with the man who passed away, on the beach today.

282
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,361
Right, Ran?

283
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:56,861
Yeah. And, it's also true that they came to the Chinese restaurant.

284
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:58,161
See, I told you so.

285
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:01,961
It's true, but all three of them came separately to the restaurant.

286
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:03,561
Dr. Agasa?

287
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:07,161
That thin young man came at 7:10 pm.

288
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:10,061
The plump young guy at 8 pm sharp.

289
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:14,061
The tanned young man came around 8:40 pm.

290
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:18,061
Those kids don't look like you at all.

291
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:20,761
No, they are kids from the neighborhood.

292
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:26,261
Their parents asked me to take them on a trip during summer vacation.

293
00:15:26,261 --> 00:15:28,661
So don't tell me that Conan

294
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,761
and the precocious little girl is also here.

295
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,661
You mean Ai. She's in the hotel now

296
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:35,461
but Conan is...

297
00:15:35,461 --> 00:15:36,661
Look over there.

298
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:40,161
Hey, you... Stop that.

299
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,761
You're not allowed to touch it.

300
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:46,861
You know what? Don't you think it's strange, Officer Yokomizo?

301
00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:47,861
Look!

302
00:15:47,861 --> 00:15:51,561
He drowned but his body is full of scratches and his clothes are torn.

303
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,661
And why is he wrapped in the net?

304
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:57,661
Well... The murderer tried to make him drown,

305
00:15:57,661 --> 00:15:59,561
binding his arms and legs with the net.

306
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:03,561
And scratches... Maybe he fought with the murderer and...

307
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,561
Hey, the police will take it from here. Your help is not necessary!

308
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,161
All right, send the body for post-mortem.

309
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,161
Yes, sir!

310
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:16,761
Can we go now?

311
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:19,361
We have to prepare to go fishing tomorrow.

312
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:20,561
No, you can't.

313
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:23,461
I have something else to ask you yet.

314
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:24,961
Are you still suspecting us?

315
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,161
We already told you.

316
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:29,661
All three of us had been waiting for him at the restaurant.

317
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,061
Yeah, but it seems more probable

318
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:36,761
that he had already killed before the appointed time.

319
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:41,761
And I don't really understand why you came to this beach to find him.

320
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,261
It's the call.

321
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,261
We waited for him until after 8pm but he didn't show up at all,

322
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:49,061
so I called his cell phone to ask him to come over.

323
00:16:49,061 --> 00:16:51,661
The guy just hung up without saying anything,

324
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:55,961
but I heard the sounds of waves in the background.

325
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:57,461
The sounds of waves?

326
00:16:57,461 --> 00:17:01,461
Yeah. That's why we came here to look for him.

327
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:05,961
Because this beach is a shortcut from his house to that hotel.

328
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:07,161
I also called him once,

329
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,061
while I was waiting alone at "Tong-Poo".

330
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,861
And called a second time after Yuuta came.

331
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,361
Which reminds me, I also called him once

332
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,461
before I went to the restaurant.

333
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:20,261
I did so because I wasn't sure that he was going to show up.

334
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:21,561
Oh, really?

335
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:24,461
Yeah. I heard the phone ring

336
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,561
but couldn't get him on the cell phone.

337
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,861
If you still doubt us,

338
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:31,561
then why don't you check his cell phone to see who called him.

339
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:33,361
Officer Yokomizo.

340
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:36,361
We found a cell phone caught in the net.

341
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:37,961
It seems to have dropped from his clothes.

342
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:38,961
What should we do?

343
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:41,061
Can I take a look at it?

344
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,561
Check it carefully!

345
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,561
Mine should be listed after Yuuta's.

346
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:48,461
According to the records,

347
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:52,461
Mr. Yoshizawa called at 7:02 pm.

348
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:55,261
Mr. Shimojo called three times at 7:47 pm,

349
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,961
8:03 pm and 8:18 pm.

350
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:02,461
And then Mr. Nezu called once at 8:41 pm.

351
00:18:03,761 --> 00:18:07,861
It shows that he only answered your call, exactly as you told me.

352
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:11,661
Which means that the person who took the call

353
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:16,161
was Mr. Aramaki himself or the murderer.

354
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:20,261
But then why didn't he take Mr. Yoshizawa and Mr. Simojo's calls?

355
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,061
How should we know?

356
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:27,061
Now you know that we didn't kill him, right?

357
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,761
It's true.

358
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:31,261
If the one who pressed the button to take the call

359
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:34,661
was Mr. Aramaki himself or the murderer,

360
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:36,661
it would be almost impossible

361
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:40,661
for any of these three persons here to kill him.

362
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,861
But I also think it is highly unlikely

363
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:43,561
that the murderer would take call.

364
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:46,761
And if Mr. Aramaki himself took the call,

365
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:48,761
why didn't he take the calls from Mr. Yoshizawa and Mr. Simojo?

366
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:49,761
It's strange.

367
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,361
And if he took the call to ask for help

368
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:56,261
while being attacked by the murderer,

369
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,461
then why did he hang up the phone without a word?

370
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:05,661
-Hey! Look! Over there! -What?

371
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:09,661
Isn't that the boat we were sailing on this afternoon?

372
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,161
Yeah, it sure is.

373
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:14,561
Hey you, go retrieve the boat right now.

374
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,661
The boat may have something to do with this case.

375
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,161
Yes, sir.

376
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:19,361
Darn.

377
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:24,661
Yeah, that reminds me of the day when our fathers died.

378
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,361
Really. Their ship drifted back to this beach at that time,

379
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,561
just like that boat.

380
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,161
Yeah. Without her crew

381
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:36,661
and with the big hole in the hull.

382
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:39,761
Well, no amount of grieving is gonna bring them back.

383
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,361
So, let's just forget it, Nobutsugu.

384
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,961
Hey, you! What are you doing? Hurry up!

385
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:46,561
Bring the boat over here on the double!

386
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,561
Yes, sir.

387
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:53,561
Why don't you stop barking orders and go help him.

388
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:57,361
Oh, well... That's not my job but my men's.

389
00:19:58,361 --> 00:20:01,661
Hey, don't tell me you can't swim.

390
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:06,461
How could you become a police officer anyway without knowing how to swim?

391
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:09,761
Your hair looks a lot like corals but can't you swim?

392
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:10,761
A coral?

393
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,861
Inside the boat there are a sake bottle and a sandal.

394
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:19,361
The pooled water in the bottom of the boat is seawater.

395
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:22,561
This is...

396
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,761
A button at the bottom of the boat?

397
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:27,861
Hey, if I remember right, the dead body is...

398
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:31,561
Yes... the corpse was only wearing one sandal,

399
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:34,561
and a button was missing from his shirt.

400
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,161
I see.

401
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:38,661
The murderer made must've made Mr. Aramaki drunk

402
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:40,561
and put him on board this boat.

403
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:42,861
Then wrapped him in the net,

404
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,961
threw him overboard and drowned him.

405
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:48,761
About the scratches on his body.

406
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,361
Perhaps he got them when he struggled with the murderer on the boat.

407
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:55,861
But that seems somehow unnatural to me.

408
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:57,161
If I were a murderer,

409
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:58,561
I wouldn't leave evidences like these just lying around,

410
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,561
but would throw them into the sea.

411
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,161
Stupid!

412
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,961
Don't you know that you shouldn't throw the garbage into the sea!

413
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:06,861
It's environmental destruction!

414
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:11,361
Didn't I tell you that's only if I were the murderer?

415
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,161
Conan, are you the murderer?

416
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:16,861
No, I was thinking from the murderer's side.

417
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:20,761
Oh, which side? The good or the bad?

418
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:22,261
Dr. Agasa.

419
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:25,961
Please keep an eye on these kids.

420
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,561
Hey, officer!

421
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:31,361
Can we start going?

422
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,561
Not yet.

423
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:37,561
Then hurry up and find out his estimated time of death.

424
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:41,261
Without that information, we can't figure anything out either.

425
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:43,261
We are working on it now.

426
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:47,961
Don't dump garbage into the sea.

427
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:49,561
A tin can?

428
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:51,961
Oh, really...

429
00:21:55,461 --> 00:21:56,961
Are you all right?

430
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:00,861
I just felt something prick my hand.

431
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,761
Be careful.

432
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:05,861
There are many seashells lying around here.

433
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:07,161
Seashells.

434
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,461
Sir.

435
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:15,161
Were there scratches on the victim's cell phone?

436
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,561
Yes, it was badly scratched.

437
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:19,261
Look.

438
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:22,561
Now I've got it. So, that's what happened.

439
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:27,161
Yet I find it unlikely that the murderer would bet on such a coincidence.

440
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:29,261
So, he must have used a trick of some kind.

441
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:31,661
What is his true intention?

442
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,261
"Next Episode" -I've figured it out.

443
00:24:08,261 --> 00:24:11,761
The trick the killer used to drown that man.

444
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,961
What?

445
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:20,461
I see, that's what happened.

446
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:25,861
That's why that remark was made.

447
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,261
No doubt about it.

448
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:29,161
That person's the killer.

449
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,161
Next Conan,

450
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:35,161
"The Mystery Caught In the Net (Part 2)"

451
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,079
Next Conan's Hint:

452
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,279
"The boat on the sand beach"

453
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,779
Next! The solution of the murder case.

454
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,479
Ai, you're so cute.

455
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,479
Yeah.
