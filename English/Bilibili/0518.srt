1
00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:03.199
The start of the age of mystery.

2
00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:04.999
The detective show on Monday at 7.

3
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.299
The mystery code in Grandpa's diary.

4
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.499
Treasure hunt in Yamaguchi.

5
00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:10.999
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.899
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.399
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:55.121 --> 00:02:00.921
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Investigation Chapter"

9
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.621
This Shrine here, is dedicated to Yoshida Shouin.

10
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.521
The man who trained people who went on to become

11
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.321
the leaders of the Meiji Restoration of Japan.

12
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:12.421
Shouin?

13
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:15.921
He lived 150 years ago.

14
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:17.721
Meiji Regulation?

15
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:21.121
Not regulation! Restoration!

16
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:26.121
Shouin traveled throughout Japan to broaden his knowledge.

17
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:27.421
And because he wanted to change the country,

18
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:30.021
he also studied foreign systems as well.

19
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.021
That was when Japan kept out foreign cultures.

20
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:35.421
He studied Western culture, and, at the risk of his life,

21
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.421
he even tried to stow away to America.

22
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:41.921
But before his wish came true,

23
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:44.421
Shouin was executed.

24
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:48.621
Even so, others adopted Shouin's ambitions.

25
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.321
And his pupils who listened to his teachings

26
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:53.121
and went on to change society!

27
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:54.421
Did you guys get that?

28
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:59.121
Hey, why do all these kids have to come with us

29
00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:01.421
for our Japanese history assignment?

30
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.121
Come on, it's okay.

31
00:03:03.121 --> 00:03:06.321
This is going to be a really fun day.

32
00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:08.821
That should be my line.

33
00:03:10.321 --> 00:03:11.321
What's going on?

34
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:13.121
Give me that!

35
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.521
No! Stop!

36
00:03:15.621 --> 00:03:16.621
No!

37
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.121
Hey you!

38
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.921
What are you doing?

39
00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:23.521
Wait up!

40
00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:27.221
Are you okay?

41
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:41.221
You were threatened?

42
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.221
Yes.

43
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.121
They said, if I don't hand over this diary,

44
00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:45.621
they will harm me.

45
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.221
And if I tell the police, they said I'd be jeopardizing my life.

46
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.921
They told me that several times over the phone.

47
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.021
Do you have an idea who it was?

48
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:55.421
No, I have no idea.

49
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:58.921
It looks like a very old diary.

50
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:02.121
This is a gift from my grandfather.

51
00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:05.921
But there are only riddles and puzzles inside.

52
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.121
Puzzles?

53
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.521
My grandfather loved word games.

54
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.521
And he would write down those in this book.

55
00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:17.021
But before I could get all the answers to the puzzles,

56
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:21.821
my grandfather died five years ago on this day.

57
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:26.221
My grandfather loved Shouin,

58
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.021
that's why I went to the Shrine today.

59
00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:35.021
But why would they want an old diary?

60
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.521
I do not know either.

61
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.921
Mr. Mouri, could you please investigate this for me?

62
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:43.721
Of course, I'll get right to it!

63
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:44.921
What's that?

64
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:47.821
That place that was torn off earlier,

65
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.521
there's something in it.

66
00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.921
What is it?

67
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:53.221
It says, "On November 30th,"

68
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:56.821
"the treasure will be revealed in the sunset."

69
00:04:56.821 --> 00:04:59.421
"Solve the puzzle of the fox"

70
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:01.021
Treasure?

71
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.721
Ms. Kimiko, do you know anything about this?

72
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.221
Treasure... I remember him saying...

73
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:11.321
Kimiko, I have a magnificent treasure

74
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:14.621
that could buy the whole country.

75
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:16.821
Wha... what?

76
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:19.621
Treasure that could buy the country?

77
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.121
So, how many Unagi-bowls can I buy with that?

78
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.321
Why does everything have to be measured with food?

79
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:28.021
But, what is this fox puzzle?

80
00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:30.121
Look at this.

81
00:05:30.921 --> 00:05:33.321
There's a picture of a fox here in this page.

82
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:36.121
"Feed the carps to the fox",

83
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:38.121
what does that mean?

84
00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:39.721
Carps in the moat...

85
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:43.021
maybe it's about my hometown.

86
00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:45.221
Where is that?

87
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:47.921
It's Tsuwano City of the Shimane prefecture.

88
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:49.921
We have to go there at once!

89
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:50.921
Why?

90
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.021
Tomorrow is November 30th!

91
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:58.321
We cannot let this chance pass us! We leave tomorrow morning!

92
00:05:58.321 --> 00:06:02.221
But how are we supposed to get tickets now?

93
00:06:02.221 --> 00:06:04.121
Leave that to me!

94
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:07.121
Sonoko Suzuki is here to help!

95
00:06:07.121 --> 00:06:08.421
I'll use my family's connections,

96
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.221
and whether it's a bullet train or express,

97
00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:13.321
I can get any ticket you need!

98
00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:16.021
That's the power of the daughter of the powerful Suzuki Family.

99
00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:17.021
Yes.

100
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:20.221
And with this case in the hands of me, Kogorou Mouri,

101
00:06:20.221 --> 00:06:23.321
finding that treasure will be a piece of cake!

102
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:28.321
We've got trouble.

103
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.621
That woman has gone to see Detective Kogoro Mouri.

104
00:06:31.621 --> 00:06:35.121
I see, continue to monitor her moves.

105
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:47.721
Thank you for accepting this case.

106
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:49.921
No need to thank me!

107
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:52.721
What does it mean?

108
00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:55.121
"Feed the carps to the fox".

109
00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:57.621
Do you think carp are tasty?

110
00:06:57.621 --> 00:06:59.721
Why do you guys have to tag along, too?

111
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:01.221
Well, we think that's as plain as the nose on your face.

112
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:04.921
We're the ones who saved Ms. Kimiko in the first place!

113
00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:06.421
Jeez...

114
00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:08.521
Writing down puzzles in a diary.

115
00:07:08.521 --> 00:07:11.621
Your grandfather must have been very creative.

116
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:15.721
Yes, he was always thinking about interesting things.

117
00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:19.921
Kimiko, how many stamps

118
00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:24.421
do you need to send a letter to the future?

119
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:26.121
Letter to the future?

120
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:28.921
What is the answer?

121
00:07:30.121 --> 00:07:32.221
He never told me.

122
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:42.121
Shin-Yamaguchi Station!

123
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:47.221
From here we will take the Yamaguchi Line to get to Tsuwano.

124
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:49.221
Kimiko!

125
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:51.021
Kimiko, are you okay?

126
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:52.521
Yes... Yes, I am.

127
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:54.521
Kimiko, who is this?

128
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:57.321
I'm Shigeru Kawaguchi, Kimiko's friend!

129
00:07:57.321 --> 00:08:00.621
I heard about what happened in Tokyo.

130
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:03.621
We were the ones who save her, you know!

131
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:06.721
And we are...

132
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:08.521
The Youth Detective Squad!

133
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:12.221
Good for you, guys.

134
00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:14.521
I owe you for protecting my friend.

135
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:18.221
So, Kimiko, you're going back to Tsuwano, right?

136
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:20.121
Yes... I am...

137
00:08:23.021 --> 00:08:25.421
Ms. Kimiko?

138
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:28.921
Hey, it's me! Nine tickets were enough!

139
00:08:28.921 --> 00:08:31.321
Cancel the rest.

140
00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:37.821
Wow!

141
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.121
I can feel the heat!

142
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:42.121
The smell of it is amazing!

143
00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:44.621
All of you! Get on board this instant!

144
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:45.921
Okay!

145
00:08:47.521 --> 00:08:51.221
"Shin-Yamaguchi to Tsuwano"

146
00:08:55.221 --> 00:08:56.421
For a limited time period,

147
00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:58.221
real steam locomotives service the Yamaguchi Line.

148
00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:00.521
It seems like there are no seats left.

149
00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:03.821
How did you get these tickets?

150
00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:07.621
I have some connections. It's pretty easy.

151
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.321
Is there any hot spring spot?

152
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:12.221
Around here, the Yuda hot springs are famous.

153
00:09:12.221 --> 00:09:16.521
That guy, Shigeru Kawaguchi isn't his real name.

154
00:09:16.521 --> 00:09:17.821
So you noticed?

155
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:22.221
Kimiko's cell phone strap and his pendant are the same.

156
00:09:22.221 --> 00:09:23.821
There are initials engraved in the back of each one.

157
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:27.621
Kimiko's is "K.K" for Kimiko Kobayakawa.

158
00:09:27.621 --> 00:09:29.221
But his says "A.T."

159
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:30.521
If his name is Shiegeru Kawaguchi,

160
00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:32.521
it should be "S.K." right?

161
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:35.521
I wonder why he is hiding his real name.

162
00:09:36.521 --> 00:09:40.221
I have some connections. It's pretty easy.

163
00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:41.421
I'll use my family's connections,

164
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:44.421
and whether it's a bullet train or express,

165
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:46.921
I can get any ticket you need!

166
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:48.621
That means he might be connected

167
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.021
to someone powerful in this area.

168
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.221
What are you trying to do?

169
00:10:06.221 --> 00:10:08.521
Listen to me!

170
00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:10.721
What's the matter?

171
00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:13.021
Oh, I was looking for the bathroom.

172
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:15.221
Oh, it's that way.

173
00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:16.921
Thanks!

174
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:25.621
Tsuwano!

175
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.621
Excuse me, are you Mr. Mouri?

176
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:30.221
Yes, that is me.

177
00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:32.721
Thank you for coming from so far.

178
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:36.621
My name is Tsuneo Kikkawa. I work for the Kobayakawa family.

179
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:38.921
Thank you for waiting on us.

180
00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:41.321
Where is Ms. Kimiko?

181
00:10:41.321 --> 00:10:43.621
She was with us just now.

182
00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.721
Maybe she got kidnapped?

183
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:47.421
I'm here!

184
00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:49.721
I forgot to get a gift for my mother.

185
00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:51.321
I just ran to get something.

186
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:52.421
That's a relief!

187
00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:53.621
It's funny that

188
00:10:53.621 --> 00:10:56.321
I was just in Tokyo, but I'm buying her a gift here.

189
00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:00.121
Where did your friend go?

190
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:02.621
He left already.

191
00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:04.021
Come on, let's go.

192
00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:11.521
Development is our town's future!

193
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:14.021
And I believe everyone knows what I've done for the community.

194
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:15.221
Who is that?

195
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:18.621
His name is Hisamichi Takahashi.

196
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:20.921
He is involved in real estate and construction

197
00:11:20.921 --> 00:11:22.121
around this area.

198
00:11:22.121 --> 00:11:23.421
He has extensive business operations,

199
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:26.021
developing resorts and such.

200
00:11:26.021 --> 00:11:27.721
Now he's announcing his candidacy

201
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.921
as a member of the prefectural assembly.

202
00:11:29.921 --> 00:11:35.021
And this area will be vitalized and life will be better for everyone.

203
00:11:35.021 --> 00:11:37.721
And the one who can do it is me, Hisamichi Takahashi!

204
00:11:37.721 --> 00:11:40.121
And only me, Hisamichi Takahashi!

205
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:42.221
Mr. Takahashi makes me feel safe and secure.

206
00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:45.421
Yes, he's the one who loves this town the most.

207
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:48.921
To think such a splendid father could have a son like that is too bad...

208
00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:51.021
Atsushi, right?

209
00:11:51.021 --> 00:11:54.621
How long is he going to keep acting like a punk?

210
00:11:55.921 --> 00:11:58.721
This is Tonomachi Street.

211
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:02.621
And this is where the ancient samurai houses are still standing.

212
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.721
Wow, look at the size of that carp!

213
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:09.921
In the old days, they were raised as emergency food.

214
00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:13.421
Are we going to feed all the carp to the fox?

215
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:16.421
What are you talking about? This is a puzzle, remember?

216
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:19.021
We're not actually gonna feed them!

217
00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:20.321
I know that bit!

218
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:24.121
Thank you so much.

219
00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:27.821
No need to. I am glad that your daughter is back safe.

220
00:12:27.821 --> 00:12:32.621
Our house was recently robbed too.

221
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:33.621
What?

222
00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:36.821
Maybe they were looking for the diary?

223
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:38.421
Maybe so.

224
00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:44.021
Mr. Mouri, please catch the people who are doing this.

225
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:46.021
Of course.

226
00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:48.521
So, it seems that Ms. Kimiko has heard

227
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:50.721
about this treasure from her grandfather.

228
00:12:50.721 --> 00:12:52.121
Have you heard of this before?

229
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:55.921
Yes, I have heard about it.

230
00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:58.121
I heard that, because of this treasure,

231
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:02.221
the Kobayakawa family was restored after the War.

232
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:08.221
But I know that it wasn't only because of this treasure.

233
00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:10.921
It was by my father's hard work that made it happen.

234
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:14.921
But there are some who don't think so.

235
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:17.521
Especially some people who rose to power in the turmoil

236
00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:19.321
after the Second World War.

237
00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:23.521
Since we've been deeply trusted by the local people historically,

238
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:26.421
they take advantage of every opportunity to get at the Kobayakawa family.

239
00:13:26.421 --> 00:13:31.821
I see, so they might be the ones after the diary.

240
00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:35.921
-We have to find the treasure before they do. -Yes.

241
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:39.021
Can I eat now?

242
00:13:39.021 --> 00:13:41.021
Oh, I'm so sorry!

243
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:42.721
Please go ahead!

244
00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:44.321
Thank you!

245
00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:46.721
It is the sweets from Yamaguchi Prefecture.

246
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:50.521
It is slightly different from the ones in Nagoya.

247
00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:55.521
-It's so good! -It's like jelly!

248
00:13:55.521 --> 00:13:57.721
Mine already gone!

249
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:06.521
To feed the fox the carp means the carp disappear.

250
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:07.621
Mitsuhiko,

251
00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:09.421
can you hand me the copy of this picture?

252
00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:11.421
Yeah, sure.

253
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.821
-Conan? -What's going on?

254
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:19.621
How about this way?

255
00:14:21.221 --> 00:14:23.721
The carp disappeared!

256
00:14:24.621 --> 00:14:26.521
-It's true. -Oh, my...

257
00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:30.921
"Feed the carp" should be about this!

258
00:14:30.921 --> 00:14:35.121
Well, you just folded it.

259
00:14:35.121 --> 00:14:36.921
But look, there are letters.

260
00:14:36.921 --> 00:14:38.021
What?

261
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:41.821
The patterns come together and form letters!

262
00:14:41.821 --> 00:14:45.421
"Below the top of the hidden Inari"?

263
00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:47.121
Inari.

264
00:14:47.121 --> 00:14:49.821
I can only think of the Taikodani Inari Shrine in this area.

265
00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:53.521
That's it! The treasure is at the Taikodani Inari Shrine!

266
00:14:53.521 --> 00:14:55.721
All right, let's go!

267
00:15:09.574 --> 00:15:13.574
This is... an amazing numbers of arches...

268
00:15:13.574 --> 00:15:16.574
Yes, there are almost a thousand arches.

269
00:15:16.574 --> 00:15:18.574
A thousand?

270
00:15:18.574 --> 00:15:21.274
Are we going to walk up there?

271
00:15:21.274 --> 00:15:23.274
We have no choice.

272
00:15:27.974 --> 00:15:29.974
I can't do it!

273
00:15:29.974 --> 00:15:32.774
Come on, Genta!

274
00:15:32.774 --> 00:15:34.974
Just a little more!

275
00:15:43.074 --> 00:15:44.374
We made it!

276
00:15:45.174 --> 00:15:48.374
-It's pretty. -Look at the view!

277
00:15:48.374 --> 00:15:53.974
So what does " Below the top of the hidden Inari" mean?

278
00:15:53.974 --> 00:15:55.374
Hey, what's that?

279
00:15:55.374 --> 00:15:58.974
-Is it food? -Fried tofu?

280
00:15:58.974 --> 00:16:02.074
That is not for eating. It's an offering.

281
00:16:02.074 --> 00:16:05.174
Because fried tofu is the fox's favorite food.

282
00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:07.774
Where do they put them?

283
00:16:07.774 --> 00:16:09.574
Are you planning to steal them?

284
00:16:09.574 --> 00:16:11.474
You'll get punished!

285
00:16:11.474 --> 00:16:14.474
I'm just asking!

286
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.374
They either put it at the main building,

287
00:16:17.374 --> 00:16:20.274
or in the shrine at the back.

288
00:16:20.274 --> 00:16:24.174
Maybe that's the hidden Inari?

289
00:16:28.274 --> 00:16:30.074
Here?

290
00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:32.874
I don't see anything.

291
00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:35.274
I found the fried tofu!

292
00:16:35.274 --> 00:16:37.774
Now you know you can't get them.

293
00:16:37.774 --> 00:16:41.274
-I said I'm not! -This is awesome.

294
00:16:41.274 --> 00:16:43.474
Hey guys, look at this!

295
00:16:43.474 --> 00:16:46.574
So many foxes in there!

296
00:16:46.574 --> 00:16:47.874
You're right.

297
00:16:47.874 --> 00:16:49.874
It's cool.

298
00:16:49.874 --> 00:16:54.074
I know! The hidden Inari is around here!

299
00:16:54.074 --> 00:16:56.674
No, not there, it's here.

300
00:17:00.074 --> 00:17:03.274
This is the hidden Inari.

301
00:17:03.274 --> 00:17:06.474
Now, "Below the top of the hidden Inari"

302
00:17:06.474 --> 00:17:09.774
There is a fried tofu figure made of stone.

303
00:17:09.774 --> 00:17:11.574
Fried tofu?

304
00:17:11.574 --> 00:17:14.274
I got it! The kanji that means "Top"

305
00:17:14.274 --> 00:17:16.174
also could translate to the meaning of fried tofu.

306
00:17:16.174 --> 00:17:20.474
So the treasure should be under the fried tofu made of stone!

307
00:17:20.474 --> 00:17:24.574
-Awesome, Mitsuhiko! -You are a genius!

308
00:17:24.574 --> 00:17:26.674
Thanks, guys!

309
00:17:28.874 --> 00:17:30.174
A jar?

310
00:17:30.974 --> 00:17:32.874
What's in there?

311
00:17:32.874 --> 00:17:36.874
Well, there is some kind of paper.

312
00:17:36.874 --> 00:17:38.874
This is...

313
00:17:38.874 --> 00:17:40.574
It looks like a map.

314
00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:42.974
There's something written on the top!

315
00:17:42.974 --> 00:17:44.674
What does it say?

316
00:17:44.674 --> 00:17:46.674
"Reflect the castle in the eye of the cat"

317
00:17:46.674 --> 00:17:49.174
"and look under the mouse."

318
00:17:49.174 --> 00:17:50.774
What does that mean?

319
00:17:50.774 --> 00:17:52.674
A cat...

320
00:17:53.274 --> 00:17:55.974
It should be about this.

321
00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:58.474
I see holes in it.

322
00:17:58.474 --> 00:18:01.874
Not a mouse in any of the pages.

323
00:18:01.874 --> 00:18:04.274
Another puzzle, huh?

324
00:18:04.274 --> 00:18:09.374
This seems like the old map of the city of Hagi.

325
00:18:09.374 --> 00:18:12.374
Hagi is in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

326
00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:17.274
Yes, the city is linked to Shouin whom my grandfather adored.

327
00:18:17.274 --> 00:18:21.574
I see, so the treasure should be in Hagi.

328
00:18:22.374 --> 00:18:25.674
I see. They are headed for Hagi.

329
00:18:25.674 --> 00:18:29.074
Stay with them, you hear me?

330
00:18:33.474 --> 00:18:35.674
Where is Kimiko?

331
00:18:36.774 --> 00:18:39.174
I'm coming!

332
00:18:48.474 --> 00:18:50.874
It feels like a very old town.

333
00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:54.374
They have preserved the town as it is was like in the old days.

334
00:18:54.374 --> 00:18:57.174
So you can even walk through the town

335
00:18:57.174 --> 00:18:59.674
even if you had a map from the Edo Period!

336
00:18:59.674 --> 00:19:01.274
That is marvelous!

337
00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:03.874
The many people who were involved in the Meiji Restoration

338
00:19:03.874 --> 00:19:06.174
have also seen this same view today.

339
00:19:06.174 --> 00:19:09.474
That's right! This is where the Meiji Restoration all began!

340
00:19:09.474 --> 00:19:11.874
Here we go. The Meiji Reservation.

341
00:19:11.874 --> 00:19:14.074
Restoration!

342
00:19:14.074 --> 00:19:16.874
That's the reform that gave Japan its chance

343
00:19:16.874 --> 00:19:19.174
to become a modern country like it is today.

344
00:19:19.174 --> 00:19:22.074
Many people who were involved in the Meiji Restoration

345
00:19:22.074 --> 00:19:24.074
were from Hagi.

346
00:19:24.074 --> 00:19:25.474
I see!

347
00:19:25.474 --> 00:19:27.974
"Hagi Museum East Entrance"

348
00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:31.574
The Cat Street?

349
00:19:32.274 --> 00:19:34.374
Does this have anything to do with that code?

350
00:19:34.374 --> 00:19:40.174
About 250 streets are named like that.

351
00:19:40.174 --> 00:19:43.474
This street is named after a person who was close to Terumoto Mouri,

352
00:19:43.474 --> 00:19:46.574
and since he was fond of cats,

353
00:19:46.574 --> 00:19:48.874
they called it the Cat Street.

354
00:19:50.074 --> 00:19:52.074
Look! A real cat!

355
00:19:52.074 --> 00:19:56.774
Oh, kitty cat! I know, I got it!

356
00:19:56.774 --> 00:19:59.174
You mean you solved the puzzle?

357
00:19:59.174 --> 00:20:00.274
Yes!

358
00:20:00.274 --> 00:20:03.574
They meant the white walls, not the castle!

359
00:20:03.574 --> 00:20:06.774
That means that one of these cats is watching a wall

360
00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:10.774
which will point out where the treasure is!

361
00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:14.074
And that cat right there is looking at it right...

362
00:20:14.074 --> 00:20:16.274
Wait! Please wait, Kitty!

363
00:20:16.274 --> 00:20:19.174
I'm very sure that he is wrong.

364
00:20:19.174 --> 00:20:22.474
Mr. Mouri sure has a sense of humor.

365
00:20:22.474 --> 00:20:25.174
The problem is that he's dead serious.

366
00:20:29.974 --> 00:20:33.374
That was the guy who called himself Shigeru Kawaguchi?

367
00:20:38.274 --> 00:20:40.474
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

368
00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:42.474
But...

369
00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:44.774
It is him.

370
00:20:45.974 --> 00:20:47.274
That man...

371
00:20:49.674 --> 00:20:52.074
The guy who attacked Kimiko!

372
00:20:53.674 --> 00:20:57.074
This is where the doctor in the Edo period named Shusuke Aoki

373
00:20:57.074 --> 00:20:58.674
was living.

374
00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:01.374
They say that they found treasure buried here.

375
00:21:01.374 --> 00:21:03.274
You know well!

376
00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:05.074
Really?

377
00:21:05.074 --> 00:21:08.574
Yes, they say that they found it from under the cellar.

378
00:21:08.574 --> 00:21:10.774
Treasure!

379
00:21:11.474 --> 00:21:13.274
There is a treasure, I'm sure!

380
00:21:13.274 --> 00:21:14.674
I think so too!

381
00:21:14.674 --> 00:21:16.074
I'm getting excited!

382
00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.874
Me too!

383
00:21:18.874 --> 00:21:21.774
Now, let's head to the Hagi Castle!

384
00:21:28.774 --> 00:21:33.274
What does Shigeru have to do with those men?

385
00:21:33.274 --> 00:21:35.674
And who is he exactly?

386
00:21:38.474 --> 00:21:40.974
-Hurry up! -Be quiet!

387
00:21:40.974 --> 00:21:44.374
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

388
00:21:44.374 --> 00:21:46.774
-The keys! -You little brat!

389
00:21:46.774 --> 00:21:49.274
Police! This way! Come quick!

390
00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:51.074
Hurry up! We're moving!

391
00:21:52.974 --> 00:21:54.474
Mitsuhiko!

392
00:21:55.274 --> 00:21:56.774
What's going on?

393
00:21:56.774 --> 00:21:57.974
Thanks!

394
00:22:04.574 --> 00:22:05.974
You're not getting away!

395
00:22:13.174 --> 00:22:14.974
Crack!

396
00:22:14.974 --> 00:22:18.074
No, I didn't think they would go this far.

397
00:22:18.074 --> 00:22:21.674
I didn't pay enough attention.

398
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:25.874
Is there really a treasure that could buy a country?

399
00:22:25.874 --> 00:22:31.274
And who are those men?

400
00:22:31.274 --> 00:22:32.774
And that voice...

401
00:22:32.774 --> 00:22:35.374
Police! This way! Come quick!

402
00:22:35.374 --> 00:22:37.774
I know that voice, and it is...

403
00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:02.674
We have the girl and the children.

404
00:24:02.674 --> 00:24:05.374
Find that treasure or else!

405
00:24:07.674 --> 00:24:08.774
Conan?

406
00:24:08.774 --> 00:24:09.974
Mitsuhiko?

407
00:24:10.674 --> 00:24:12.374
Mitsuhiko!

408
00:24:12.374 --> 00:24:15.474
"Draw the map in the cave where the water goblin lives."

409
00:24:15.474 --> 00:24:18.574
Where is this cave?

410
00:24:18.574 --> 00:24:21.074
We have to hurry.

411
00:24:21.074 --> 00:24:24.474
We only have time until sunset!

412
00:24:24.474 --> 00:24:26.074
Next Conan,

413
00:24:26.074 --> 00:24:29.974
"The Meiji Restoration Mystery Tour: Deciphering Chapter"

414
00:24:40.774 --> 00:24:42.874
Next Conan's Hint:

415
00:24:42.874 --> 00:24:45.174
"Cat"

416
00:24:45.174 --> 00:24:46.974
Meow! Treasure discovered in the next episode!

417
00:24:46.974 --> 00:24:48.374
How many servings of broiled eel on rice will I be able to eat?

418
00:24:48.374 --> 00:24:49.974
One-track mind.
