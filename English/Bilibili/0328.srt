1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,740
The rhythm of the wind sharpens the skill of deduction.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,740
Alibis and tricks are unraveled.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,740
The fragrance of murder and the blotches

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,940
of a love affair in a glass of wine.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,540
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,440
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,540
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:45,067
Yes, who is it?

9
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,667
It's Ran Mouri.

10
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,167
Okay. One moment.

11
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,267
What's up, Ran?

12
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:53,567
Yuki,

13
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,367
thanks for the books.

14
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:57,467
How did you like it?

15
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:00,667
Well. My heart was pounding excitedly from beginning to end.

16
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,967
So, you thought so, too?

17
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:02,967
"Yuki Kojima (20)" -You came all this way

18
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:04,667
just to return it to me?

19
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,467
Thank you.

20
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,467
No, well not really.

21
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:11,667
I was on my way to a restaurant with my father and family

22
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:12,867
so I just dropped by on the way.

23
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:16,867
Hello. Thank you for being nice to my daughter always.

24
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,767
No, I've done nothing. Thank you.

25
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,567
Hey, Kojima.

26
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,067
"Junji Togashi (22)" -Which plate should I put out?

27
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,467
Please wait.

28
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,467
Oh, that's right.

29
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,067
We're holding a birthday party for a friend now.

30
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,867
Why don't you all join us, Ran?

31
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,267
But...

32
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:35,067
Please do so by all means.

33
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,467
There are only going to be three of my university friends,

34
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:39,467
so you don't have to be hesitant.

35
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:42,467
Besides, being able to meet the renowned Detective Mouri

36
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:45,067
is a birthday present that can't be beaten.

37
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,267
Ran, if it's okay with you, right?

38
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,167
Dad!

39
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:54,367
I'll bet all you want to do is get free booze.

40
00:02:55,767 --> 00:03:01,467
"Mystery of the Birthday Wine"

41
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:09,167
Yuki.

42
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,867
Where shall I put this?

43
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:13,867
Can you put it in the kitchen for now?

44
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:14,967
Okay.

45
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,067
Oh, my. Are you okay?

46
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,167
Yes, I'm fine.

47
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:39,667
I'm sorry. This chair is a little broken.

48
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:43,167
The chair that Keiko, the star of today sits on goes way inside, right?

49
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:47,567
Yes. And will you put your bag in the kitchen?

50
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,467
It's kind of in the way here.

51
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:51,667
Okay, right away, madam.

52
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,267
Are you really okay?

53
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,667
You're not hurt, are you?

54
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,867
Yes, I'm fine.

55
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:59,767
Yuki, is there anything else you'd like me to do?

56
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,467
No, I guess that's it.

57
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,967
I'm sorry to have made you help me.

58
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,667
No problem at all.

59
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,567
That chair's broken, Togashi.

60
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,567
No problem, because I'll sit in it.

61
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,867
-It's Keiko and the others. -Yes.

62
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:22,967
Coming!

63
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,567
"Keiko Sawaguchi(20)" -Good evening.

64
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,667
We've been waiting for you, Keiko.

65
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,267
Hello.

66
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:32,467
-Hi, thanks for coming. -Hi there, you're late.

67
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,267
Sorry, the roads were jammed.

68
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:38,067
Keiko, I'll go park the car then.

69
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,367
Okay.

70
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:43,067
Keiko, has the day you're going abroad as an exchange student been decided?

71
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,167
I'm leaving next week Tuesday.

72
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,267
So, I'm sort of busy with this and that.

73
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,467
You mean, you're leaving that soon?

74
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,467
Mr. Mouri, please move a bit more to the left.

75
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,867
You mean like so?

76
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,867
Yes, okay. Here goes. One plus two is...

77
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,167
Three...

78
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:04,367
I'm so happy to be able to take a snapshot

79
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,167
with the renowned Detective Kogoro Mouri.

80
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,867
Huh? The glass cups are already out here.

81
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:15,567
Yes. Nonaka, will you get the thing out?

82
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:17,867
"Kasuki Nonaka (22)" -Huh? Oh, right.

83
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:23,467
This is my gift to you!

84
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,467
I bought it when I went to Germany some time ago.

85
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,367
Just for your birthday.

86
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,067
It wasn't cheap, you know.

87
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:31,067
Thanks so much!

88
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:34,067
Hey, I dished out my half for it too, you know.

89
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,167
Oh, you did?

90
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,267
First, for the birthday girl.

91
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,667
Thank you.

92
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,967
I hope you like it.

93
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,267
Thank you.

94
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,867
Nice color.

95
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:55,767
Hey, Nonaka, leave some for me, too.

96
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,867
Shoots, there's still some more left.

97
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:00,367
Here you go.

98
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,067
Like they say, "Save the best for last".

99
00:06:04,867 --> 00:06:06,167
Just enough.

100
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,967
Here's a toast to our dear friend,

101
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:11,767
Keiko Sawaguchi's 20th birthday,

102
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:14,867
as well as her study trip abroad to the States.

103
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:15,867
Cheers!

104
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,467
Cheers...

105
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:18,867
Thank you!

106
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,967
It's delicious.

107
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:27,567
Really. It's so refreshing.

108
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,267
This is really good!

109
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,267
Everybody, please don't forget

110
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:38,467
I dished out half the cash.

111
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,667
Just what do you think you're doing, Togashi?

112
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,967
Sorry, sorry!

113
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:52,767
I'd completely forgotten about this chair.

114
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:55,067
Keiko, it didn't spill on your clothes, did it?

115
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,367
I think I'm fine.

116
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,867
I spilt the wine of the birthday girl.

117
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,667
The bottle's already empty too,

118
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:03,467
so if you want my drink, you can have it.

119
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:04,867
Go ahead and pass it around.

120
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,567
-Nonaka. -Yes.

121
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,467
I tell you, you're hopeless, Togashi.

122
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,267
I'm sorry, please bear with that.

123
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,467
Okay. Thank you.

124
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:20,967
I almost forgot the cake.

125
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,167
Yes, I'll bring it.

126
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:24,167
Oh, will you please.

127
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,867
"Happy Birthday, Keiko"

128
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,267
Ready?

129
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,167
I'm going to turn out the lights.

130
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,867
Go ahead, Keiko.

131
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,267
Happy birthday!

132
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:46,767
Happy birthday.

133
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,367
It's really good.

134
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,167
-All set. -Okay, I'll cut the cake, then.

135
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,567
Keiko?

136
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,467
Keiko, what's the matter?

137
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,267
Keiko, what the matter? Get a hold of yourself!

138
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,967
Keiko!

139
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,067
Keiko?

140
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:25,167
Ran, get the ambulance!

141
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,967
-Okay. -Get the police, too.

142
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,667
Okay.

143
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:33,767
Stay back! Don't touch anything on the table!

144
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:42,767
Inspector, poison was found

145
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:46,567
from the cup that the victim drank out of after all.

146
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,867
And what about the other glass cups?

147
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:53,567
No poison was detected from the other four glass cups

148
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:56,067
or the empty wine bottle.

149
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,867
And on the cup that was used by the victim, Ms. Sawaguchi,

150
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:02,967
her fingerprints, as well as those of Mr. Togashi,

151
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:06,367
Mr. Nonaka and Ms. Kojima were also found.

152
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:07,867
The fingerprints of all four people?

153
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,667
I see.

154
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,267
The glass cup that Ms. Sawaguchi drank from

155
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:17,767
was the one that Mr. Togashi had passed around

156
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:20,467
to Ms. Kojima and Mr. Nonaka,

157
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:23,767
and finally passed around to Ms. Sawaguchi, the victim.

158
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,667
If you want my drink, you can have it.

159
00:09:25,667 --> 00:09:26,967
Go ahead and pass it around.

160
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,867
-Nonaka. -Yes.

161
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:34,867
I tell you, you're hopeless, Togashi.

162
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:39,367
-Yes. -And who opened the wine bottle?

163
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:40,467
It's me.

164
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,167
I pulled the cork off the bottle.

165
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,367
Then, I poured wine for Keiko, the birthday girl,

166
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,567
the guest, Mr. Mouri,

167
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:50,167
Yuki and myself.

168
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:53,267
Then I finally took the bottle from Nonaka

169
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,467
and poured wine for myself.

170
00:09:57,267 --> 00:10:03,367
Inspector, maybe someone had put poison in the glass cup beforehand?

171
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:06,767
But Mr. Togashi, you said that you took a sip of wine from your glass

172
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,567
before you gave it to the victim, didn't you?

173
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,667
Yes.

174
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,867
And how do you feel?

175
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:17,867
Just fine.

176
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:24,667
Then, the poison must've been inserted after he drank the wine.

177
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:28,567
Maybe he just pretended to drink and didn't.

178
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,567
He drank out of his cup for sure.

179
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,167
I saw him drink after the toast.

180
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,167
Shut up, kid.

181
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:40,867
If there were ice cubes in the cup,

182
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:44,867
then maybe poison could've been put in the ice cubes beforehand.

183
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:49,467
I don't think people ever drink wine on the rocks.

184
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,267
True.

185
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:56,167
And after he took a sip, Mr. Togashi gave that cup of wine to who?

186
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:59,467
Me, and I gave it to Mr. Nonaka.

187
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:02,167
He couldn't have put poison in the cup

188
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,867
since everybody was watching.

189
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,167
I see.

190
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,567
I was watching him, too.

191
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,067
Inspector,

192
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,567
when Ms. Sawaguchi blew out the candles,

193
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,767
the room was dark for an instant.

194
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:16,967
I see.

195
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,467
If then, I guess poison could've been put in.

196
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,167
I see. If then, maybe it would've been possible.

197
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:32,067
Inspector Megure, how about having everyone take their seats again?

198
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,267
You want to replay the scene of the crime?

199
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,767
Will you help us out, everyone?

200
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:37,967
Yes.

201
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:40,967
Sure thing.

202
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,367
Let's start, then.

203
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:48,067
So, you all sat in this order?

204
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,167
Yes, that's right.

205
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:54,167
So, the glass cup that the victim received from Mr. Togashi goes here?

206
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:56,167
Is this correct?

207
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,267
Yes.

208
00:11:57,267 --> 00:12:00,167
I put it there, so there's no mistake about it.

209
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:02,667
After that, the candles were blown out,

210
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,267
the room got dark,

211
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:08,167
and the lights were switched back on again right away?

212
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,467
I turned the lights back on with that switch over there.

213
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,967
How long was it pitch dark?

214
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,467
I think it was no more than 4 to 5 seconds,

215
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,267
because I got up and turned on the lights

216
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:25,167
right after the candles were all blown out.

217
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,267
Do you all agree?

218
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:28,667
Well...

219
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,867
I think so, too.

220
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,667
Then, the answer is simple.

221
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,667
The only one who could pour poison in the cup

222
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,967
within a period of 4 to 5 seconds

223
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,567
would be the one who was sitting to the right of the victim.

224
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,567
That is the one who was nearest to the cup.

225
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,567
No one other than you, Mr. Nonaka!

226
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,867
Dad.

227
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:47,567
It... it doesn't have to me.

228
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,967
Even Yuki could've reached the glass if she leaned over.

229
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,467
Why should I do something like that?

230
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:55,567
Inspector, it's true that from where Ms. Kojima was seated,

231
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,967
she could've done so, too.

232
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,367
Oh, no.

233
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,367
I couldn't have done it.

234
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:08,067
I'd have to climb over to the table or something to reach the cup.

235
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,367
Or, you went around behind everybody,

236
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:12,367
came all the way here

237
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:15,267
and went back to turn on the lights.

238
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:21,467
No, 4 to 5 seconds isn't enough time.

239
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,067
Even if it were dark,

240
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,867
I'm sure somebody would've sensed you do so if you did.

241
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:30,967
Which means that Mr. Togashi couldn't have done it after all.

242
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:34,367
Inspector. I guess it would be safe to say

243
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,667
that the killer is either Mr. Nonaka or Ms. Kojima.

244
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,167
Yes.

245
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,167
No.

246
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,267
Why...

247
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:47,367
why did that person take such a strange attitude?

248
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,267
Wait a second. If that method is used...

249
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:00,767
I got it.

250
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:03,767
I figured out the method of how the poison was put inside the cup.

251
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:11,789
Inspector Megure.

252
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:16,889
I checked the belongings of the three.

253
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,689
And found this is in Mr. Nonaka's bag.

254
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,889
Just what is it?

255
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,489
That's the bottle that I...

256
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:28,789
There could be poison inside.

257
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,789
We'll check it out right away.

258
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:32,289
Please do.

259
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:35,689
So, Mr. Nonaka.

260
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:37,789
Will you please explain the bottle that we just found?

261
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:39,489
I know nothing about it.

262
00:14:39,489 --> 00:14:41,989
That's my bag all right,

263
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,389
but it's the first time I've ever seen that tiny bottle.

264
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:47,189
That's what they all say,

265
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:51,189
"I know nothing of it. It's the first time I've seen it".

266
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:53,089
Officer Takagi!

267
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,189
What is it, Conan?

268
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,389
There is one thing...

269
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:59,889
What? The same thing?

270
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,789
Yes, sir. As to the detailed substance,

271
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,389
I'll go back to headquarters and analyze it.

272
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:06,689
This was found in Ms. Sawaguchi's glass

273
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,989
and this was found in the tiny bottle.

274
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:12,289
The reaction of both is exactly the same.

275
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:16,989
Mr. Nonaka, we'd like to hear more details from you so.

276
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:18,689
I... I didn't do it!

277
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,889
Somebody stuck the stuff into my bag!

278
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:23,089
Please calm down, Mr. Nonaka!

279
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,589
Please come with me to the station!

280
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,289
No good.

281
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,889
Please hear me out, inspector!

282
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:30,589
I've never seen that bottle, honestly!

283
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:32,189
Please believe me!

284
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:42,889
Please wait, inspector!

285
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:45,389
What is it, Mouri?

286
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:46,889
Inspector.

287
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:48,889
Hey, that pose?

288
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,489
That's the Sleeping Kogoro.

289
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:55,189
I've figured out who the real killer is, inspector.

290
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:56,889
Real killer?

291
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,289
He's not the one?

292
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,889
Are you saying that it's her?

293
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:02,989
I didn't...

294
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,789
No. It's not her.

295
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,289
Then, is it Mr. Togashi?

296
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:10,789
But Dad, I thought you said he didn't have the chance

297
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:13,089
to insert the poison just a while ago, didn't you?

298
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,989
No, the poison was not inserted afterwards,

299
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,689
but rather, was in the glass, to begin with.

300
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,789
Cut it out. I drank out of the cup myself,

301
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,989
but I'm alive and kicking as you can see for yourself.

302
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:27,489
That's just it, Mr. Togashi!

303
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:31,589
That's the very reason why I was suspicious of you to start with.

304
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:32,889
What?

305
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,989
When someone who drank the same wine as you

306
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,389
starts to suffer in agony,

307
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,689
even if you didn't drink the poison,

308
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,689
you would be worried nonetheless

309
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,889
and get sick for real.

310
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:48,189
I see. Come to think of it, that's true.

311
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:50,989
But, you acted differently.

312
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:53,689
Ms. Sawaguchi drank the poison

313
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:56,589
and collapsed right before your eyes, yet you...

314
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:00,489
No, I'm fine.

315
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:06,489
You were completely sure that you didn't drink the poison.

316
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:07,989
Why?

317
00:17:07,989 --> 00:17:14,489
Because you're the one who used a trick to poison Ms. Sawaguchi.

318
00:17:14,489 --> 00:17:17,789
So, there's no mistake about it, Mr. Togashi.

319
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:21,689
Cut out the gibberish!

320
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:23,989
If the poison was in there, to begin with,

321
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,689
I would've been poisoned, too.

322
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:28,689
Right, Yuki?

323
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:35,189
Just a while ago, Conan found one empty container of gum syrup

324
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:38,889
from the basket in the kitchen.

325
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:43,289
The thing is, the murder is possible if gum syrup is used.

326
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:45,889
Even if the poisoned wine were to be drunk,

327
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:50,389
the first sip can be drunk without drinking the poison.

328
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:53,089
Is... is that true, Mr. Mouri?

329
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:56,789
Yes. First, gum syrup is put into the glass,

330
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:00,989
then the poison, and the liquid is stirred.

331
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:03,389
Back then, in one of the five glasses

332
00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:05,889
that Mr. Togashi brought from the kitchen,

333
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:09,989
gum syrup was inside.

334
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:14,089
The bottom part of that glass was colored.

335
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:17,889
Therefore, there was no worry of anyone noticing it.

336
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,489
I see.

337
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:24,589
Moreover, he poured the wine in slowly.

338
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:26,589
Even if you pour wine over the gum syrup

339
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:28,189
which is heavier than the wine,

340
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:31,289
they won't mix and the wine stays on top of the gum syrup.

341
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:34,989
In other words, the poison won't mix with the wine.

342
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,789
I see.

343
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,389
It's the same principle as when you put gum syrup into iced coffee

344
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:42,689
and it sinks to the bottom of the cup.

345
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:44,889
Then, after the toast,

346
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,789
Mr. Togashi drank the wine for everyone to see.

347
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,289
After which he deliberately tipped over Ms. Sawaguchi's wine glass.

348
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:55,389
By giving her his own glass,

349
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:59,689
he made her drink the poison that was at the bottom of the glass cup.

350
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,189
Togashi!

351
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:04,189
No, it's not me.

352
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:07,789
Mr. Mouri, all you just said is based only on assumption!

353
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:10,689
Do you have any proof that I did it?

354
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:14,389
Did you get the fingerprints I asked you for, Officer Tome?

355
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:19,689
Yes. There were no fingerprints on the sides of the bottle.

356
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:24,789
But, Conan's fingerprints were found on the bottom of the bottle.

357
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,089
What?

358
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:27,789
Before the party started,

359
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,989
I goofed and turned your bag upside down, Mr. Togashi.

360
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:35,689
And at that time, a bottle just like that one came rolling out

361
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:38,389
so I put it right back into the bag.

362
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,989
Like this, so it wouldn't drop.

363
00:19:40,989 --> 00:19:43,189
Huh? But, it's strange.

364
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,989
I put it back inside Mr. Togashi's bag

365
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:49,289
and yet, why is it in Mr. Nonaka's camera bag?

366
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:54,889
Conan, thank you. There's nothing strange about it.

367
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:56,489
Why not?

368
00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:00,589
Because he sneaked that bottle into Mr. Nonaka's bag.

369
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:05,389
Mr. Togashi, isn't it right?

370
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:11,489
Mr. Togashi, you must've worked very carefully

371
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,589
not to leave your fingerprints behind.

372
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:19,389
That's why you didn't bother to wipe off the fingerprints at the end.

373
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,289
I used to date Keiko 2 years ago.

374
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:33,589
She kept on asking me to get her expensive presents during that time.

375
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,589
I kept giving her stuff despite having to go into debt.

376
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:40,989
Then, in the end, that darn woman had the nerve to switch over to Nonaka.

377
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,689
She dumped me as if I were a worn-out rag or something.

378
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:49,989
I've been waiting for today.

379
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:53,689
Her 20th birthday.

380
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:57,689
I planned it out carefully to poison Keiko

381
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:04,489
and then schemed to frame you, Nonaka, up as the killer.

382
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:45,789
"Mouri Detective Agency"

383
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:47,889
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

384
00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:49,589
Dad!

385
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:52,689
Sonoko came back from Germany yesterday

386
00:22:52,689 --> 00:22:54,489
and she brought a bottle of wine as a souvenir.

387
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:55,689
Would you like to drink it?

388
00:22:55,689 --> 00:22:57,789
Wine?

389
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:59,889
Sure!

390
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:09,189
It sure is good!

391
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,189
I'm so lucky that it tastes just like the one we had last week.

392
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:16,589
-Ran... -What?

393
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:20,389
Oh, you're right.

394
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:24,389
Well... expensive things sure suit my taste buds.

395
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:28,989
I made a mistake and gave him the cheap wine I got at a shop nearby.

396
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:32,289
Cheers!

397
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:34,389
Who cares? Since he seems to be enjoying himself.

398
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:41,189
Cheap stuff is just the thing for Pops' taste buds.

399
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:48,489
"Next Episode"

400
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:51,289
Then, when you passed here about 7 pm,

401
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:54,289
there was nobody lying on the road?

402
00:23:54,289 --> 00:23:55,989
A bicycle?

403
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:58,089
This is...

404
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:00,289
Let's go see the place

405
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:03,589
where you all say you were watching the fireworks.

406
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:07,089
There are bicycle wheel traces near the broken fence.

407
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:13,489
Next Conan, "Friendship Torn Apart (Part 1)"

408
00:24:14,057 --> 00:24:16,757
Next Conan's Hint:

409
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:18,557
"Sunroof"

410
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,157
In the next episode, we'll get to hear Ran's witty quote!

411
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:21,857
A great deduction after a week's rest.

412
00:24:21,857 --> 00:24:23,503
It's a story of friendship.
