Tutankhamun.

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,970
The Sphinx.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,820
The Rosetta Stone.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,420
And finally...

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,580
The Screaming Mummy.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,010
Ancient Egypt sure is mysterious.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,010
But isn't everything on
display here a replica?

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,640
Why did we bother coming to this
museum on the way home from school?

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,130
Curious?

13
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,270
We're here...

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,280
For these!

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,530
These Egyptian god keychains are super
popular among our classmates right now.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,090
And you can only buy them here.

17
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,830
That's right.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,600
Super popular, huh?

19
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,780
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,890
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,520
The mystery of the cursed statue
returns to life at the museum!

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,610
Always determining the one truth

23
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,290
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,920
his name is Detective Conan!

25
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,600
The Cursed Museum

26
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,850
The Cursed Museum
"The Cursed Museum!"

27
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,910
The Cursed Museum

28
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,170
This one's good, but it's
hard to say no to this one.

29
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,420
Oolong Tea

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,200
Don't you think this one's cute, too?

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,560
Hey, not bad.

32
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,550
Hey, not bad.
I doubt we'll be leaving for a while.

33
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,640
I doubt we'll be leaving for a while.
Right?

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
I doubt we'll be leaving for a while.

35
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,930
What's this?

36
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,080
A notebook?

37
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,690
Ah, they have guests write
reviews and requests in here.

38
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,690
Some of the reviews are quite
harsh, but they're quite helpful.

39
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,200
Uh...

40
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,530
Oh, excuse me.

41
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:43,580
Oh, excuse me.
Kowata Ken (56)
Museum Director

42
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,950
Kowata Ken (56)
Museum Director
I'm Kowata, the director of the
Ancient Oriental Culture Museum.

43
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm Kowata, the director of the
Ancient Oriental Culture Museum.

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,460
Nice to meet you.

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,460
So it's his taste that's
reflected in this place.

46
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,010
We'll be closing soon, but
enjoy yourself until then.

47
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,130
Kids are very welcome here.

48
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,400
Closed

49
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,900
Okay, I'm getting this one.

50
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,400
Anubis is mine.

51
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,410
They finally made up their minds.

52
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,320
Excuse me.

53
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,530
Have you made up your minds?

54
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,640
Yes.

55
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
We'd like these, please.

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,560
Sure thing.

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,460
Oh...

58
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,290
Ishikawa-kun, could you handle the register?

59
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,660
Ishikawa-kun, could you handle the register?
Ishikawa Takuto (25)
Museum Employee

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,030
Ishikawa Takuto (25)
Museum Employee
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,460
Ishikawa Takuto (25)
Museum Employee

62
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,960
This way, please.

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,940
Okay.

64
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,280
What was that?

65
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,550
What was that sound?

66
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,060
Conan-kun!

67
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,500
Conan-kun, what's wrong?

68
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,070
C-Could it be?

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,700
Ran-neechan, call the police.

70
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,070
Got it.

71
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,460
It's the curse.

72
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,170
It's Anubis' curse.

73
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,230
Hey, Detective Takagi.

74
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,740
Was this an accident or a murder?

75
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,340
We don't know yet.

76
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,940
It's the curse.

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,030
It's clearly Anubis' curse.

78
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,300
What curse?

79
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,610
Look at the object he's
holding in his right hand.

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,830
A-A feather?

81
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,060
Is that an ostrich feather?

82
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,390
Indeed it is.

83
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,840
Wh-What's so special about ostrich feathers?

84
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,370
The Book of the Dead.

85
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,260
That's right.

86
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,090
Th-The Book of the Dead?

87
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,220
The Book of the Dead is a
guidebook to the afterlife.

88
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,760
It describes how the dead
reach the afterlife.

89
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,480
What does that have to
do with ostrich feathers?

90
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,980
The dead are judged after their death.

91
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,740
Their own heart is placed
on one side of Ra's scales.

92
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,580
An ostrich feather is
placed on the other side.

93
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,750
If the deceased's heart is tainted by
sin, the scales tip out of balance.

94
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,400
If the deceased is judged innocent,
the way to the afterlife opens to them.

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:51,060
However, if they're guilty, the
beast Ammit consumes their soul.

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,390
And presiding over that judgment is...

97
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:05,020
God of the Underworld and
mummification, Anubis.

98
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
I've heard about this.

99
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,630
A bunch of archaeologists
died mysterious deaths.

100
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,830
That's the curse of the pharaohs.

101
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,330
Anubis must've judged this person guilty.

102
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,260
Does that mean Anubis is the culprit?

103
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:30,340
Does that mean the Anubis statue happened
to fall as the victim was passing by it?

104
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,160
Don't you think it's odd, though?

105
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,600
There's a wound on the back of his head.

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,430
Yes. Forensics said further investigation
is required to determine

107
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,330
if he got that when he was
struck by the falling statue.

108
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,780
Then what about that broken pedestal?

109
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,550
The broken leg is a different
color from the other ones.

110
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,620
You're right.

111
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,260
Was only this leg made using a weaker wood?

112
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,650
Which means after a certain
amount of time had passed,

113
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,910
the wood could no longer bear the weight
of the statue, causing it to fall.

114
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,850
It's an improvised timer.

115
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,180
In other words, the culprit could've rigged
this in order to fabricate an alibi.

116
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,970
Y-You mean...

117
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,190
Yes. It's likely that this wasn't
an accident, but a murder.

118
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,190
Director, we'd like to check
your security camera footage.

119
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,460
O-Okay.

120
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,520
By the way, how many employees
are there aside from yourself?

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,560
Just Ishikawa-kun.

122
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,960
Nothing beats low labor costs.

123
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,560
That's him.

124
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,470
We determined from his wallet that the
victim was Uchida Hiroaki-san, 47 years old.

125
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,240
He worked in construction.

126
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,140
We've already contacted his
wife, and she's on her way here.

127
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,770
Additionally, we believe this
woman is his wife Uchida Yuko-san.

128
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,770
She's been coming here a lot recently.

129
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,520
What?

130
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,780
I offered her an annual pass,
but she declined my offer.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,780
I-I see.

132
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,800
Keep playing the tape.

133
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,620
Okay.

134
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,290
Stop.

135
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,580
Who is that?

136
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,290
That's Yamada-san, a regular.

137
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,050
He's one of a few guests
who have an annual pass.

138
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,220
Keep playing the tape.

139
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,300
Okay.

140
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,310
Nobody came to the museum after this.

141
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,300
In other words, one of them is the culprit.

142
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,370
That's definitely my husband.

143
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,020
How did this happen?

144
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,190
You came to this museum today, didn't you?

145
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,830
Yes.

146
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,220
Uchida Yuko (33)
Uchida Hiroaki's Wife

147
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,500
Uchida Yuko (33)
Uchida Hiroaki's Wife
Did something happen inside the museum?

148
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Uchida Yuko (33)
Uchida Hiroaki's Wife
I don't know.

149
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,960
I don't know.

150
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,840
He suddenly showed up while I
was viewing the exhibits inside.

151
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,300
He suddenly showed up while I
was viewing the exhibits inside.
Uchida Hiroaki (47)

152
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,740
We got into an argument,
and I left before him.

153
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,810
I don't know what happened
after we parted ways.

154
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,150
Why did you get into an argument?

155
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,770
He was a very controlling person.

156
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,900
He was angry that I came
here without his permission.

157
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,530
Does that mean your husband followed you?

158
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:40,380
He'd make it sound like
he caught me cheating,

159
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,850
but as far as I'm concerned, he
was acting like a nasty stalker.

160
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,040
Then...

161
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,870
I can't say we were a happy couple.

162
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,470
I was considering divorce.

163
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,770
Are you sure you should be saying that?

164
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,650
You'd figure it out if I lied.

165
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,550
It's better to be honest.

166
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,310
Just to be sure, could we
check your phone's history?

167
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,020
I'm sorry. I don't have a cell phone.

168
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,960
What?

169
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,180
That's unusual in this day and age.

170
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,940
That woman is the culprit!

171
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,270
Yamada Kiyoshi (72)
Museum Regular

172
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,560
Yamada Kiyoshi (72)
Museum Regular
I saw them.

173
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,320
Yamada Kiyoshi (72)
Museum Regular
What did you see?

174
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:18,530
Yamada Kiyoshi (72)
Museum Regular
I saw them arguing.

175
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,690
I saw them arguing.

176
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,980
They threatened to kill them.

177
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,300
Who did?

178
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,140
The husband.

179
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,890
They even said, "You'll
never get away with it!"

180
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,410
Who did?

181
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,920
That was the husband, too.

182
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,220
It makes no difference who said it.

183
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,610
The culprit is definitely the wife!

184
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,810
You also don't have an alibi.

185
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,690
Fool! Who's got the time
to bludgeon a stranger?

186
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,440
I told you, it's Anubis' curse.

187
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,800
We're asking for your alibi for
when the incident took place.

188
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,610
What were you doing around 3PM, 30
minutes before the body was discovered?

189
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,800
I was repairing a mirror.

190
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,020
After that, I met up with the
director and some guests.

191
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,960
I believe I was preparing
to close the museum.

192
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,440
In other words, you were both alone.

193
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,080
Yes.

194
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,470
Ishikawa-san, how long have
you been working here?

195
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,990
Who, me? I think it's been about two years.

196
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,300
Huh.

197
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,020
I can't believe he doesn't
know the difference

198
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,480
between the pharaohs and Anubis
after working here for two years.

199
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,650
Ultimately, nobody had a solid alibi.

200
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,020
Let's look into the backgrounds
of the victim and suspects.

201
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,070
We may discover a surprising connection.

202
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,490
You're right.

203
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,750
This Uchida man is unbelievable.

204
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,000
Committed acts of violence against romantic partner
Violated partner's privacy with controlling behavior
Numerous other incidents of harassment

205
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,260
Committed acts of violence against romantic partner
Violated partner's privacy with controlling behavior
Numerous other incidents of harassment
On top of his countless minor offensives, he
has a history of cheating, brawling, and debt.

206
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,830
Committed acts of violence against romantic partner
Violated partner's privacy with controlling behavior
Numerous other incidents of harassment

207
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,630
Committed acts of violence against romantic partner
Violated partner's privacy with controlling behavior
Numerous other incidents of harassment
Hello?

208
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,260
Committed acts of violence against romantic partner
Violated partner's privacy with controlling behavior
Numerous other incidents of harassment
Detective, I know who did it.

209
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,520
Committed acts of violence against romantic partner
Violated partner's privacy with controlling behavior
Numerous other incidents of harassment
You do?

210
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:18,720
Yes. I'm confirming it
now, but it must be them.

211
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,820
Who is it?

212
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,910
Well, actually...

213
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,830
What are you—

214
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,030
What's the matter? Sir?

215
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,700
Sir?!

216
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,880
Sonoko, are we really going back there?

217
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,660
I'm Mystery Queen Sonoko.

218
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,120
Of course I'm curious to know
how yesterday turned out.

219
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,100
I guess so.

220
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Please calm down.

221
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,080
Please calm down.
Hey, look.

222
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,530
Please calm down.

223
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,220
What are you doing?

224
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,850
D-Don't touch me!

225
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,580
I am Anubis!

226
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,830
I am the god of the Underworld who
judges the souls of the dead!

227
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,670
This voice...

228
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,850
Is that the director?

229
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,160
Present your heart to me!

230
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,760
Present your heart to me!
What's going on here?

231
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,260
I received a call from the
director this morning.

232
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,600
He said he knew who the culprit was.

233
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,100
What?

234
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,110
But before he could tell me
their name, the call ended.

235
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,370
I rushed here and found him like this.

236
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,130
His soul was tainted!

237
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,870
His soul tainted by lies
was consumed by Ammit!

238
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,340
Take him to the station.

239
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,960
Yes, sir.

240
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,380
Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,840
How dare you put your hands on a god!

242
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,610
Please stop struggling.

243
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,340
Please stop struggling.
You mustn't touch me!

244
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,710
Inside that cursed notebook is...

245
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,640
No! Let go!

246
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,720
If you look at it, you'll be cursed!

247
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,850
The only thing the cursed can do is pray!

248
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,850
Conan-kun, don't. You'll be cursed.

249
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,060
I'll be fine.

250
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,460
Judging by his behavior, there must be
something about the culprit in this notebook.

251
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,900
Date | Time
Today I got to see the Book of the
Dead. The hieroglyphs are arranged
in such an orderly manner, like the
bricks in the wall at Tokyo Station.
By the way, the sun rising over the
Libyan Desert was magical.

252
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,200
Date | Time
Today I got to see the Book of the
Dead. The hieroglyphs are arranged
in such an orderly manner, like the
bricks in the wall at Tokyo Station.
By the way, the sun rising over the
Libyan Desert was magical.
I see.

253
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,660
Date | Time
Today I got to see the Book of the
Dead. The hieroglyphs are arranged
in such an orderly manner, like the
bricks in the wall at Tokyo Station.
By the way, the sun rising over the
Libyan Desert was magical.

254
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,740
So that's how it is.

255
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,360
But Conan-kun, why are we
going to Tokyo Station?

256
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,170
This notebook is full of reviews from lots of
people, and Uchida Yuko-san's are among them.

257
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,050
What?

258
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,120
She didn't write her name, but the
initials are the same, so it must be her.

259
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,580
If you look back through reviews
written in the same handwriting,

260
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,170
you'll find that Yuko-san
has left 17 reviews.

261
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,840
At first glance, the remarks seem harmless,

262
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
but if you read them carefully, you'll
notice they have something in common.

263
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,550
What's that?

264
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,890
"It was raining in Shibuya."

265
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,680
"Shinjuku at night reminds
me of Cairo at night."

266
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,640
"Flowers were blooming
by the river in Meguro."

267
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,990
"The cicadas in Shakujii Park were..."

268
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,420
I know!

269
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,710
She's meeting someone.

270
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,220
She's meeting someone.
Shinjuku

271
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,720
Shinjuku
There's always the name of a
location in each of her comments.

272
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:50,850
There's always the name of a
location in each of her comments.

273
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,720
There's always the name of a
location in each of her comments.
Yoyogi

274
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,680
There's always the name of a
location in each of her comments.
Daikanyama

275
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,530
There's always the name of a
location in each of her comments.
Shibuya

276
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:53,650
Shibuya

277
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,010
Shinjuku

278
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,760
Shinjuku
Come to think of it, she said
she didn't have a cell phone.

279
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:54,840
Come to think of it, she said
she didn't have a cell phone.

280
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,440
Come to think of it, she said
she didn't have a cell phone.
Shakujii Park

281
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,390
Come to think of it, she said
she didn't have a cell phone.
Shibuya

282
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,670
Come to think of it, she said
she didn't have a cell phone.
Shinjuku

283
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,470
Shinjuku
So it's a code.

284
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,930
So it's a code.
Shinjuku

285
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,220
So it's a code.

286
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,900
Also, look at the dates of the comments.

287
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,280
The dates? But all the comments have dates.

288
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,320
The dates and times go back and forth.

289
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,940
I know.

290
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,180
This isn't when she wrote the comment,
it's when she's meeting someone.

291
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,260
The last one is 11 o'clock on the ninth.

292
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,330
We only have 20 more minutes!

293
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,370
Let's hurry!

294
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,480
We're here, but where are supposed
to look? Tokyo Station is huge.

295
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,450
This certainly is a problem.

296
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,890
I've requested backup, but we
need to narrow it down somehow.

297
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,760
Where is she? Where are they meeting?

298
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,520
15 more minutes.

299
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,760
Ten more minutes.

300
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,450
Damn it. Which words indicate
where they're meeting?

301
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,160
Today I got to see the Book of the Dead.

302
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,190
The hieroglyphs are arranged
in such an orderly manner,

303
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,000
like the bricks in the wall at Tokyo Station.

304
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,710
By the way, the sun rising over
the Libyan Desert was magical.

305
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,840
When the deceased watched their hearts

306
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,430
weighed against an ostrich
feather on Anubis' scale,

307
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,180
all they could do was pray.

308
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,920
That's why I'll begin by praying, too.

309
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,520
Let me see that.

310
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,650
What's the Libyan Desert?

311
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,510
It's a part of the Sahara
Desert in southwestern Egypt.

312
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,240
Huh, I guess Yuko-san's been to Egypt.

313
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,690
H-Hold on.

314
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:42,410
Huh?

315
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:48,090
I reviewed some records last night,
and she's never been to Egypt.

316
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,790
She doesn't even have a passport.

317
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,590
What?

318
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,590
That's it.

319
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,440
What?

320
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,360
Sonoko-neechan, you said the Libyan
Desert is in southwestern Egypt, right?

321
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,470
Y-Yeah.

322
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,220
Then it's impossible for the sun
to rise over the Libyan Desert.

323
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,600
Oh, yeah.

324
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,730
Then this is part of the code, too?

325
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,730
See how it says "I'll begin
by praying" before that?

326
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,730
Yeah, I see it.

327
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,990
That's where it starts.

328
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,610
Where it starts?

329
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,000
At Tokyo Station, there are
facilities for praying here.

330
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,600
At Tokyo Station, there are
facilities for praying here.
Prayer Room

331
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,870
Prayer Room
The prayer room.

332
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
Prayer Room

333
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,000
And since the Libyan Desert
is in southwestern Egypt,

334
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,290
Prayer Room
Taxi Stand

335
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,550
Prayer Room
Taxi Stand
if you head southwest from the prayer room...

336
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,700
Taxi Stand
if you head southwest from the prayer room...
Marunouchi Subway
North Exit

337
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,260
Taxi Stand
Marunouchi Subway
North Exit
The taxi stand.

338
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,940
What? What is Ishikawa-san doing here?

339
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,710
Ishikawa-san, I knew you would come here.

340
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,000
This case started with the
discord between the Uchidas.

341
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,570
After witnessing their argument,

342
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,470
Yuko-san's lover decided to commit
a crime in order to protect her.

343
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,390
You're wrong! I'm the one who killed him!

344
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,950
A woman couldn't have committed this crime.

345
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,520
Even if you dropped the
feather in the hallway

346
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,030
and attacked him from
behind as he picked it up,

347
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,530
it would've been difficult
for you to drag the body

348
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,390
or tamper with the two-meter
tall Anubis statue's platform,

349
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,550
even though it's a replica, in
such a short amount of time.

350
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,370
No! I did it!

351
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,470
No, you had nothing to do with the murder.

352
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,420
How do you know that?

353
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,600
It was written in the notebook.

354
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,540
What? Wh-Where?

355
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,070
It wasn't written explicitly.

356
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,180
What was it, then?

357
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,740
Her final note was written
in her usual handwriting.

358
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,780
If she'd been involved in the murder,

359
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,090
it would've affected her handwriting.

360
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,520
You're right.

361
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,300
Come to think of it, Ishikawa-san
mixed up Anubis and the pharaohs...

362
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,510
But that was a lie meant to direct
suspicion away from himself.

363
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,750
He pretended to be ignorant
so we wouldn't suspect him.

364
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,340
Is he responsible for the
director's curse, too?

365
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,800
You showed up just before the director

366
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,300
could tell Detective Takagi the
culprit's name, didn't you?

367
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,420
When you explained the
situation to the director,

368
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,250
he felt sorry for you two and had second
thoughts about telling the truth.

369
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,420
So he pretended to be cursed
by Anubis to avoid testifying.

370
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:07,060
I see. Then he wouldn't
have to perjure himself.

371
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,930
You're right.

372
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,330
I'm responsible for everything.

373
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,210
I know I've caused trouble for the director.

374
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,910
But Uchida Hiroaki deserved to die!

375
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,850
You're wrong.

376
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:21,460
What?

377
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,960
Violence, controlling behavior, violations
of privacy, and all manner of harassment.

378
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,980
I know Uchida-san was having affairs with
multiple women for several years, too.

379
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,720
I was in hell.

380
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,020
Ishikawa-san saved me from that hell.

381
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,460
Yuko-san...

382
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,780
However,

383
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,150
that doesn't make it right
to take a person's life.

384
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,150
Hey, apparently a Aztec culture museum is
opening on the other side of the station.

385
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,560
Want to check it out sometime?

386
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,460
What?

387
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,630
What about Ancient Oriental culture?

388
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,890
That's old news. Aztec culture is in now.

389
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,810
The Incan Empire, Machu Picchu,
Lake Titicaca, Quetzalcoatl.

390
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,880
It's so romantic.

391
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,940
Do you even know what those words mean?
