8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,950
cheated a man named Komoto Takashi
out of a large sum of money.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,960
Komoto Takashi learned that he
didn't have long left to live

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,130
Komoto Takashi learned that he
didn't have long left to live
Komoto Takashi (40)

11
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,300
and has been seeking revenge
against the four of them.

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,680
However, Komoto accidentally fell off
a cliff and was believed to have died.

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,960
But two days later, Akiba Miyako-san
was killed using the same method.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,120
Stabbed repeatedly with a knife.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,810
Same method.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,930
T.K.?

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,730
Komoto Takashi.

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,950
Akiba-san was murdered
last night around 11 PM.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:06,080
Komoto Takashi's fingerprints were found
on the lighter left next to the body.

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,800
So Komoto survived his fall from that cliff.

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,590
And he has resumed his revenge murders.

22
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,130
Save me.

23
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,200

It's Komoto.

K-Komoto?

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,030
You're the last one left, Fuyuki.

29
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,830
You'll pay for deceiving me ten years ago.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,430
S-Spare me, Komoto!

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,980
I was wrong. I'll return your money.

32

I'll return ten times what we took, okay?

33
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,700
Money, money, money.

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,180
You think you can erase your sins with money.

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,240
No wonder you think you can buy
your own life with money, too.

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,200
You're the same scumbag you ever were.

37
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,060
K-Komoto?

38
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,690
Komoto, hello? Komoto!

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,770
Spare me, Komoto!

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,350
Find him.

41
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,770
Do whatever it takes to find Komoto.

42
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,770
Yes, sir.

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,150
So his revenge wasn't over yet.

44
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,480
Yeah, but why did he bother
to call him this time?

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,160
Because he's the one he hated the most.

46
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,410
He's the one who suggested they swindle him.

47
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,610
That's true, but...

48
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,640
Something's not right.

49
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,440
What is that?

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,450
What? You found Komoto's body?

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,950
Yes. The fingerprints are
definitely a match, you say?

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,390
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

MPD Beika Police Station
The autopsy determined
that the cause of death

65
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,960
was a cerebral contusion
caused by a blow to the head.

66
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,200
Additionally, bruises and broken
bones were found all over the body.

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,500
We believe he fell to his death
from a rather high height.

68
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,890
The estimated time of death is the
afternoon of the day before yesterday.

69
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,200
The afternoon of the day before yesterday?

70
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,390
Could it be?

71
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,910
Yes. That's the time Komoto
fell at Shikigawa Valley.

72
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,820
So he really did die then.

73
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,700
I-In that case...

74
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,860
What was the body doing at a development
site in a completely different area?

75
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,700
And who killed Akiba Miyako-san last night?

76
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,950
If he died when he fell, then...

77
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,590
There's only one conceivable explanation.

78
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,510
And what's that, Mori-kun?

79
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:16,010
Komoto Takashi's revenge against
the four of them was interrupted.

80
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,520
A "Mr. X" is carrying on Komoto's will

81
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,770
and carrying out his revenge for him.

82
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
Carrying out his revenge?

83
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,780
That's right.

84
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,680
And in order to complete
it as Komoto's revenge,

85
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,080
they used the same method
to kill Akiba Miyako-san,

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,990
left Komoto's possession at the crime scene,

87
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,300
and pretended to be Komoto
when they called Fuyuki.

88
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,840
I see.

89
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,550
It's certainly possible.

90
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,150
Komoto's accomplice Mr. X
probably accompanied him

91
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,270
to the valley where he fell.

92
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,310
They quickly retrieved Komoto's
body after he fell to his death,

93
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,820
and hid it at the development
site so it wouldn't be discovered

94
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,320
so that we'd believe Komoto was alive
and continuing to carry out his revenge.

95
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,170
That would explain why the body was buried.

96
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,460
And why Komoto's belongings
were at the crime scene.

97
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,710
So, who is his collaborator Mr. X?

98
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,640
Based on the fact that they're
carrying out his revenge

99
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,460
and have committed the
heinous crime of murder,

100
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,140
it must be someone who feels deeply
indebted to Komoto Takashi.

101
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,350
So they're returning a favor.

102
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,850
All right. Investigate Komoto's
acquaintances based on Mori-kun's reasoning.

103
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,800
Yes, sir!

104
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,150
Also, Chiba.

105
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,590
Guard Fuyuki closely.

106
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,780
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:03,440
But even if Mr. X was indebted to
Komoto, would he commit murder for him?

108
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,040
Mr. X must be incredibly conscientious.

Mori Detective Agency

Mori Detective Agency

112
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,710
Have you already identified Mr. X?

113
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,230
No, not yet.

114
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,150
It turns out that Mr. X called Fuyuki again.

115
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,360
Is that you, Fuyuki?

116
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,040
I'm sure you already know
that I'm not Komoto.

I got revenge on a woman named
Akiba Miyako for Komoto.

119
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,460
But taking a person's life has left
a terrible aftertaste in my mouth.

120
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,130
Y-You mean...

121
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,160
Anyway, I have a suggestion.

122
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,390
When I called this morning, you said
you'd pay as much as I wanted, right?

123
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,580
Yeah, I did. I'll pay any amount.

124
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,680
How much do you want?

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,180
You really are a scumbag.

126
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,380
What?

127
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,660
Nevermind. I'll contact you later
regarding the amount and handoff method.

128
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,570
It's odd, isn't it?

129
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,790
Mr. X is supposed to be carrying
on Komoto's will to repay a favor,

130
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,660
but he's demanding cash now.

131
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,160
Maybe that was his real motive.

132
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,080
No, Inspector.

133
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,590
This is a trap.

134
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,590
A trap?

135
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,730
That's right.

136
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,240
He intends to make Fuyuki let
his guard down by convincing him

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,220
that he'll be spared in exchange
for money, and then kill him.

138
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,970
So that's how it is.

139
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,970
This is an opportunity
to arrest him, Inspector.

140
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,230
We'll allow him to believe that we've fallen
for his trap and catch him with his pants down.

141
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,410
The old man's deduction
isn't impossible, but...

142
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,610
The Next Day

143
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,100
He won't be able to escape with
this much security in the area.

144
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,320
Hey, officer.

145
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,270
He said he'd let me go if I paid him.

146
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm telling you, that could be a trap.

147
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,320
Hey, mister.

148
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,490
Just waiting for him to attack doesn't
feel very detective-like, does it?

149
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,500
Now that you mention it,

150
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,920
it doesn't give me an opportunity
to show off my detective skills.

151
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,290
All right. I'll go find him.

152
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,500
Yeah.

153
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,200
Inspector.

154
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,160
A man is approaching.

155
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,550
He's got something wrapped
around his stomach.

156
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,000
He's got a bomb wrapped around his stomach?

157
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,020
That's Mr. X?

158
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,270
Ow! What are you doing?

159
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,240
I've removed it!

160
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,740
That's a back brace!

161
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,750
Give it back, please!

162
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,010
Let's go, kid.

163
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,750
Okay.

164
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,730
We'll find them if we look into
everyone who feels indebted to Komoto.

165
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,760
But is that really the right
direction to investigate?

166
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,390
Mr. X could only have heard about Komoto's
revenge plot from Komoto himself.

167
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,320
Yeah, but...

168
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,660
You'd only tell someone who
felt deeply indebted to you

169
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,400
about your plans to kill someone.

170
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,130
He wouldn't bother retrieving a dead body

171
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,640
or burying one in the mountains
unless he felt indebted to him.

172
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,030
Retrieve a dead body?

173
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,200
Wait a minute.

174
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,410
What if he had still been alive then?

175
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,340
That would mean...

176
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:22,420
Didn't you say then that someone else
was there watching when he fell,

177
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,300
but that person disappeared at some point?

178
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:25,680
The Uedas

179
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,910
The Uedas
Yeah.

180
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,800
The Uedas
When I looked below the cliff,

181
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,060
When I looked below the cliff,

182
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,560
there was someone fishing in the river.

183
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,620
I thought he must've seen it, too.

184
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,570
But by the time we got down
the river, he was gone.

185
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,200
Do you know who he was?

186
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,120
No idea.

187
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,080
It was our first time going there.

188
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,760
He works at the hospital.

189
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,580
What?

190
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:54,540
He works at Shikigawa General Hospital.

191
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,320
He works at Shikigawa General Hospital.
The Shimodas

192
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:57,960
The Shimodas
He took care of me when
I was in the hospital.

193
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,590
He took care of me when
I was in the hospital.

194
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,590
He's a very nice man named Otosaka-san.

195
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,420
Otosaka-san?

196
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,790
Give me some more time.

197
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,100
I've got something in mind.
I promise I'll return it.

198
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,200
Otosaka Jinichi (25)
Hospital Employee

199
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,110
Otosaka Jinichi (25)
Hospital Employee
Otosaka-san.

200
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,620
Otosaka-san.

201
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,570
Yes?

202
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,450
There's a child here to see you.

203
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,740
What? A child?

204
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm Otosaka. Are you the
one who wanted to see me?

205
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,960
The great Detective Mori
Kogoro asked me to come here.

206
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,060
Mori Kogoro-san?

207
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,750
Yeah.

208
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,460
Shikigawa General Hospital

209
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,350
Shikigawa General Hospital
Yeah, I was working that afternoon.

210
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,620
Yeah, I was working that afternoon.

211
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,610
I went fishing there in the morning.

212
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,360
But I didn't see anyone fall.

213
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,150
It must've happened after I left.

214
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,940
I see. I thought you might've seen something.

215
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,130
I'll let Kogoro-no-ojisan know.

216
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,130
Really? Sounds like Otosaka-san
is having a hard time.

217
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,020
Don't tell anyone, though.

218
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,710
I won't.

219
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,170
By the way, it sounds like
he goes fishing often.

220
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,340
He goes by car, right?

221
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:34,640
Yeah, probably. He always parks his
car at the very end over there.

222
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,780
If he drives this car to
work, then on the way here...

223
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,740
Shikigawa Valley

224
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,200
Otosaka-san, over here.

225
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,000
Huh? Didn't I run into you at the hospital?

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,090
Ah, you're that police officer.

227
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,010
What are you doing here?

228
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,250
Actually, I'm not sure.

229
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,260
Kogoro-no-ojisan asked me to
bring Otosaka-san here, too.

230
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,510
Inspector.

231
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,620
Why did you ask us to come here, Mori-kun?

232
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,000
What? I didn'tâ

233
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,530
X^2 plus Y^2 squared equals... equals...

234
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,530
Otosaka Jinichi-kun, when you
were fishing here three days ago,

235
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,270
a man named Komoto Takashi suddenly
fell right before your eyes.

236
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,920
I told you, it was after I left that he fell.

237
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,750
No. Komoto screamed and fell
right before your eyes.

238
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,500
He was badly injured but still alive,
so you fished him out of the river.

239
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,850
Believing it would be faster to drive him to
the hospital rather than call an ambulance,

240
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,900
you rushed towards the hospital at the
foot of the mountain where you work.

241
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,070
On the way there, Komoto
likely made a request.

242
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,810
Don't take me to the hospital.

243
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,160
What do you mean?

244
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,540
I don't have long to live anyway.

245
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,170
More importantly, I want
you to hear my story.

246
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,620
Please.

247
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:31,580
Haruyama Junpei
Natsukawa Yoji
Akiba Miyako
Fuyuki Ryuzaburo

248
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,760
Haruyama Junpei
Natsukawa Yoji
Akiba Miyako
Fuyuki Ryuzaburo
Komoto described the revenge killings he
had committed against the four so far.

249
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:36,930
Haruyama Junpei
Natsukawa Yoji
Akiba Miyako
Fuyuki Ryuzaburo

250
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,930
Then he lamented the fact that
he'd been unable to complete it.

251
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,440
Damn it. I was so close.

252
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,620
K-Komoto-san?

253
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,290
You mean...

254
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,950
Otosaka-kun is the Mr. X
carrying out Komoto's revenge?

255
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,450
It's you?

256
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,990
That's right.

257
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,470
Normally you wouldn't tell anyone
about your plan to kill someone,

258
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,320
but it's different if you're dying.

259
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,590
It's human nature to want to tell
someone about your unfulfilled desires.

260
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,100
Having learned about Komoto
Takashi's revenge plot,

261
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,600
Otosaka-kun came up with a way
to use that to his advantage.

262
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,100
He decided to blackmail Fuyuki.

263
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,170
What?

264
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,470
He never had any intention of
carrying on Komoto Takashi's will.

265
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,630
He killed Akiba Miyako-san to ensure
that he'd get money from Fuyuki.

266
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,640
Once three of them were dead,

267
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,250
the terrified Fuyuki wouldn't hesitate
to pay to save his own life.

268
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,760
So he killed Akiba Miyako-san
just to stoke Fuyuki's fear.

269
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,020
You seem to be having trouble
paying off your debt.

270
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,250
After burying and hiding Komoto Takashi's
body, you killed Akiba Miyako-san.

271
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:16,030
You made it look like
part of Komoto's revenge,

272
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,220
and then placed a threatening call.

273
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,550
It's Komoto.

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,250
You're the last one left, Fuyuki.

275
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,740
I'll return your money.

276
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,040
I'll return ten times what we took, okay?

277
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,780
He made exactly the request
you wanted him to make.

278
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,190
However, that's when things
went wrong for you.

279
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,050
The body you'd hidden was discovered,

280
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,660
so you couldn't pretend to be Komoto anymore.

281
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,490
You revealed that you were an agent
carrying out Komoto's revenge

282
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,880
and openly demanded money.

283
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,980
We read too deeply into the situation
when we assumed it was a trap.

284
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,460
It was in fact his actual goal.

285
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,630
Mori-san, your theory doesn't have
a scrap of evidence to back it up.

286
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,490
In the first place, I never
rescued anyone named Komoto.

287
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,660
Then what were you doing then

288
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,330
at the convenience store parking
lot between here and the hospital?

289
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,840
I found the security camera footage.

290
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,350
You got in the rear passenger seat and
remained parked for over ten minutes.

291
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
What were you doing?

292
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,780
Komoto Takashi fell from
this cliff around noon.

293
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,640
The estimated time of death
is around that same time.

294
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,800
But since you were working that afternoon,

295
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,390
there wasn't enough time for you to start
your shift after visiting that development site.

296
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,250
In other words, you hid the
body after you finished work.

297
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,260
Which means Komoto's body was in your
car when you started your shift.

298
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:08,140
You mean the body I was
looking for was nearby then?

299
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

300
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,650
It was probably hidden
out of sight in his car.

301
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:21,570
Then we should be able to find Komoto
Takashi's hair or blood in his car if we search it.

302
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,800
Yeah.

303
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,320
That would prove that he abandoned the body.

304
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,360
We should be able to find something belonging

305
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,080
to the culprit at the scene of
Akiba Miyako-san's murder, too.

306
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,210
If we compare them against yours,

307
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,870
I'm sure of them will be a match.

308
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,200
Everything you've said is correct, Mori-san.

309
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,180
I tried to blackmail this scumbag.

310
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,180
You jerk.

311
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,690
Both you and that Akiba
woman are terrible people.

312
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,940
That doesn't make it okay to
murder to blackmail someone.

313
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,740
I'm not in debt because I
blew my money having fun.

314
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,050
I know people who are in
trouble. Several of them.

315
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,360
I had to help them.

316
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,820
Perhaps he's not lying.

317
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:32,050
He probably rescued Komoto
Takashi from the river

318
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,390
and attempted to take him to the hospital
out of the goodness of his heart, but...

319
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,920
Yeah.

320
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,900
He stepped off the right path when
he decided to use Komoto's death.

321
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,560
The fact is, he did something unforgivable.

322
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,410
What a stupid man.

323
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,160
This all began because of the misdeeds
you committed ten years ago.

324
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,480
Surely you don't think you'll
escape your own guilt.

325
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,360
I guess I solved another case, huh?

326
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,390
Anyway, who the heck is Otosaka?

327
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,260
I must be a great detective if I identified
him as the culprit without knowing who he is.
