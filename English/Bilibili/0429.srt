1
00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.167
Victory, sincerity, charging for the truth.

2
00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:05.067
Endless impulse to aim for the best!

3
00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:06.967
His girlfriend leaves home after a trivial argument.

4
00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.267
This leads to a sad reencounter at the place where they first met.

5
00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:10.767
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.567
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.367
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:56.177 --> 00:01:57.177
And?

9
00:01:57.177 --> 00:01:59.077
When is he coming?

10
00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.877
He says he'll come after changing clothes at home.

11
00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:04.577
Who's he?

12
00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:07.077
Don't you remember? I told you the other day.

13
00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:10.677
A new student who came to our class is going to come over.

14
00:02:12.077 --> 00:02:13.377
Come on, Ran!

15
00:02:13.377 --> 00:02:16.077
-Let's go! -Okay.

16
00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:19.677
A new student?

17
00:02:21.377 --> 00:02:22.677
Oh, right.

18
00:02:22.677 --> 00:02:24.177
When I talked about this,

19
00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.177
you were asleep, weren't you?

20
00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:27.777
Hey.

21
00:02:27.777 --> 00:02:30.377
Why is that person coming here?

22
00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:32.777
Why not?

23
00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:35.477
Oh, my.

24
00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:40.577
This kid thinks that you got a boyfriend and is getting jealous.

25
00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:42.677
Come on, Sonoko.

26
00:02:42.677 --> 00:02:44.077
That's not it!

27
00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:45.577
Then what is it?

28
00:02:45.577 --> 00:02:48.277
Are you going to squeal to Shinichi about this?

29
00:02:48.277 --> 00:02:50.377
I am him in person.

30
00:02:50.377 --> 00:02:52.777
Too bad!

31
00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:55.177
He's not coming here because of me.

32
00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.677
Hi, Ran.

33
00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:00.077
You're back early.

34
00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:02.077
I hate to ask you a favour when you just got back,

35
00:03:02.077 --> 00:03:04.877
but would you give me a cup of coffee?

36
00:03:04.877 --> 00:03:07.577
Unless it's the coffee you make,

37
00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:11.577
it seems that my brain cells get sulky and refuse to get up.

38
00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:23.977
Who are you mimicking?

39
00:03:23.977 --> 00:03:25.977
Mr. Mouri, are you okay?

40
00:03:27.577 --> 00:03:29.577
Come on!

41
00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:33.377
It's only the filthy rich tempestuous girl!

42
00:03:33.377 --> 00:03:36.477
What? Tempestuous?

43
00:03:36.477 --> 00:03:37.977
-If you're talking about the one who's coming here, -Hey!

44
00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.677
he says he's coming here later!

45
00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:43.277
Is that person coming to see Pops?

46
00:03:43.277 --> 00:03:46.677
Yes. He says he's a great fan of dad.

47
00:03:46.677 --> 00:03:49.877
Are you relieved, glasses brat?

48
00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:52.377
Sonoko, you're going to get it.

49
00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:55.677
A great fan of Pops?

50
00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:03.277
"The Point of No Return (Part 1)"

51
00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:09.077
I was looking forward to the guest.

52
00:04:10.377 --> 00:04:11.777
But...

53
00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:16.177
what's the point of putting on airs for a high school boy?

54
00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:21.177
A boy?

55
00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:24.077
Huh? Wasn't she supposed to be a high school girl

56
00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:27.077
who resembled Reina Mizunashi the announcer?

57
00:04:28.777 --> 00:04:29.977
Reina Mizunashi?

58
00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:40.377
I told you it was a boy student!

59
00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:44.277
You used to say, "that cute kid" so I took him to be a girl.

60
00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:49.077
No, Pops! Don't meet him!

61
00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:54.577
He is here!

62
00:04:57.377 --> 00:04:58.377
Come in!

63
00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:01.177
Pops!

64
00:05:15.277 --> 00:05:16.577
Ouch.

65
00:05:17.977 --> 00:05:20.077
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:20.077 --> 00:05:22.577
I tripped over something.

67
00:05:31.477 --> 00:05:33.477
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

68
00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:35.577
It's an honour to see you!

69
00:05:38.877 --> 00:05:43.877
He's Conan, who's staying with us for now.

70
00:05:51.477 --> 00:05:52.977
Huh?

71
00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:56.277
Like I just said, he's staying with us.

72
00:05:56.277 --> 00:05:57.877
He's a glasses brat.

73
00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:01.977
Here, your glasses!

74
00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:04.677
Thank you.

75
00:06:04.677 --> 00:06:06.677
He's my father.

76
00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:12.377
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:12.377 --> 00:06:15.077
How do you do, Detective Mouri?

78
00:06:15.077 --> 00:06:17.177
I'm Eisuke Hondo.

79
00:06:19.477 --> 00:06:20.877
Hello.

80
00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:22.877
Nice to meet you.

81
00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:27.077
It hurts.

82
00:06:28.277 --> 00:06:29.977
It hurts.

83
00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:38.977
Ouch...

84
00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:42.577
What's with this guy?

85
00:06:42.577 --> 00:06:48.377
I kind of understand why Ran referred to him as "the kid".

86
00:06:48.377 --> 00:06:51.077
He's just a bit of a klutz.

87
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.877
I'm not a klutz, just unlucky!

88
00:06:55.277 --> 00:06:59.077
If I drop my toast, the buttered side will definitely fall on the ground.

89
00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:04.277
If I go camping, I'm the first to get bitten by mosquitoes.

90
00:07:05.577 --> 00:07:07.177
If I take a group picture with everyone,

91
00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.777
for some reason I'm the only one with my eyes closed.

92
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:12.077
God must not like me!

93
00:07:13.877 --> 00:07:17.477
If you were a girl, you would be a cute little klutz, but...

94
00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:20.877
That's why I wanted to meet Detective Mouri!

95
00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:23.177
Huh? Why?

96
00:07:23.177 --> 00:07:27.177
I want you to share just a little bit of your good luck with me!

97
00:07:27.177 --> 00:07:28.377
Good luck?

98
00:07:28.377 --> 00:07:34.077
I mean, being able to solve cases while asleep is super lucky!

99
00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:38.077
I'm sure that only during that time, God descends on you!

100
00:07:38.077 --> 00:07:40.477
God? Come on.

101
00:07:40.477 --> 00:07:45.377
It's true that dad is called the "Sleeping Kogoro",

102
00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:47.877
but he's just looking down and revealing the truth,

103
00:07:47.877 --> 00:07:50.177
and not really asleep, you know.

104
00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:53.577
But he usually avoids answering during interviews after solving cases,

105
00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:58.977
saying things like, "I forgot", or "Ask the police", right?

106
00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:01.577
Come to think of it...

107
00:08:01.577 --> 00:08:04.077
He's just saying so because he's embarrassed!

108
00:08:04.077 --> 00:08:05.877
He remembers everything.

109
00:08:05.877 --> 00:08:07.277
Right, dad?

110
00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:10.677
Yeah, sort of.

111
00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:14.077
Please show me the "Sleeping Kogoro".

112
00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.377
Please!

113
00:08:15.377 --> 00:08:17.577
Yeah, but...

114
00:08:17.577 --> 00:08:19.977
He's a load of trouble.

115
00:08:21.777 --> 00:08:23.877
Excuse me.

116
00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:27.377
"Atsushi Misumi (32)" -Is this the Mouri Detective Agency?

117
00:08:27.377 --> 00:08:28.377
Yes.

118
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.377
You touched my breasts! How dare he touch me!

119
00:08:35.777 --> 00:08:37.977
Are you here to ask him to solve a case?

120
00:08:37.977 --> 00:08:40.877
Sort of.

121
00:08:40.877 --> 00:08:43.777
Detective Mouri! He wants you to solve a case!

122
00:08:43.777 --> 00:08:45.477
All right!

123
00:08:46.577 --> 00:08:47.577
Not again.

124
00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:49.877
Ouch. Not again.

125
00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:51.977
My nose...

126
00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:05.477
A born klutz. Goodness.

127
00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:07.677
Please don't let it bother you.

128
00:09:07.677 --> 00:09:09.577
Oh, okay.

129
00:09:13.877 --> 00:09:16.677
You want me to find your girlfriend who disappeared?

130
00:09:16.677 --> 00:09:17.977
Yes.

131
00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:19.677
I'm living with her,

132
00:09:19.677 --> 00:09:23.177
but this morning when I got up, she was gone.

133
00:09:23.177 --> 00:09:24.477
The reason she left

134
00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:29.277
is probably because of the argument we had last night.

135
00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:33.177
If it's okay with you, would you please tell me what you argued about?

136
00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:34.577
Oh, yes.

137
00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.577
Hey!

138
00:09:39.577 --> 00:09:41.777
You guys, go away.

139
00:09:41.777 --> 00:09:43.577
It's okay!

140
00:09:43.577 --> 00:09:47.077
It's just the usual argument that anybody has.

141
00:09:47.077 --> 00:09:49.077
I see.

142
00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:50.177
Okay.

143
00:09:50.177 --> 00:09:51.377
Right.

144
00:09:51.377 --> 00:09:56.477
I've been busy lately and unable to spend much time with her.

145
00:09:56.477 --> 00:09:58.977
That's what triggered our argument,

146
00:09:58.977 --> 00:10:02.077
but after having said what we both wanted to say...

147
00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:04.077
You've changed!

148
00:10:04.077 --> 00:10:06.477
And I haven't changed at all!

149
00:10:06.477 --> 00:10:08.477
We are at the point of no return.

150
00:10:08.477 --> 00:10:10.677
We can never go back to how when we first met.

151
00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:14.477
After that remark, she didn't say anything and went to sleep.

152
00:10:14.477 --> 00:10:17.877
When I got up in the morning, she and the car were gone.

153
00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:22.877
It sure sounds like any other lover's quarrel.

154
00:10:22.877 --> 00:10:25.677
The possibility of this being a criminal case is very low.

155
00:10:25.677 --> 00:10:27.677
She just simply left.

156
00:10:29.477 --> 00:10:33.177
I'm sure she'll return in two to three days.

157
00:10:33.177 --> 00:10:35.077
I can't wait that long!

158
00:10:35.077 --> 00:10:36.977
Tomorrow I have to turn in some documents to the company,

159
00:10:36.977 --> 00:10:40.577
but I left it in the car that she took!

160
00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:44.177
So I need to find her by today no matter what!

161
00:10:46.877 --> 00:10:49.877
Of course I'm worried about her, too.

162
00:10:49.877 --> 00:10:51.477
I see.

163
00:10:51.477 --> 00:10:55.077
I understand, but there's so little to go on.

164
00:10:55.077 --> 00:10:56.977
Hey.

165
00:10:56.977 --> 00:10:58.377
Did she know

166
00:10:58.377 --> 00:11:02.177
that you had important papers from your company in the car?

167
00:11:02.177 --> 00:11:03.877
Yeah.

168
00:11:03.877 --> 00:11:07.877
If so, she could just be trying to be mean to you.

169
00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.077
Trying to be mean?

170
00:11:11.077 --> 00:11:14.877
Yeah! I think she wants you to come look for her,

171
00:11:14.877 --> 00:11:18.677
to the place where you both played Japanese Parcheesi in the past.

172
00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:20.077
Japanese Parcheesi?

173
00:11:20.077 --> 00:11:21.777
Just what does that mean?

174
00:11:21.777 --> 00:11:22.777
Remember?

175
00:11:22.777 --> 00:11:27.077
He said a while ago, "We're at a point of no return."

176
00:11:27.077 --> 00:11:30.177
Isn't that about Parcheesi?

177
00:11:30.177 --> 00:11:32.577
When I played Parcheesi with Ran the other day,

178
00:11:32.577 --> 00:11:35.077
I hit the point of no return, too!

179
00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:39.577
Ran, are you playing Parcheesi with this glasses brat?

180
00:11:39.577 --> 00:11:42.177
It's the TV game "Budori Street".

181
00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:43.977
Conan is good at it.

182
00:11:45.777 --> 00:11:49.377
You're so stupid.

183
00:11:49.377 --> 00:11:50.977
The point of no return that he's talking about

184
00:11:50.977 --> 00:11:55.577
is not being able to return to how they used to be when they first met.

185
00:12:00.677 --> 00:12:06.977
Maybe she's where you both first met each other?

186
00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:08.277
Right, right.

187
00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:12.377
After having a fight, if she wants to be mean and make you find her,

188
00:12:12.377 --> 00:12:13.877
that could be the ideal place.

189
00:12:15.477 --> 00:12:17.477
Anyway, Mr. Misumi...

190
00:12:17.477 --> 00:12:18.777
What is it?

191
00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:21.177
Where did you first meet her?

192
00:12:21.177 --> 00:12:22.277
Right.

193
00:12:22.277 --> 00:12:24.777
At a ski range in Gunma.

194
00:12:36.365 --> 00:12:39.265
That's why I told you not to come.

195
00:12:39.265 --> 00:12:41.665
Are you all right, Eisuke?

196
00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:42.865
See.

197
00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:46.265
In situations like these, I'm the first one to catch a cold.

198
00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:53.465
It's snowing so hard, so maybe Sonoko was right not wanting to come.

199
00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:55.165
Gunma?

200
00:12:55.165 --> 00:12:58.565
It'll be covered in snow this time of the year.

201
00:12:58.565 --> 00:13:01.165
I'm sorry, Ran. Would you mind me not going this time?

202
00:13:03.065 --> 00:13:04.165
Right.

203
00:13:05.865 --> 00:13:08.265
Hey, don't you give your cold to Ran.

204
00:13:08.265 --> 00:13:11.465
I'm fine. Because Conan's so warm.

205
00:13:11.465 --> 00:13:13.465
Same here.

206
00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:14.565
And?

207
00:13:14.565 --> 00:13:18.965
Did you two really meet on this freezing mountain?

208
00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.265
Yes.

209
00:13:20.265 --> 00:13:25.565
She drove here with three of her friends,

210
00:13:25.565 --> 00:13:28.365
but when she drove through the short cut of the mountain road here,

211
00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:31.365
the engine stopped and they were stalled.

212
00:13:33.065 --> 00:13:34.565
What seems to be the matter?

213
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:37.965
We're in a fix because our car stopped moving.

214
00:13:37.965 --> 00:13:41.265
No cars have passed by either.

215
00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:42.265
I'm so glad.

216
00:13:44.265 --> 00:13:47.965
So, the place where we first met is the road just up ahead.

217
00:13:55.065 --> 00:13:56.465
On the other side of that tree!

218
00:13:56.465 --> 00:13:57.565
That's my car!

219
00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:06.565
Case closed, I guess.

220
00:14:17.765 --> 00:14:19.965
Ami? Ami?

221
00:14:19.965 --> 00:14:22.365
Hey, Ami! Get a hold of yourself!

222
00:14:22.365 --> 00:14:23.665
Hey! What is it?

223
00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:28.565
I'll go check!

224
00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:29.565
Wait.

225
00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:46.865
The space between both doors are sealed tightly with masking tape.

226
00:14:49.865 --> 00:14:52.665
There is a portable clay charcoal stove by the passenger's seat.

227
00:14:52.665 --> 00:14:53.765
Suicide?

228
00:14:56.565 --> 00:14:59.265
Where's the key? Don't you have a spare key?

229
00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.965
I do!

230
00:15:08.765 --> 00:15:09.865
Darn it!

231
00:15:09.865 --> 00:15:14.265
It's sealed tight with masking tape. It won't open.

232
00:15:14.265 --> 00:15:17.765
I guess we'll have to call the police and break it open using tools.

233
00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:19.165
Please stay back.

234
00:15:32.165 --> 00:15:34.165
Where did you get that bat?

235
00:15:34.165 --> 00:15:38.065
I always keep a bat for playing a sandlot game in the trunk of my car.

236
00:15:38.065 --> 00:15:40.365
Ami! I'll get you out of there right now!

237
00:15:43.565 --> 00:15:44.565
Ami!

238
00:15:50.265 --> 00:15:51.265
Ami!

239
00:15:59.765 --> 00:16:00.765
Ami?

240
00:16:03.365 --> 00:16:07.765
Peel off the masking tape on the door of the car for now!

241
00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:08.965
Yes, sir!

242
00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:13.665
But it's very tightly sealed.

243
00:16:13.665 --> 00:16:14.965
It's hard to peel all of it off.

244
00:16:17.265 --> 00:16:18.965
That's right.

245
00:16:18.965 --> 00:16:20.965
There should be a cutter in here.

246
00:16:41.565 --> 00:16:42.565
Ami?

247
00:16:42.565 --> 00:16:44.065
Get a hold of yourself, Ami!

248
00:16:44.065 --> 00:16:46.865
Ami?

249
00:16:46.865 --> 00:16:50.065
From the looks of it, she's already dead.

250
00:16:50.065 --> 00:16:51.265
Oh, no.

251
00:16:51.265 --> 00:16:53.465
Ami! Ami!

252
00:16:57.665 --> 00:17:00.365
Ami! Hey, Ami!

253
00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:13.065
I guess I'll call an ambulance as well as the Gunma police.

254
00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:15.865
I called them a while ago.

255
00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:20.465
I was told that an officer who is a great partner of yours is coming!

256
00:17:20.465 --> 00:17:23.565
Hey. Don't tell me that it's...

257
00:17:27.865 --> 00:17:29.665
So it's him after all.

258
00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:35.265
What makes us great partners?

259
00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:38.965
Just what do think you're saying, Mr. Mouri?

260
00:17:38.965 --> 00:17:43.265
Every case we've worked on together has been solved!

261
00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:45.565
It's 100%!

262
00:17:45.565 --> 00:17:48.565
Then what about all the other cases?

263
00:17:48.565 --> 00:17:51.365
Well, you see...

264
00:17:51.365 --> 00:17:54.365
All the other cases aren't solved.

265
00:17:54.365 --> 00:17:58.365
Let's leave the tidbits aside and start the investigation.

266
00:17:58.365 --> 00:18:02.065
I'm going to get a picture of the Sleeping Kogoro for sure today.

267
00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:04.765
I'm sorry to say this, but that won't be possible.

268
00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:10.165
Look at the car that the woman was in.

269
00:18:10.165 --> 00:18:14.365
The door is sealed tight from the inside of the car with masking tape.

270
00:18:14.365 --> 00:18:17.165
There is a portable charcoal stove by the passenger's seat

271
00:18:17.165 --> 00:18:19.465
with burned remains of solid fuel.

272
00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:21.565
The woman was carried out of the car

273
00:18:21.565 --> 00:18:24.365
after cracking the windshield with a metal bat.

274
00:18:24.365 --> 00:18:27.165
Because that was the only way to get in or out of the car.

275
00:18:27.165 --> 00:18:31.965
In other words, this is carbon monoxide poisoning,

276
00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:34.265
that was carried out by burning solid fuel in a sealed car.

277
00:18:34.265 --> 00:18:37.365
There's no doubt that she committed suicide.

278
00:18:37.365 --> 00:18:38.765
-What? -What?

279
00:18:38.765 --> 00:18:40.665
-It means we don't get to see... -It means we don't get to see...

280
00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:43.565
-the Sleeping Kogoro at work? -the Sleeping Kogoro at work?

281
00:18:43.565 --> 00:18:45.565
Who is this young lad?

282
00:18:45.565 --> 00:18:51.065
Oh, he's just a high school fan that came along with us.

283
00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:52.365
A fan of Mr. Mouri?

284
00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:53.465
Yes, sir!

285
00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.365
How do you do? I'm Eisuke Hondo!

286
00:18:56.365 --> 00:18:59.165
This is the first time I'm meeting a real police detective,

287
00:18:59.165 --> 00:19:00.365
so I'm really excited!

288
00:19:01.665 --> 00:19:04.965
I'm Officer Yamamura of the Gunma Police Department.

289
00:19:04.965 --> 00:19:07.865
You can call me Mr. Yama.

290
00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:11.465
They make a great pair.

291
00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:18.265
-Mr. Yamamura. -Yes?

292
00:19:18.265 --> 00:19:22.365
Sleeping drug was detected from the canned coffee on the car floor.

293
00:19:22.365 --> 00:19:23.965
A sleeping drug?

294
00:19:23.965 --> 00:19:28.465
Anxious of whether she could really die or not,

295
00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:30.765
I think she drank it just be sure she would succeed.

296
00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:32.465
I see!

297
00:19:32.465 --> 00:19:33.865
If so...

298
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:39.065
the woman must've had really bad sleeping posture.

299
00:19:39.065 --> 00:19:40.365
What?

300
00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:43.865
She was sitting nicely in the driver's seat, wasn't she?

301
00:19:43.865 --> 00:19:50.465
But I saw a folded part on the top of her clothes near her hips.

302
00:19:50.465 --> 00:19:51.765
She would most likely be bothered

303
00:19:51.765 --> 00:19:54.565
if she was sitting nicely and fix it right away.

304
00:19:54.565 --> 00:19:59.165
So the crease was probably made while she was asleep, right?

305
00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.965
It seems to have been so.

306
00:20:01.965 --> 00:20:05.165
And the same goes for the driver's seat.

307
00:20:05.165 --> 00:20:06.165
What?

308
00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:09.965
Come with me, Ran.

309
00:20:11.065 --> 00:20:12.465
Okay.

310
00:20:12.465 --> 00:20:14.265
Bend down beside the car

311
00:20:14.265 --> 00:20:16.065
and pretend that you're holding the steering wheel.

312
00:20:16.065 --> 00:20:17.565
Oh, okay.

313
00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:21.265
Like this?

314
00:20:21.265 --> 00:20:25.965
See? The woman was in the same position that Ran is now,

315
00:20:25.965 --> 00:20:28.365
so isn't the seat too far back for her?

316
00:20:28.365 --> 00:20:30.365
Maybe she had bad sleeping posture

317
00:20:30.365 --> 00:20:32.765
so she pushed her seat back before going to sleep.

318
00:20:35.165 --> 00:20:36.265
It's true.

319
00:20:36.265 --> 00:20:40.565
The seat is too far back for the woman to have been driving.

320
00:20:40.565 --> 00:20:43.865
Isn't that probably because she moved the seat back

321
00:20:43.865 --> 00:20:46.165
in order to place the portable charcoal stove at the feet?

322
00:20:46.165 --> 00:20:47.565
I see.

323
00:20:47.565 --> 00:20:49.765
She put it at her feet,

324
00:20:49.765 --> 00:20:52.365
but moved it over to the passenger's seat because it was too hot.

325
00:20:52.365 --> 00:20:54.965
By the way, who are you?

326
00:20:54.965 --> 00:20:56.065
Right.

327
00:20:56.065 --> 00:20:59.065
I was dating the woman who committed suicide in this car.

328
00:20:59.065 --> 00:21:01.465
I'm Atsushi Misumi.

329
00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:03.965
I'm so sorry. My condolences.

330
00:21:03.965 --> 00:21:08.365
And? Did she have bad sleeping posture?

331
00:21:08.365 --> 00:21:09.465
Yes.

332
00:21:09.465 --> 00:21:12.365
She didn't have very good sleeping posture.

333
00:21:12.365 --> 00:21:13.865
I see.

334
00:21:13.865 --> 00:21:16.865
Then it is suicide after all.

335
00:21:16.865 --> 00:21:18.465
I guess so.

336
00:21:27.865 --> 00:21:29.265
No.

337
00:21:29.265 --> 00:21:32.765
This is cleverly schemed homicide that was set up to look as suicide.

338
00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:35.465
Moreover, the culprit is probably...

339
00:21:35.465 --> 00:21:37.565
that man.

340
00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:39.965
But I don't understand.

341
00:21:39.965 --> 00:21:43.765
How did he get out of the sealed car?

342
00:22:02.465 --> 00:22:06.765
The car was sealed tightly from the inside with masking tape.

343
00:22:06.765 --> 00:22:10.165
And to keep her in the seat...

344
00:22:10.165 --> 00:22:13.865
What kind of trick did he use?

345
00:23:44.865 --> 00:23:46.365
"Next Episode"

346
00:23:46.365 --> 00:23:49.965
That all absorbing attitude as if to despise everyone is indeed

347
00:23:49.965 --> 00:23:51.565
the Sleeping Kogoro!

348
00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:53.665
Wait a second.

349
00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:55.065
That masking tape...

350
00:24:00.065 --> 00:24:02.065
Doesn't it bother you?

351
00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:03.265
What?

352
00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:05.165
Next to Mr. Mouri...

353
00:24:05.165 --> 00:24:06.865
Oh, you mean Conan?

354
00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:14.865
Next Conan, "The Point of No Return (Part 2)"

355
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.750
Next Conan's Hint:

356
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.150
"Bandage"

357
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.250
I have a stomachache so give me bandage.

358
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.350
I don't think it will cure your stomachache.

359
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.650
Is that so?
