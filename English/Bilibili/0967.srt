1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,450
A producer was murdered at
the new Nichiuri TV building.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,450
Hattori Heiji and I identified the murderers,
but the case took a surprising turn.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,040
A connection emerged between the murder
victim and a man who died in Kyoto.

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:23,030
Meanwhile, another explosion
occurred in Osaka Nanko,

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,030
claiming yet another victim.

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,140
Kyoto-Osaka Serial Bombing Investigation HQ

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,470
The Osaka police's efforts uncovered
an important suspect, but...

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,850
The Osaka police's efforts uncovered
an important suspect, but...

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,310
Ishizawa Katsuji (38)
The Osaka police's efforts uncovered
an important suspect, but...

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,430
Hey, are you all right?

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,840
Hang in there! Who did this?

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,410
This man...

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,760
It's Ishizawa!

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,840
What's going on?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,610
The rhythm on my lips is footloose!

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,440
The rhythm of my detective
skills is perfect!

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,220
An important suspect becomes a victim!

18
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,320
The bombing cases reach
their critical moment!

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,870
Always determining the one truth

20
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,670
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,010
his name is Detective Conan!

Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba

23
00:02:56,591 --> 00:03:00,711
"Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba, Climax!"
Kaiju Gomera VS Kamen Yaiba

24
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:01,981

Naniwa Police Hospital

26
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:08,021
Doctor, what's Iwazawa's condition?

27
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,291
Ishizawa Katsuji (38)
Bombing Suspect
Doctor, what's Iwazawa's condition?

28
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:11,441
Ishizawa Katsuji (38)
Bombing Suspect

29
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,331
He has bruises all over his body.

30
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:17,341
Most of them are light,

31
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:20,841
but the problem is the blow
to the back of his head.

32
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:23,331
It's a bit troubling.

33
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:28,331
He'll live, but he'll need
total bed rest for a while.

34
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,831
Has he regained consciousness?

35
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:33,461
We'd like to question him a little.

36
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:36,111
Were you listening to what I said?

37
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,221
You won't be able to
question him for a while.

38
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,041
Isn't there something you can do?

39
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,801
He's a suspect in an important case.

40
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,361
There's nothing to be done.

41
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,561
If he dies, you'll have nothing.

42
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:52,721
In any case, for now he needs total rest,
and he's not receiving any visitors.

43
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,711
Got it?

44
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,981
Hey, mister.

45
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:02,741
Huh?

46
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:08,441
Shouldn't we check out Iwazawa-san's house
one more time before returning to the hotel?

47
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,321
I'm tired.

48
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:13,991
I'm going back to the hotel, taking
a shower, and having a drink.

49
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:18,801
You're saying Ishizawa's condition didn't
make the great Mori Kogoro feel anything?

50
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:19,511
Huh?

51
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:25,921
If Ishizawa is the serial bomber,
who was keeping him locked up?

52
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,901
Why was Ishizawa covered in bruises?

53
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,021
There's a lot of curious mysteries.

54
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,781
Once Ishizawa regains consciousness—

55
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,151
You're sure you want to
wait for a confession?

56
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,491
Aren't you a great detective?

57
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:42,411
Fine, fine.

58
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:46,131
But we're just taking a
quick look and then leaving.

59
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:46,811
Okay.

60
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,021
I'll see you later.

61
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:48,501
Got it.

62
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:51,881
He's not coming with us?

63
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:55,051
He's taking his bike to Kyoto.

64
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,261
Kyoto? To do what?

65
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,641
Who knows?

66
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:04,641
Anyway, forensics searched his whole
house and didn't find anything.

67
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:08,521
What am I supposed to find?

68
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:08,871
Yonekura Isato Murdered

69
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:11,901
Isn't it a detective's
job to figure that out?
Yonekura Isato Murdered

70
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:13,181
I guess.

71
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,901
What a filthy kitchen.

72
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:20,401
Now this is what you call a bachelor pad.

73
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,661
Ishizawa-san was found here?

74
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,841
Yeah.

75
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:29,241
Where was Ishizawa-san being locked up?

76
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:33,091
I think it was his room on the second floor.

77
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:37,671
Apparently he was held
here for a couple of days.

78
00:05:38,331 --> 00:05:40,511
They left him without
anything to eat or drink.

79
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:45,311
Hey, mister. The lock on this door is broken.

80
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,561
Ishizawa probably kicked it open.

81
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:53,191
Once he left his room,

82
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:58,401
he slipped on the stairs and fell down.

83
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,411
That's when he got all those cuts
and bruises all over his body.

84
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,911
Probably.

85
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,291
I wonder what Ishizawa-san
was doing in the kitchen.

86
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,611
Isn't it obvious?

87
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:17,421
He was looking for a knife or something
to cut the ropes binding him.

88
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:22,211
But look. The front door is right
at the bottom of the stairs.

89
00:06:22,211 --> 00:06:25,401
He would've been saved immediately
if he left through the front door,

90
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,441
so why did he go to the kitchen?

91
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:31,961
He was probably out of his mind.

92
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:35,311
After all, he'd been locked in
a room without food or drink.

93
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:38,821
Now that we've checked
the place out, let's go.

94
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:39,541
Yonekura Isato Murdered

95
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,571
This is probably why.
Yonekura Isato Murdered

96
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,181
But what about this?

97
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,581
Haibara Ai
Message Received

98
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:56,711
Didn't I ask for okonomiyaki?

99
00:06:56,981 --> 00:07:00,461
Sorry. I don't know where to get one.

100
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,551
Where's the high school
detective of the west?

101
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:05,591
We're acting separately for now.

102
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,221
You should've asked him.

103
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,051
Yeah.

104
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:13,221
Didn't he promise to treat me to okonomiyaki?

105
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:20,731
Now then.

106
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,601
This place is bigger than I thought.

107
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,551
It's all right.

108
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:37,291
Uh, Haibara? More importantly...

109
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:41,071
The data you asked for is right here.

110
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,251
Thanks.

111
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,361
Of the four you mentioned,

112
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:49,411
I haven't had time for Ishizawa
who you tacked on later,

113
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:53,641
but that's almost certainly how
the other three are connected.

114
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,181
I see.

115
00:07:57,181 --> 00:08:01,331
Yonekura-san, Suemura-san, and Onda-san

116
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:04,651
all carried large amounts
of debt at one point.

117
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:10,911
And all three of them paid off
their debts exactly ten years ago.

118
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,631
Smells fishy.

119
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:19,301
I thought you'd say that, so I also picked
up unsolved cases from the year before.

120
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,921
Good thinking, Haibara.

121
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:24,461
But there was only a single case

122
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:29,301
committed by four suspects for an amount
that would've paid off all their debts.

123
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,351
120 Million Yen Stolen!!
Multiple Suspects?
committed by four suspects for an amount
that would've paid off all their debts.

124
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:31,221
120 Million Yen Stolen!!
Multiple Suspects?

125
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:36,311
The culprits broke into the mansion
by blowing up the back door.

126
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:41,141
After tying up the couple that owned
the house and two of their employees,

127
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,111
they stole 120 million yen in cash and fled.

128
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,841
That's odd.

129
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,911
Right?

130
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:55,011
But if the four current victims
were the culprits in this robbery,

131
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:58,001
how is that connected to the current case?

132
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:04,041
I doubt the victims from ten years
ago are getting their revenge now.

133
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:10,201
Normally you'd assume they had a falling out.

134
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,781
But it was ten years ago.

135
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,351
Why now?

136
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,371
A lot can happen in ten years.

137
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:21,981
Some will succeed, while others will fail.

138
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,211
You're right. A lot can happen.

139
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:30,671
Ten years ago, I never thought
I'd end up like this.

140
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:36,471
Oh, right. That reminds me...

141
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:41,921
Onda recently had a failed investment
and was on the verge of bankruptcy.

142
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:45,291
That's it! At least, I wish I could say that.

143
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:51,771
The problem is that everyone connected
to the case has already been killed.

144
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:53,551
There's nothing you can do.

145
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,431
There are four big questions.

146
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:02,941
Onda-san had two cars, so why was only
one of them rigged with explosives?

147
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:09,601
Why didn't the bomb in Yonekura-san's
car have a detonator or timer?

148
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:15,071
How did the culprit know Suemura-san
would go to that warehouse?

149
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:20,291
Why was Ishizawa-san locked inside his
room and abandoned for several days?

150
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,661
And then there's one more.

151
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,761
Will there be a fourth bombing?

152
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:37,141
I'll give you ten minutes.

153
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,951
Any more than that will tax the patient.

154
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,401
Understood.

155
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:42,641
Okay, Ishizawa-san.

156
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,181
I'll have a nurse wait outside.

157
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,181
Let them know if you need anything.

158
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,021
Okay.

159
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:51,191
You'd better stick to the time limit.

160
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:52,471
Okay.

161
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:55,451
Thanks for the food.

162
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:57,411
Hey.

163
00:10:57,411 --> 00:10:58,371
Huh?

164
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:02,941
These bombings are pretty
sloppy, aren't they?

165
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:04,121
Sloppy?

166
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:09,141
Of the three bomb plots,
only the third succeeded.

167
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:13,281
The first exploded on a different
day than originally planned,

168
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:17,021
and someone else killed the
target of the second, right?

169
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:18,221
Yeah.

170
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,491
Once the first two out of three plans failed,

171
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:28,231
wouldn't you normally postpone the
third and come up with a new one?

172
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:32,131
The culprit must either be really confident,

173
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:35,911
or there must be some reason they
couldn't postpone their plan.

174
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:39,371
That's it. So that's how it is!

175
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:40,371
Huh?

176
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:42,341
Thanks, Haibara.

177
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:44,471
You can have my takoyaki.

178
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,371
What?

179
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:47,981
Or should I go get you some more?

180
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:48,861
What?

181
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:50,501
Hattori?

182
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,871
I know what you need to look for.

183
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,498
Gomera has risen out of the Osaka
Bay and is headed straight this way!

184
00:12:10,118 --> 00:12:11,458
Cut!

185
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:14,418
We're checking the footage.

186
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:18,198
Watching this is so exciting.

187
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,138
Yeah. Real actors are so cool.

188
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:24,678
Maybe I'll become an actor, too.

189
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:25,378
What?

190
00:12:25,698 --> 00:12:29,368
Maybe I'll be in a tiger drama.

191
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:31,978
It's Taiga, not tiger.

192
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:33,548
Genta-kun, you can do it.

193
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:36,368
Is something wrong, Kazuha-chan?

194
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:40,808
Maybe I got carried away.

195
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:42,188
You're worried about Hattori-kun?

196
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,468
Gomera and Yaiba were right in front of me.

197
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:46,318
I couldn't help myself.

198
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:49,948
It's all right. I'm sure he understands.

199
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:52,818
Oh, there you are.

200
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:54,458
Kosugi-san?

201
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:58,558
There's something I'd like you to do for me.

202
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,878
What? You want us to audition?

203
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:06,998
It's an audition, but
it's not that big a deal.

204
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:11,458
We were supposed to select some
actors to appear in the movie

205
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,708
at yesterday's public announcement,

206
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:20,918
but two people dropped out after what
happened with Yonekura-san's case.

207
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:21,638
So...

208
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:24,318
But we're not...

209
00:13:24,318 --> 00:13:27,398
Yes, yes, yes! I'll do it!

210
00:13:28,038 --> 00:13:29,148
Really?

211
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:33,408
I'd do anything to appear in
a movie with Gomera and Yaiba!

212
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:34,988
Osaka Police HQ

213
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:36,278
I see.

214
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:39,408
I thought we could confirm
before the meeting,

215
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:43,538
but Ishizawa won't talk.

216
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:46,918
He just keeps repeating that
he doesn't know anything.

217
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,298
It's odd, though.

218
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:54,788
He's protecting the person
who kept him locked up.

219
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:57,718
Come to think of it, I wonder
what Mori-san is doing.

220
00:13:57,718 --> 00:14:01,808
He said he'd return to his hotel
after stopping by Ishizawa's house.

221
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,058
I hope he finds something.

222
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:08,858
Come in.

223
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:10,438
Hello.

224
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:13,948
Mori-san, we've been waiting for you.

225
00:14:14,258 --> 00:14:16,208
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:20,588
I only meant to take a quick break at
the hotel, but ended up oversleeping.

227
00:14:20,588 --> 00:14:23,458
How was your visit to Ishizawa's house?

228
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:27,668
There's nothing to say.

229
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:29,838
Mori-san?
Absolutely nothing came of...

230
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:32,198
Nothing came of it...

231
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:37,848
Since I went right after forensics searched
the place, I wasn't expecting much,

232
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:41,848
but I discovered something confusing
about Ishizawa-san's actions.

233
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:45,868
What was confusing about his actions?

234
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:51,288
First, I'd like to know your opinion on the
situation as an Osaka police investigator.

235
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:54,988
We're remaining silent,

236
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,368
but we believe Ishizawa Katsuji
committed the bombings.

237
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:04,278
He plotted to murder Yonekura and the
others to get revenge for the past.

238
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,308
Then who locked up Ishizawa?

239
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:09,748
We suspect he's putting on an act.

240
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:11,558
For what reason?

241
00:15:11,558 --> 00:15:15,738
Didn't he want us to think
there was another culprit?

242
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:18,658
The police were catching up to him.

243
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:24,188
But Ishizawa's name only came up yesterday.

244
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:27,588
Did he have time to set that up?

245
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:29,048
Well...

246
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,768
And concerning Onda-san's murder,

247
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:37,858
he had two cars which he drove
on alternating days, correct?

248
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:41,778
Yes. On even days he drove the red one,
and on odd days he drove the blue one.

249
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:45,878
But he died on an odd numbered day.

250
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:50,538
That's because the blue car happened
to be having mechanical problems.

251
00:15:50,888 --> 00:15:54,918
That coincidence was the
first question I had.

252
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:59,888
If the culprit wanted to kill
Onda-san as soon as possible,

253
00:15:59,888 --> 00:16:02,808
he would have rigged both
cars with explosives.

254
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:08,688
But the culprit deliberately chose the
red car and installed a bomb in it.

255
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:13,938
In other words, the culprit wanted
Onda-san to die in the red car

256
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,068
on an even day.

257
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:20,568
Next, there's Suemura-san's case.

258
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:25,608
The bomb was placed in the abandoned
factory beforehand, right?

259
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:31,958
The bomb was placed inside a box and
set to explode if it was opened.

260
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:37,328
How did the culprit know Suemura-san
would be the one to open the box?

261
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:39,278
It happened at an abandoned factory.

262
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,468
No one else would come.

263
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:45,498
Then how did they know Suemura-san
would go to an abandoned factory

264
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:48,598
that no one else would go to?

265
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:54,988
And why did the culprit do something as
dangerous as leaving a bomb there beforehand?

266
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:57,108
So they'd have an alibi.

267
00:16:57,538 --> 00:17:02,358
They'd be far away by the
time the bomb exploded.

268
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:04,868
That's it.

269
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,038
That's why it was just the red car.

270
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,398
They wanted an alibi for when
Onda-san's car exploded.

271
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:17,938
Onda-san was supposed to die a day later,

272
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:22,128
on the day of the movie's
production announcement.

273
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:25,198
Of the people involved,

274
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:28,888
there was one man who'd have an alibi for
that day and the day Suemura-san died,

275
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:34,308
as well as the authority to make
Suemura-san go to the warehouse.

276
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,688
It was Yonekura.

277
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:40,238
But there was a bomb in Yonekura's car, too.

278
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:41,948
About that bomb...

279
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,978
Neither a timer nor a
detonator has been found.

280
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:46,698
In other words,

281
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:52,548
It was an explosive, but it wasn't
a bomb. Not yet, at least.

282
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:53,458
Not yet?

283
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:57,408
Yonekura-san probably intended
to go rig the explosive as a bomb

284
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:00,398
on his way to the airport
for his business trip,

285
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:05,338
after the production announcement.

286
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:08,588
Go rig the bomb? Where?

287
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,598
I see. So that's why he locked
Ishizawa inside his house.

288
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:18,878
He probably intended to blow
up Ishizawa and his house

289
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:22,608
with the bomb, and frame him for everything.

290
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:27,298
So it'd be treated as an accidental
explosion caused by the bomber himself.

291
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:28,678
But it's possible...

292
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:33,408
Yonekura intended to
leave a bomb in his car,

293
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:37,888
and then blow it up in
the airport parking lot.

294
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:43,928
And he'd escape misfortune because
he happened to be on a business trip.

295
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,098
Do you recall their testimony?

296
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:53,928
Yonekura-san kept muttering Onda's name
while staring at the screen of his phone.

297
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:55,798
I see.

298
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:59,968
He was so distressed that
Onda had died a day early

299
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:03,938
that he couldn't get out of
the way of the falling kaiju.

300
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:08,568
But what was his motive?

301
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:14,078
This is where the strange actions
taken by Ishizawa-san come in.

302
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:19,588
Ishizawa-san kicked open the
door and escaped his prison,

303
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:23,378
but he slipped on the stairs and fell.

304
00:19:23,688 --> 00:19:29,038
But the front door was just across
from the stairs he fell down.

305
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:34,138
Why did Ishizawa-san go into the
kitchen where he was discovered

306
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:38,338
instead of leaving through the
front door and seeking help?

307
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:43,568
The answer was in a
newspaper in the entryway.

308
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:44,018
Yonekura Isato Murdered

309
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:48,458
It had been delivered while
Ishizawa-san was locked up.
Yonekura Isato Murdered

310
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,058
Yonekura Isato Murdered

311
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:52,198
An article on Yonekura-san's murder
was all over the front page.
Yonekura Isato Murdered

312
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:55,698
Ishizawa-san had a thought.

313
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:01,378
If he sought help from the police, he'd be
questioned about Yonekura-san's bombing,

314
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:05,908
and his past deeds could be exposed.

315
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,338
His past deeds?

316
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:13,718
Ten years ago, four men stole
120 million yen in Kobe.

317
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:18,978
I-Impossible. They're
the suspects in that case?

318
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:24,268
My investigation revealed
that Yonekura-san, Onda-san,

319
00:20:24,268 --> 00:20:28,558
and Suemura-san all paid off
large debts ten years ago.

320
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:29,358
What?

321
00:20:29,848 --> 00:20:34,338
Not only that, but recently
Onda-san had a failed investment,

322
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:36,748
and he was in debt once again.

323
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:42,938
So Yonekura planned to kill everyone involved

324
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:46,058
because Onda was blackmailing him?

325
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:49,758
But there's nothing we can do without proof.

326
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:53,768
The proof should be arriving shortly.

327
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,418
I finally found it.

328
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:00,938
It was hard to find since
the mansion was so huge.

329
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,188
What are you doing? We're in a meeting!

330
00:21:04,448 --> 00:21:06,568
I was just doing as Kud—

331
00:21:08,428 --> 00:21:12,858
As Mori-han asked and looking
for evidence in Onda's house.

332
00:21:13,478 --> 00:21:14,988
Kumori-han?

333
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:20,578
There should be concrete evidence
on this disc right here.

334
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:25,538
Team Yonekura

335
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:49,738
Hey, Takashi! Are you listening?

336
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:53,468
I'm listening. Right, Katsuji?

337
00:22:53,468 --> 00:22:55,258
Yone won't shut up.

338
00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:56,908
The one they called Takashi is Onda,
and the man next to him is Ishizawa.

339
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,118
Let's go over it one more time.
The one they called Takashi is Onda,
and the man next to him is Ishizawa.

340
00:22:58,118 --> 00:22:59,298
The one they called Takashi is Onda,
and the man next to him is Ishizawa.

341
00:22:59,298 --> 00:22:59,888
Once we arrive, Takashi and
Katsuji will go to the back door.
The one they called Takashi is Onda,
and the man next to him is Ishizawa.

342
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:02,268
And the other man is Yonekura.
Once we arrive, Takashi and
Katsuji will go to the back door.

343
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:04,788
Then Ryohei-san will...

344
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:08,258
Hey! What are you filming for, you idiot?!

345
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:08,848
Who cares, Yone?

346
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:10,508
Ryohei must be Suemura.
Who cares, Yone?

347
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:11,708
Yeah.
Ryohei must be Suemura.

348
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,278
Yeah.

349
00:23:12,878 --> 00:23:15,958
If we copy this video and distribute
it to everyone, no one can betray us.

350
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,878
All right. This is it.
If we copy this video and distribute
it to everyone, no one can betray us.

351
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:17,928
All right. This is it.

352
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:19,228
We should contact the
Hyogo police immediately.

353
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:20,798
Exactly.
We should contact the
Hyogo police immediately.

354
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:20,858
Wait!
Exactly.

355
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:21,638
Wait!

356
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:24,558
This is bad news.

357
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:26,288
What's bad?

358
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,208
Look at the screen.

359
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:31,038
There are four men in the shot, right?

360
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,098
Yeah.

361
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:33,838
What about it?

362
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:37,338
Then who's shooting the video?

363
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:41,628
So there were five robbers.

364
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,348
Yeah.

365
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,728
Which means in the presence
of the final man...

366
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,478
It's already been set.

367
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,768
A bomb that could go off at any time.
