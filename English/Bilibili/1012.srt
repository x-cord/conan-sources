1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,130
Th-This house...

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:08,840
That's right.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,490
It's the villa you built with the money
you scammed from stupid women like me.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,910
The love nest you've been
sharing with some bitch.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,250
Fukikoshi Toji (42)

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,660
Fukikoshi Toji (42)
I-It's not like that with her.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:22,940
I-It's not like that with her.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,330
Y-You've got it all wrong, honey.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,190
What a shame.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,380
Your excuses won't reach my ears.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,460
Make all the excuses you
want in the afterlife.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,740
Goodbye, darling.

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,940
We came to Gunma prefecture to pick
wild plants with Kobayashi-sensei

14
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,150
and Wakasa-sensei of
Teitan Elementary School.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,180
Zenda Maika-san, who quit her teaching
job at the elementary school

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,520
the previous week to get married,
took us into the mountains.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,420
However, while we were looking elsewhere,
someone abandoned the body of a man there.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,340
That man was Zenda-san's fiancé.

19
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,510
Did someone really move the body

20
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,420
while we were picking wild plants?

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,410
The dirt on Zenda-san's right arm is odd.

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,830
As well as all the cardboard
boxes in her car.

23
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:55,700
And then there's the four-leaf
clover Ayumi-chan lost track of.

24
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,210
A journey of a thousand miles
starts with the first step!

25
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,620
Solve 1,000 mysteries and enter a new world!

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,610
We encounter a case in the woods of Gunma!

27
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,530
Where did that four-leaf clover go?

28
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,070
Always determining the one truth

29
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,980
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

30
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,680
his name is Detective Conan!

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,490
Picking Wild Plants and Clovers
(Part Two)

32
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,630
Picking Wild Plants and Clovers
(Part Two)
"Picking Wild Plants and Clovers, Part Two!"

33
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,010
Picking Wild Plants and Clovers
(Part Two)

34
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,940
Wow. Somebody built a grand villa here.

35
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,080
Yes, sir.

36
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,620
And in front of the gate,
there's a bloodstain?

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Yes. It would seem that this
was the scene of the murder.

38
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,820
The weapon was probably a
20 cm-long kitchen knife.

39
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,580
It was wrapped in newspaper and left
in a garbage bag inside the villa.

40
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,550
And? Was anyone inside the house?

41
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,460
Yes.

42
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,960
Inside a closet, we found a rather weak
woman whose hands were covered in blood.

43
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,340
What? A-A woman?

44
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,170
She's currently being taken to
the station for questioning.

45
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,720
She says she's Uruma Shigefumi's girlfriend

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,830
but had nothing to do with the murder.

47
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,690
She remembers last night
up until she had some wine.

48
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,580
When she woke up, she was
trapped inside the closet.

49
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,360
Her fear of dark cramped spaces made
her panic, so she couldn't get out.

50
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,110
Ah, right.

51
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,740
"So dark! So cramped! So scary!"

52
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,110
You mean that thing.

53
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,710
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,370
But there wasn't any wine in the
villa, and the closet wasn't locked.

55
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,670
It's possible that she's making it up.

56
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,380
I had a high school classmate with
a fear of dark cramped spaces.

57
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,880
It seemed pretty questionable.

58
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,630
And besides, this place is less than 50 meters
away from where the body was discovered.

59
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,890
A woman would be strong enough
to drag the body there.

60
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,410
In other words, that woman got into a
fight with the victim and killed him,

61
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,650
but she didn't know what to do with the body.

62
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,910
Some people picking wild
plants showed up in a car.

63
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,450
Among them was a woman the
victim was trying to con.

64
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,640
Believing she could frame that woman,

65
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,210
she dragged the body to the car.

66
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,460
But the body was found
sooner than she expected,

67
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,210
and the police arrived right away,

68
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,880
so she hid herself inside the closet.

69
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,460
How does that sound, huh?

70
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,720
Sounds good to me.

71
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,520
I don't think that's right.

72
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,220
What?

73
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:16,820
After all, that woman's hands were
covered in that man's blood, right?

74
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,100
Y-Yeah.

75
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:24,500
If a weak woman wanted to drag a
body, she'd carry it by the legs.

76
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,490
But there weren't any bloody
hand prints on the body's pants.

77
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,740
You're right.

78
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,990
Wait a minute.

79
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,420
You shouldn't be wandering
around the crime scene.

80
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,350
Sensei.

81
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,970
Please keep an eye on your children.

82
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,680
C-Conan-kun?

83
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,980
Jeez. He's just like the old man.

84
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,400
A four-leaf clover?

85
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,820
Wait a minute.

86
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,320
If this is the four-leaf
clover Ayumi-chan found...

87
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,330
Then all those unassembled
cardboard boxes in the car,

88
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,100
and the dirt on her right
arm up to her elbow...

89
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,840
Could it be?

90
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,600
I knew it.

91
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,260
There are tire tracks behind the tires.

92
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,390
I'm certain of it.

93
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,980
She's the culprit.

94
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,980
Zenda Maika (38)

95
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,610
Zenda Maika (38)
She brought us here so we would find it.

96
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,410
She brought us here so we would find it.

97
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,500
This body that she made
appear, as though by magic.

98
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,110
There's a lot about this case that's puzzling,
but when you came here and parked your car,

99
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,430
as this photo shows, there
wasn't anything beside the car.

100
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,160
If the body was placed against the tree
behind the car while you were picking wild plants,

101
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,470
then while you were distracted
by your plant harvesting,

102
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,390
someone must have secretly
left the body here.

103
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,370
Since the victim attempted
to con you with marriage fraud,

104
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,150
Since the victim attempted
to con you with marriage fraud,
Wanted
For Fraud Committed
in a Broad Area
Uruma
Shigefumi

105
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,440
Wanted
For Fraud Committed
in a Broad Area
Uruma
Shigefumi

106
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,200
they must've meant to frame you.

107
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,840
No...

108
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,700
So have you figured out who the culprit is?

109
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,720
Yes.

110
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,800
It was probably the woman claiming
to be the victim's girlfriend

111
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,700
who we found hiding inside the closet of
the victim's villa through these woods.

112
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,930
But weren't that woman's
hands covered in blood?

113
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,600
If she moved the body, her bloody
hand prints should be on it.

114
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,900
Yes, you mentioned that earlier.

115
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,620
She probably washed her hands
before moving the body.

116
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,490
But since the police arrived
sooner than she anticipated,

117
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,380
she panicked and accidentally touched
the bloody knife with her bare hands

118
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,030
while putting it in a trash bag.

119
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,960
But if she had time to do that,
wouldn't she have fled the scene?

120
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm telling you, she panicked.

121
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,050
In any case, we'll handle the
rest of this investigation.

122
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,800
You all are free to leave for the day.

123
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,300
I don't have a choice.

124
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,310
I didn't want to use this in
front of Wakasa-sensei, but...

125
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,680
Hey, Inspector Yamamura.

126
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,370
Over here.

127
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,060
What is it?

128
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
It's right here.

129
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,110
Look closely.

130
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,900
What am I supposed to be—

131
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,980
Inspector Yamamura?

132
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,870
Wake up. Are you okay?

133
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,340
I-Is something the matter, Inspector?

134
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,500
You're damn right something's the matter.

135
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,500
I set up the joke for you guys,
but you didn't correct me.

136
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,550
What? That was a joke?

137
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,260
Yes.

138
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,010
The idea that the culprit left the body here
while they were picking wild plants is a huge joke.

139
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,590
After all,

140
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,580
the body was right here where
I'm sitting now the whole time.

141
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,000
What?!

142
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,240
Over here.

143
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,860
What is it?

144
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,670
It's right here.

145
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,870
Look closely.

146
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,120
What am I supposed to be—

147
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,820
Inspector Yamamura?

148
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,670
Wake up. Are you okay?

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,220
I-Is something the matter, Inspector?

150
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,300
You're damn right something's the matter.

151
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,310
I set up the joke for you guys,
but you didn't correct me.

152
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,370
What? That was a joke?

153
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,060
Yes.

154
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,820
The idea that the culprit left the body here
while they were picking wild plants is a huge joke.

155
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,420
After all,

156
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,380
the body was right here where
I'm sitting now the whole time.

157
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,950
What?!

158
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,580
Naturally, it was here long before
they came to pick wild plants.

159
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,980
Didn't you just say there wasn't
anything here before we arrived?

160
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,080
Liar.

161
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,050
You're trying to confuse everyone by
making things up again, aren't you?

162
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,930
I love cashews, but I hate being confused.

163
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,270
Inspector Yamamura, they have
a terrible opinion of you.

164
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,140
Besides, didn't you check it earlier?

165
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:57,940
There wasn't a body in the
photo we took when we arrived.

166
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,150
So why?

167
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,290
Of course it wasn't in the photo.

168
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,040
What?

169
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,900
At that time, the body was
hidden behind the car.

170
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,800
Wh-What are you talking about?

171
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,920
Are you saying someone moved the car
while we were picking wild plants?

172
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,500
Remember what we said?

173
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,890
We didn't hear the sound
of the car's engine then.

174
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,110
It's possible to move a car
without starting the engine,

175
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,930
even for a little girl like you.

176
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,960
A picture is worth a thousand words.

177
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,310
Why don't we perform an experiment?

178
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:34,540
You there.

179
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes, sir.

180
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,290
Could you borrow the car
keys and do as I say?

181
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,320
Yes, sir.

182
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,950
Also, make sure you write down my
deduction so we don't forget it.

183
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,660
Yes, sir. The keys, please.

184
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,960
Once you're seated in the driver's seat,

185
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,960
insert the car keys in the ignition.

186
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:01,460
Turn the key to the "ON" position
one step before "START."

187
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,860
Depress the brake pedal while
unlocking the gearshift

188
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,970
and shift from park to neutral.

189
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,970
Once you've done that, you
can get out of the car.

190
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,970
Leave the key in the ignition.

191
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,310
Yes, sir.

192
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,980
Now we're ready to begin. Kobayashi-sensei.

193
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,920
Yes?

194
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,210
Could you please move the car towards me?

195
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,980
I can't do that.

196
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,740
I don't have a license.

197
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,370
It's all right.

198
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,500
Simply put your hand on top
of the front tire and push it.

199
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,560
Push the tire?

200
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,240
I don't think this will work.

201
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,110
It moved.

202
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,850
Kobayashi-sensei, you're so strong.

203
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,340
But how?

204
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,490
The tires are linked together.

205
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,610
You can easily move all of them with
only the strength required to move one.

206
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,330
So when you took that photo when you arrived,

207
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,620
the body was probably hidden
behind the car like this.

208
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,920
Then the tree that was behind the car
when we took the photo was that tree.

209
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,960
Yes.

210
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,940
And to prove it,

211
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,040
the thing Ayumi-chan was looking for
is right next to the front tire.

212
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,890
The thing I was looking for?

213
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,490
Is next to the front tire?

214
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,330
It's the four-leaf clover!

215
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,280
Seriously?

216
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,900
But what is it doing here?

217
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,870
The reason you couldn't find it earlier,
no matter how hard you looked for it,

218
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,870
was because the car had moved slightly.

219
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:03,250
In other words, this is where the car
was parked when you took that photo.

220
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,880
Another piece of evidence...

221
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:12,260
is the tire tracks left behind the rear
tires when the car was moved forward.

222
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,640
I asked the forensics
team to take some photos.

223
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,270
There's only one person
who could have done this.

224
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,610
Only one person who could've
parked the car here,

225
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,780
and pushed the front tire to move the car.

226
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,130
Zenda Maika-san, it could only have been you.

227
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,290
First, roughly six hours ago,

228
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,040
you took the victim to his villa
roughly 50 meters from here

229
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,340
and stabbed him with a knife.

230
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,180
You dragged the body through the woods,

231
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,810
and left it here where I'm leaning now.

232
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,990
Then you picked up Conan-kun
and his classmates,

233
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,630
who came to check things out
for their wild plant picking class,

234
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,020
in your car and parked it in its current
position so the body would be hidden.

235
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:15,660
B-But, Inspector, wouldn't the people inside
the car see the body when the car was parked?

236
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,660
Not a problem. Look closely
at the car windows.

237
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,160
The rear and right side windows specifically.

238
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,350
Rear and side windows?

239
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,300
Something's covering them.

240
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,210
Those are unassembled cardboard boxes.

241
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,850
By leaving lots of them on the car seat,

242
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,540
she could have them move them out of the way

243
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,630
by placing them against the
windows and block them that way.

244
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,450
After parking the car here, Zenda-san
left the car in neutral instead of park,

245
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:56,700
turned off the engine, and left the key
in the ignition when she exited the car.

246
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,030
Once she took a photo that made it look
like there was no body next to the car,

247
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,460
she was ready to go.

248
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,170
She simply waited for someone
to say they were thirsty,

249
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,420
and invited a child to go with her
to retrieve the drinks in the car.

250
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,170
After getting the bags containing
the drinks out of the car,

251
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,430
she claimed to have lost her earring.

252
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,230
While pretending to look for
her earring with the child,

253
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,230
she used her right hand to turn
the tire and slowly move the car,

254
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,940
making the body appear as though by magic.

255
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,570
Kobayashi-sensei, you have dirt on your
left arm up to your elbow, don't you?

256
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,710
What?

257
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,350
Yes, I do. How did this happen?

258
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,830
It's because you used your
left hand to rotate the tire.

259
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:51,710
There should be a similar
stain on Zenda-san's elbow.

260
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,720
There should be mud on her right elbow
because she used her right hand to rotate the tire.

261
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,220
A very strange stain to acquire if all she was
doing was searching for an earring on the ground.

262
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,140
Additionally, you're probably also the
person who trapped the victim's girlfriend

263
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,480
inside the closet at the his villa.

264
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,980
You heard about her love of wine
and fear of dark, cramped places.

265
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,070
You knew the victim you were
meeting early this morning

266
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,910
probably wouldn't drink the wine,

267
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,750
so last night you gave him the drugged wine

268
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,510
knowing only she would
drink it and fall asleep.

269
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,260
After stabbing the victim, you
used his key to enter the villa,

270
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,300
wiped the victim's blood on
the sleeping woman's hands,

271
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,510
and stuffed her inside the closet.

272
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,100
That way, even if she woke up,

273
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,090
her fear of dark, cramped places

274
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,180
would keep her trapped inside the
closet until the police found her.

275
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,650
By leaving the knife in a garbage bag at
the villa and taking the wine with you,

276
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,830
you ruined the credibility of her statement

277
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,850
and were able to frame her.

278
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,850
Judging by how much the victim bled,

279
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,040
the culprit was probably
covered in his blood.

280
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,580
When you killed him, if you drove
this car here with the victim,

281
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,050
it should probably turn up
somewhere on the driver's seat.

282
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,430
Wiping the seat down isn't enough
to get rid of a luminol reaction.

283
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,930
Am I wrong?

284
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,550
You're wrong!

285
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,440
Zenda-sensei really was
looking for her earring!

286
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,570
The car didn't move then!

287
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,830
I wanted to... I wanted
to give this four-leaf clover

288
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,370
to Zenda-sensei...

289
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,390
There's no way she did it!

290
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,430
Yoshida-san.

291
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,710
I'm sorry, Yoshida-san.

292
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,760
I can't accept your four-leaf clover.

293
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm a bad person who took someone's life.

294
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,090
I don't deserve good fortune
before I'm punished for that.

295
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,480
So you should give that to
someone you want to make happy.

296
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,210
Zenda-sensei, are you saying
you really killed that man?

297
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,790
Yes.

298
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,540
Because I realized he was a con
artist who commits marriage fraud,

299
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,930
I plotted to kill him and
frame his girlfriend for it.

300
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,800
But... quitting my teaching
job was the right choice.

301
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,010
I used a child to fabricate
an alibi for my own crime.

302
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,170
I've failed as a teacher.

303
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,610
Huh? What happened to the case?

304
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,380
What are you talking about?

305
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,670
You did an amazing job solving it, Inspector.

306
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,460
Right, Wakasa-sensei?

307
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,710
Yes, you really did.

308
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,620
What should I do with this clover?

309
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,420
Why don't you keep it?

310
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,310
Didn't Zenda-sensei say you
should give it to someone?

311
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,470
Yes, someone who you want to make happy.

312
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,110
Wakasa-sensei.

313
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,820
You can have this four-leaf
clover, Wakasa-sensei.

314
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,440
What?

315
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,470
After all, you're pretty
clumsy. It'll keep you safe.

316
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,950
Thank you.

317
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,950
I'll wrap it in my handkerchief.

318
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,480
I'll treasure this.

319
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,460
Okay.

320
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,840
Anyway, I wonder where Conan went.

321
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,230
I saw him hiding behind the
tree with the inspector.

322
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,340
He must be trying to steal
a march on us again.
