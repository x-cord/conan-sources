1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.599
But please keep this a secret from everyone.

2
00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.499
He's going to curse you to death if you tell.

3
00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:07.199
What? Cursed to death?

4
00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:09.199
That's what I tell all my fans.

5
00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.299
I mean, it really doesn't match for a devil

6
00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.099
to have a hobby like origami, does it?

7
00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.399
Oh, I see.

8
00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.299
Were you here all the while

9
00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:19.199
before these children came to see you?

10
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.399
Yeah, I ate take-out lunch,

11
00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.199
took a quick nap, and started folding origami after that.

12
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.799
Which means you were here at the TV station way earlier than scheduled?

13
00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:33.499
I was in the dressing waiting room by 11:00.

14
00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.399
I asked my manager to order take-out food

15
00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.299
and to go get me some stuff right away.

16
00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:41.199
Yes, when I came back, I saw the children

17
00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.499
just about to go into Satan's room,

18
00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.199
so at first I stopped them.

19
00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:46.299
Because I was told not to wake him

20
00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.599
until time to go into the studio at 14:00.

21
00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:49.899
I see.

22
00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.399
Which means you have no alibi

23
00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.499
at the time of the crime.

24
00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:58.699
That's right. I couldn't have done it.

25
00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.899
If I leave this dressing room with this face,

26
00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.999
I would sure stand out, wouldn't I?

27
00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.199
Why don't you gather all the guys at the TV station

28
00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.899
and ask them if they've seen me around the time in question?

29
00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.799
But if he takes off his make-up

30
00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.799
and walks around without anything on...

31
00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.499
I see, he could've walked around the TV station without make-up,

32
00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.099
headed for the reception room,

33
00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.099
and return to his room

34
00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:20.099
after committing the crime then put on his make-up.

35
00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:21.899
I don't think that's possible.

36
00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.499
What do you mean?

37
00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:26.399
Does it take a lot of time to put make-up on?

38
00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.399
No, it only takes at most about 30 minutes.

39
00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.899
Either way, there's no mirror in this dressing room.

40
00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:36.199
Mirror?

41
00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:37.399
There's no mirror?

42
00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.299
There seems to be a leading actor who doesn't like mirrors,

43
00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.099
that are two or three rooms in at this station with no mirrors.

44
00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:47.899
Satan always uses that place over there.

45
00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.199
I don't like mirrors either.

46
00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:52.699
Especially big ones.

47
00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:55.999
Would you like to take a look at the dressing room?

48
00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:06.599
It's true that there's no mirror on the wall.

49
00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.199
Inspector!

50
00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.299
There's one here!

51
00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.099
But this mirror is what I just bought a while ago.

52
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.799
And something that I handed over to Satan

53
00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.399
when I came into this room with the children.

54
00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.699
Please tell me where that store is.

55
00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.299
I'll go confirm.

56
00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.299
Okay.

57
00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.399
Also, if you would, please let us investigate the dressing room

58
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.999
and Satan's belongings,

59
00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.999
as well as his person.

60
00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.499
Sure, go ahead.

61
00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:42.599
In the bag... There seems to be make-up cosmetics.

62
00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.499
There is no mirror.

63
00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.099
He doesn't seem to have any on him.

64
00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:51.999
What's with this dirty top and cap?

65
00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.899
It says "Akumaya" on the chest part?

66
00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.899
I'm using that for the scene of the talk show

67
00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.999
that I'm going to be appearing on today, so I brought it with me.

68
00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.699
During my live shows I usually do a stand-up comedy

69
00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.199
with the other members between songs.

70
00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.099
Hello, we're the Akumaya.

71
00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.399
We've come to bring you misfortune.

72
00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:09.799
Like so.

73
00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.899
Officer Takagi, will you go confirm this with the program staff?

74
00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:13.899
Yes, sir.

75
00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.599
By the way, I use that make-up kit

76
00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.699
to fix my make-up when I'm on air.

77
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.799
If it's to do a slight touch up,

78
00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.899
all I have to do is borrow the make-up of the women staff

79
00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.799
and fix myself up.

80
00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.699
Well, I don't perspire that much,

81
00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.599
so I don't really need to touch up too frequently.

82
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.599
But it seems that your purple lipstick

83
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.599
doesn't stay on all that long.

84
00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.099
That cigarette butt

85
00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.599
with purple lipstick on the filter.

86
00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.699
The same color is here and there on the autograph sheet

87
00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.799
that you autographed for Mitsuhiko too.

88
00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.099
That's true. How come?

89
00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.499
Back then, Satan held

90
00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.299
the cap of the pen in his mouth and autographed the sheet, right?

91
00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.899
That's why the color of his lipstick

92
00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.499
smeared off on your hand

93
00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.099
from the pen he returned to you, Mitsuhiko.

94
00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.799
And since you were holding the autograph sheet all the while,

95
00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.499
the color smeared onto the sheet too.

96
00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.499
-Is that so? -I see!

97
00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.099
Oh, but strange.

98
00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.499
There are no purple smears on the take-out lunch dishes,

99
00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:08.299
chopsticks or spoon that you ate your lunch with.

100
00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.499
And yet they are all things you bring to your mouth.

101
00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.299
I wonder why?

102
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.999
It... it's true, that's strange.

103
00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:19.099
I lightly wipe off my lipstick when I eat lunch.

104
00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.999
I don't like the color smearing off on my chopsticks and dishes.

105
00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:25.999
Besides, lipstick is not hard to put back on even without a mirror.

106
00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:28.699
Then is that color around your eyes also lipstick?

107
00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.899
It's the same purple color.

108
00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.099
It's not lipstick,

109
00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.899
but color made by the same manufacturer.

110
00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.299
Of course I need to use a mirror to put this on, though.

111
00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:40.699
Well, if there's a person who can put this on without using a mirror...

112
00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.699
That person for sure is either, really god or the devil!

113
00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.399
I guess so.

114
00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:48.699
You like that purple color, don't you, Mr. Devil?

115
00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.899
Yeah, I've liked it since the Indies days.

116
00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:54.899
This color can only be made by this manufacturer.

117
00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.599
Since today's job is not a live performance,

118
00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.799
the white on my face and gray on my cheeks

119
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.199
are water based-type foundation that are easy to get a hold of.

120
00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.599
Is anything the matter?

121
00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.499
Satan's got dry eye

122
00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:09.899
because he's wearing contacts.

123
00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:13.799
-Here, eye drops. -No, I'm fine.

124
00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.699
But your eyes are red.

125
00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.299
I'm telling you that I'm fine!

126
00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:21.199
Just leave me alone, will you?

127
00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:24.999
Really. No mirror was found in this room,

128
00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.599
in my bag or when I was body checked,

129
00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.499
so how do you propose I put on my make-up?

130
00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:31.599
Take-out delivery lunch.

131
00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.699
Let's say that after committing the crime,

132
00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.199
you gave the mirror that you used to fix your make-up

133
00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.699
to one of the men who delivered the food here.

134
00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.299
Then all would be okay, right?

135
00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:55.799
If that method were used, it's possible.

136
00:05:55.799 --> 00:05:57.799
It's not possible.

137
00:05:57.799 --> 00:06:00.499
I asked the guard about it.

138
00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:03.299
He said that the only delivery service that came before 14:00

139
00:06:03.299 --> 00:06:04.699
were only those three lunch deliveries,

140
00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.999
and moreover, they all arrived at around 12:00.

141
00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.999
I already confirmed it just in case,

142
00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:12.199
but all three deliveries brought food at around 12:00,

143
00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.399
and Satan seems to have told all of them

144
00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.499
to come get the dishes at sundown.

145
00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.499
So, the dishes haven't been retrieved yet.

146
00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:21.299
And all three deliverymen said that when they delivered the meal,

147
00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:23.199
Satan was wearing his usual make-up

148
00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.699
and nothing was out of the ordinary.

149
00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.699
If the delivery services came before the crime was committed,

150
00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.699
it would be impossible to give him a mirror after the crime.

151
00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.499
The only possibility left is when the AD came to get him,

152
00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.699
and on the way rushing over to the reception room,

153
00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.799
he threw the mirror that he had on him away.

154
00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:43.399
I don't think that's possible.

155
00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:45.299
I was watching with these very eyes.

156
00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:47.699
All Satan did was run.

157
00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.099
I see.

158
00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:55.399
And the manager bought the mirror at about 12:30 noon.

159
00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:56.999
To get here to Nichiuri TV,

160
00:06:56.999 --> 00:06:59.299
it would take at least one hour even by car.

161
00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:01.699
It would be impossible to deliver it beforehand.

162
00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.899
The delivery boy costume

163
00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:07.099
was unmistakably scheduled to be used on the program.

164
00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.399
And the TV station got the outfit for him too.

165
00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:13.299
But were they really going to shoot a program of him

166
00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:14.399
wearing that make-up in delivery man's outfit?

167
00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.199
Everybody seemed to like it when we did a live performance though.

168
00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:18.599
My head is completely reset,

169
00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:20.699
so wearing a cap won't throw it out of place either.

170
00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.699
Come to think of it, where did you change into that devil look?

171
00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.499
Were you already dressed like that when you came to the dressing room?

172
00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:27.899
At home!

173
00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:29.399
I completed everything at home

174
00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.499
and came here by car.

175
00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:33.799
I parked the car in the parking lot and came right up here.

176
00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:36.499
Of course, my manager kept my bag for me.

177
00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:38.299
It doesn't look right for me to be carrying a bag

178
00:07:38.299 --> 00:07:39.799
looking like this, you see.

179
00:07:39.799 --> 00:07:43.099
When you were folding origami, were you smoking?

180
00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:44.699
Yeah. When I do things requiring detail,

181
00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:46.299
I smoke, at times.

182
00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.899
Bug you?

183
00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:53.199
Not at all. I was just wondering.

184
00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:55.199
He's lying.

185
00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:57.099
This man is lying.

186
00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:57.824
so I was contacting everybody's residence by public phone.

187
00:09:57.824 --> 00:09:59.224
Officer.

188
00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:01.924
Haven't you got your answer already?

189
00:10:01.924 --> 00:10:03.424
If I walk around the TV station looking like this,

190
00:10:03.424 --> 00:10:06.924
someone is bound to notice.

191
00:10:06.924 --> 00:10:08.024
Like I said a while ago,

192
00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:10.624
if I killed the boss...

193
00:10:10.624 --> 00:10:12.624
In order to go to the reception room two floors up,

194
00:10:12.624 --> 00:10:14.624
I'd have to remove my make-up once

195
00:10:14.624 --> 00:10:16.124
and come back here after committing the crime,

196
00:10:16.124 --> 00:10:18.624
then put my make-up back on again.

197
00:10:18.624 --> 00:10:19.924
But look,

198
00:10:19.924 --> 00:10:22.424
there is no mirror in this dressing room.

199
00:10:22.424 --> 00:10:24.024
Of course there is none in my bag,

200
00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:26.424
or anywhere on me!

201
00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:30.124
The only mirror there is, is the one my manager went out to get for me.

202
00:10:30.124 --> 00:10:31.424
That's the only mirror there is,

203
00:10:31.424 --> 00:10:33.624
but it was given to me after the crime, wasn't it?

204
00:10:33.624 --> 00:10:35.924
I already had make-up on at that time.

205
00:10:35.924 --> 00:10:38.024
I looked just like this, right?

206
00:10:38.024 --> 00:10:40.024
Yes, not only did I see him,

207
00:10:40.024 --> 00:10:42.424
but the children were there too.

208
00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:45.824
I can't draw this face without a mirror.

209
00:10:45.824 --> 00:10:46.824
You're right.

210
00:10:46.824 --> 00:10:49.824
If so, ever since I came to this TV station today,

211
00:10:49.824 --> 00:10:53.324
I looked this way right through.

212
00:10:53.324 --> 00:10:58.024
So, leave me alone to grieve over the death of my boss.

213
00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:01.324
I can't cry in front of people being that I'm a devil.

214
00:11:01.324 --> 00:11:02.624
You're right.

215
00:11:02.624 --> 00:11:04.024
Okay, then.

216
00:11:04.024 --> 00:11:06.524
At least let me take off my make-up.

217
00:11:06.524 --> 00:11:08.624
All I need is three minutes.

218
00:11:08.624 --> 00:11:10.024
If it's not my face,

219
00:11:10.024 --> 00:11:13.324
nobody would know it's me even if I shed tears.

220
00:11:13.324 --> 00:11:14.524
I see.

221
00:11:14.524 --> 00:11:18.424
You're planning to remove it along with your make-up?

222
00:11:18.424 --> 00:11:24.824
The evidence that had turned you into a real devil...

223
00:11:24.824 --> 00:11:28.024
The scarlet red trace of crime!

224
00:13:00.324 --> 00:13:02.724
Hey! Gramps.

225
00:13:02.724 --> 00:13:05.024
He's using my voice again without permission.

226
00:13:05.024 --> 00:13:06.724
What sort of joke is this supposed to be?

227
00:13:06.724 --> 00:13:08.024
It's not funny.

228
00:13:08.024 --> 00:13:10.824
It's true that you couldn't go with that appearance of yours,

229
00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:12.524
but if you remove your make-up

230
00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:14.524
and wear the outfit of the deliveryman,

231
00:13:14.524 --> 00:13:17.124
no one would notice that it's you.

232
00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:21.324
That's why you ordered three different dishes from three different shops.

233
00:13:21.324 --> 00:13:22.624
In other words, just around the time of the crime,

234
00:13:22.624 --> 00:13:23.386
three deliverymen would be going in and out of here.

235
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:23.503
his face would be shadowed out of view.

236
00:13:23.503 --> 00:13:25.003
Besides, the murder was committed in the afternoon,

237
00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:26.803
when not much can be reflected on the glass.

238
00:13:26.803 --> 00:13:28.403
I've figured it out!

239
00:13:28.403 --> 00:13:31.403
The killer didn't use glass.

240
00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:32.703
He used that ruler!

241
00:13:34.203 --> 00:13:37.403
-Ruler? -But how?

242
00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:40.303
The same way as the window glass!

243
00:13:40.303 --> 00:13:43.103
All he has to do is use this origami to make it night time.

244
00:13:43.103 --> 00:13:46.203
What? Will that really make a mirror?

245
00:13:46.203 --> 00:13:47.703
Try it! Try it!

246
00:13:47.703 --> 00:13:50.603
Things like window glass and transparent plastic

247
00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:54.903
are always reflecting light and projecting something.

248
00:13:54.903 --> 00:13:56.603
Nothing's reflected, though.

249
00:13:56.603 --> 00:13:58.703
That's just because the light on this side is strong

250
00:13:58.703 --> 00:14:00.303
and it isn't clearly visible.

251
00:14:00.303 --> 00:14:01.803
But if you use black origami like this

252
00:14:01.803 --> 00:14:05.503
and block the light coming from this side...

253
00:14:05.503 --> 00:14:07.103
You can really see!

254
00:14:09.903 --> 00:14:11.203
It's true! Wow!

255
00:14:11.203 --> 00:14:13.003
It's just like a mirror!

256
00:14:13.003 --> 00:14:15.703
By the way, since a thing that is reflected on the window glass at night

257
00:14:15.703 --> 00:14:17.103
will become shadowed,

258
00:14:17.103 --> 00:14:19.603
it is hard to make out since it is dark.

259
00:14:19.603 --> 00:14:21.703
But the thing that is reflected,

260
00:14:21.703 --> 00:14:23.603
unlike the genuine one is monotone.

261
00:14:23.603 --> 00:14:25.903
It's hard to make out color this way.

262
00:14:25.903 --> 00:14:29.703
Then, maybe this silver color should be used.

263
00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:32.703
See, this way, you can tell the colors apart.

264
00:14:32.703 --> 00:14:35.103
But it's blurred and hard to see.

265
00:14:35.103 --> 00:14:38.803
The color silver originally has the power to reflect things.

266
00:14:38.803 --> 00:14:40.803
But since the surface of the paper is not smooth,

267
00:14:40.803 --> 00:14:42.603
it looks blurred.

268
00:14:42.603 --> 00:14:45.103
Besides, there's no need to make out color.

269
00:14:45.103 --> 00:14:47.603
Satan's make-up only requires coloring the same places

270
00:14:47.603 --> 00:14:49.503
with the respective corresponding colors.

271
00:14:49.503 --> 00:14:50.703
I see.

272
00:14:50.703 --> 00:14:52.903
Then he can put on make-up here.

273
00:14:52.903 --> 00:14:55.803
Yes. In other words, Satan's crime began

274
00:14:55.803 --> 00:14:59.103
right after the three delivery lunches that he ordered were delivered.

275
00:14:59.103 --> 00:15:00.903
He removes his make-up immediately,

276
00:15:00.903 --> 00:15:02.803
and goes to the reception room where the president is,

277
00:15:02.803 --> 00:15:04.203
wearing his delivery man's outfit.

278
00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:06.203
Then, after killing him, rushes back here,

279
00:15:06.203 --> 00:15:09.603
uses the ruler mirror that he made to put his make-up back on,

280
00:15:09.603 --> 00:15:13.303
and waits for the manager to come wake him up.

281
00:15:13.303 --> 00:15:15.003
But if so,

282
00:15:15.003 --> 00:15:16.703
there should be a lot of the president's blood

283
00:15:16.703 --> 00:15:20.203
splattered on the delivery man's outfit.

284
00:15:20.203 --> 00:15:23.703
I'm sure he probably got some other clothing ready.

285
00:15:23.703 --> 00:15:27.003
Let's say, maybe something like a hooded raincoat.

286
00:15:27.003 --> 00:15:29.403
Okay! Dispatch the investigation crew and look for it!

287
00:15:29.403 --> 00:15:30.803
Yes, sir!

288
00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:35.603
Who cares, even if you find something like that.

289
00:15:35.603 --> 00:15:38.503
I didn't do it, and besides, you don't have proof either.

290
00:15:38.503 --> 00:15:41.403
I made a mirror using origami and a ruler, you say.

291
00:15:41.403 --> 00:15:43.303
That's news to me.

292
00:15:43.303 --> 00:15:45.903
All I was doing in this room was make paper cranes

293
00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:49.503
while waiting for my manager to come, and that's it!

294
00:15:49.503 --> 00:15:53.803
If so, won't you fold and make another paper crane for me?

295
00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:54.803
What?

296
00:15:54.803 --> 00:15:57.303
If you want, you may smoke too.

297
00:15:57.303 --> 00:16:00.903
You get the urge to smoke when doing detailed work, don't you?

298
00:16:00.903 --> 00:16:02.403
Don't be silly.

299
00:16:02.403 --> 00:16:04.703
I could never fold a paper crane in this situation.

300
00:16:04.703 --> 00:16:07.603
Then, Ayumi, please make one for him, will you?

301
00:16:07.603 --> 00:16:08.803
Okay.

302
00:16:08.803 --> 00:16:11.803
First, you make a triangle.

303
00:16:11.803 --> 00:16:13.803
Then, you go like this.

304
00:16:13.803 --> 00:16:16.303
You're good, Ayumi.

305
00:16:16.303 --> 00:16:17.903
Because when Daddy was in the hospital,

306
00:16:17.903 --> 00:16:19.903
I made a lot of cranes together with mommy.

307
00:16:19.903 --> 00:16:22.503
Here, all done.

308
00:16:22.503 --> 00:16:24.003
It's a well-made crane,

309
00:16:24.003 --> 00:16:26.503
but it's skinny and doesn't look too energetic.

310
00:16:26.503 --> 00:16:27.803
Oh, I see.

311
00:16:30.003 --> 00:16:32.403
I see, that's right.

312
00:16:32.403 --> 00:16:34.103
In order to make the crane fat,

313
00:16:34.103 --> 00:16:36.103
you must blow air into.

314
00:16:36.103 --> 00:16:37.103
If the crane was placed against your lips,

315
00:16:37.103 --> 00:16:38.903
the lipstick should come off onto the crane.

316
00:16:38.903 --> 00:16:41.003
Just like the cigarette stubs in the astray.

317
00:16:41.003 --> 00:16:43.803
But none of it was found on your cranes.

318
00:16:43.803 --> 00:16:48.503
In other words, those aren't the cranes that he folded today, right?

319
00:16:48.503 --> 00:16:51.703
Dr. Agasa, what're you persuading yourself for?

320
00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:56.003
It seems that either Satan doesn't know how to fold cranes,

321
00:16:56.003 --> 00:16:58.503
or has forgotten how to.

322
00:16:58.503 --> 00:17:02.103
Either way, those cranes were folded beforehand

323
00:17:02.103 --> 00:17:05.303
in order to camouflage the mirror trick.

324
00:17:05.303 --> 00:17:07.303
By the way, he went out of his way to tell the police

325
00:17:07.303 --> 00:17:09.103
that he also feels hate towards his boss

326
00:17:09.103 --> 00:17:10.703
so that they would suspect him

327
00:17:10.703 --> 00:17:13.703
and investigate the dressing room right away,

328
00:17:13.703 --> 00:17:16.503
and find that there is no mirror around.

329
00:17:16.503 --> 00:17:18.003
He didn't want to dilly-dally

330
00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:20.303
because the three shops that delivered the food

331
00:17:20.303 --> 00:17:22.403
may come to retrieve the dishes.

332
00:17:22.403 --> 00:17:23.603
If they come, the fact that there is no mirror in the room

333
00:17:23.603 --> 00:17:24.903
may be thrown into obscurity.

334
00:17:24.903 --> 00:17:28.003
That's why he wanted them to come get the dishes at sundown.

335
00:17:28.003 --> 00:17:32.203
He did so to make time for us to check the room!

336
00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:33.303
It... it's a lie!

337
00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:36.403
Satan would never kill, no way.

338
00:17:36.403 --> 00:17:39.503
Then, let's have him remove his make-up right now

339
00:17:39.503 --> 00:17:42.203
and show us his face.

340
00:17:42.203 --> 00:17:43.903
Sure, okay!

341
00:17:43.903 --> 00:17:45.903
Satan, go ahead and remove your make-up!

342
00:17:47.603 --> 00:17:51.103
Satan?

343
00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:54.003
Sorry, but I can't do that, manager.

344
00:17:55.703 --> 00:17:58.403
Because if I take off this devil's mask,

345
00:17:58.403 --> 00:18:02.403
under it will be the wretched face of a killer.

346
00:18:02.403 --> 00:18:03.903
No, don't tell me that...

347
00:18:05.603 --> 00:18:07.703
You know, don't you? About three years ago,

348
00:18:07.703 --> 00:18:12.503
when I hurt my throat during a tour and was hospitalized.

349
00:18:12.503 --> 00:18:16.303
Back then, there was a child who used to come visit me every day.

350
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:17.303
There used to always be a small box

351
00:18:17.303 --> 00:18:20.103
with a crane inside it, each time she came.

352
00:18:20.103 --> 00:18:23.703
She believed that I was a real devil.

353
00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:27.003
I always looked forward to reading her letters.

354
00:18:27.003 --> 00:18:28.103
But suddenly one day,

355
00:18:28.103 --> 00:18:32.003
the letters from that girl stopped coming.

356
00:18:32.003 --> 00:18:36.003
Back then, I thought that she had just gotten tired of me.

357
00:18:37.903 --> 00:18:40.803
But last month, when I went drinking with boss,

358
00:18:40.803 --> 00:18:43.003
I finally found out why.

359
00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:45.203
In his exact words, the boss said,

360
00:18:45.203 --> 00:18:47.203
"Wanna cause a stir again with sacrifice?"

361
00:18:47.203 --> 00:18:48.403
Sacrifice?

362
00:18:48.403 --> 00:18:52.103
Right. I was in the hospital and didn't know,

363
00:18:52.103 --> 00:18:54.003
but the boss wrote a comment in the band's official website,

364
00:18:54.003 --> 00:18:57.303
pretending to be me, without telling me about it.

365
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:59.903
He wrote, "It is necessary to make a sacrifice to recover my evil powers.

366
00:18:59.903 --> 00:19:01.603
I want blood."

367
00:19:01.603 --> 00:19:02.803
Don't... don't tell me

368
00:19:02.803 --> 00:19:05.103
that child who was your fan took it seriously and...

369
00:19:08.003 --> 00:19:12.003
Yeah, when I pressured him for an answer on the spot,

370
00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:13.503
he laughed and said the following.

371
00:19:13.503 --> 00:19:18.203
In the last letter it said, "I will happily give you my blood. Goodbye."

372
00:19:18.203 --> 00:19:20.703
The revival live that I performed six months later

373
00:19:20.703 --> 00:19:22.103
after being discharged from the hospital,

374
00:19:22.103 --> 00:19:25.403
was really hot over the fact that someone had taken her life for me.

375
00:19:25.403 --> 00:19:29.703
I looked for that girl's house right away and visited her residence.

376
00:19:29.703 --> 00:19:32.403
I found out that she died by killing herself over an unknown reason.

377
00:19:32.403 --> 00:19:35.203
Then, you killed him to avenge her death.

378
00:19:35.203 --> 00:19:37.003
Yeah, I did it.

379
00:19:37.003 --> 00:19:40.203
He thinks nothing of human life if for the sake of money.

380
00:19:40.203 --> 00:19:43.603
He even crushed my plans of holding a final live performance,

381
00:19:43.603 --> 00:19:45.403
telling me to pay for damages incurred

382
00:19:45.403 --> 00:19:48.303
if I quit before my contract is over!

383
00:19:49.603 --> 00:19:53.603
I killed the real devil!

384
00:19:53.603 --> 00:19:55.903
I mean although I seem to have my righteous reasons for doing what I did,

385
00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:58.003
the fact is, these past one to two years I've been in a slump.

386
00:19:58.003 --> 00:19:59.203
I've been annoyed

387
00:19:59.203 --> 00:20:03.203
and maybe the fact is, I just wanted to get everything over with.

388
00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:06.703
But my older sister was saying

389
00:20:06.703 --> 00:20:09.403
Styx III is going to revive for sure.

390
00:20:09.403 --> 00:20:11.903
She said that she was sure you'd be making a wondrous song

391
00:20:11.903 --> 00:20:13.403
that will give everyone energy again!

392
00:20:13.403 --> 00:20:15.303
I'm no good anymore.

393
00:20:15.303 --> 00:20:18.203
I used to frequently say, "I'll possess you" or "I'll curse you",

394
00:20:18.203 --> 00:20:20.303
"but I never ever said "die".

395
00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:21.603
The only one who says something like that,

396
00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:23.903
is the monster that comes on in the Kamen Yaiba show.

397
00:20:26.503 --> 00:20:30.403
I've fallen low to that level.

398
00:20:30.403 --> 00:20:31.503
But that's...

399
00:20:31.503 --> 00:20:34.603
Besides, after her letters stopped coming,

400
00:20:34.603 --> 00:20:36.103
I got to thinking.

401
00:20:36.103 --> 00:20:38.103
What did I do wrong,

402
00:20:38.103 --> 00:20:40.703
or what did she not like about me?

403
00:20:40.703 --> 00:20:43.803
When I started thinking this way, tears started pourings

404
00:20:43.803 --> 00:20:46.203
and I couldn't compose nor write lyrics.

405
00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:48.203
I couldn't write even a phrase.

406
00:20:48.203 --> 00:20:50.203
Phooey, talk about a fallen devil.

407
00:20:52.103 --> 00:20:54.403
Your tears are a bit red?

408
00:20:54.403 --> 00:20:57.403
That's President Urushibara's blood that splattered on him.

409
00:20:57.403 --> 00:20:58.403
Blood?

410
00:21:04.203 --> 00:21:07.403
You couldn't see colors very well using the ruler mirror, right?

411
00:21:07.403 --> 00:21:10.003
So, you put foundation

412
00:21:10.003 --> 00:21:12.803
right over the blood by your eyes without noticing.

413
00:21:12.803 --> 00:21:14.503
You noticed it only after

414
00:21:14.503 --> 00:21:17.603
your manager bought the mirror and gave it to you.

415
00:21:17.603 --> 00:21:20.203
That's why you couldn't use eye drops.

416
00:21:20.203 --> 00:21:21.903
Because if you did, the eye drop

417
00:21:21.903 --> 00:21:24.003
would wet the area around your eyes, resulting in conclusive evidence.

418
00:21:24.003 --> 00:21:26.103
-I see. -I see.

419
00:21:26.103 --> 00:21:28.003
Shall we go then?

420
00:21:30.103 --> 00:21:32.703
But it sure is like a fairy tale.

421
00:21:33.903 --> 00:21:36.303
Well, like they say,

422
00:21:36.303 --> 00:21:38.503
"When a devil sheds tears,

423
00:21:38.503 --> 00:21:41.003
he loses his evil powers".

424
00:23:12.603 --> 00:23:14.303
Now, something very shocking has happened!

425
00:23:14.303 --> 00:23:17.303
Ms. Kazuka Inoue, Yoko Okino and Azusa Yamamoto

426
00:23:17.303 --> 00:23:19.803
-have aligned in a row with nine correct answers! -You can do it!

427
00:23:19.803 --> 00:23:21.803
There is only one more question to go.

428
00:23:21.803 --> 00:23:23.803
If any one of the three answers correctly,

429
00:23:23.803 --> 00:23:25.303
she will be the winner!

430
00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:27.003
This program was shot

431
00:23:27.003 --> 00:23:29.903
when you went to the TV station the other day, right?

432
00:23:29.903 --> 00:23:32.703
Yes, but I didn't get to see Yoko after the incident,

433
00:23:32.703 --> 00:23:35.003
so I don't know how it turned out.

434
00:23:35.003 --> 00:23:36.703
What else can the result be,

435
00:23:36.703 --> 00:23:38.203
but Yoko answering ten questions correctly

436
00:23:38.203 --> 00:23:40.503
and winning first prize?

437
00:23:40.503 --> 00:23:43.003
Ms. Inoue, do you have confidence?

438
00:23:43.003 --> 00:23:45.603
I'll do my best!

439
00:23:45.603 --> 00:23:47.003
Ms. Okino.

440
00:23:47.003 --> 00:23:48.403
My fans out there.

441
00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:49.803
Root for me, okay?

442
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:52.203
Of course, of course! I'll root for you!

443
00:23:52.203 --> 00:23:54.103
Ms. Yamamoto?

444
00:23:54.103 --> 00:23:55.803
I will do my best!

445
00:23:55.803 --> 00:23:57.803
Here goes.

446
00:23:57.803 --> 00:23:59.403
Question number 10!

447
00:24:02.303 --> 00:24:05.003
Conan Doyle brings to mind Sherlock Holmes,

448
00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:07.903
Masashi Yokomizo brings to mind Kousuke Kindaiji.

449
00:24:07.903 --> 00:24:10.103
Then what does Ranpo Edogawa bring to mind?

450
00:24:12.703 --> 00:24:15.003
-She did it! -Yes, Ms. Okino.

451
00:24:19.003 --> 00:24:21.603
Akechi, Akechi!

452
00:24:21.603 --> 00:24:23.803
Too bad, Ms. Okino, you're disqualified.

453
00:24:23.803 --> 00:24:26.703
The top prize winners are Ms. Kazuka Inoue and Ms. Azusa Yamamoto!

454
00:24:26.703 --> 00:24:28.303
Let's give them a bit hand!

455
00:24:28.303 --> 00:24:31.103
-Congratulations! -Congratulations for both winner.

456
00:24:31.103 --> 00:24:32.303
Oh boy.

457
00:24:32.303 --> 00:24:35.103
How could she say such a name?

458
00:24:35.103 --> 00:24:37.603
Kogoro Mouri!

459
00:24:38.703 --> 00:24:40.803
How disappointing.

460
00:24:58.603 --> 00:25:00.403
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:25:00.403 --> 00:25:03.103
"Roma letters".

462
00:25:03.103 --> 00:25:04.603
The next episode involves a spider house.

463
00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:05.703
Are there going to be that many spies?

464
00:25:05.703 --> 00:25:07.803
He's talking about the insect!
