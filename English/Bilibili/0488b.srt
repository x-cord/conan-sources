1
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,779
The victim of the murder is Mr. Tenji Urushibara,

2
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,782
age 47, president of an entertainment production.

3
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:17,684
The estimated time of his death is around 13:00.

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,587
He died of loss of blood from a stab wound.

5
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,392
And, who first discovered the corpse?

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,094
Oh, me.

7
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,396
At 14:00, President Urushibara

8
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,999
and the producer of a program that I'm in charge of

9
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:36,103
was supposed to have a meeting in this reception room, but...

10
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,505
I came to tell him that the meeting would be later than scheduled.

11
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:41,608
That's when.

12
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,978
I contacted the police and ambulance right away.

13
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,382
As well as Satan, who just happened to be at this TV station

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,983
and belongs to the production run by the president.

15
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,385
Satan?

16
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,887
It's me.

17
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,090
What... what're you?

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,491
A Death God?

19
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,793
I'm Satan.

20
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,397
I'm Satan Onizuka, the vocal for Styx III!

21
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,500
Styx III? Santa Onizuka?

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,502
Wrong, Inspector!

23
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,704
Oh, I know you.

24
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:12,206
You're the one in the visual rock band

25
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,108
that used to be popular about 3 or 4 years ago.

26
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:17,911
Hey, hey. What do you mean "used to be"?

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,082
And, do you know if your boss was hated by anyone or not?

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,084
With a personality like his,

29
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,487
I'm sure there were many who hated him.

30
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,590
I was one of them too.

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,192
So then, let me ask you.

32
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,294
At the time of the crime, which was around 13:00,

33
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,497
where were you, and what were you doing?

34
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,198
I was in the dressing room at that time.

35
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,300
He was folding origami!

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,202
You guys?

37
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,906
That devil said he was folding origami!

38
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,307
Origami?

39
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,809
He made five paper cranes!

40
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,478
He seems to have been trying to kill time.

41
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,581
But please keep this a secret from everyone.

42
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,484
He's going to curse you to death if you tell.

43
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,187
What? Cursed to death?

44
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:02,189
That's what I tell all my fans.

45
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,291
I mean, it really doesn't match for a devil

46
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,093
to have a hobby like origami, does it?

47
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,395
Oh, I see.

48
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,297
Were you here all the while

49
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,199
before these children came to see you?

50
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,401
Yeah, I ate take-out lunch,

51
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,205
took a quick nap, and started folding origami after that.

52
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:23,810
Which means you were here at the TV station way earlier than scheduled?

53
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,480
I was in the dressing waiting room by 11:00.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,383
I asked my manager to order take-out food

55
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,285
and to go get me some stuff right away.

56
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:34,188
Yes, when I came back, I saw the children

57
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,490
just about to go into Satan's room,

58
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,192
so at first I stopped them.

59
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,293
Because I was told not to wake him

60
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,595
until time to go into the studio at 14:00.

61
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,896
I see.

62
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,399
Which means you have no alibi

63
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,502
at the time of the crime.

64
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,705
That's right. I couldn't have done it.

65
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,907
If I leave this dressing room with this face,

66
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,009
I would sure stand out, wouldn't I?

67
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,179
Why don't you gather all the guys at the TV station

68
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,883
and ask them if they've seen me around the time in question?

69
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,785
But if he takes off his make-up

70
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:05,786
and walks around without anything on...

71
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,488
I see, he could've walked around the TV station without make-up,

72
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,090
headed for the reception room,

73
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,091
and return to his room

74
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,093
after committing the crime then put on his make-up.

75
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,895
I don't think that's possible.

76
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,496
What do you mean?

77
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,399
Does it take a lot of time to put make-up on?

78
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,402
No, it only takes at most about 30 minutes.

79
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,906
Either way, there's no mirror in this dressing room.

80
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,209
Mirror?

81
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,410
There's no mirror?

82
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,281
There seems to be a leading actor who doesn't like mirrors,

83
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:38,085
that are two or three rooms in at this station with no mirrors.

84
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,887
Satan always uses that place over there.

85
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,190
I don't like mirrors either.

86
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,692
Especially big ones.

87
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,996
Would you like to take a look at the dressing room?

88
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,606
It's true that there's no mirror on the wall.

89
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,211
Inspector!

90
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,280
There's one here!

91
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,083
But this mirror is what I just bought a while ago.

92
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,786
And something that I handed over to Satan

93
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,388
when I came into this room with the children.

94
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,690
Please tell me where that store is.

95
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,292
I'll go confirm.

96
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,293
Okay.

97
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,396
Also, if you would, please let us investigate the dressing room

98
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,998
and Satan's belongings,

99
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,000
as well as his person.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,502
Sure, go ahead.

101
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:35,609
In the bag... There seems to be make-up cosmetics.

102
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,511
There is no mirror.

103
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,079
He doesn't seem to have any on him.

104
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,985
What's with this dirty top and cap?

105
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,888
It says "Akumaya" on the chest part?

106
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,890
I'm using that for the scene of the talk show

107
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,993
that I'm going to be appearing on today, so I brought it with me.

108
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,695
During my live shows I usually do a stand-up comedy

109
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,196
with the other members between songs.

110
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,098
Hello, we're the Akumaya.

111
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:00,400
We've come to bring you misfortune.

112
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,803
Like so.

113
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,906
Officer Takagi, will you go confirm this with the program staff?

114
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:06,907
Yes, sir.

115
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,608
By the way, I use that make-up kit

116
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,678
to fix my make-up when I'm on air.

117
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,779
If it's to do a slight touch up,

118
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,881
all I have to do is borrow the make-up of the women staff

119
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,783
and fix myself up.

120
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,685
Well, I don't perspire that much,

121
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,587
so I don't really need to touch up too frequently.

122
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,589
But it seems that your purple lipstick

123
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,591
doesn't stay on all that long.

124
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,094
That cigarette butt

125
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,596
with purple lipstick on the filter.

126
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,698
The same color is here and there on the autograph sheet

127
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,800
that you autographed for Mitsuhiko too.

128
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,103
That's true. How come?

129
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,504
Back then, Satan held

130
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,307
the cap of the pen in his mouth and autographed the sheet, right?

131
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,909
That's why the color of his lipstick

132
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,511
smeared off on your hand

133
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,080
from the pen he returned to you, Mitsuhiko.

134
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,782
And since you were holding the autograph sheet all the while,

135
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,485
the color smeared onto the sheet too.

136
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,487
-Is that so? -I see!

137
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,089
Oh, but strange.

138
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,492
There are no purple smears on the take-out lunch dishes,

139
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:01,294
chopsticks or spoon that you ate your lunch with.

140
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,497
And yet they are all things you bring to your mouth.

141
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,298
I wonder why?

142
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,001
It... it's true, that's strange.

143
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,105
I lightly wipe off my lipstick when I eat lunch.

144
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,008
I don't like the color smearing off on my chopsticks and dishes.

145
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,979
Besides, lipstick is not hard to put back on even without a mirror.

146
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,681
Then is that color around your eyes also lipstick?

147
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,884
It's the same purple color.

148
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,085
It's not lipstick,

149
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,887
but color made by the same manufacturer.

150
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,289
Of course I need to use a mirror to put this on, though.

151
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:33,693
Well, if there's a person who can put this on without using a mirror...

152
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,696
That person for sure is either, really god or the devil!

153
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,398
I guess so.

154
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,701
You like that purple color, don't you, Mr. Devil?

155
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,905
Yeah, I've liked it since the Indies days.

156
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,908
This color can only be made by this manufacturer.

157
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,610
Since today's job is not a live performance,

158
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,779
the white on my face and gray on my cheeks

159
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,183
are water based-type foundation that are easy to get a hold of.

160
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,586
Is anything the matter?

161
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,488
Satan's got dry eye

162
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,889
because he's wearing contacts.

163
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,793
-Here, eye drops. -No, I'm fine.

164
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,697
But your eyes are red.

165
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,299
I'm telling you that I'm fine!

166
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,201
Just leave me alone, will you?

167
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,004
Really. No mirror was found in this room,

168
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,607
in my bag or when I was body checked,

169
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,510
so how do you propose I put on my make-up?

170
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,611
Take-out delivery lunch.

171
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,683
Let's say that after committing the crime,

172
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,185
you gave the mirror that you used to fix your make-up

173
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:36,690
to one of the men who delivered the food here.

174
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,291
Then all would be okay, right?

175
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,802
If that method were used, it's possible.

176
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,804
It's not possible.

177
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,507
I asked the guard about it.

178
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,309
He said that the only delivery service that came before 14:00

179
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,711
were only those three lunch deliveries,

180
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,980
and moreover, they all arrived at around 12:00.

181
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,982
I already confirmed it just in case,

182
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,185
but all three deliveries brought food at around 12:00,

183
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,387
and Satan seems to have told all of them

184
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,489
to come get the dishes at sundown.

185
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,491
So, the dishes haven't been retrieved yet.

186
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,294
And all three deliverymen said that when they delivered the meal,

187
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,196
Satan was wearing his usual make-up

188
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,697
and nothing was out of the ordinary.

189
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,701
If the delivery services came before the crime was committed,

190
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,704
it would be impossible to give him a mirror after the crime.

191
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,507
The only possibility left is when the AD came to get him,

192
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,709
and on the way rushing over to the reception room,

193
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,779
he threw the mirror that he had on him away.

194
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,383
I don't think that's possible.

195
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:38,285
I was watching with these very eyes.

196
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,687
All Satan did was run.

197
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,088
I see.

198
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:48,395
And the manager bought the mirror at about 12:30 noon.

199
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,996
To get here to Nichiuri TV,

200
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,299
it would take at least one hour even by car.

201
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,701
It would be impossible to deliver it beforehand.

202
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,903
The delivery boy costume

203
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,106
was unmistakably scheduled to be used on the program.

204
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,411
And the TV station got the outfit for him too.

205
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,279
But were they really going to shoot a program of him

206
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,380
wearing that make-up in delivery man's outfit?

207
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,182
Everybody seemed to like it when we did a live performance though.

208
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,585
My head is completely reset,

209
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,687
so wearing a cap won't throw it out of place either.

210
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,690
Come to think of it, where did you change into that devil look?

211
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,492
Were you already dressed like that when you came to the dressing room?

212
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,894
At home!

213
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,395
I completed everything at home

214
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,496
and came here by car.

215
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,800
I parked the car in the parking lot and came right up here.

216
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,502
Of course, my manager kept my bag for me.

217
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,304
It doesn't look right for me to be carrying a bag

218
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,806
looking like this, you see.

219
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:36,109
When you were folding origami, were you smoking?

220
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,711
Yeah. When I do things requiring detail,

221
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,279
I smoke, at times.

222
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,880
Bug you?

223
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,186
Not at all. I was just wondering.

224
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,188
He's lying.

225
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,090
This man is lying.

226
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,310
The sun's already set.

227
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,511
Yes.

228
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,914
He must be the killer after all.

229
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:08,917
He probably removed his make-up once,

230
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,718
and went to the boss's room looking his normal self, then killed him.

231
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:13,822
He then put his make up back on and became the devil again.

232
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,424
The question is, where did he get a hold of the mirror

233
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:19,627
he needed to put on his make-up and where did he get rid of it?

234
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:23,131
Although there were several restrooms from here to the reception room,

235
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:26,634
if he uses the mirror there, people would undoubtedly see him.

236
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:29,204
If by chance, nobody saw him there,

237
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:31,306
if he passed this corridor looking the way he is,

238
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:34,209
somebody is sure to have remembered seeing him.

239
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:36,911
If he wears something over his head, he would stand out even more.

240
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,813
It's most natural to think that he came back here to this room

241
00:10:38,813 --> 00:10:42,217
and fixed his make-up.

242
00:10:42,217 --> 00:10:44,118
But there's one other thing that's also bothering me.

243
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,820
Those paper cranes.

244
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,422
He says that he couldn't commit the crime because he was folding them.

245
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:49,023
If he intends to use that as an alibi,

246
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,925
five cranes are too few a number to have finished folding.

247
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,026
Moreover, to establish his alibi,

248
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,728
he lined up what he already made and brought in here.

249
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:55,230
Which means that if any one of his cranes are squashed,

250
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,832
it would be plain to see.

251
00:10:57,832 --> 00:11:01,836
So, then, what is it? What meaning do the origami and cranes have?

252
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:05,607
Maybe this is the mirror.

253
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:06,608
See, this window,

254
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:10,612
the figures of Genta and Mitsuhiko can clearly be seen.

255
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:14,916
But take a very close look.

256
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,518
Where is your face, Young Lady?

257
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:20,521
See, it's dark so you can't see clearly, can you?

258
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,623
Yeah, it's true!

259
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:24,626
Getting closer to the mirror makes it dark so that you can't see well.

260
00:11:24,626 --> 00:11:27,228
The crime was committed around 13:00 in the afternoon.

261
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,930
It's still lighted outside.

262
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,933
It won't serve as a mirror unless it becomes dark, right?

263
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:37,005
I see. That's why he used the origami.

264
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,606
I finally figured out

265
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:41,309
the trick of how you returned back to your devil appearance!

266
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,512
Doc, where were you?

267
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:48,016
I'm sorry, my cell phone ran out of battery,

268
00:11:48,016 --> 00:11:50,818
so I was contacting everybody's residence by public phone.

269
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:52,220
Officer.

270
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,922
Haven't you got your answer already?

271
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,424
If I walk around the TV station looking like this,

272
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,927
someone is bound to notice.

273
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,029
Like I said a while ago,

274
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,631
if I killed the boss...

275
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:05,633
In order to go to the reception room two floors up,

276
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,635
I'd have to remove my make-up once

277
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,103
and come back here after committing the crime,

278
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,606
then put my make-up back on again.

279
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,907
But look,

280
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:15,410
there is no mirror in this dressing room.

281
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,011
Of course there is none in my bag,

282
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:19,414
or anywhere on me!

283
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:23,117
The only mirror there is, is the one my manager went out to get for me.

284
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,419
That's the only mirror there is,

285
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,621
but it was given to me after the crime, wasn't it?

286
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,923
I already had make-up on at that time.

287
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:31,025
I looked just like this, right?

288
00:12:31,025 --> 00:12:33,027
Yes, not only did I see him,

289
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:35,430
but the children were there too.

290
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,833
I can't draw this face without a mirror.

291
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,834
You're right.

292
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:42,804
If so, ever since I came to this TV station today,

293
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,307
I looked this way right through.

294
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:51,012
So, leave me alone to grieve over the death of my boss.

295
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:54,315
I can't cry in front of people being that I'm a devil.

296
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,616
You're right.

297
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:57,018
Okay, then.

298
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:59,520
At least let me take off my make-up.

299
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,622
All I need is three minutes.

300
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:03,024
If it's not my face,

301
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:06,327
nobody would know it's me even if I shed tears.

302
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,528
I see.

303
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:11,432
You're planning to remove it along with your make-up?

304
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:17,805
The evidence that had turned you into a real devil...

305
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:21,009
The scarlet red trace of crime!

306
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,334
Hey! Gramps.

307
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,636
He's using my voice again without permission.

308
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,338
What sort of joke is this supposed to be?

309
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:34,639
It's not funny.

310
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,442
It's true that you couldn't go with that appearance of yours,

311
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,143
but if you remove your make-up

312
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:41,145
and wear the outfit of the deliveryman,

313
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,748
no one would notice that it's you.

314
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:47,952
That's why you ordered three different dishes from three different shops.

315
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,253
In other words, just around the time of the crime,

316
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:53,358
three deliverymen would be going in and out of here.

317
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:56,761
You mixed yourself among them and committed the crime.

318
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:58,262
And if the clothing that each of the deliverymen

319
00:13:58,262 --> 00:13:59,964
are wearing similar the better.

320
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,265
The people who saw them,

321
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:04,035
wouldn't go out of their way to remember the face of each man.

322
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,136
Then, don't tell me

323
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,539
that the outfit of the delivery person that was in his bag back then was...

324
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:09,540
Right.

325
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,344
He used the outfit Akumaya that he was going to use on his talk show.

326
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:16,647
You're talking as if you saw what actually happened.

327
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,649
Exactly.

328
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,050
I was watching,

329
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,552
back then, at the queer delivery man who ran through

330
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:24,355
without holding any delivery box in hand.

331
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:26,557
"Rairaiken" -I see.

332
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:29,961
Any delivery man would normally be holding a delivery box.

333
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,963
Of course, when he comes and when he leaves.

334
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,165
But this is a TV station.

335
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,435
Maybe an actor wearing that sort of outfit happened to pass by?

336
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,937
I thought so for an instant too.

337
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:41,539
But no matter how small the role,

338
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:44,042
a little bit of make-up would be used.

339
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:47,345
However, that man didn't have any make-up on whatsoever.

340
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,547
More than anything else, in the view from under the cap,

341
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:51,449
was the back part of the man's head,

342
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,053
which was the same upside-down "V" mark as that of Satan.

343
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:59,357
But you have no evidence that the delivery man was I, do you?

344
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:02,860
There are some people with their hair shaved like mine, here and there.

345
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,563
The guy could even have been one of my fans.

346
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:10,635
Besides, even if I were able to come back after killing the boss,

347
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:13,838
how on earth do you propose I redid my make-up?

348
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:17,141
It's true that there's no mirror in this room.

349
00:15:17,141 --> 00:15:18,943
Then all you need to do is make one

350
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:20,945
by using a transparent plate.

351
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,346
Transparent.

352
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:23,347
Plate?

353
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:28,753
If you're talking about this glass window, it's impossible.

354
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,054
As the children mentioned earlier,

355
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,156
if you get close enough to put make-up on,

356
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,659
his face would be shadowed out of view.

357
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,160
Besides, the murder was committed in the afternoon,

358
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,962
when not much can be reflected on the glass.

359
00:15:37,962 --> 00:15:39,564
I've figured it out!

360
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,567
The killer didn't use glass.

361
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,835
He used that ruler!

362
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:48,539
-Ruler? -But how?

363
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,442
The same way as the window glass!

364
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:54,245
All he has to do is use this origami to make it night time.

365
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,348
What? Will that really make a mirror?

366
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:58,850
Try it! Try it!

367
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,752
Things like window glass and transparent plastic

368
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:06,057
are always reflecting light and projecting something.

369
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,759
Nothing's reflected, though.

370
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,861
That's just because the light on this side is strong

371
00:16:09,861 --> 00:16:11,462
and it isn't clearly visible.

372
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:12,964
But if you use black origami like this

373
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:16,634
and block the light coming from this side...

374
00:16:16,634 --> 00:16:18,236
You can really see!

375
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,340
It's true! Wow!

376
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,142
It's just like a mirror!

377
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,844
By the way, since a thing that is reflected on the window glass at night

378
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:28,246
will become shadowed,

379
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:30,748
it is hard to make out since it is dark.

380
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,850
But the thing that is reflected,

381
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,752
unlike the genuine one is monotone.

382
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:37,054
It's hard to make out color this way.

383
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:40,858
Then, maybe this silver color should be used.

384
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,861
See, this way, you can tell the colors apart.

385
00:16:43,861 --> 00:16:46,264
But it's blurred and hard to see.

386
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:49,934
The color silver originally has the power to reflect things.

387
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,936
But since the surface of the paper is not smooth,

388
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:53,738
it looks blurred.

389
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:56,240
Besides, there's no need to make out color.

390
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,743
Satan's make-up only requires coloring the same places

391
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,645
with the respective corresponding colors.

392
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,846
I see.

393
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,048
Then he can put on make-up here.

394
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,951
Yes. In other words, Satan's crime began

395
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:10,254
right after the three delivery lunches that he ordered were delivered.

396
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:12,056
He removes his make-up immediately,

397
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:13,958
and goes to the reception room where the president is,

398
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,359
wearing his delivery man's outfit.

399
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,361
Then, after killing him, rushes back here,

400
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,765
uses the ruler mirror that he made to put his make-up back on,

401
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:24,435
and waits for the manager to come wake him up.

402
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,137
But if so,

403
00:17:26,137 --> 00:17:27,839
there should be a lot of the president's blood

404
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,342
splattered on the delivery man's outfit.

405
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,846
I'm sure he probably got some other clothing ready.

406
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:38,149
Let's say, maybe something like a hooded raincoat.

407
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:40,551
Okay! Dispatch the investigation crew and look for it!

408
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:41,953
Yes, sir!

409
00:17:43,554 --> 00:17:46,757
Who cares, even if you find something like that.

410
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,660
I didn't do it, and besides, you don't have proof either.

411
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,563
I made a mirror using origami and a ruler, you say.

412
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:54,465
That's news to me.

413
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:57,034
All I was doing in this room was make paper cranes

414
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,638
while waiting for my manager to come, and that's it!

415
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:04,942
If so, won't you fold and make another paper crane for me?

416
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:05,943
What?

417
00:18:05,943 --> 00:18:08,446
If you want, you may smoke too.

418
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:12,049
You get the urge to smoke when doing detailed work, don't you?

419
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,551
Don't be silly.

420
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,853
I could never fold a paper crane in this situation.

421
00:18:15,853 --> 00:18:18,756
Then, Ayumi, please make one for him, will you?

422
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:19,957
Okay.

423
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:22,960
First, you make a triangle.

424
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,962
Then, you go like this.

425
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:27,465
You're good, Ayumi.

426
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:29,066
Because when Daddy was in the hospital,

427
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,035
I made a lot of cranes together with mommy.

428
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:33,638
Here, all done.

429
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:35,139
It's a well-made crane,

430
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:37,642
but it's skinny and doesn't look too energetic.

431
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:38,943
Oh, I see.

432
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:43,547
I see, that's right.

433
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:45,249
In order to make the crane fat,

434
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,251
you must blow air into.

435
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,252
If the crane was placed against your lips,

436
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,054
the lipstick should come off onto the crane.

437
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:52,156
Just like the cigarette stubs in the astray.

438
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:54,959
But none of it was found on your cranes.

439
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:59,664
In other words, those aren't the cranes that he folded today, right?

440
00:18:59,664 --> 00:19:02,867
Dr. Agasa, what're you persuading yourself for?

441
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:07,138
It seems that either Satan doesn't know how to fold cranes,

442
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:09,640
or has forgotten how to.

443
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,244
Either way, those cranes were folded beforehand

444
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:16,447
in order to camouflage the mirror trick.

445
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,449
By the way, he went out of his way to tell the police

446
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,251
that he also feels hate towards his boss

447
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,852
so that they would suspect him

448
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:24,855
and investigate the dressing room right away,

449
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:27,658
and find that there is no mirror around.

450
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:29,160
He didn't want to dilly-dally

451
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,462
because the three shops that delivered the food

452
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,564
may come to retrieve the dishes.

453
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:34,765
If they come, the fact that there is no mirror in the room

454
00:19:34,765 --> 00:19:36,067
may be thrown into obscurity.

455
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:39,136
That's why he wanted them to come get the dishes at sundown.

456
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:43,341
He did so to make time for us to check the room!

457
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:44,442
It... it's a lie!

458
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:47,545
Satan would never kill, no way.

459
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,648
Then, let's have him remove his make-up right now

460
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,351
and show us his face.

461
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:55,052
Sure, okay!

462
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:57,054
Satan, go ahead and remove your make-up!

463
00:19:58,756 --> 00:20:02,259
Satan?

464
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:05,162
Sorry, but I can't do that, manager.

465
00:20:06,864 --> 00:20:09,567
Because if I take off this devil's mask,

466
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:13,537
under it will be the wretched face of a killer.

467
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:15,039
No, don't tell me that...

468
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:18,843
You know, don't you? About three years ago,

469
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:23,647
when I hurt my throat during a tour and was hospitalized.

470
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:27,451
Back then, there was a child who used to come visit me every day.

471
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:28,452
There used to always be a small box

472
00:20:28,452 --> 00:20:31,255
with a crane inside it, each time she came.

473
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:34,859
She believed that I was a real devil.

474
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,162
I always looked forward to reading her letters.

475
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:39,263
But suddenly one day,

476
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:43,134
the letters from that girl stopped coming.

477
00:20:43,134 --> 00:20:47,138
Back then, I thought that she had just gotten tired of me.

478
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,942
But last month, when I went drinking with boss,

479
00:20:51,942 --> 00:20:54,145
I finally found out why.

480
00:20:54,145 --> 00:20:56,347
In his exact words, the boss said,

481
00:20:56,347 --> 00:20:58,349
"Wanna cause a stir again with sacrifice?"

482
00:20:58,349 --> 00:20:59,550
Sacrifice?

483
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,254
Right. I was in the hospital and didn't know,

484
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:05,156
but the boss wrote a comment in the band's official website,

485
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,459
pretending to be me, without telling me about it.

486
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:11,062
He wrote, "It is necessary to make a sacrifice to recover my evil powers.

487
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,763
I want blood."

488
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:13,964
Don't... don't tell me

489
00:21:13,964 --> 00:21:16,267
that child who was your fan took it seriously and...

490
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:23,140
Yeah, when I pressured him for an answer on the spot,

491
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,642
he laughed and said the following.

492
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:29,346
In the last letter it said, "I will happily give you my blood. Goodbye."

493
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:31,849
The revival live that I performed six months later

494
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,250
after being discharged from the hospital,

495
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,554
was really hot over the fact that someone had taken her life for me.

496
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:40,858
I looked for that girl's house right away and visited her residence.

497
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,561
I found out that she died by killing herself over an unknown reason.

498
00:21:43,561 --> 00:21:46,363
Then, you killed him to avenge her death.

499
00:21:46,363 --> 00:21:48,165
Yeah, I did it.

500
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:51,335
He thinks nothing of human life if for the sake of money.

501
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:54,738
He even crushed my plans of holding a final live performance,

502
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:56,540
telling me to pay for damages incurred

503
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,443
if I quit before my contract is over!

504
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:04,748
I killed the real devil!

505
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:07,051
I mean although I seem to have my righteous reasons for doing what I did,

506
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:09,153
the fact is, these past one to two years I've been in a slump.

507
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:10,354
I've been annoyed

508
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:14,358
and maybe the fact is, I just wanted to get everything over with.

509
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,862
But my older sister was saying

510
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,564
Styx III is going to revive for sure.

511
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:23,067
She said that she was sure you'd be making a wondrous song

512
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:24,535
that will give everyone energy again!

513
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:26,437
I'm no good anymore.

514
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:29,340
I used to frequently say, "I'll possess you" or "I'll curse you",

515
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,442
"but I never ever said "die".

516
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:32,743
The only one who says something like that,

517
00:22:32,743 --> 00:22:35,045
is the monster that comes on in the Kamen Yaiba show.

518
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:41,552
I've fallen low to that level.

519
00:22:41,552 --> 00:22:42,653
But that's...

520
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,756
Besides, after her letters stopped coming,

521
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,258
I got to thinking.

522
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,260
What did I do wrong,

523
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,862
or what did she not like about me?

524
00:22:51,862 --> 00:22:54,965
When I started thinking this way, tears started pourings

525
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:57,334
and I couldn't compose nor write lyrics.

526
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,336
I couldn't write even a phrase.

527
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,338
Phooey, talk about a fallen devil.

528
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,543
Your tears are a bit red?

529
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:08,546
That's President Urushibara's blood that splattered on him.

530
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:09,547
Blood?

531
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,556
You couldn't see colors very well using the ruler mirror, right?

532
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:21,158
So, you put foundation

533
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:23,961
right over the blood by your eyes without noticing.

534
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,663
You noticed it only after

535
00:23:25,663 --> 00:23:28,766
your manager bought the mirror and gave it to you.

536
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:31,335
That's why you couldn't use eye drops.

537
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,037
Because if you did, the eye drop

538
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,139
would wet the area around your eyes, resulting in conclusive evidence.

539
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:37,241
-I see. -I see.

540
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,143
Shall we go then?

541
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,847
But it sure is like a fairy tale.

542
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,451
Well, like they say,

543
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,653
"When a devil sheds tears,

544
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:52,156
he loses his evil powers".

545
00:25:23,747 --> 00:25:25,449
Now, something very shocking has happened!

546
00:25:25,449 --> 00:25:28,452
Ms. Kazuka Inoue, Yoko Okino and Azusa Yamamoto

547
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:30,954
-have aligned in a row with nine correct answers! -You can do it!

548
00:25:30,954 --> 00:25:32,956
There is only one more question to go.

549
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,958
If any one of the three answers correctly,

550
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,460
she will be the winner!

551
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,162
This program was shot

552
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,065
when you went to the TV station the other day, right?

553
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:43,834
Yes, but I didn't get to see Yoko after the incident,

554
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,136
so I don't know how it turned out.

555
00:25:46,136 --> 00:25:47,838
What else can the result be,

556
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,339
but Yoko answering ten questions correctly

557
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,642
and winning first prize?

558
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:54,144
Ms. Inoue, do you have confidence?

559
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:56,747
I'll do my best!

560
00:25:56,747 --> 00:25:58,148
Ms. Okino.

561
00:25:58,148 --> 00:25:59,550
My fans out there.

562
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,951
Root for me, okay?

563
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:03,354
Of course, of course! I'll root for you!

564
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,255
Ms. Yamamoto?

565
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:06,957
I will do my best!

566
00:26:06,957 --> 00:26:08,959
Here goes.

567
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,561
Question number 10!

568
00:26:13,464 --> 00:26:16,166
Conan Doyle brings to mind Sherlock Holmes,

569
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,036
Masashi Yokomizo brings to mind Kousuke Kindaiji.

570
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,238
Then what does Ranpo Edogawa bring to mind?

571
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,143
-She did it! -Yes, Ms. Okino.

572
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:32,750
Akechi, Akechi!

573
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,952
Too bad, Ms. Okino, you're disqualified.

574
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:37,855
The top prize winners are Ms. Kazuka Inoue and Ms. Azusa Yamamoto!

575
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:39,456
Let's give them a bit hand!

576
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:42,259
-Congratulations! -Congratulations for both winner.

577
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:43,460
Oh boy.

578
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,263
How could she say such a name?

579
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:48,766
Kogoro Mouri!

580
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:51,935
How disappointing.

581
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:41,618
Next Conan's Hint:

582
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,321
"Roma letters".

583
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:45,823
The next episode involves a spider house.

584
00:27:45,823 --> 00:27:46,924
Are there going to be that many spies?

585
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,026
He's talking about the insect!
