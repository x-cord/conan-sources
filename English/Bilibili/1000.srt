The legendary case that took

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.850
What is the mystery behind
the cursed piano and melody?

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.520
Always determining the one truth

6
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.180
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

7
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.620
his name is Detective Conan!

14
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.199
There isn't anyone by that
name on this island.

15
00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.489
What? Can't you search your
records more thoroughly?

16
00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.579
I have a letter from him requesting
my services right here.

17
00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.139
But he's not on the island's resident list.

18
00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:28.559
And besides, I just arrived
on this island last month.

19
00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:30.089
Hey, what's going on here?

20
00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.499
Well, actually...

21
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:37.469
This man claims to have been hired
by a resident of the island.

22
00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:38.459
Hired?

23
00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.199
Yes, by somebody named Aso Keiji-san.

24
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:43.919
Did you say Aso Keiji?!

25
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.179
That's not possible.

26
00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.809
What?

27
00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.179
After all, he passed away
more than ten years ago.

28
00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.189
It happened 12 years ago on
the night of a full moon.

29
00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.709
He was a famous pianist from this island.

30
00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.319
After performing a concert at
the village's community center,

31
00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.579
he suddenly locked himself and
his family inside his home

32
00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.819
and set the house on fire.

33
00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.719
According to the rescuers
who arrived at the scene,

34
00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.689
after brutally murdering his
wife and daughter with a knife,

35
00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:33.219
he played the same piece over and over
amidst the flames like a man possessed.

36
00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:37.579
It was Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata."

37
00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.119
Jeez. What an awful prank.

38
00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:47.899
It might not be a prank.

39
00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:48.609
What?

40
00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:52.049
After all, you received
your retainer fee, right?

41
00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:52.809
Yeah.

42
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.489
And the postmark on the letter
is from Moonshade Island.

43
00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.619
You're right.

44
00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:05.869
Which means someone on this island probably
wants you to investigate that Aso Keiji person.

45
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.319
I see.

46
00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.519
But if the man in question is dead, then...

47
00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:17.899
Let's try talking to the mayor who
was allegedly Aso-san's friend.

48
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.319
You're right.

49
00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.519
I believe they said the mayor
is at the community center.

50
00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.289
Are you listening, Kenta-kun?
I believe they said the mayor
is at the community center.

51
00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.789
Make sure you keep yourself
warm while you sleep.

52
00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:26.279
Okay.

53
00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.929
Bye, Doctor Narumi.

54
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:30.479
Bye.

55
00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.439
Excuse me.

56
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.029
Yes?

57
00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.309
Do you know where the community center is?

58
00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:42.399
Take a right at that corner, and the
community center is at the end of the street.

59
00:04:42.399 --> 00:04:44.769
Did you come here from the mainland?

60
00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:46.839
Yes. We're from Tokyo.

61
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.359
Really?! My family's from Tokyo, too.

62
00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:52.269
Oh, really?

63
00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:56.059
But unlike Tokyo, isn't
this island wonderful?

64
00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.859
The air is clear, and it's so quiet here.

interested in the mayoral election.

90

second anniversary memorial service

118

121
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.309
I'm just copying your methods.

122
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:51.179
There's somebody who says he'd
like to meet with the mayor.

123
00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.919
What? Who wants to see me now?

124
00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.489
H-He says he's a detective from Tokyo.

125
00:06:58.489 --> 00:06:59.399
Jeez.

126
00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.069
How long are they going to make us wait?

127
00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:04.329
Maybe they're busy preparing
for the memorial service.

128
00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:05.539
Right, Conan-kun?

129
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:07.139
Conan-kun?

130
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.259
A piano.

131
00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.359
Hey, Conan-kun.

132
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:15.269
What is it, Ran?

133
00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:18.869
This is a big room.

134
00:07:19.329 --> 00:07:21.719
Are they going to hold a piano concert?

135
00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:25.999
The ocean is right behind the building.

136
00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:29.709
This piano looks pretty old.

137
00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:31.069
I wonder if it works.

138
00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:31.919
Don't!

139
00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.169
Don't touch that piano!

140
00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:42.049
That's the cursed piano played here
at the concert the day Aso-san died.

141
00:07:42.489 --> 00:07:44.809
Surely it's not cursed.

142
00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:47.609
That incident wasn't the
only thing that happened.

143
00:07:47.609 --> 00:07:50.579
Something similar happened
to the previous mayor.

144
00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:55.559
You mean Kameyama Isamu-san, whose
memorial service is being held today?

145
00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:58.819
Yes. It happened two years ago.

146
00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:03.589
The moon was full that night, just
like the night of Aso-san's incident.

147
00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:10.189
I happened to pass nearby when
I heard the sound of the piano

148
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.599
coming from the supposedly
empty community center.

149
00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:17.089
I thought someone was there, so I called out
to them, and the sound abruptly stopped.

150
00:08:17.829 --> 00:08:19.519
When I entered the room...

151
00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:24.919
Kameyama-san was leaning
against the keys, dead.

152
00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:28.829
The cause of death was a heart attack.

153
00:08:29.249 --> 00:08:33.599
And horrifyingly, the piece that had
been playing right up until his death

154
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:39.179
was the piece Aso-san played amidst
the inferno, the "Moonlight Sonata."

155
00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:47.029
Since then, people started
calling this the cursed piano.

156
00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:50.369
The villagers are too afraid to touch it.

157
00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:56.309
There's nothing special about this piano.

158
00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:57.889
Conan-kun!

159
00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:03.729
In any case, please wait outside
until the service is over.

160
00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:05.669
Oh, it's you guys.

161
00:09:05.669 --> 00:09:06.639
Narumi-san.

162
00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:09.449
Were you able to meet with the mayor?

163
00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:11.779
No, not yet.

164
00:09:11.779 --> 00:09:13.779
Are you here for the service, Narumi-san?

165
00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:14.659
Yes.

166
00:09:15.099 --> 00:09:20.119
Kameyama-san's was the first body I
examined after coming to the island.

167
00:09:20.489 --> 00:09:22.679
I thought I could at least
light some incense.

168
00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:26.789
Oh, right. This is one of the mayoral
candidates I mentioned earlier.

169
00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:27.279
Shimizu Masato (49)
Mayoral Election Candidate
Oh, right. This is one of the mayoral
candidates I mentioned earlier.

170
00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:27.629
Shimizu Masato (49)
Mayoral Election Candidate

171
00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:30.239
Nice to meet you. I'm Shimizu Masato.
Shimizu Masato (49)
Mayoral Election Candidate

172
00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:30.249
Shimizu Masato (49)
Mayoral Election Candidate

173
00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:31.729
A pleasure.

174
00:09:42.969 --> 00:09:45.509
Nishimoto Ken (55)
Unemployed

175
00:09:49.869 --> 00:09:50.909
Bastard.

176
00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:55.619
You hired a detective to
investigate me, didn't you?

177
00:09:56.919 --> 00:09:58.389
Don't be ridiculous.

178
00:09:58.389 --> 00:10:00.139
Hey, are you running away from me?

179
00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:03.119
I'm going to the bathroom.

180
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:10.329
It doesn't make sense.

181
00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:16.119
Supposedly no one's used that piano
in years, but it was in tune.

182
00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:19.939
Someone's probably been tuning it in secret.

183
00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:20.459
During the next full moon
once again on Moonshade Island
the shadows will begin to vanish

184
00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:23.629
And then there's that letter
that arrived one week ago...
During the next full moon
once again on Moonshade Island
the shadows will begin to vanish

185
00:10:23.629 --> 00:10:25.139
During the next full moon
once again on Moonshade Island
the shadows will begin to vanish

186
00:10:31.469 --> 00:10:33.269
Th-This song...

187
00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.639
The "Moonlight Sonata!"

188
00:10:34.849 --> 00:10:35.819
Crap!

189
00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:36.519
Conan-kun?

190
00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:45.349
Damn it! We were too late!

191
00:10:55.946 --> 00:10:58.416
It's no use. He's dead.

192
00:10:58.416 --> 00:10:59.916
Kawashima-san is dead?

193
00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:01.306
What's going on?

194
00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:03.516
Ran, call the police substation.

195
00:11:03.516 --> 00:11:04.296
Got it.

196
00:11:04.776 --> 00:11:07.926
Everyone else, stay where you are.

197
00:11:08.426 --> 00:11:09.576
Doctor Narumi.

198
00:11:09.576 --> 00:11:10.686
Yes?

199
00:11:10.926 --> 00:11:12.966
Could you examine the body?

200
00:11:13.196 --> 00:11:14.396
Very well.

201
00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:21.746
I see. So that's how it is.

202
00:11:22.616 --> 00:11:25.576
This is what that letter
was warning us about.

203
00:11:25.576 --> 00:11:29.256
Damn it! If only I'd realized
what it meant sooner.

204
00:11:29.756 --> 00:11:31.386
I-It's the curse.

205
00:11:32.206 --> 00:11:34.466
It's the piano's curse!

206
00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:35.976
This isn't a curse.

207
00:11:36.676 --> 00:11:38.416
Look closely.

208
00:11:38.826 --> 00:11:42.806
It's not a curse or a ghost
that's playing the piano.

209
00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:45.196
It's this tape recorder.

210
00:11:48.016 --> 00:11:55.936
In other words, this is a murder case made
to look like the previous two incidents.

211
00:11:57.806 --> 00:12:01.066
Oh, come on. Don't go making up stories.

212
00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:03.886
Who are you, anyway?

213
00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:07.576
Me? I came here from Tokyo.

214
00:12:08.796 --> 00:12:11.586
I'm the great detective Mori Kogoro.

215
00:12:12.946 --> 00:12:14.806
Ever heard of him?

216
00:12:14.806 --> 00:12:15.826
No...

217
00:12:20.516 --> 00:12:21.806
Seawater?

218
00:12:28.256 --> 00:12:30.236
Judging by the body's condition,

219
00:12:30.236 --> 00:12:34.856
the estimated time of death is
30 minutes to one hour ago.

220
00:12:34.856 --> 00:12:37.116
The cause of death is suffocation.

221
00:12:37.116 --> 00:12:40.226
I believe he was drowned.

222
00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:42.526
He was drowned?

223
00:12:42.826 --> 00:12:46.336
I can't say for certain without
performing an autopsy.

224
00:12:46.336 --> 00:12:48.836
I think Doctor Narumi is right.

225
00:12:49.476 --> 00:12:51.786
Look outside the window.

226
00:12:52.436 --> 00:12:54.756
Isn't that Kawashima-san's jacket?

227
00:12:55.026 --> 00:12:59.976
It looks like something was dragged from the
door leading out to the sea to the piano,

228
00:12:59.976 --> 00:13:03.376
and there's mud and sand
on Kawashima-san's back.

229
00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:09.516
Also, the room's doors
and windows are locked,

230
00:13:09.766 --> 00:13:15.256
and the first few minutes of this
"Moonlight Sonata" tape are blank.

231
00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:21.166
During the service, the culprit probably brought
Kawashima-san to the ocean and drowned him,

232
00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:24.096
moved the body into this room,
locked the doors and windows,

233
00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:27.346
turned on the tape recorder,
and then left the room.

234
00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:33.916
After several minutes of silence, the "Moonlight
Sonata" started playing on the tape recorder.

235
00:13:34.326 --> 00:13:35.986
Right, Mister?

236
00:13:35.986 --> 00:13:38.306
Y-Yeah, that's right.

237
00:13:38.806 --> 00:13:45.666
But since we were in the entryway of
the community center the whole time...

238
00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:49.606
W-Wait a minute. Does that mean
the culprit is still...

239
00:13:50.576 --> 00:13:52.806
in this room?

240
00:13:54.336 --> 00:13:58.846
Yeah, as long as they didn't
use the confusion to escape.

241
00:13:58.846 --> 00:14:00.366
Hey, Mister Detective.

242
00:14:00.626 --> 00:14:06.516
I wouldn't call it a motive, but the
man happiest about Kawashima's death

243
00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:12.236
is probably the other mayoral
candidate, Shimizu-kun.

244
00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:13.706
W-What did you say?

245
00:14:13.706 --> 00:14:17.006
I could say the same thing
about you, Mayor Kuroiwa.

246
00:14:17.006 --> 00:14:17.996
What was that?

247
00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:20.276
Now, now. Try to calm down.

248
00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:25.246
By the way, how long as
that piano been here?

249
00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:30.366
It was given to the community center
as a gift from Aso-san 15 years ago.

250
00:14:30.366 --> 00:14:32.556
It's been here ever since.

251
00:14:32.556 --> 00:14:34.236
From Aso-san?

252
00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:39.026
Yes. Aso-san's name is even on the lid.

253
00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:42.216
What's this?

254
00:14:42.936 --> 00:14:43.716
Sheet music?

255
00:14:48.186 --> 00:14:52.316
That's odd. This wasn't here when
we looked at it this afternoon.

256
00:14:55.736 --> 00:14:57.736
Who was that?

257
00:14:57.736 --> 00:14:59.856
Nishimoto Ken-san.

258
00:14:59.856 --> 00:15:00.946
Nishimoto?

259
00:15:01.196 --> 00:15:04.786
He was quite prosperous a long time ago,

260
00:15:04.786 --> 00:15:07.846
but after the previous mayor
passed away two years ago,

261
00:15:07.846 --> 00:15:10.476
he began shutting himself inside his home.

262
00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:13.516
Since the incident two years ago, huh?

263
00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:18.976
Oh, right. I believe that Mayor Kuroiwa
and he are childhood friends, right?

264
00:15:19.246 --> 00:15:21.966
Yeah, I think so.

265
00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:24.616
Dad.

266
00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:28.606
I brought a police officer.

267
00:15:28.796 --> 00:15:30.756
Took you long enough, Ran.

268
00:15:30.756 --> 00:15:32.526
Yeah, but...

269
00:15:32.526 --> 00:15:36.026
Uh, who called for me?

270
00:15:36.026 --> 00:15:39.136
This man. His name is Mori Kogoro-san.

271
00:15:40.986 --> 00:15:42.686
Who are you?

272
00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.996
In any case, it's already late.

273
00:15:46.996 --> 00:15:49.696
We'll interview the witnesses tomorrow.

274
00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:56.886
Damn it. This case is full of unknowns.

275
00:15:57.626 --> 00:16:01.786
Why did the culprit bother to
move the body to the piano?

276
00:16:02.566 --> 00:16:06.696
Does this sheet music that was found
with the body mean anything?

277
00:16:07.446 --> 00:16:07.646
the shadows will begin to vanish

278
00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:11.396
And what about the letter
warning us about this case?
the shadows will begin to vanish

279
00:16:11.396 --> 00:16:11.906
the shadows will begin to vanish

280
00:16:12.876 --> 00:16:14.026
Wait a minute.

281
00:16:14.026 --> 00:16:17.786
I think that letter said "begin to vanish."

282
00:16:18.876 --> 00:16:21.246
Could it be that this case is...?

283
00:16:21.526 --> 00:16:22.746
What?!

284
00:16:22.746 --> 00:16:26.746
This letter warned us about this case?

285
00:16:26.926 --> 00:16:32.206
Yeah. "The shadows will vanish" means
they'll be enveloped in light.

286
00:16:32.206 --> 00:16:34.856
That light is the moon's light.

287
00:16:34.856 --> 00:16:36.186
It's referring to the "Moonlight Sonata."

288
00:16:36.356 --> 00:16:39.886
That's it. Both 12 years
ago and two years ago,

289
00:16:39.886 --> 00:16:44.726
the "Moonlight Sonata" was playing right
up until Aso-san and Kameyama-san died.

290
00:16:45.206 --> 00:16:48.476
In other words, if the
shadows will vanish again,

291
00:16:48.476 --> 00:16:52.856
that means the "Moonlight Sonata" will be
played again, and somebody else will die.

292
00:16:52.856 --> 00:16:54.316
Wait a minute.

293
00:16:54.676 --> 00:16:57.836
This letter says that the shadows
will "begin to vanish."

294
00:16:59.016 --> 00:17:03.206
Does that mean there's more to this case?

295
00:17:06.646 --> 00:17:07.726
Sheesh.

296
00:17:09.036 --> 00:17:14.576
If you ask me, spending the night
here with the body is insanity.

297
00:17:15.046 --> 00:17:16.856
Well, you know...

298
00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:21.096
More importantly, who moved the body?

299
00:17:21.096 --> 00:17:23.016
That was me.

300
00:17:23.016 --> 00:17:27.176
I felt bad about leaving
him in that position.

301
00:17:27.176 --> 00:17:28.926
You shouldn't have done that.

302
00:17:28.926 --> 00:17:31.196
The crime scene hasn't been
properly examined yet.

303
00:17:31.196 --> 00:17:32.386
Huh?

304
00:17:32.786 --> 00:17:34.786
That sheet music is missing.

305
00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:36.236
What?

306
00:17:36.236 --> 00:17:40.876
Oh, I thought I'd hold
onto it for safekeeping.

307
00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:41.706
Here.

308
00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:46.056
Huh? This is the sheet music
for the "Moonlight Sonata."

309
00:17:46.056 --> 00:17:47.296
Th-The "Moonlight Sonata"?

310
00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:52.576
But the fourth line is sort of weird.

311
00:17:52.576 --> 00:17:53.846
The fourth line?

312
00:17:54.456 --> 00:17:56.076
Weird how?

313
00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.476
Ready?

314
00:17:58.206 --> 00:18:00.416
When you play the fourth line...

315
00:18:04.606 --> 00:18:05.716
See?

316
00:18:06.366 --> 00:18:12.696
Could the fourth line of this sheet music
be a dying message from Kawashima-san?

317
00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:18.246
Which means it's possible that the
culprit will return to retrieve this.

318
00:18:21.426 --> 00:18:23.246
Doctor Narumi?

319
00:18:23.246 --> 00:18:27.286
I called your inn, and
they said you'd be here.

320
00:18:27.286 --> 00:18:29.756
I brought you dinner.

321
00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:31.826
N-Now that you mention it...

322
00:18:34.866 --> 00:18:35.996
Really?

323
00:18:36.256 --> 00:18:39.956
So you're not originally from
this island, Doctor Narumi?

324
00:18:39.956 --> 00:18:43.756
No. I go back to Tokyo every weekend.

325
00:18:44.036 --> 00:18:47.006
It's been two years since
I started coming here.

326
00:18:47.006 --> 00:18:48.706
Speaking of two years,

327
00:18:48.706 --> 00:18:51.386
I have a question about Mayor
Kameyama who died two years ago.

328
00:18:51.656 --> 00:18:57.626
He'd previously had heart problems, and
the cause of death was a heart attack.

329
00:18:58.006 --> 00:19:01.286
But his face was rather tense,

330
00:19:01.846 --> 00:19:05.036
as though he'd seen something terrifying.

331
00:19:05.406 --> 00:19:08.956
He looked like he'd seen
something terrifying, huh?

332
00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:16.036
In any case, I'll keep watch tonight.

333
00:19:16.036 --> 00:19:18.016
You guys should go to sleep.

334
00:19:18.016 --> 00:19:19.236
Okay.

335
00:19:21.976 --> 00:19:25.966
Hey, Mori-kun. Mori-kun.

336
00:19:25.966 --> 00:19:28.796
It's almost noon. Wake up.

337
00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:32.806
I-Inspector Megure, what are you doing here?

338
00:19:32.806 --> 00:19:36.076
Are you sure you're not still asleep?

339
00:19:36.286 --> 00:19:41.436
I heard you were involved,
so I came all the way here.

340
00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:42.906
Th-That's right.

341
00:19:42.906 --> 00:19:45.526
Inspector, I have something for you.

342
00:19:45.526 --> 00:19:48.216
Conan-kun already gave me the sheet music.

343
00:19:48.216 --> 00:19:48.856
What?

344
00:19:49.236 --> 00:19:53.696
The three of them outlined
the case for me, too.

345
00:19:54.176 --> 00:19:58.136
All three of them were awake
by the time we arrived.

346
00:19:58.136 --> 00:19:58.726
What?

347
00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:04.526
In any case, we're interviewing
people at the village office.

348
00:20:04.526 --> 00:20:05.956
Come lend us a hand.

349
00:20:05.956 --> 00:20:07.476
Yes, sir.

350
00:20:16.496 --> 00:20:18.786
Well? Did you figured out who did it?

351
00:20:18.786 --> 00:20:20.266
Don't be stupid.

352
00:20:20.266 --> 00:20:23.356
We've got 38 witnesses to question.

353
00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:26.276
When will I be questioned?

354
00:20:26.276 --> 00:20:27.746
I'm sure you're exhausted.

355
00:20:27.746 --> 00:20:29.886
I asked them to question you last.

356
00:20:29.886 --> 00:20:33.426
In that case, I'll go wash my face first.

357
00:20:33.776 --> 00:20:34.666
Hey.

358
00:20:35.546 --> 00:20:38.756
How many more people do
you have to question?

359
00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:43.496
Six total. There's Doctor
Narumi, those four over there,

360
00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:47.006
and Nishimoto, who's being
questioned right now.

361
00:20:48.436 --> 00:20:49.376
You fool!

362
00:20:49.646 --> 00:20:51.766
Cursed piano, my ass.

363
00:20:51.766 --> 00:20:54.996
This happened because that
thing is still here.

364
00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:56.606
B-But sir...

365
00:20:56.836 --> 00:20:59.466
Get rid of it immediately. Got it?

366
00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:02.426
V-Very well.

367
00:21:07.636 --> 00:21:09.896
Enough already!

368
00:21:09.896 --> 00:21:13.906
I obviously don't have a motive
to kill Kawashima-san!

369
00:21:13.906 --> 00:21:14.206
I told you, we're just questioning everyone.

370
00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:18.666
Wow. Reiko-san has been
yelling for ten minutes.
I told you, we're just questioning everyone.

371
00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:19.266
You can't be serious!

372
00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:19.776
That's odd.
You can't be serious!

373
00:21:19.776 --> 00:21:20.286
That's odd.

374
00:21:20.286 --> 00:21:20.956
Now, now. Please calm down.

375
00:21:20.956 --> 00:21:22.226
They've been interviewed already,
so why aren't they leaving?
Now, now. Please calm down.

376
00:21:22.226 --> 00:21:24.256
They've been interviewed already,
so why aren't they leaving?

377
00:21:26.156 --> 00:21:27.546
I'm going to the bathroom!

378
00:21:29.906 --> 00:21:30.876
He's not here!

379
00:21:31.706 --> 00:21:33.926
Hey, did Nishimoto-san go in there?

380
00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:36.216
No. Only Shimizu is inside.

381
00:21:36.516 --> 00:21:38.126
Damn it. He must be upstairs.

382
00:21:39.316 --> 00:21:40.246
Crap!

383
00:21:40.846 --> 00:21:42.286
This song...

384
00:21:43.716 --> 00:21:45.596
It's the second movement
of the "Moonlight Sonata."

385
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:47.746
Where's the source of the sound?!

386
00:21:49.436 --> 00:21:50.316
The broadcast room?

387
00:21:51.386 --> 00:21:52.666
Nishimoto-san!

388
00:21:56.376 --> 00:21:57.796
Mayor Kuroiwa.

389
00:21:58.016 --> 00:22:00.556
Call forensics and the coroner immediately.

390
00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:05.556
But Inspector, the coroner left for
Tokyo to perform Kawashima's autopsy.

391
00:22:05.556 --> 00:22:08.016
Damn it. Why did this have to happen now?

392
00:22:08.016 --> 00:22:08.846
Excuse me.

393
00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:11.886
If you don't mind, I could do it.

394
00:22:11.886 --> 00:22:13.306
Doctor Narumi.

395
00:22:13.616 --> 00:22:15.346
Thank you.

396
00:22:15.346 --> 00:22:18.216
In that case, until the forensics team
arrives, could you examine him right away?

397
00:22:18.216 --> 00:22:18.986
Yes.

398
00:22:19.186 --> 00:22:23.936
Again. I knew it was coming,
but I let another person die.

399
00:22:24.396 --> 00:22:25.906
It's unforgivable.

400
00:22:25.906 --> 00:22:29.806
Threatening to commit murder and then
calmly carrying out that threat...

401
00:22:31.536 --> 00:22:33.896
They won't get away with this!

402
00:23:54.396 --> 00:23:54.406
Th-The hellfire's grudge? Could it be?
