1
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.140
Today's case is an unimaginable one.

2
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.440
One clue however, connects the seemingly unrelated cases

3
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.640
and solves the mystery perfectly!

4
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.140
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.940
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.040
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.725
Pop's is tailing somebody.

8
00:01:57.725 --> 00:02:00.025
A person by the name of Shoichiro Hitomi

9
00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:02.125
falls to his death from the Beika Hotel.

10
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:08.225
At the same time, his twin kid brother, Takehiko,

11
00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:12.225
is found killed by someone at his home in Haido-cho.

12
00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:19.725
Could this have been synchronicity, a so called fateful coincidence?

13
00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:20.925
"Shoichiro, Takehiko" -Wrong.

14
00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:23.125
"Kanako, Kaoru Minamizato" -This is not a case of synchronicity.

15
00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.625
The line that connects Kaoru with the others.

16
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.225
If I can figure out what that is, the mystery would be solved.

17
00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:31.225
Why did Shoichiro attack,

18
00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:33.525
rather, try to kill Kaoru?

19
00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:34.725
For what reason?

20
00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:42.325
"A Case of Synchronicity (Part 2)"

21
00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:52.425
Pops, about this picture.

22
00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:53.925
What about it?

23
00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:57.725
Ms. Kaoru Minimizato went to the front desk

24
00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:00.425
after Shoichiro made the call, right?

25
00:03:00.425 --> 00:03:01.525
Right.

26
00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:04.225
Back then, what was it that Kaoru said?

27
00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:07.225
Huh?

28
00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.025
Uh...

29
00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:12.125
Did you receive anything for me from a person called Mr. Anzai?

30
00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.425
That person call Mr. Anzai.

31
00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:17.925
Aren't you going to ask Kaoru about him one more time?

32
00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:19.225
Shut up!

33
00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:21.125
What seems to be the matter, Mouri?

34
00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:24.125
I'd like to talk to Kaoru once more.

35
00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.125
Wait for me, dad!

36
00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:27.225
Pops!

37
00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:40.525
Who are you?

38
00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:50.225
What was that?

39
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:51.625
I think it came from Kaoru's room.

40
00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.125
What?

41
00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:59.525
Kaoru! Kaoru!

42
00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:02.925
Kaoru!

43
00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:07.725
Darn, they just fixed the door a while ago, not again...

44
00:04:07.725 --> 00:04:09.425
But, I don't have a choice.

45
00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:14.825
Kaoru!

46
00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:16.625
Dad, nab him!

47
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:17.825
Okay!

48
00:04:21.825 --> 00:04:23.025
I'm so sorry!

49
00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:41.425
She's still okay, get the ambulance.

50
00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:44.625
"Beika Central Hospital"

51
00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:48.925
I was in a relationship with Mr. Manabu Anzai

52
00:04:48.925 --> 00:04:50.525
when I was living in the Kansai District.

53
00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:07.825
We were also going to get married,

54
00:05:07.825 --> 00:05:09.325
but 6 months ago...

55
00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:20.825
His whereabouts suddenly became unknown.

56
00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:22.825
Is that right?

57
00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:26.025
Well, I'm sorry to have suspected you.

58
00:05:26.025 --> 00:05:28.925
I'm sure the man was only after your money.

59
00:05:28.925 --> 00:05:32.625
Have you filed an offense report?

60
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:37.125
No. I wanted to see him and confirm things before doing so.

61
00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.925
But, if you don't even know where he is...

62
00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:43.725
Well, I came here because I was told that

63
00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:46.925
he was seen in Tokyo somewhere.

64
00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:53.625
But, when it actually came to looking for him,

65
00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.625
I had no idea where to start looking.

66
00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.825
Other than his name Mr. Anzai,

67
00:05:57.825 --> 00:06:01.825
I realized that I didn't know where he was born or where he worked.

68
00:06:01.825 --> 00:06:04.925
Rather, I didn't know anything about him.

69
00:06:04.925 --> 00:06:07.425
He didn't say anything deliberately.

70
00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:12.425
If so, it's doubtful whether Anzai is his real name or not either.

71
00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:15.525
The only clue that I have, is a picture of him.

72
00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:16.925
What?

73
00:06:16.925 --> 00:06:20.125
May we have a look at it?

74
00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:23.425
I met Mr. Anzai on a diving trip,

75
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:26.125
so I figured he'd be diving over here too.

76
00:06:27.325 --> 00:06:29.625
I've been looking for him here and there

77
00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:34.225
with the picture and contact number of Beika Hotel, but...

78
00:06:38.225 --> 00:06:40.225
He's!

79
00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:43.225
What's up, Conan?

80
00:06:43.225 --> 00:06:45.425
Pops, show me your digital camera.

81
00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:47.325
Okay.

82
00:06:48.425 --> 00:06:50.725
See, it's him.

83
00:06:54.725 --> 00:06:57.025
Please try to remember, dad.

84
00:06:57.025 --> 00:07:00.425
Wasn't there anything between this man and Shoichiro?

85
00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:05.125
No, not that I can recall, I think.

86
00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:09.725
Where is that? I'll try and go there.

87
00:07:09.725 --> 00:07:12.225
No, let us handle this.

88
00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:15.225
I'm a detective so I'm used to looking for people.

89
00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:18.725
By the way, the man that attacked you a while ago,

90
00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:21.225
wasn't he Mr. Anzai?

91
00:07:21.225 --> 00:07:24.525
Oh, I wonder.

92
00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:27.925
Oh no... I don't know.

93
00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:30.525
"Beika Sports Center"

94
00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:33.625
It's this man in the picture.

95
00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.625
Oh, you mean Mr. Tanizaki.

96
00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:38.025
Tanizaki? His name is not Anzai?

97
00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:40.825
Yes, I'm certain that this is Mr. Tanizaki.

98
00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:43.125
He was using an alias after all.

99
00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:46.325
Well, who knows if Tanizaki is his real name either though.

100
00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:48.825
"Tennis Club Parking Lot"

101
00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.325
Mr. Tanizaki.

102
00:07:55.325 --> 00:07:58.925
Rather, should I call you Mr. Anzai?

103
00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:03.425
May I ask what this is all about?

104
00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:06.625
You know Ms. Kaoru Minamizato, don't you?

105
00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:09.225
Who's that? No, I don't.

106
00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:11.125
Please don't play dumb with me.

107
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.625
I'm sorry, Shin.

108
00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:15.825
For making you wait.

109
00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:19.025
Oh, who is that lady?

110
00:08:19.025 --> 00:08:20.425
Who is this old man?

111
00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:22.825
It's nothing. He's got the wrong person.

112
00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:24.125
Hurry up and get in.

113
00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:35.625
I just got mail from daddy saying

114
00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:37.925
that he'd come up with the money for us!

115
00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:40.925
Oh, thanks, you're a life-saver.

116
00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:44.325
It's okay, anything for you, Shin.

117
00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.625
I see.

118
00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:56.125
Just as I thought.

119
00:08:56.125 --> 00:09:01.025
I hate to say this, but I guess he had deceived you.

120
00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:05.025
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako, Kaoru" -I see,

121
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:07.425
it's not all there is to it.

122
00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:08.925
One more man...

123
00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:11.625
whatever his name is, Tanizaki or Anzai,

124
00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:14.125
that guy is involved in this case.

125
00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.125
Kaoru's probably not the only one

126
00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:19.725
who'd been deceived by this guy.

127
00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.625
Including the woman that we saw a while ago,

128
00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:23.625
he probably deceived several others more.

129
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:27.425
If Kaoru found out, she would indict him.

130
00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:30.325
That's why he wanted to shut Kaoru up.

131
00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:32.825
There is a motive for him to kill.

132
00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:35.825
In other words, Shoichiro and that guy

133
00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.825
are connected to each other with the sports center.

134
00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:41.925
But this can be brushed away as mere coincidence.

135
00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:56.325
Shoichiro's accidental death.

136
00:09:57.825 --> 00:09:59.525
"Takehiko Hitomi, (45)" -And Takehiko's homicide

137
00:09:59.525 --> 00:10:01.425
which occurred at the same time.

138
00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:06.525
And Kaoru's assault and battery case.

139
00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:11.025
"Unknow man" -I've got to figure this one out after all.

140
00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:12.925
"Shoichiro, Takehiko, Kanako, Kaoru"

141
00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:14.025
Wait a sec.

142
00:10:14.025 --> 00:10:15.625
I get it.

143
00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:17.525
So that's the story!

144
00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:30.847
"Beika Hotel"

145
00:10:31.147 --> 00:10:32.847
Ran.

146
00:10:33.347 --> 00:10:35.047
What is it, Conan?

147
00:10:35.047 --> 00:10:38.347
Pops told me to tell you to take pictures of these diagrams

148
00:10:38.347 --> 00:10:40.147
because he'll be using them later.

149
00:10:57.347 --> 00:11:00.547
Mouri, everyone's here.

150
00:11:00.547 --> 00:11:02.147
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:02.147 --> 00:11:05.747
Thank you all for coming.

152
00:11:05.747 --> 00:11:07.947
And, what is this?

153
00:11:07.947 --> 00:11:09.447
What're you going to start?

154
00:11:09.447 --> 00:11:12.347
I'm going to unravel the mystery of the two cases.

155
00:11:12.347 --> 00:11:13.947
Cases?

156
00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:17.747
Wasn't Shoichiro's case an accident?

157
00:11:17.747 --> 00:11:20.747
Whether it was an accident or had to do with synchronicity,

158
00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:22.047
everything fit too well into place.

159
00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:25.947
Until it makes people feel very abnormal.

160
00:11:25.947 --> 00:11:30.447
In other words, a frightening perfect murder was being schemed.

161
00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:32.747
Perfect crime?

162
00:11:32.747 --> 00:11:36.147
Yes, if it worked out the way it should've.

163
00:11:36.147 --> 00:11:38.747
Ran, is the monitor ready?

164
00:11:38.747 --> 00:11:40.247
Okay.

165
00:11:40.247 --> 00:11:44.447
To be honest, I was concerned about something from the very beginning.

166
00:11:44.447 --> 00:11:47.847
Despite owning a cell phone,

167
00:11:47.847 --> 00:11:52.247
Shoichiro made a call using the public phone in the lobby of the hotel.

168
00:11:52.247 --> 00:11:55.447
Although the place was not even an out of service range area.

169
00:11:57.547 --> 00:11:59.247
He did so

170
00:11:59.247 --> 00:12:03.047
because he didn't want anyone to know who he was calling.

171
00:12:03.047 --> 00:12:05.047
Why didn't he want anybody to know?

172
00:12:05.047 --> 00:12:07.847
He didn't want to leave any evidence behind.

173
00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:09.547
Just in case he had to justify himself and this evidence

174
00:12:09.547 --> 00:12:11.147
would work against him.

175
00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:14.447
Oh, and who was the person on the other side of the line?

176
00:12:14.447 --> 00:12:18.747
Most probably the woman who was staying at this hotel...

177
00:12:21.747 --> 00:12:24.647
Kaoru Minamizato.

178
00:12:32.247 --> 00:12:35.347
Kaoru, what were the contents of the phone call

179
00:12:35.347 --> 00:12:37.647
that you received back then?

180
00:12:37.647 --> 00:12:42.647
Well, that he received something from Mr. Anzai

181
00:12:42.647 --> 00:12:45.847
and had taken it to the front desk.

182
00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:49.847
But I was told that the front desk didn't have anything for me.

183
00:12:49.847 --> 00:12:52.647
Why did he lie and make that phone call?

184
00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.847
Because he didn't know Ms. Kaoru's face.

185
00:12:55.847 --> 00:12:57.347
Who didn't know?

186
00:12:57.347 --> 00:12:59.347
Shoichiro.

187
00:12:59.347 --> 00:13:02.447
That's why he called Ms. Kaoru to confirm what she looked like.

188
00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:03.947
And...

189
00:13:26.247 --> 00:13:29.347
He ambushed Kaoru, then attacked her.

190
00:13:29.347 --> 00:13:32.047
However, I happened to be there.

191
00:13:32.047 --> 00:13:35.847
Shoichiro who attempted to flee from the veranda...

192
00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:46.547
But, why did he attack me, who he didn't know at all?

193
00:13:46.547 --> 00:13:50.747
Because it would be very convenient for the culprit.

194
00:13:51.647 --> 00:13:54.047
If he didn't know you at all, he would not have a motive.

195
00:13:54.047 --> 00:13:57.747
In other words, he would not be suspected either.

196
00:13:57.747 --> 00:14:01.947
I don't really understand what you're trying to get at.

197
00:14:01.947 --> 00:14:05.747
Kanako, do know why Shoichiro called you

198
00:14:05.747 --> 00:14:08.247
to tell you to come all the way to Beika?

199
00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.347
About that...

200
00:14:11.647 --> 00:14:14.047
So that my husband wouldn't find out?

201
00:14:14.047 --> 00:14:17.047
No, he used you for his alibi.

202
00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:19.747
To establish an alibi?

203
00:14:19.747 --> 00:14:24.247
Shoichiro has no motive to kill Kaoru.

204
00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:25.447
However...

205
00:14:28.147 --> 00:14:30.647
You're fired, get out of here, this minute!

206
00:14:31.647 --> 00:14:34.747
He has a motive to kill Takehiko.

207
00:14:34.747 --> 00:14:38.147
But, he could've established his alibi any other way.

208
00:14:38.147 --> 00:14:39.347
Yes.

209
00:14:39.347 --> 00:14:42.947
But the fact was, he had another important purpose.

210
00:14:42.947 --> 00:14:45.947
It was to make Kanako leave the house

211
00:14:45.947 --> 00:14:48.647
and make sure that Takehiko was at home alone.

212
00:14:48.647 --> 00:14:52.947
After all, it would be troublesome to have Kanako at home,

213
00:14:52.947 --> 00:14:55.347
-if he wanted to murder Takehiko. -What?

214
00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:57.247
Please try to remember,

215
00:14:57.247 --> 00:14:59.147
the call you received from Shoichiro.

216
00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:02.147
What was his first question?

217
00:15:02.147 --> 00:15:03.347
Is Takehiko here?

218
00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:05.147
Yes, he is.

219
00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:07.347
He wanted to know where Takehiko was.

220
00:15:07.347 --> 00:15:09.047
And he made sure Takehiko was home,

221
00:15:09.047 --> 00:15:11.747
he went on to say that he wanted to see you.

222
00:15:11.747 --> 00:15:13.747
Can you come out to Beika?

223
00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.147
Okay.

224
00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:19.147
In front of the station at 12.30 pm. See you.

225
00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:20.347
He called you on his cell phone

226
00:15:20.347 --> 00:15:22.447
from the toilet of the sports center.

227
00:15:22.447 --> 00:15:25.847
I'm pretty sure that there was one other person near him at that time.

228
00:15:25.847 --> 00:15:28.947
Shoichiro probably checked on

229
00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:31.347
the whereabouts of Takehiko for this person,

230
00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:33.547
as well as lure Kanako out.

231
00:15:34.547 --> 00:15:36.947
Ran, can you display the relationship connection diagram?

232
00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:38.147
Okay.

233
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.947
At first glance, it looks to be a case

234
00:15:40.947 --> 00:15:43.047
that is complicatedly interwoven,

235
00:15:43.047 --> 00:15:45.447
But if we omit Kanako,

236
00:15:45.447 --> 00:15:48.847
who was just used to carry out the murders...

237
00:15:49.647 --> 00:15:51.547
It's true it starts to look way more simple.

238
00:15:51.547 --> 00:15:53.947
But, who is that character to the lower right?

239
00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:57.747
There's Shoichiro who has murderous feelings towards Takehiko

240
00:15:57.747 --> 00:16:00.047
and as for Kaoru, the man over there,

241
00:16:00.047 --> 00:16:03.747
who uses an array of aliases had murderous feelings towards her.

242
00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:06.747
I guess we'll just call you Mr. Anzai for now.

243
00:16:06.747 --> 00:16:09.147
Murderous feelings that would never had intersected

244
00:16:09.147 --> 00:16:12.247
and a plan to carry them out was established,

245
00:16:12.247 --> 00:16:15.447
when Shoichiro and you, Mr. Anzai encountered each other.

246
00:16:15.447 --> 00:16:17.147
A plan for exchange murder!

247
00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.247
You must've really panicked, Mr. Azai,

248
00:16:24.247 --> 00:16:26.647
when you succeeded carrying out your part of the deal,

249
00:16:26.647 --> 00:16:32.247
and Shoichiro goofed, on top of getting himself killed.

250
00:16:32.247 --> 00:16:34.347
Because of this,

251
00:16:34.347 --> 00:16:39.047
you ended up having to kill Kaoru with your own hands.

252
00:16:42.747 --> 00:16:46.347
Therefore, you head off to Beika Hotel by yourself.

253
00:16:55.247 --> 00:16:56.947
An exchange murder?

254
00:16:56.947 --> 00:16:58.947
Say what you like.

255
00:16:58.947 --> 00:17:02.947
Do you have evidence, though? Some kind of definite proof?

256
00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:06.447
Dad.

257
00:17:08.647 --> 00:17:10.947
Well, of course, that's an understandable remark.

258
00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:14.347
Inspector Megure, were you able to find the thing in question

259
00:17:14.347 --> 00:17:16.747
in the vicinity of Takehiko's residence?

260
00:17:16.747 --> 00:17:21.347
Yeah, it came out of a trash can of a nearby park.

261
00:17:21.347 --> 00:17:23.547
That's the key of our house.

262
00:17:23.547 --> 00:17:28.347
Kanako, that's the key that you gave to Shoichiro, isn't it?

263
00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:31.047
-Yes. -Strangely enough,

264
00:17:31.047 --> 00:17:34.647
this key was not found among Shoichiro's belongings.

265
00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:40.947
He had given it to Mr. Anzai.

266
00:17:40.947 --> 00:17:42.747
Since he had no intention of getting it back,

267
00:17:42.747 --> 00:17:45.747
so maybe it's more appropriate to say, he gave it to you.

268
00:17:47.547 --> 00:17:51.747
As for you, Mr. Anzai, although you used the key to go into the house,

269
00:17:51.747 --> 00:17:54.947
figuring that it would only serve as evidence if you have it on you,

270
00:17:54.947 --> 00:17:56.747
you decided to throw it away.

271
00:17:56.747 --> 00:18:00.147
Why was the window cracked, then?

272
00:18:00.147 --> 00:18:04.647
Of course it was just to make it look as if a robber had broken in.

273
00:18:04.647 --> 00:18:07.547
There was no meaning for him to leave the key back in the room,

274
00:18:07.547 --> 00:18:11.247
so he locked the door and left.

275
00:18:11.247 --> 00:18:14.447
Amazing how you deduced that far.

276
00:18:14.447 --> 00:18:18.347
Please think back to where Takehiko was lying on the floor.

277
00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:21.047
It was right by the front door, wasn't it?

278
00:18:21.047 --> 00:18:23.547
If the window had been cracked first,

279
00:18:23.547 --> 00:18:26.447
even though Takehiko was in the living room,

280
00:18:26.447 --> 00:18:29.447
he would've headed for the study to check out what happened.

281
00:18:29.447 --> 00:18:34.347
However, he in fact, heard someone come in from the front door...

282
00:18:35.947 --> 00:18:39.247
He ran into you, Mr. Anzai as you came in,

283
00:18:39.247 --> 00:18:41.247
and was killed.

284
00:18:49.347 --> 00:18:51.647
Did you find any fingerprints on the key or what?

285
00:18:51.647 --> 00:18:55.947
No, you must've wiped it off before getting rid of it.

286
00:18:56.647 --> 00:18:58.747
It doesn't matter either way.

287
00:18:58.747 --> 00:19:01.147
If you have no evidence,

288
00:19:01.147 --> 00:19:02.847
sorry, but I think I'm leaving.

289
00:19:02.847 --> 00:19:05.747
Then, how about something like this?

290
00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:08.547
-Ran, can you take out the picture, please? -Yes.

291
00:19:11.247 --> 00:19:12.247
What is it?

292
00:19:12.247 --> 00:19:14.347
Looking for a mistake.

293
00:19:14.347 --> 00:19:17.447
Will everyone here look very carefully?

294
00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:18.447
The picture to the left

295
00:19:18.447 --> 00:19:21.247
is Mr. Anzai before he goes into the restroom.

296
00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:25.347
The picture to the right is Mr. Anzai when he comes out.

297
00:19:35.347 --> 00:19:37.347
The key!

298
00:19:50.047 --> 00:19:52.247
You have no way out at this point.

299
00:19:52.247 --> 00:19:54.747
Admit your shameful deeds.

300
00:19:59.647 --> 00:20:03.947
When I was shown the picture at a diving shop I used to frequent,

301
00:20:03.947 --> 00:20:05.647
shivers went through my spine.

302
00:20:05.647 --> 00:20:08.147
I somehow made it through back then,

303
00:20:08.147 --> 00:20:11.747
but when I thought of the time that Kaoru eventually finds me...

304
00:20:11.747 --> 00:20:13.647
It was just around that time.

305
00:20:15.747 --> 00:20:19.547
Darn, that Takehiko.

306
00:20:19.547 --> 00:20:21.847
He can just drop dead for all I care.

307
00:20:24.347 --> 00:20:26.647
He can just drop dead.

308
00:20:32.947 --> 00:20:36.247
What do you say we commit exchange murders?

309
00:20:36.247 --> 00:20:38.847
Even if we do get caught, we would have no motive,

310
00:20:38.847 --> 00:20:41.447
and besides, we'll have a perfect alibi.

311
00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:46.147
Let me sleep on it.

312
00:20:46.147 --> 00:20:48.447
I've gone as far as tell you this much,

313
00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:51.347
I really don't want you to refuse this offer.

314
00:20:52.747 --> 00:20:55.047
He was not all for it to begin with,

315
00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:57.247
but after I convinced him that we would never be caught,

316
00:20:57.247 --> 00:21:00.147
he decided to do it.

317
00:21:00.147 --> 00:21:03.647
So, you're the one who talked him into this after all.

318
00:21:03.647 --> 00:21:06.847
By the way, Shoichiro seems to have repented

319
00:21:06.847 --> 00:21:10.547
after realizing what a serious crime he had committed.

320
00:21:10.547 --> 00:21:13.447
Sorry, I don't know what's come over me.

321
00:21:13.447 --> 00:21:15.147
Please overlook this.

322
00:21:17.647 --> 00:21:20.447
He was probably cornered to no end.

323
00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:24.247
That's why he was conned into going along with your plan.

324
00:21:24.247 --> 00:21:26.447
A disgusting crime.

325
00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:28.347
You're really going to have to make amends.

326
00:22:57.047 --> 00:22:58.147
"Chiezo Nekura, (31). Frequent offenders, arrest!"

327
00:22:58.147 --> 00:23:00.747
After his face was seen in the newspapers

328
00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:03.147
people claiming that they were victimized came out one after the other.

329
00:23:03.147 --> 00:23:05.647
He must've been a real villain.

330
00:23:05.647 --> 00:23:08.047
Villain is just enough to describe his abhorrence.

331
00:23:08.047 --> 00:23:12.347
That's why he comes up with an idea like exchange murders.

332
00:23:12.347 --> 00:23:16.947
I wonder if this was a case of synchronicity too.

333
00:23:16.947 --> 00:23:20.947
Because the fact that dad was tailing Shoichiro,

334
00:23:20.947 --> 00:23:25.047
and dad bursting into the room when Shoichiro attacked Kaoru

335
00:23:25.047 --> 00:23:26.747
were all coincidences, right?

336
00:23:26.747 --> 00:23:31.847
You gotta remember when Kaoru was attacked by that man too.

337
00:23:31.847 --> 00:23:35.247
If I didn't say let's go back, she would've been in serious danger.

338
00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:37.647
It was me who said that.

339
00:23:37.647 --> 00:23:39.347
Oh, well, who cares?

340
00:23:39.347 --> 00:23:42.047
I wonder if this is synchronicity too.

341
00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.547
What is, Conan?

342
00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:46.447
Whenever Pops successfully solves a case,

343
00:23:46.447 --> 00:23:49.547
we're coincidentally always blessed!

344
00:23:49.547 --> 00:23:51.447
-What? -Dad.

345
00:23:51.447 --> 00:23:54.347
This is all thanks to my wisdom and chance!

346
00:23:54.347 --> 00:23:55.947
Dad.

00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:04.147

00:24:04.147 --> 00:24:05.447
