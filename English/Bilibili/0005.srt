1
00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:02.854
My name's Conan Edogawa.

2
00:00:02.854 --> 00:00:06.184
High school student Shinichi was forced
to take a pill that shrunk him!

3
00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:08.114
I may look like a little
grade school student,

4
00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:10.114
but my powers of deduction
are unrivaled!

5
00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:12.114
I'll show you how mysteries
are really solved!

6
00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:15.584
Today's incident is a terrifying
explosion on a bullet train!

7
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.620
The Great Bullet Train Explosion

8
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.050
Nobody shaves in the bullet train

9
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.340
on the way to their
best friend's wedding!

10
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.880
It's not my fault!

11
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.730
I overslept 'cuz I was up late last
night discussing things with a client!

12
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.190
Oh, please. You got drunk
and fell asleep in the doorway.

13
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.620
I brought you along 'cuz you
wanted to come, but I dunno why...

14
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.130
But the wedding's in Kyoto!

15
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.880
You really wanted to go there too,
didn't you, Conan-kun?

16
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.600
Yeah.

17
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.710
Why did we have to
bring him along anyway?!

18
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.260
You know we can't
leave him all alone!

19
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.550
Say, are those new shoes?

20
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.550
Yeah! Professor Agasa gave them to me!

21
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.910
I made you something
I'm sure you'll like!

22
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.390
Power Kick Shoes!

23
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840
Kick a ball with these shoes

24
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.350
and the criminals
won't know what hit them!

25
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.710
It uses electricity and magnetic fields
to stimulate your feet muscles,

26
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.810
thereby substantially
increasing your kick power!

27
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.460
What about my glasses?

28
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.630
They're ready too.

29
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.100
I added a miniature hidden
microphone to them.

30
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.710
I'm certain it'll come in handy!

31
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.880
I hope they actually work
when I need them to!

32
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.920
A bullet train!

33
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.290
But why are they with us too?!

34
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.250
What does it matter?
Their tickets have been paid for.

35
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.510
Man, parents these days...

36
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.010
Conan-kun! Let's go exploring!

37
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.630
It looks like it'll be really fun!

38
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.640
Let's go!

39
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.010
Their parents obviously have some issues.

40
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.030
And what about his parents?!

41
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.460
They haven't even called us once!

42
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.020
Uh oh!

43
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.000
I gotta go to the bathroom!

44
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.670
It's not like I'm living
with you because I want to!

45
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.860
It's all their fault!

46
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.780
They were the ones who forced me
to take that weird pill

47
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.240
and wind up small like this!

48
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.930
It's them!

49
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.730
This is my best chance to
steal some of those pills!

50
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.130
Once I turn back into high
school detective Shinichi Kudo,

51
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.710
I'll expose all of your
evil deeds to the world!

52
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.710
Just you wait!

53
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.610
But what in the world
could they be doing here?

54
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.040
They're meeting with someone...

55
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.680
Now's my chance to plant Professor
Agasa's hidden microphone

56
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.390
on one of their seats!

57
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.530
What are you doing, Conan-kun?!

58
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.150
Move!

59
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.950
I wasn't doing anything...

60
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.710
Really?

61
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.210
You're such a troublemaker,
Conan-kun!

62
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.340
It's people like you who
give kids a bad name!

63
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.340
You should wrap the gum in paper
and put it in an ashtray!

64
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.550
There.

65
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.680
I'll hear them just fine
if it's in there!

66
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.550
Learn from your friends, Conan-kun!

67
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.620
You're all such good children!

68
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.260
Of course we are!

69
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.460
Let's go!

70
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.340
If I know you, Conan-kun,
that wasn't any ordinary prank!

71
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.670
Was that gum some sort
of secret weapon?!

72
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.800
Are those two men spies?! Hit men?!

73
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.210
It would be great if they were,
but I was just being a troublemaker!

74
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.240
For reals?

75
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.920
Aw, man...

76
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.010
What a bore.
Let's get back to exploring!

77
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.460
Excuse me for being a bore.

78
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.750
Outta the way, boy.

79
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.530
Huh?

80
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.860
It's not them!
They're not the men in black!

81
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.940
I got the wrong people!
I feel like such an idiot!

82
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.130
He has a suitcase instead of
the attachÃ© case he had before...

83
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.130
Something's not right...

84
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.460
The two suitcases are too different

85
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.280
for someone to accidentally
mistake one for the other...

86
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.010
That's it! I'll use the professor's
hidden microphone!

87
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.880
He said that if I turn the dial
to match the frequency,

88
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.980
special sound waves will
stimulate my eardrums,

89
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.930
allowing me to hear
with my glasses on!

90
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.010
I can finally have a smoke.

91
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.860
I can hear them!

92
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.910
Something's in here!

93
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.260
Oh no!

94
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.260
Oh, it's just gum.

95
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.840
That was close!

96
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.880
This sure turned out to be
an easy transaction, boss!

97
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.380
Keep it down!

98
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.340
Don't worry, nobody's listening!

99
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.590
But 100 million just for
handing over that case?

100
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.760
What in the world was inside it?

101
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.270
Information about gold.

102
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.740
Information that's worth more than
100 million once it's put to use.

103
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.090
Probably's already sitting
back down, smiling with glee

104
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.800
and looking out at the last scenic view
that the fool will ever get to see...

105
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.710
Last scenic view?

106
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.530
Included inside the black
case we handed over...

107
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:56.880
...was a bomb that'll detonate in 10
seconds after receiving a large shock!

108
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.210
A bomb?!

109
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.620
So if they accidentally
drop the case...

110
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.920
The information is too important.

111
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.880
I doubt that would happen...

112
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.210
And besides, the explosion
is set for 3:10.

113
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.430
It's a time bomb?

114
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.210
No. But when the time comes,

115
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.390
they'll unknowingly press
the detonation button themselves.

116
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.090
10 seconds later, the entire bullet
train gets blasted into pieces.

117
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.820
Into pieces?!

118
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.010
I mean, 8 times 8 equals?

119
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.330
64!

120
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.040
Don't you mean "Happa 64"?

121
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.300
Oh, right!

122
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.300
8 times 8 is 64!

123
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.310
8 times 9...

124
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.210
72!

125
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.260
Stupid kid had me scared
there for a second!

126
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.180
Now arriving at Nagoya!

127
00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.680
Hurry! We're getting off!

128
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.360
Wait! There's still something
I want to ask you!

129
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.610
Wait!

130
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.330
Not so fast!

131
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.170
I can't let you out of
my sight, Conan-kun.

132
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.040
This is bad! Without them onboard--

133
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.080
Wait. The person they made
the transaction with is still inside!

134
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.300
Oh, man! 40 minutes until it explodes!

135
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.510
I have to find the person before then!

136
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.700
But how?! There's hundreds
of passengers onboard!

137
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.370
Conan-kun!

138
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.770
Where could he have gone...

139
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.520
A bomb?!

140
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.710
Yeah! Someone onboard has a bomb!

141
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.260
We have to stop the train
at the next station

142
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.460
and evacuate all the passengers!

143
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.380
This train's gonna be
blown to smithereens!

144
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.670
Now, now. Don't be teasing grownups.

145
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.260
Hold on. It isn't nice to disregard
him just because he's a kid.

146
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.170
Wait a second while I call
Anpan Man for help!

147
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.630
No good! They don't
believe me one bit!

148
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.850
What should I do?!

149
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.210
Conan-kun! Is anything
interesting going on?

150
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.290
Let us know if you find
another case to solve!

151
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.760
Are these the only guys
who'll listen to me?!

152
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.880
There are tons of black briefcases...

153
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.240
Checking them all would be impossible!

154
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.770
Darn it! Is my only option
to look for the bomb alone?

155
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.170
Find a clue!

156
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.710
Remember back to the beginning
of their conversation!

157
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.180
I can finally have a smoke.

158
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.260
What does that mean?

159
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.390
The dining car isn't non-smoking...

160
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.260
Ah! The person they met
doesn't like cigarette smoke!

161
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.050
Meaning that person doesn't smoke!

162
00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.390
Which means the person's
in a non-smoking car!

163
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.770
Let's see, how many non-smoking
cars were on this train...?

164
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.920
Eight!

165
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.660
Why do you ask?

166
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.660
Are we solving a mystery?!

167
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.500
There have to be more clues!

168
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.880
100 million just for handing
over that case?

169
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.300
What in the world was inside it?

170
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.960
Information about gold.

171
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.170
Probably's already sitting
back down, smiling with glee

172
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.880
and looking out at the last scenic view
that the fool will ever get to see...

173
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.760
Where on this train can you see
scenic views from the windows?!

174
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.340
The 2-story Green Cars!

175
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.330
There are 3 Green Cars, right?
Which ones are non-smoking?

176
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.210
That would be the 2nd floor of Car 7!

177
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.460
What's there?!

178
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.330
I dunno what's goin' on,
but let's go anyway!

179
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.320
No, it's too dangerous for children...

180
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.210
We're the Junior Detective Club!
Let's go!

181
00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:19.165
Who could have the black briefcase
with the bomb in it?!

182
00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:23.045
One...

183
00:12:23.915 --> 00:12:25.055
Two...

184
00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:27.005
Three...

185
00:12:27.795 --> 00:12:28.965
Four...

186
00:12:32.005 --> 00:12:34.865
I'll have to check them
each one by one!

187
00:12:40.335 --> 00:12:44.695
Stock trading and a gold Rolex!

188
00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:47.125
He's rakin' in the dough, all right...

189
00:12:47.125 --> 00:12:48.115
Here goes!

190
00:12:48.755 --> 00:12:50.835
Hey! Can I play that game too?

191
00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:52.415
This is not a toy!

192
00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:54.585
Liar! There's a bunch of circles
and rectangles on the screen!

193
00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:56.915
You're disrupting my work! Go away!

194
00:12:57.295 --> 00:12:58.125
Big meanie!

195
00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:02.375
Then let me play this black one!
It's a game too, right?

196
00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:05.835
What's the matter, little boy?
Are you lost?

197
00:13:12.505 --> 00:13:13.635
Wow!

198
00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:16.245
What a good view this is!

199
00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:20.445
Isn't it? The weather is clear today,
so you can see Mt. Fuji from there!

200
00:13:21.705 --> 00:13:22.705
Mt. Fuji?!

201
00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:25.255
Do you like Mt. Fuji?

202
00:13:25.255 --> 00:13:28.705
Yeah! I love it!

203
00:13:28.705 --> 00:13:31.445
Darn! It's locked!

204
00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:36.045
Shut up already! What part of
"go away" don't you understand?!

205
00:13:36.045 --> 00:13:36.825
Ugh.

206
00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:39.915
Say, did you go to the dining car?

207
00:13:39.915 --> 00:13:41.125
Eh? Why do you ask?

208
00:13:41.125 --> 00:13:44.045
I just thought you looked
like the person who was there

209
00:13:44.045 --> 00:13:45.795
with some men dressed in black.

210
00:13:46.415 --> 00:13:48.455
Oh, you must have
the wrong person then.

211
00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:50.375
I haven't been to the dining car.

212
00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:51.665
What about you, Mister?

213
00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:54.765
As if I could go anywhere
when I'm this busy!

214
00:13:55.295 --> 00:13:56.185
Sorry!

215
00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:06.415
Hey, did you go to the dining
car a little while ago?

216
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:10.795
Huh?

217
00:14:10.795 --> 00:14:13.295
I said, did you go to the
dining car a little while ago?!

218
00:14:14.045 --> 00:14:15.915
Why, yes I did!

219
00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:19.505
No matter how many times I go,
Disneyland is always fun!

220
00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:25.465
This isn't working out.
I'll come back to him later!

221
00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:36.345
Gold rims!

222
00:14:36.955 --> 00:14:39.025
Hey! Did you go to the dining car?

223
00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:41.995
What?

224
00:14:41.995 --> 00:14:45.205
I guess it's really none
of my business, is it?

225
00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:52.835
That's a napkin from the dining car!

226
00:14:53.545 --> 00:14:55.525
This guy's been there!

227
00:14:56.625 --> 00:14:57.745
Here goes!

228
00:14:58.455 --> 00:15:01.625
Hey, my paper airplane
got stuck up there.

229
00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:02.705
You don't mind if I get it, do you?

230
00:15:03.545 --> 00:15:04.755
Okay?

231
00:15:06.015 --> 00:15:08.675
Huh? Where is it?
I can't find it!

232
00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:12.545
Don't touch that!

233
00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:18.255
Included inside the black case
we handed over...

234
00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:23.035
...was a bomb that'll detonate in
10 seconds after receiving a large shock!

235
00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:24.295
Oh no!

236
00:15:32.505 --> 00:15:34.755
Nice catch, Genta-kun!

237
00:15:34.755 --> 00:15:36.005
Excellent job!

238
00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:38.655
What is this, anyway?

239
00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:41.075
It's a--

240
00:15:41.535 --> 00:15:43.335
Will you knock it off already?!

241
00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:52.465
Underwear?!

242
00:15:55.545 --> 00:15:57.925
You lousy kids!

243
00:15:58.545 --> 00:15:59.675
And stay out!

244
00:16:02.415 --> 00:16:05.475
Conan-kun! The rest of you too!
Give it a rest!

245
00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.705
14 minutes until it explodes!

246
00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:17.165
But that's one person down!
Only three to go!

247
00:16:17.165 --> 00:16:18.925
Who has the bomb?!

248
00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:26.335
Darn those freaks!

249
00:16:26.335 --> 00:16:28.195
It's a time bomb?

250
00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:31.005
No. But when the time comes,

251
00:16:31.005 --> 00:16:34.005
they'll unknowingly press
the detonation button themselves.

252
00:16:34.455 --> 00:16:35.705
That's it!

253
00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:38.705
That means the explosion's set off by
the person's reaction to something...

254
00:16:38.705 --> 00:16:44.855
The 3 people have a laptop,
a cell phone, and a tape player!

255
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.415
No good! They're all suspect!

256
00:16:48.415 --> 00:16:49.835
I'm still missing something!

257
00:16:51.045 --> 00:16:53.375
No you don't! Where do
you think you're going?

258
00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:57.255
I told you to sit here
and behave yourself!

259
00:16:57.255 --> 00:16:59.045
But I need to go to the bathroom...

260
00:16:59.045 --> 00:17:00.835
You just went.

261
00:17:00.835 --> 00:17:01.825
I'm thirsty--

262
00:17:01.825 --> 00:17:03.125
Just put up with it.

263
00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:04.045
Gifts?

264
00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:05.795
You're supposed to buy
those on your way back!

265
00:17:05.795 --> 00:17:06.815
A walk?

266
00:17:06.815 --> 00:17:08.335
No!

267
00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:11.715
You sure do like
to get into trouble...

268
00:17:13.585 --> 00:17:16.165
Oh no! 7 minutes left!

269
00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:18.545
The only choice now
is to explain everything

270
00:17:18.545 --> 00:17:21.005
and have all the passengers evacuate!

271
00:17:21.005 --> 00:17:23.695
But nobody'll believe me
because I'm a kid!

272
00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:28.045
There's only one way
to make her believe me!

273
00:17:28.045 --> 00:17:30.495
If I tell her that
I'm actually Shinichi Kudo,

274
00:17:30.495 --> 00:17:33.295
Ran would have to believe me!

275
00:17:33.295 --> 00:17:35.545
Everyone would believe
her if she told them!

276
00:17:37.335 --> 00:17:42.345
If the bomb explodes, me, Ran,
and all the other passengers are...

277
00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:46.915
Say, Ran.

278
00:17:46.915 --> 00:17:50.335
That's no way to address your elders!

279
00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:53.255
You're supposed to use name
suffixes for older people!

280
00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:56.005
Listen to me, Ran.

281
00:17:56.005 --> 00:17:57.545
You did it again!

282
00:17:57.545 --> 00:18:00.225
This is serious!

283
00:18:00.795 --> 00:18:02.015
I'm sorry, Ran.

284
00:18:03.205 --> 00:18:04.915
I've been hiding something
from you this whole time.

285
00:18:04.915 --> 00:18:05.635
Hiding?

286
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.665
I'm neither Conan Edogawa
nor a grade school student!

287
00:18:09.665 --> 00:18:10.105
I'm...

288
00:18:10.835 --> 00:18:13.545
I'm actually...

289
00:18:13.545 --> 00:18:15.585
Did we pass the ocean already?!

290
00:18:15.585 --> 00:18:18.065
Yeah, while you were looking away.

291
00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:21.255
But these seats face the mountains!

292
00:18:21.255 --> 00:18:23.035
We wouldn't have seen it anyway!

293
00:18:23.505 --> 00:18:24.495
Facing the mountains?!

294
00:18:25.255 --> 00:18:26.415
What a good view this is!

295
00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:30.665
Isn't it? The weather is clear today
so you can see Mt. Fuji from there!

296
00:18:31.455 --> 00:18:33.705
I'm sure those seats
faced the ocean!

297
00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:35.565
It would be impossible
to see Mt. Fuji!

298
00:18:36.455 --> 00:18:40.505
Then where did she see
Mt. Fuji from?

299
00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:42.815
The dining car!

300
00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:46.665
They sat on the side
facing the mountains.

301
00:18:46.665 --> 00:18:50.915
If she mistook the view from there
for the view from her seat...

302
00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:54.545
I haven't been to the dining car.

303
00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:57.885
If that was a lie to cover up
the truth about the transaction...

304
00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:01.355
...then the bomb's...

305
00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:04.565
...in her briefcase!

306
00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:09.875
Not good! Only one minute left!

307
00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:12.635
Attention, passengers.

308
00:19:12.635 --> 00:19:18.125
As using cellular phones may
disturb other passengers,

309
00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:21.575
we ask that you step onto the outside
deck before using your phone.

310
00:19:22.165 --> 00:19:24.215
That's it! The cell phone!

311
00:19:25.795 --> 00:19:27.835
Now what?

312
00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:32.335
Hey! Ran says she'll buy us
any yummy food we want!

313
00:19:32.335 --> 00:19:34.915
Alright! I'll take
an eel boxed lunch!

314
00:19:34.915 --> 00:19:36.085
I want sushi!

315
00:19:36.085 --> 00:19:39.125
I'd like a full course
of French cuisine!

316
00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:41.325
Hey, wait...

317
00:19:42.255 --> 00:19:45.335
It's impossible to plan for someone
to press a key or button

318
00:19:45.335 --> 00:19:48.125
on a laptop or tape player
at exactly 3:10!

319
00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:49.665
But a phone!

320
00:19:49.665 --> 00:19:52.575
It's entirely possible to have
a predetermined time or phone number!

321
00:20:00.665 --> 00:20:01.185
Too late!

322
00:20:01.525 --> 00:20:02.085
Hello?

323
00:20:04.335 --> 00:20:08.025
10 seconds later, the entire bullet
train gets blasted into pieces.

324
00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:22.965
What was that?

325
00:20:29.335 --> 00:20:30.415
W-Who are you...?

326
00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:33.665
Conan Edogawa. A detective!

327
00:20:34.455 --> 00:20:36.085
D-Detective?!

328
00:20:36.705 --> 00:20:40.455
Hey, you! What have
you done this time?!

329
00:20:40.455 --> 00:20:42.055
I'm just a grade school student though!

330
00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:48.455
Afterward, the bullet train was stopped

331
00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:50.625
and Inspector Megure and his men
began their investigation.

332
00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:53.625
Being late to the wedding
was a problem in itself,

333
00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:56.975
but things somehow came to an end
without anyone getting hurt.

334
00:20:57.585 --> 00:21:01.295
It turns out she bought inside
information about the trading market

335
00:21:01.295 --> 00:21:03.385
from the two men for 100 million yen.

336
00:21:03.385 --> 00:21:05.415
Apparently, she was supposed
to call them on a specific phone

337
00:21:06.045 --> 00:21:09.375
at a specific time to find out
how to open the case.

338
00:21:09.375 --> 00:21:14.165
But the two planned from the start
to get rid of her after getting the money.

339
00:21:14.165 --> 00:21:21.325
They were caught and arrested
by an emergency police inspection line.

340
00:21:22.165 --> 00:21:25.375
I really jumped to conclusions though...

341
00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:29.305
Where did the real men
in black who shrunk me go?!

342
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:32.455
Darn it! I'll never give up!

343
00:21:32.455 --> 00:21:35.205
I'll catch up to you someday!

344
00:21:35.205 --> 00:21:36.255
I swear it!

345
00:23:15.135 --> 00:23:18.555
Say, Conan-kun. What were you
about to tell me that one time?

346
00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:19.575
Eh? What are you talking about?

347
00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:24.425
Don't pretend you don't know!
You were serious when you said it!

348
00:23:24.425 --> 00:23:27.585
I'm neither Conan Edogawa
nor a grade school student!

349
00:23:27.585 --> 00:23:28.285
I'm...

350
00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:30.795
I'm actually...

351
00:23:32.175 --> 00:23:33.525
Who are you actually?

352
00:23:33.525 --> 00:23:37.365
Uh, I'm actually...

353
00:23:37.365 --> 00:23:39.565
A genius at getting into trouble!

354
00:24:02.805 --> 00:24:04.765
What are you doing, Ran?

355
00:24:04.765 --> 00:24:09.295
It's chocolate. For Valentine's Day,
which only comes once a year!

356
00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:11.095
A date?!

357
00:24:11.725 --> 00:24:13.205
I'm going now!

358
00:24:13.595 --> 00:24:16.305
Go and catch a rich man.

359
00:24:16.725 --> 00:24:19.035
It goes without saying that
this case is an easy one.

360
00:24:19.975 --> 00:24:22.775
Which means you did it!

361
00:24:23.555 --> 00:24:25.775
The real murderer was...

362
00:24:25.775 --> 00:24:27.635
On the next Conan--

363
00:24:27.635 --> 00:24:29.855
The Valentine Murder Case.

364
00:24:48.806 --> 00:24:50.999
Next Conan's Hint:

365
00:24:50.999 --> 00:24:51.002
Next Conan's Hint:
Chocolate.

366
00:24:51.002 --> 00:24:53.096
Chocolate.
