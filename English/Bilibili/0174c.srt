1
00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:11.051
I know I heard it!

2
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:12.651
It sounded like something fell into the ocean,

3
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:14.651
it's very suspicious!

4
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:18.851
Like I told you, it was probably the sound of fish jumping!

5
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:23.551
I hear there are a lot of bonito and flying fish in this area.

6
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:28.451
Excuse me! Did you see that boy who speaks with a Kansai accent?

7
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:30.051
Kansai accent?

8
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:33.851
He came here to borrow a flashlight.

9
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:35.751
Flashlight?

10
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:39.051
That means there's a good chance

11
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:42.451
he went out on the deck to look for something!

12
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:43.851
Then...

13
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.651
That sound... No way!

14
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.451
It can't be!

15
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:50.251
Wait!

16
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:54.151
It's impossible! He'd never let that happen!

17
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:58.351
Hattori!

18
00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:02.251
Hattori!

19
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:04.251
Where are you?

20
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.251
Answer me!

21
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:11.751
Hattori.

22
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:19.851
It can't be true! It can't!

23
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:21.851
Hattori!

24
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:26.551
Hattori!

25
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:35.451
Hattori!

26
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.451
Hey, kid!

27
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:39.651
You've got to be careful!

28
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:40.851
You could've fallen over.

29
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.851
-But... -He's right, kid!

30
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:49.251
The ocean is extremely vast.

31
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:54.651
If a person were to fall in, a mere human being

32
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:57.151
would be helpless death is a certainty.

33
00:01:57.151 --> 00:01:59.551
Conan!

34
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:02.551
What in the world are you doing?

35
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:05.551
But Heiji is...

36
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.551
That boy again.

37
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:11.151
He's probably off somewhere looking for clues!

38
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:12.151
Dad's right!

39
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:16.151
Don't worry, he'll pop up soon.

40
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:20.451
Yoshimi.

41
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:25.051
Well...

42
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:29.051
Your voice sounded just like someone I knew.

43
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.351
Never mind that, what's going on here?

44
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:35.051
What are you three doing here?

45
00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:39.251
She asked us to help her look for something.

46
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:40.451
You were looking for something?

47
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.051
My pendant.

48
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:44.851
I noticed it was gone just when I was going to bed,

49
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:48.251
I was looking all over for it, then I ran into these fellows.

50
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.251
They didn't look like they had anything to do,

51
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.051
so I asked them to help me.

52
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:52.251
There's a better chance of finding it with three

53
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:55.051
rather than one person searching.

54
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:59.051
Well, are you talking about this locket with the photo in it?

55
00:02:59.051 --> 00:03:00.451
What?

56
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:02.051
The clasp was unhooked,

57
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.851
I found it on the bow.

58
00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.451
Yes, this is it, thank you.

59
00:03:08.451 --> 00:03:12.151
I must have dropped it this evening when I was up there.

60
00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:15.551
Then is the little girl in the picture, you, Nagisa?

61
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.151
Is that your father carrying you?

62
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.151
Yes.

63
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:23.451
For goodness sakes, why didn't you return it to her earlier?

64
00:03:23.451 --> 00:03:27.451
But there was a hole in her father's face

65
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:30.151
and I didn't know who it belonged to!

66
00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:35.451
After all, it could have been someone else carrying their daughter.

67
00:03:35.451 --> 00:03:40.151
I intended to ask who it belonged to during dinner but I forgot!

68
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.851
I'm sorry, I didn't realise there was a hole in it.

69
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.151
It's all right.

70
00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:47.551
It's an old photo taken over 20 years ago.

71
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:50.451
This is the only thing I have left

72
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:53.051
to remind me of my late father.

73
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:57.651
Are you all out of your minds?

74
00:03:57.651 --> 00:04:01.451
A killer is on board and you're all wandering around!

75
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.451
"Toji Samezaki (62)" -Mouri!

76
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:04.451
Why did you let them out of the restaurant?

77
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:06.551
Well...

78
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:09.351
They said they wanted to go back to their cabins and rest.

79
00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:10.351
That's right!

80
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.651
You have no right to give us orders!

81
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:16.551
Besides, I didn't want to stay here anymore!

82
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:19.151
"Nagisa Isogai (27)" -Especially not with a hysterical old man!

83
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.151
What did you say?

84
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:24.051
If you say being alone is dangerous,

85
00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:26.851
it'll be better to lock myself in my room

86
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:30.151
and spend the night playing cards with these kids.

87
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:31.151
Isn't that right?

88
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.851
Well...

89
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:35.051
"Sadao Kujirai (50)" -I don't think

90
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.051
"Minoru Ebina (42)" -it's a good idea to split up.

91
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:41.351
I think it's safer if we all stay together in one place.

92
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:46.351
By the way, have you found Mr. Kameda you were looking for?

93
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:48.951
No, he seems to have disappeared!

94
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:51.151
Along with Mr. Kano!

95
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:53.151
Have you seen Heiji Hattori?

96
00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:57.351
No way! Are you telling me Heizo's son is also missing?

97
00:04:57.351 --> 00:05:01.051
Darn, what's happening on this ship?

98
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:05.451
All right then! I don't anyone of you to go anywhere alone!

99
00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:08.051
The killer could be someone outside this group

100
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:12.051
or it could be one of us.

101
00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:15.151
The killer could be lying in wait for us to be alone!

102
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:17.151
He may be right.

103
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:18.851
When we heard the first gunshot,

104
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.651
Mr. Samezaki was with us in the lounge

105
00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:24.351
and Mr. Kujirai had just returned from the restaurant.

106
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:27.751
And right after we all ran to the upper deck,

107
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:29.551
there was an explosion at the stern

108
00:05:29.551 --> 00:05:32.551
and the box with the body inside was set on fire.

109
00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:35.851
We all ran up to the deck together

110
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:40.151
and even Mr. Ebina and Ms. Isogai who joined us later

111
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:42.551
wouldn't have been able to start the fire.

112
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:43.851
Which means that

113
00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:47.951
since we can't at present identify the fire victim,

114
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:50.351
the only ones capable of setting the fire

115
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:52.151
were the men not on the deck with us,

116
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:55.951
Mr. Kameda, Mr. Kanie

117
00:05:55.951 --> 00:06:00.551
and the old man calling himself Saizo Kano.

118
00:06:01.651 --> 00:06:04.451
But something's bothering me,

119
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:08.151
it's the strange behaviour of the people in this group.

120
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:15.151
And Mr. Samezaki's almost fanatical reaction.

121
00:06:15.151 --> 00:06:17.651
What happened?

122
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:21.851
What happened during that robbery 20 years ago?

123
00:06:29.612 --> 00:06:31.712
I'm going to the toilet,

124
00:06:31.712 --> 00:06:32.912
please wait for me!

125
00:06:34.512 --> 00:06:36.212
Darn it all! If only Hattori were here,

126
00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:40.412
he'd easily be able to ask Pops about the case.

127
00:06:40.412 --> 00:06:42.612
Where in the world'd he got off to?

128
00:06:42.612 --> 00:06:47.012
"Dr. Agasa's home"

129
00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:49.212
Hello? Hey, how are things going?

130
00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:51.912
What? The 400 million yen robbery 20 years ago?

131
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:53.912
"The statute of limitations of" -We were just watching

132
00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:56.612
"400 million yen robbery is running out today" -a special on that case!

133
00:06:56.612 --> 00:06:58.712
The statute of limitations is running out

134
00:06:58.712 --> 00:07:01.012
so they've been doing a lot of specials on it since last night!

135
00:07:01.012 --> 00:07:02.812
I thought you'd probably want to see it,

136
00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:04.712
so we're recording it.

137
00:07:04.712 --> 00:07:07.112
Did they mention something about the thieves?

138
00:07:07.112 --> 00:07:08.612
Wait a second.

139
00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:10.612
I'm sure there was something!

140
00:07:12.912 --> 00:07:15.712
They identified the ringleader, Saizo Kano,

141
00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:17.212
but as for the remaining three,

142
00:07:17.212 --> 00:07:21.512
all they had were montages and no names!

143
00:07:21.512 --> 00:07:24.212
Did they mention whether Kano died or not?

144
00:07:24.212 --> 00:07:27.412
Yes, his blood stained coat with a bullet hole

145
00:07:27.412 --> 00:07:28.912
and it washed up on shore,

146
00:07:28.912 --> 00:07:31.312
so the police deduced he was killed

147
00:07:31.312 --> 00:07:34.112
by his three accomplices after a falling out!

148
00:07:34.112 --> 00:07:37.712
But how did they know it was Kano's coat?

149
00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:40.712
In the inside pocket of the coat,

150
00:07:40.712 --> 00:07:43.712
they found a photo that he always carried on his person.

151
00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:47.712
It was a picture of him carrying his daughter.

152
00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:49.212
What?

153
00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:51.512
It certainly was a tragic case.

154
00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.112
The alarm went off and it scared one of the robbers,

155
00:07:54.112 --> 00:07:55.912
he panicked and fired wildly.

156
00:07:55.912 --> 00:08:01.112
One of the bullets hit and killed a teller named Samezaki.

157
00:08:01.112 --> 00:08:03.212
What? You mean someone was shot?

158
00:08:03.212 --> 00:08:07.612
A female teller, her name was Yoshimi Samezaki.

159
00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.912
The poor thing, she was still so young.

160
00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:13.212
Yoshimi Samezaki?

161
00:08:13.212 --> 00:08:16.912
It can't be. But it's just too much of a coincidence.

162
00:08:17.912 --> 00:08:23.512
Why are there so many people connected to that case here on this ship?

163
00:08:23.512 --> 00:08:28.312
Who is this Masaru Furukawa who sponsored the tour?

164
00:08:28.312 --> 00:08:32.012
"Masaru Furukawa" -Who in the world is he anyway?

165
00:08:38.212 --> 00:08:39.612
What was that?

166
00:08:39.612 --> 00:08:41.312
I have to go now!

167
00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.612
Call me if you think of something!

168
00:08:43.612 --> 00:08:45.112
Hey...

169
00:08:46.612 --> 00:08:47.912
Where'd that come from?

170
00:08:47.912 --> 00:08:49.812
The stern, I think!

171
00:08:49.812 --> 00:08:51.712
All right! I'll go from the left,

172
00:08:51.712 --> 00:08:53.512
you go around from the right!

173
00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:54.512
Yes, sir!

174
00:08:56.212 --> 00:08:57.512
Hey! Conan!

175
00:09:16.212 --> 00:09:18.212
No one's here.

176
00:09:18.212 --> 00:09:19.712
That's impossible!

177
00:09:19.712 --> 00:09:21.712
-Look around! -Yes, sir!

178
00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:26.212
Hattori, what's happened?

179
00:09:26.212 --> 00:09:28.512
Why don't you show yourself?

180
00:09:28.512 --> 00:09:33.212
If you'd heard that sound, you'd be the first one here.

181
00:09:33.212 --> 00:09:36.812
What's happened to you, Hattori?

182
00:09:37.812 --> 00:09:42.812
Sir! Do you suppose he went this way back inside?

183
00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:46.512
It's Kano.

184
00:09:46.512 --> 00:09:48.712
Kano is the killer, I just know it!

185
00:09:48.712 --> 00:09:52.912
He's trying to confuse us by firing shots all over the ship!

186
00:09:52.912 --> 00:09:55.212
But what is he trying to do?

187
00:09:55.212 --> 00:09:57.912
It's... it's me.

188
00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:01.012
He's...

189
00:10:01.012 --> 00:10:03.612
he's trying to kill me.

190
00:10:03.612 --> 00:10:06.312
I...

191
00:10:06.312 --> 00:10:07.912
don't want to die.

192
00:10:07.912 --> 00:10:12.112
I don't want to die yet.

193
00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:15.712
Please! Protect me, please!

194
00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:19.112
I'll tell you everything.

195
00:10:23.712 --> 00:10:26.412
Yes, that's right.

196
00:10:26.412 --> 00:10:29.912
I was one of Kano's accomplices

197
00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:33.712
in the that robbery 20 years ago.

198
00:10:33.712 --> 00:10:35.512
I came aboard this ship

199
00:10:35.512 --> 00:10:37.612
because the three of us wanted to celebrate

200
00:10:37.612 --> 00:10:41.012
the end of 20 years of hiding out.

201
00:10:41.012 --> 00:10:43.912
One of the others sent me a letter.

202
00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:46.412
He said there was no chance of being caught once the ship sailed

203
00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:49.412
because the statute of limitations would run out.

204
00:10:49.412 --> 00:10:53.212
There was an old 10,000 bill in the letter,

205
00:10:53.212 --> 00:10:56.512
but it'd been so long since we'd seen each other.

206
00:10:56.512 --> 00:10:59.112
We'd all changed our faces and our names,

207
00:10:59.112 --> 00:11:01.712
so we didn't know who was who

208
00:11:01.712 --> 00:11:05.212
until Kanie called out to me.

209
00:11:05.212 --> 00:11:09.612
And he told me our other accomplice was Kameda.

210
00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:15.612
And? So who's the one trying to kill you?

211
00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:18.412
Well...

212
00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:20.712
I don't know who it is.

213
00:11:20.712 --> 00:11:22.212
You're lying.

214
00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:25.212
It's Saizo Kano, isn't it? The man you and the others double-crossed.

215
00:11:25.212 --> 00:11:27.312
That's impossible!

216
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:31.312
One of the others shot him to death 20 years ago.

217
00:11:31.312 --> 00:11:34.412
Then it's probably one of the others.

218
00:11:34.412 --> 00:11:37.012
He wants all the money for himself!

219
00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:40.512
You haven't used that money yet, have you?

220
00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:43.412
That's what I thought at first

221
00:11:43.412 --> 00:11:45.712
but something's strange.

222
00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:47.912
It just doesn't make any sense!

223
00:11:49.512 --> 00:11:51.512
What was that?

224
00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:52.912
Everyone! Get down!

225
00:11:53.912 --> 00:11:55.212
Are you all right?

226
00:11:55.212 --> 00:11:56.812
Kujirai!

227
00:11:56.812 --> 00:11:59.112
Where? Where were you shot?

228
00:12:00.112 --> 00:12:01.612
Don't move!

229
00:12:05.412 --> 00:12:07.812
You've been shot!

230
00:12:07.812 --> 00:12:10.512
Darn! Where'd the shot come from?

231
00:12:13.912 --> 00:12:16.912
Hey, kid! Get down!

232
00:12:16.912 --> 00:12:18.512
Somebody's out there!

233
00:12:18.512 --> 00:12:21.212
There! On the bow!

234
00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:22.612
You jerk!

235
00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:25.312
-I'm not letting him get away this time! -Sir!

236
00:12:31.312 --> 00:12:34.512
Hey! You've nowhere to run!

237
00:12:34.512 --> 00:12:38.612
Throw your gun down and surrender yourself.

238
00:12:38.612 --> 00:12:41.012
Hey, Kano! Are you listening to me?

239
00:12:41.012 --> 00:12:44.112
You are Saizo Kano, aren't you?

240
00:12:45.912 --> 00:12:50.212
Hey! Say something!

241
00:12:50.212 --> 00:12:54.212
This is... Kanie?

242
00:12:54.212 --> 00:12:57.212
That's impossible!

243
00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:08.459
One shot to the head.

244
00:13:08.459 --> 00:13:09.959
He died instantly.

245
00:13:09.959 --> 00:13:11.159
Yes.

246
00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:13.159
The body's still warm.

247
00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:15.659
His blood hasn't coagulated yet.

248
00:13:15.659 --> 00:13:18.959
There're powder burns on his temple, indicating he placed the gun,

249
00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:21.259
there and pulled the trigger.

250
00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.259
When the gunshot was heard,

251
00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:28.059
everyone except Kanie was in the restaurant.

252
00:13:28.059 --> 00:13:34.059
There's no other explanation Kanie shot himself in the head,

253
00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:38.359
which means Kanie who was hiding out on the bow of this ship,

254
00:13:38.359 --> 00:13:41.959
was so upset to hear his old partner

255
00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:44.459
blab about the robbery 20 years ago

256
00:13:44.459 --> 00:13:47.059
that he tried to shoot him

257
00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:49.059
but failed to kill him!

258
00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:51.259
But realising he could not escape,

259
00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:53.659
he gives up and commits suicide.

260
00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:56.959
What a fool!

261
00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:59.159
But...

262
00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:01.259
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

263
00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:03.459
The burnt body at the bow

264
00:14:03.459 --> 00:14:06.659
was wearing Mr. Kanie's clothes and his wristwatch, wasn't he?

265
00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:10.359
Then whose body is that anyway?

266
00:14:10.359 --> 00:14:13.159
Well, it's either Kameda,

267
00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:15.459
another of the accomplices who disappeared earlier

268
00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:18.059
or Saizo Kano.

269
00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:22.759
Either way, Kanie here was the killer.

270
00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:25.759
He disguised the body to look like him

271
00:14:25.759 --> 00:14:28.859
and set it on fire to make it appear he was dead.

272
00:14:28.859 --> 00:14:33.059
The question is, how Kanie managed to evade our search

273
00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:35.659
and hide out here.

274
00:14:35.659 --> 00:14:38.459
What's this?

275
00:14:38.459 --> 00:14:42.859
There's something weird tied behind this guy.

276
00:14:42.859 --> 00:14:44.059
This is...

277
00:14:44.059 --> 00:14:46.059
A rope ladder!

278
00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:50.159
No one would find this hiding place

279
00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:51.759
if you were playing hide and seek!

280
00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.059
I get it.

281
00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:57.759
Kanie hid here, hanging on to the ladder.

282
00:14:57.759 --> 00:15:01.459
There's some rope marks on his arms and legs.

283
00:15:01.459 --> 00:15:03.759
So I'm sure you're right.

284
00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:05.959
But I don't understand.

285
00:15:05.959 --> 00:15:08.759
Why go to all the trouble of making it look like you died

286
00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:11.459
and then hide out here?

287
00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:13.659
The only explanation I can think of is

288
00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:17.759
he wanted to surprise his next victim by appearing suddenly

289
00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:21.959
before him filling the guy with fear.

290
00:15:21.959 --> 00:15:23.659
But who was Kanie trying to kill

291
00:15:23.659 --> 00:15:25.859
that he had to go through so much trouble?

292
00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:29.859
Kujirai, who just got shot was one of his old buddies, wasn't he?

293
00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:33.259
You're right.

294
00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:42.259
Look at all the blood.

295
00:15:42.259 --> 00:15:45.759
It looks like an artery's been damaged.

296
00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:48.159
He needs medical attention right away.

297
00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:52.459
Ran's gone to get the first aid kit.

298
00:15:52.459 --> 00:15:56.859
You are a very lucky person,

299
00:15:56.859 --> 00:16:00.859
you got off with only a hole through your coat and arm.

300
00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:03.259
Hey, Mouri, I found it!

301
00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:05.459
I found where the bullet passed through.

302
00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:09.259
I'm pretty sure Kanie fired the gun from the bow

303
00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:11.459
and it passed through the window here.

304
00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:15.159
Now all we have to do is find the bullet

305
00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:16.659
which should be embedded somewhere.

306
00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:20.459
Well, do you mean this?

307
00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:25.359
Yes, no doubt about it, this is it!

308
00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:27.859
What a sharp shooter.

309
00:16:27.859 --> 00:16:29.959
He missed his target

310
00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:33.259
but he fired the shot from way over there with a pistol.

311
00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:37.059
Have you forgotten? One of the men Kano hired

312
00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:40.759
to help pull off the job was very handy with firearms.

313
00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:44.659
That's right, we were able to learn

314
00:16:44.659 --> 00:16:46.459
he probably served in some foreign army,

315
00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:48.559
but that was about it.

316
00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:52.159
Yes, so that must have been Kanie!

317
00:16:53.659 --> 00:16:55.859
Dad!

318
00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:57.459
You got the first aid kit!

319
00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:04.459
We've got to stop the bleeding.

320
00:17:04.459 --> 00:17:06.459
What? Where's Conan?

321
00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:07.759
What?

322
00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:10.159
Isn't he somewhere around there?

323
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:14.659
What? A boy with a Kansai accent?

324
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.659
He came to borrow a flashlight but never returned.

325
00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:18.959
He hasn't come to the bridge either.

326
00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:22.759
It's strange. Where could he have gone?

327
00:17:22.759 --> 00:17:26.359
Could you search everyone's cabin just to make sure?

328
00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.559
Sure but I doubt we'll find him.

329
00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.559
That's right...

330
00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:33.659
When we were looking for that Kameda fellow with Mr. Samezaki,

331
00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:36.559
we went through all the cabins too.

332
00:17:36.559 --> 00:17:38.259
Well, did you happen to notice

333
00:17:38.259 --> 00:17:40.559
if he might been searching for something somewhere?

334
00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:43.759
He is a private detective too.

335
00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:45.759
I didn't notice anything.

336
00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:49.059
Besides, all the cabins were locked, except for Mr. Kameda's.

337
00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:52.159
Come to think of it, there is one cabin we didn't search!

338
00:17:52.159 --> 00:17:55.359
That's right, it was so neat.

339
00:17:55.359 --> 00:17:57.759
-What? -You know, that guy with the glasses,

340
00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.159
Mr. Ebina, it was his room.

341
00:17:59.159 --> 00:18:01.859
There was only a trunk in the middle of the room,

342
00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:04.159
the bed looked like it hadn't even used.

343
00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:08.159
It looked like he hadn't even unlocked his trunk.

344
00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:12.259
Can you show me where that cabin is?

345
00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:15.259
Mr. Mouri asked me to look inside!

346
00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:22.659
Conan?

347
00:18:22.659 --> 00:18:24.659
Conan!

348
00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.359
Hey, kid.

349
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.359
Are you sure Mr. Mouri wanted it like this?

350
00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:37.959
Yes! And he also said he didn't want anyone else to know about it.

351
00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:39.759
Quick, let's get back inside!

352
00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:41.859
That body is giving me the creeps.

353
00:18:41.859 --> 00:18:43.959
Yes, you're right.

354
00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:46.359
Go back to where the others are, kid!

355
00:18:46.359 --> 00:18:48.159
Okay!

356
00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:50.859
This tour sure turned into a nightmare.

357
00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:53.459
I heard the killer committed suicide though.

358
00:18:53.459 --> 00:18:55.559
And that guy Furukawa who planned this tour,

359
00:18:55.559 --> 00:19:00.159
I'll bet he is waiting at Ogasawara for the ship to dock.

360
00:19:01.359 --> 00:19:03.959
Masaru Furukawa,

361
00:19:03.959 --> 00:19:06.359
the man who planned this tour.

362
00:19:06.359 --> 00:19:09.359
All the mysteries start here.

363
00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:12.059
If the killer is Kanie

364
00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:15.559
and this Masaru Furukawa is also Kanie,

365
00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:18.759
then all the pieces to this case will fit,

366
00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:21.259
but I'm still not convinced.

367
00:19:21.259 --> 00:19:24.759
There's the watch the body had on

368
00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:30.859
and that Furukawa seal Mr. Kameda had is another puzzle.

369
00:19:30.859 --> 00:19:35.959
Darn it, I wish I at least knew who this Masaru Furukawa is.

370
00:19:44.859 --> 00:19:47.159
Excuse me.

371
00:19:47.159 --> 00:19:49.459
Did you see a kid that wearing glasses?

372
00:19:50.859 --> 00:19:53.159
Don't tell me...

373
00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.459
Masaru Furukawa is...

374
00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.759
A burn mark?

375
00:20:03.759 --> 00:20:07.759
And the paint's coming off on the other side.

376
00:20:07.759 --> 00:20:09.459
Maybe...

377
00:20:12.759 --> 00:20:14.759
Conan!

378
00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.359
Here's another!

379
00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:40.159
And other here!

380
00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:41.459
I've got it.

381
00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:45.359
That's how you can control the time and everyone's movements.

382
00:20:45.359 --> 00:20:48.459
And that's where Hattori's role as private detective fits in.

383
00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:51.259
But why Hattori?

384
00:20:51.259 --> 00:20:54.659
He's famous in Osaka but that's all.

385
00:20:54.659 --> 00:20:58.459
Why hire a private detective all the way from Osaka?

386
00:21:01.459 --> 00:21:02.759
Gosh!

387
00:21:02.759 --> 00:21:06.759
You're always wandering around and making us worry!

388
00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:09.759
I... I was just about to go back.

389
00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:11.959
That's why I...

390
00:21:11.959 --> 00:21:14.459
I'm begging you.

391
00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:18.659
Don't leave me alone.

392
00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:39.159
Conan, you know what a scared cat I am.

393
00:21:39.159 --> 00:21:40.759
If you get lost,

394
00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:44.959
I'll have to search this spooky ship all by myself!

395
00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:47.759
I... I'm sorry.

396
00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:51.759
By the way, where'd you get this tennis ball?

397
00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:54.359
I found it under the table at the restaurant just now

398
00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:56.959
while I was looking for you.

399
00:21:56.959 --> 00:22:00.659
I asked who it belonged to but no one came forward.

400
00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:05.059
Did Mr. Samezaki say something when he saw it?

401
00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:09.259
Because he and dad went off somewhere before seeing it.

402
00:22:09.259 --> 00:22:11.759
They were talking very loudly.

403
00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:13.959
It was something about an old bullet wound

404
00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:18.159
they found on Mr. Kanie's body.

405
00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:21.359
Where was everyone when Pops and the others

406
00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:25.459
left the restaurant the first time to look for Mr. Kano?

407
00:22:25.459 --> 00:22:28.659
They all left too, separately.

408
00:22:28.659 --> 00:22:31.259
But when they came back with Heiji,

409
00:22:31.259 --> 00:22:34.359
the others were already back.

410
00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:36.359
I see.

411
00:22:36.359 --> 00:22:39.159
I've figured everything out.

412
00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:42.659
I've solved the mystery behind this strange case!
