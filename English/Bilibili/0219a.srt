1
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.590
"Detective Conan"

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.090
"Special"

3
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.390
Isn't it rare? A museum.

4
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.590
Aren't you curious what he looks like?

5
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.490
I'm sure he's a nice man!

6
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.890
Like Harrison Ford, John Reno or maybe Brad Pitt.

7
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.090
I hear that he collects famous jewellery from the world over

8
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.290
and holds exhibitions.

9
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.090
I hear that you get to see the largest black pearl in the world.

10
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.390
Is that the pearl that is said to bring happiness,

11
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.490
the black pearl called the "Black Star"?

12
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.990
"Saturday night when the moon is full,"

13
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.390
"at the sound of the bell at midnight,"

14
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.790
"I will appear to take the clock that soars high above away."

15
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.190
Three steel crows in the dark of the night.

16
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.190
Still yet beyond... there are two more.

17
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.390
Oops, they've even got an armored vehicle ready.

18
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.790
Just as expected of the Metropolitan Police Department.

19
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.590
They've sure gone all out!

20
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.290
Don't, Kaito.

21
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.590
I have an uncomfortable feeling about this project.

22
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.890
If you are cornered into a fix like before,

23
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.590
and if something should ever happen to you,

24
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.490
I, as your steward, wouldn't be able to apologize to him

25
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.290
before his altar.

26
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.490
Gosh!

27
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.390
You're always like this before a big project.

28
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.090
Give me a break, will you? Here!

29
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.290
But, Kaito...

30
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.590
Besides, tonight I'm not the son of Toichi Kurobane,

31
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.290
the magician whom you served as steward for

32
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.090
nor am I Kaito the 8th grader!

33
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.790
I'm the one who is the talk of the town right now.

34
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.690
I'm just a villain who's putting on airs.

35
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.390
Kaito.

36
00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.989
"The Detectives Come Together!"

37
00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.489
"Kudo VS. Thief Kid"

38
00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.789
"Ekoda High School" -Too easy.

39
00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:29.389
Way too easy.

40
00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.389
The next job is duck soup that I could complete it

41
00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.189
with the tip of my pinky.

42
00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.589
Women fans entranced by Thief Kid are rapidly on the rise!

43
00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.889
Talk about just great.

44
00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.889
Women fans on the rise, my foot!

45
00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:48.789
That petty thief!

46
00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.389
To me, Aoko, he's just a rotten apple of a man

47
00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.789
running down the path of hopelessness!

48
00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:54.889
Oh, well...

49
00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.089
Cool it, don't be angry.

50
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:04.089
Just because you father, that dorky inspector

51
00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.789
is always being undone by him.

52
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.689
It can't be helped, can it?

53
00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.689
After all, the Kid is...

54
00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.689
One. Two.

55
00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.289
There!

56
00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.789
A great thief that is impossible to arrest!

57
00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.589
Anyway, as for that Inspector,

58
00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:26.389
he wouldn't be able to arrest the Kid

59
00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.789
even if Star Wars were to come up with a completed version.

60
00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.889
Gosh! Just because you resemble the Kid

61
00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.689
and can perform a little bit of magic,

62
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.689
you're always sticking up for him.

63
00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.889
That guy's seeking nothing more than self-satisfaction

64
00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.689
by disposing what he steals

65
00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.489
and returning it secretly later, a pretentious goody-goody!

66
00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:45.489
Oh my.

67
00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:48.689
That's the very thing I like about him.

68
00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:54.089
He's cute, just like a mischievous young boy.

69
00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:55.989
Oh. Akako. Akako!

70
00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:57.689
Don't let him deceive you!

71
00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:58.889
That guy is nothing but a criminal,

72
00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.789
no matter how you look at it! He is a villain!

73
00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:06.689
Besides, you saw what the Kid is after next on TV, didn't you?

74
00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.489
Oh, you mean the old clock tower in front of the station?

75
00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:14.189
Right! That belongs to everyone here in this town!

76
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.589
So, don't you think it's terrible of him to steal it?

77
00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:19.289
Yes. I guess so.

78
00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.589
Moreover, that place is...

79
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.489
That clock tower is...

80
00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:32.489
But, I heard that the clock tower was going to be moved

81
00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:34.289
somewhere else soon anyway.

82
00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.889
That it was going to be used as the symbol of some amusement park.

83
00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.189
Keiko.

84
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:40.289
Everybody was saying that if it was going to be moved elsewhere,

85
00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.589
it may as well be taken away by the Kid.

86
00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:45.889
What's not good is not good!

87
00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.889
Hey. I don't know what you're up to, but...

88
00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.589
I really think you should call off the job

89
00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.389
you're planning to carry out this time!

90
00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.689
Listen, I've been telling you that I am not the Kid!

91
00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.489
The old tower that tells time,

92
00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:01.489
when the 20,000 bells sing.

93
00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:04.689
A malevolent man will come flying from the eastern sky

94
00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.489
and the white sinner shall be perished.

95
00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:11.489
Is that some stupid something like fortune-telling again?

96
00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:13.389
It's not fortune-telling.

97
00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.489
It's a prophecy that has come to me through the devil, Lucifer.

98
00:06:16.489 --> 00:06:18.089
Luci...

99
00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.389
The day that clock sounds its bell for the 20,000th time

100
00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.789
is the night that you warned you'll be carrying out your deed.

101
00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.089
Whether you believe me or not is up to you, though.

102
00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:47.189
To all vehicles, helicopters circling the sky

103
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.889
and police cars patrolling the vicinity of the clock tower.

104
00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:51.989
Report any sightings of suspicious people to me immediately!

105
00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:53.889
All of you who are in charge of

106
00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.589
guarding the inside of the museum,

107
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.689
don't let anybody through without my orders!

108
00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.089
Guard the post that you are assigned to

109
00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:02.189
with your entire heart and soul!

110
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.889
But, Inspector Nakamori.

111
00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.389
I wonder if Kid's really going to show up?

112
00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:10.489
His warning went like this, right?

113
00:07:10.489 --> 00:07:12.589
Saturday night when the moon is full,

114
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:14.089
at the sound of the bell at midnight,

115
00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.789
I will appear to take the clock that soars high above away.

116
00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.389
The Thief Kid.

117
00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:20.389
I was thinking that he would have to use a darn big crane

118
00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:22.389
if he were to take a clock that large away.

119
00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:25.289
You idiot! When he says he'll steal something,

120
00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:28.789
-he will! -The needle of the clock.

121
00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:30.489
This clock tower

122
00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:33.889
is one that my father who was mayor 50 years ago,

123
00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.589
dished out a large sum

124
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:38.289
and asked a famous designer technician from abroad to make.

125
00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:39.989
The short hand of the clock,

126
00:07:39.989 --> 00:07:41.489
along with the signature of the designer

127
00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:44.389
has several large diamonds embedded in it.

128
00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:46.889
It is a highly evaluated work of art.

129
00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:49.789
He's probably after the diamonds.

130
00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.189
Why'd you let the owner through?

131
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:54.689
I'm sorry. He insisted that he wanted to check out

132
00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:56.889
the conditions of security with his own eyes so.

133
00:07:56.889 --> 00:08:00.189
I sure hope you checked thoroughly whether he is really the owner?

134
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:01.889
Why, of course.

135
00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:04.089
Whatever you do.

136
00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:08.489
Whatever you do, please protect it

137
00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:11.189
from the evil hands of that petty thief that sent me

138
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.389
that ridiculous letter of challenging warning.

139
00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:15.889
The dear clock tower that had inherited from my late father,

140
00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:17.289
do protect it.

141
00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:19.489
Yes. We will, owner.

142
00:08:19.489 --> 00:08:21.289
I'm counting on you.

143
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:23.589
By the way, Inspector!

144
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:26.389
I haven't seen Police Superintendent Hakuba's son,

145
00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:28.289
Saguru around lately.

146
00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:32.289
Yeah. Something about he had some unfinished case to take care of

147
00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.189
and went back to London.

148
00:08:34.189 --> 00:08:36.189
We sure could've used his help, couldn't we?

149
00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:38.389
-You idiot! -Oh, I'm so sorry!

150
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:40.289
What makes you think we can be counting on

151
00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:43.689
that costume wearing freak time after time!

152
00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:53.289
Only 28 minutes and 30 seconds till the promised time.

153
00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:54.589
Here goes then.

154
00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.689
Residing in Ekoda.

155
00:09:00.689 --> 00:09:05.689
27 years old. Single, police officer Yoichi Sensui.

156
00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:09.589
I'm going to borrow you name and face for a while.

157
00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:10.889
Excuse me!

158
00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:18.489
Kid...

159
00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:21.289
Look at the number of onlookers.

160
00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:24.389
Oh, owner! Owner, how was it inside?

161
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:26.189
"Sujio Hosokawa (32)" -Perfect!

162
00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:28.089
"Takarada's assistant" -Not an ant can get through.

163
00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:31.089
But I wonder if everything is okay

164
00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.689
on the amusement park side.

165
00:09:32.689 --> 00:09:34.489
Since it will not make it in time for the opening unless

166
00:09:34.489 --> 00:09:36.289
the construction for moving the clock tower is started tomorrow,

167
00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:39.289
purchase of the clock tower may be cancelled.

168
00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:41.989
Moreover, if Kid ever steals the precious stones

169
00:09:41.989 --> 00:09:43.889
that are embedded in the short hand of the clock,

170
00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:46.889
and if he finds out that the stones are...

171
00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:48.689
We're the only ones who know now,

172
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:50.089
that I have already sold the diamonds off

173
00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.389
and switched them for fake ones.

174
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:54.889
Besides, the price of it has jumped high,

175
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:57.589
now that everyone knows the Thief Kid is after it,

176
00:09:57.589 --> 00:10:00.889
and there wouldn't be a better time to sell it.

177
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:02.389
Whether they find out about the whole thing

178
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:04.989
after the relocation is none of my business.

179
00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:07.489
Besides, it would never be stolen!

180
00:10:07.489 --> 00:10:10.689
How could he ever steal that enormous clock tower

181
00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:13.489
in front of all these people?

182
00:10:13.489 --> 00:10:17.389
No matter how great a phantom thief he is!

183
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:19.489
Don't you dare come, Thief Kid!

184
00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:21.489
Don't give it to him, Dad!

185
00:10:21.489 --> 00:10:23.589
Hey! Hey, Aoko!

186
00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.589
You're the only one saying something like that.

187
00:10:25.589 --> 00:10:29.489
I know, but... By the way, Keiko, did you see Kaito?

188
00:10:29.489 --> 00:10:31.589
Nope, not at all.

189
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.989
Oh, right, he said he's going to be watching a magic show

190
00:10:33.989 --> 00:10:35.589
that is going to be aired tonight.

191
00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:37.289
Oh.

192
00:10:37.289 --> 00:10:39.089
I guess I'm the only one

193
00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:41.889
who remembers something so old that happened in the past.

194
00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:42.989
What?

195
00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:45.589
You witnessed a suspicious looking Thief Kid like character

196
00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:46.789
while on patrol?

197
00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:51.189
Yes, sir! He dropped this suspicious looking hat and left.

198
00:10:51.189 --> 00:10:54.989
This is Thief Kid's silk hat and cape!

199
00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:56.389
Will you wait here a while?

200
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.889
-Yes, sir! -Inspector Nakamori, please.

201
00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:02.089
Yes, the silk hat and cape are here.

202
00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:03.889
Yes...

203
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:06.189
It seems so.

204
00:11:06.189 --> 00:11:08.189
Okay! I've got approval from the Inspector!

205
00:11:08.189 --> 00:11:09.389
Will you explain the circumstances back then

206
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:10.589
and the features of the man directly

207
00:11:10.589 --> 00:11:13.889
to the Inspector who is at the top most floor?

208
00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:15.389
-Yes, sir! -Kid!

209
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:18.289
Kid...

210
00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.689
Duck soup!

211
00:11:22.689 --> 00:11:27.189
Without Hakuba around, it's so easy that it's no fun after all.

212
00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.389
Here they come, Akiko.

213
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:34.989
Yes. No doubt about it.

214
00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:36.789
It's that helicopter.

215
00:11:36.789 --> 00:11:41.089
He emits the same transparent vibe that Kaito emits.

216
00:11:41.089 --> 00:11:43.189
He has the cunning of the devil,

217
00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:46.989
and possesses a keen eye that sees through the hearts of people.

218
00:11:49.889 --> 00:11:51.389
Who is he?

219
00:11:55.789 --> 00:11:59.389
Hey! What's going on? There is one extra chopper!

220
00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:01.389
It's another support helicopter sent over by headquarters.

221
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:03.189
Support from headquarters?

222
00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:05.689
I don't recall asking for something like that!

223
00:12:05.689 --> 00:12:08.089
The Thief Kid's silk hat, eh?

224
00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:09.889
I've been informed of you.

225
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:12.989
Please show me your police I.D. and license, just to be sure.

226
00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:14.189
Yes, of course!

227
00:12:16.089 --> 00:12:20.189
Please give me your name, age and birth date.

228
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:25.089
Yoichi Sensui, 27 years old, born June 2nd.

229
00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:26.789
Okay, good work!

230
00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:29.689
Inspector Nakamori is waiting for you at the top floor.

231
00:12:29.689 --> 00:12:31.489
Yes, sir.

232
00:12:32.989 --> 00:12:36.689
Right, just in case, give me your driver's license number.

233
00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:38.589
Oh, yes.

234
00:12:38.589 --> 00:12:44.489
Yes, number 628605-524810.

235
00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:52.489
He's the Thief Kid!

236
00:12:52.489 --> 00:12:53.789
Nab him!

237
00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:55.989
This can't be happening?

238
00:12:55.989 --> 00:12:57.589
What?

239
00:12:57.589 --> 00:13:00.189
You found the Thief Kid inside the building?

240
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:04.289
Yes, sir! The C and D groups are pursuing him right now!

241
00:13:04.289 --> 00:13:08.089
Hey. Hey. I hope he's no imposter?

242
00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:09.589
No, there's no mistake about it!

243
00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:11.789
After he answered his name, age and birth date,

244
00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:17.189
I remember I was told to ask for his driver's license number.

245
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:19.589
-His driver's license number? -Yes, sir!

246
00:13:19.589 --> 00:13:21.489
The boy who was sent over by headquarters

247
00:13:21.489 --> 00:13:23.189
had informed me that

248
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:25.989
if the thief is an expert at disguising himself as another,

249
00:13:25.989 --> 00:13:28.089
he would probably remember what others

250
00:13:28.089 --> 00:13:30.789
would usually not be able to recall.

251
00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:32.989
A boy, you said?

252
00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:35.989
I repeat.

253
00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:37.489
Please close off the entrance and exit

254
00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:39.189
of the clock tower immediately!

255
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:41.789
Please don't open them until we instruct you to.

256
00:13:41.789 --> 00:13:46.489
He's no more than a mole in a hole that cannot move now.

257
00:13:46.489 --> 00:13:48.389
D group, Nakamura and Kawada!

258
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:51.989
We've lost sight of him near the 3rd floor toilet.

259
00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:56.289
Please calm down, I'm sure he is still somewhere near you.

260
00:13:56.289 --> 00:13:57.589
What?

261
00:13:59.989 --> 00:14:03.489
The ventilation hole that is beyond that toilet.

262
00:14:03.489 --> 00:14:05.789
Aren't the screws removed?

263
00:14:06.689 --> 00:14:11.089
It's been removed...

264
00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:14.889
Then, he's in there! Please resume pursuing him!

265
00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:18.489
There he is! It's him!

266
00:14:18.489 --> 00:14:23.389
Hey. The inspector sure is sharp today.

267
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:27.289
Or, is someone helping the inspector out?

268
00:14:27.289 --> 00:14:28.789
But, who could it be?

269
00:14:29.489 --> 00:14:32.589
Megure! So, it's you after all!

270
00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:33.889
Just what do you think you're doing,

271
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:35.989
bringing a kid to a place like this?

272
00:14:35.989 --> 00:14:38.989
I'm the commander of this site!

273
00:14:38.989 --> 00:14:41.789
And, besides, you don't belong in this section!

274
00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:44.189
Well, I'm very sorry.

275
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:47.689
I promised that I'd let him board this chopper once.

276
00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:50.289
So, I thought I may as well bring him along while I was at it.

277
00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:52.189
-Huh? Hey! -Inspector!

278
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:55.789
I hate to be rude, but we've got no time debating with you.

279
00:14:55.789 --> 00:14:59.689
If you want to arrest the thief, please follow my orders.

280
00:14:59.689 --> 00:15:02.089
What?

281
00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:03.689
He is thrown off at being identified

282
00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:06.589
before having the chance to carry out his act.

283
00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:10.089
His plan is not going as he planned.

284
00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:13.289
There is no better chance to capture him, but now!

285
00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:16.689
Who are you? Who the heck are you?

286
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:21.189
I am...

287
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:22.889
Shinichi Kudo.

288
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:26.989
A detective.

289
00:15:35.457 --> 00:15:37.357
Shinichi Kudo?

290
00:15:37.357 --> 00:15:40.357
Oh. I know him, I know him!

291
00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:43.857
A high school detective who solves mysterious cases

292
00:15:43.857 --> 00:15:45.757
one after the other.

293
00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:48.257
Then, you're also in the wrong section!

294
00:15:48.257 --> 00:15:51.457
We're after a thief!

295
00:15:51.457 --> 00:15:53.157
Inspector! He's just a high school student

296
00:15:53.157 --> 00:15:55.157
and belongs to no section...

297
00:15:55.757 --> 00:15:58.457
At any rate, this is a job for the police to handle!

298
00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:01.557
Outsiders just stay put in that chopper of yours!

299
00:16:01.557 --> 00:16:02.557
Understand?

300
00:16:02.557 --> 00:16:03.557
Inspector Nakamori!

301
00:16:03.557 --> 00:16:06.157
Nakamura of the D group, after receiving word from the boy,

302
00:16:06.157 --> 00:16:07.257
discovered the Thief Kid,

303
00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:08.857
disguised as a police officer inside the ventilation duct!

304
00:16:08.857 --> 00:16:10.357
They are still pursuing him!

305
00:16:10.357 --> 00:16:11.457
What?

306
00:16:11.457 --> 00:16:13.257
Nakamura of the D group here!

307
00:16:13.257 --> 00:16:14.357
It seems that our target is trying to exit

308
00:16:14.357 --> 00:16:15.857
from the ventilation duct!

309
00:16:15.857 --> 00:16:17.457
What should we do?

310
00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:18.657
Don't panic.

311
00:16:18.657 --> 00:16:21.957
Your target is already caught in your claws.

312
00:16:21.957 --> 00:16:24.257
Please tell me your present location.

313
00:16:24.257 --> 00:16:27.157
Well, since I was moving along in the dark,

314
00:16:27.157 --> 00:16:28.857
I'm not so sure of where I am.

315
00:16:28.857 --> 00:16:30.257
I know that I went up one flight of stairs from the 3rd floor

316
00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:32.757
and that this is the 4th floor.

317
00:16:32.757 --> 00:16:36.257
No problem! The exits of all the 28 ventilation holes there

318
00:16:36.257 --> 00:16:38.257
are within the building have all been closed off!

319
00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:40.157
Please just keep on pursuing him.

320
00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:42.957
There is no escape route for him anymore.

321
00:16:42.957 --> 00:16:43.957
The officers who are blocking off

322
00:16:43.957 --> 00:16:45.357
the exit of the ventilation hole on the 4th floor

323
00:16:45.357 --> 00:16:47.057
should get ready to arrest him.

324
00:16:47.057 --> 00:16:50.957
How dare he giving out orders on his own again?

325
00:16:50.957 --> 00:16:52.857
This is Nakamura of D group!

326
00:16:52.857 --> 00:16:55.757
I lost sight of him near the exit of the ventilation duct!

327
00:16:55.757 --> 00:16:57.157
What is your present location?

328
00:16:57.157 --> 00:16:58.157
This is...

329
00:16:58.157 --> 00:17:00.157
The corridor to the east on the 4th floor!

330
00:17:00.157 --> 00:17:01.857
Huh?

331
00:17:01.857 --> 00:17:04.257
The target has gotten rid of his disguise as an officer

332
00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:05.857
and is fleeing down the stairs.

333
00:17:05.857 --> 00:17:08.557
Please send a support force over right away.

334
00:17:08.557 --> 00:17:10.157
Thief Kid...

335
00:17:11.957 --> 00:17:14.557
Great work, officer.

336
00:17:14.557 --> 00:17:18.157
Okay! He panicked and got rid of his disguise as an officer!

337
00:17:18.157 --> 00:17:20.957
Everyone proceed to the fourth floor and capture the thief!

338
00:17:20.957 --> 00:17:22.957
Don't let him get away!

339
00:17:22.957 --> 00:17:25.857
But, why does that boy have so much information

340
00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:28.757
as to the structure of this clock tower?

341
00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:31.057
Of course! Because I sent him the data

342
00:17:31.057 --> 00:17:34.657
that I have in this computer over to him a while ago.

343
00:17:36.257 --> 00:17:37.557
You idiot.

344
00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:40.757
Strange.

345
00:17:40.757 --> 00:17:43.157
For him to remove his disguise as an officer in the space

346
00:17:43.157 --> 00:17:45.157
that is surrounded by officers,

347
00:17:45.157 --> 00:17:46.657
is like a hermit crab disposing of its shell

348
00:17:46.657 --> 00:17:49.057
and roaming within the sea.

349
00:17:49.957 --> 00:17:51.857
To me, that is incomprehensible.

350
00:18:16.757 --> 00:18:19.857
It's time, Inspector Nakamori.

351
00:18:19.857 --> 00:18:21.357
Oh, yeah.

352
00:18:32.757 --> 00:18:34.057
Inspector!

353
00:18:34.057 --> 00:18:35.457
Smoke has burst forth from the foothold

354
00:18:35.457 --> 00:18:36.657
at the construction site!

355
00:18:36.657 --> 00:18:38.157
What?

356
00:19:03.857 --> 00:19:07.857
Inspector Nakamori! The hands of the clock are gone!

357
00:19:07.857 --> 00:19:09.957
What? They're gone?

358
00:19:11.957 --> 00:19:13.557
It...

359
00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:15.657
It can't be.

360
00:19:19.457 --> 00:19:22.457
Wow! The Thief Kid is really something.

361
00:19:22.457 --> 00:19:24.457
Thief Kid.

362
00:19:24.457 --> 00:19:26.257
I hate you, Thief Kid.

363
00:19:33.257 --> 00:19:35.657
Is anything wrong?

364
00:19:35.657 --> 00:19:37.057
It's swaying?

365
00:19:37.057 --> 00:19:39.457
Yeah, you mean this chopper is swaying?

366
00:19:39.457 --> 00:19:42.257
-No, Inspector! -No?

367
00:19:46.657 --> 00:19:48.157
Inspector, where are you headed?

368
00:19:48.157 --> 00:19:50.857
I'm going to go up and check the engine room of the clock.

369
00:19:50.857 --> 00:19:54.857
Could you please bring the chopper closer to the clock tower?

370
00:19:54.857 --> 00:19:57.857
Darn! What the heck is going on anyway?

371
00:20:00.357 --> 00:20:01.857
Anything new?

372
00:20:01.857 --> 00:20:03.157
No.

373
00:20:04.157 --> 00:20:06.657
What the...

374
00:20:06.657 --> 00:20:08.657
Hey, what happened?

375
00:20:08.657 --> 00:20:12.757
A police officer appeared from the ventilation duct and...

376
00:20:12.757 --> 00:20:13.957
What?

377
00:20:13.957 --> 00:20:17.357
After spraying something strange at us,

378
00:20:17.357 --> 00:20:19.957
he went out from there.

379
00:20:19.957 --> 00:20:22.357
It... it can't be.

380
00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:27.557
If so, he should be clearly visible to those outside.

381
00:20:27.557 --> 00:20:29.157
Thief Kid!

382
00:20:31.757 --> 00:20:33.757
Thief Kid...

383
00:20:35.357 --> 00:20:38.257
It's me! Nakamori! I've found Kid!

384
00:20:38.257 --> 00:20:39.757
He is...

385
00:20:43.157 --> 00:20:44.857
Inspector Nakamori.

386
00:20:44.857 --> 00:20:46.057
My apologies that

387
00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:50.057
I have no time now to be playing with all of you.

388
00:20:50.057 --> 00:20:52.257
What?

389
00:20:52.257 --> 00:20:55.457
Besides, it seems that you have a "joker"

390
00:20:55.457 --> 00:20:58.357
who is pretty sharp on your side too.

391
00:20:58.357 --> 00:20:59.457
On our side?

392
00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:00.957
And, if you're going to summon anybody,

393
00:21:00.957 --> 00:21:02.057
I'd like you to do so after.

394
00:21:02.057 --> 00:21:04.457
I'd like you to decipher the code that has been carved

395
00:21:04.457 --> 00:21:05.957
in the middle of the face of the clock.

396
00:21:05.957 --> 00:21:07.557
Code?

397
00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:11.657
Yes, I'd like you to decipher it before calling anyone.

398
00:21:16.257 --> 00:21:19.157
The face of the clock is swaying?

399
00:21:19.157 --> 00:21:21.057
What is the meaning of this, Kudo?

400
00:21:21.057 --> 00:21:22.857
He is lighting up the face of the clock together

401
00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:24.957
with the curtain of smoke.

402
00:21:24.957 --> 00:21:26.157
The light is turned off, and the face of the clock is covered

403
00:21:26.157 --> 00:21:28.857
with a gigantic screen that has been set up beforehand

404
00:21:28.857 --> 00:21:30.857
and projected on the screen is a film

405
00:21:30.857 --> 00:21:32.357
of the hand of the clock disappearing.

406
00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:34.057
The film is projected from a projector that

407
00:21:34.057 --> 00:21:36.057
has been assembled onto a foothold at a construction site.

408
00:21:36.057 --> 00:21:40.257
But, it's so easy to figure that trick out.

409
00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:43.457
That trick...

410
00:21:43.457 --> 00:21:45.057
fake!

411
00:21:47.657 --> 00:21:49.857
He's probably behind the screen right now

412
00:21:49.857 --> 00:21:50.857
removing the diamonds that are embedded

413
00:21:50.857 --> 00:21:53.157
in the short hand of the clock.

414
00:21:53.157 --> 00:21:55.057
I'm going to borrow this for a while.

415
00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:06.957
Hey! Who is it? Who's firing the gun?

416
00:22:09.757 --> 00:22:10.957
Darn.

417
00:22:10.957 --> 00:22:12.957
With the chopper at such close range,

418
00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:15.157
I can't possibly fly using my hand glider.

419
00:22:17.257 --> 00:22:20.157
What shall I do? What now?

420
00:22:20.157 --> 00:22:22.057
Hey, Kudo!

421
00:22:22.057 --> 00:22:24.857
Don't worry! I won't hit anyone.

422
00:22:24.857 --> 00:22:28.357
No! That's not the point. Kudo!

423
00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:34.057
Now, for the finale of your magic show.

424
00:22:34.057 --> 00:22:37.257
Let's watch the leader of the troupe appear.
