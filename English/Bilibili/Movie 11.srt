1
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,650
Emergency!

2
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,250
Patrol car 503 calling Metropolitan Police Department.

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:23,850
Emergency!

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,350
Patrol car 503, over.

5
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,150
We found the car driven by the armed robbers,
who are on wanted list!

6
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,450
They're fleeing from Satobari Road to Gyoki Road.

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,950
Roger that.

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,850
Please state both the license plate number
and the appearance of the suspects' vehicle,

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,550
and the suspects' physical descriptions, over.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,850
Roger that.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,350
The suspects' vehicle is a black SUV.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,750
Its plate number is Shinjuku 500 SA 32-55.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,650
The suspects' physical descriptions are...

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,750
Rupan and Fujiko...

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,850
Patrol car 503, please stop kidding.

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,350
I'm not kidding...

17
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,350
Patrol car 503 calling Metropolitan Police Department!

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,350
Rupan is turning left from Gyoki Road onto Chuo Road!

19
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,250
Patrol car 503, please cut the crap, over.

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,550
I told you I'm not kidding!

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,950
Hey, Officer Sato...

22
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,750
Please drive a little more carefully.

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,450
Shouldn't you still be contacting headquarters?

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,450
Yes...

25
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,850
Patrol car 503 calling Metropolitan Police Department!

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,550
Suspects are turning right onto Harumi Road.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,350
How dare he wear Rupan mask for a robbery!

28
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,050
Unforgivable!

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,450
Welcome. Good evening.

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,450
That's 1,237 yen in total.

31
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,050
Pull your car over right now!

32
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,050
There must be some case, huh?

33
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,550
That's cool!

34
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,950
Pull your car over right now!

35
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,950
I'll repeat once more!

36
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,250
You have nowhere to run!

37
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,650
Pull your car over there!

38
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,250
How dare he be so cocky?

39
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,950
In that case, I'll pay you back with an eye for an eye!

40
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,650
Officer Sato!

41
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,050
They're getting away.

42
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,050
Hold on tight.

43
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,350
Officer Sato, what are you doing?

44
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,850
You'll bite your tongue if you keep talking.

45
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,150
Officer Sato?

46
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,750
Be quiet!

47
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,250
Wait... Wait a minute, Officer Sato.

48
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,450
Takagi, contact headquarters!

49
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,150
Got it!

50
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,050
Geez...

51
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,250
Officer Sato!

52
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,850
Backup and ambulances are on their way.

53
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,350
He's got it coming.

54
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,850
He shouldn't have worn my first love's mask.

55
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,650
First...first love?

56
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,350
Go take a look at Fujiko.

57
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:13,650
Okay.

58
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,650
Hang in there!

59
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,350
The ambulance will be here soon.

60
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,650
Officer Sato.

61
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,450
Fujiko's just passed out.

62
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,850
I think she's only slightly injured.

63
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,350
Really?

64
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,750
But why would they rob in such funny masks?

65
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,650
Koumi... Koumi Island...

66
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,750
Koumi Island?

67
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,150
So you were trying to rob the money
so that you could take a vacation on that island?

68
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,050
No...no.

69
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,650
No?

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,750
Is there anything on that island?

71
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,550
Jolly...

72
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,550
Jolly Roger...

73
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,350
Jolly Roger?

74
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,950
Have you ever heard of it?

75
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,750
Well...

76
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,150
(Koumi Island)

77
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,250
Mom, hurry up!

78
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,150
Let's go over there.

79
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,150
Wait for me!

80
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,850
Do you know how to use this?

81
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,750
Let me show you.

82
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,750
Sensei, what kind of fish are here?

83
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,450
Good morning.

84
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,150
May I have the name you made reservations under?

85
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,350
Kogoro Mouri, the famous detective.

86
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,850
2 adults, 2 students,

87
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,050
and 5 children.

88
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,650
Please wait a moment.

89
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,250
The Nichiuri Paper publishes a puzzle to solve each week, right?

90
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,050
The ones which are super hard.

91
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,350
The prize money keeps accumulating if no one answers correctly.

92
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,450
And then it even reached 300,000 yen!

93
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,750
Do you know who finally answered correctly and won 300,000 yen?

94
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,550
Well...

95
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,350
Oh, could it be...

96
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,350
Bingo!

97
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,650
I'm a famous detective, after all.

98
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,350
That kind of puzzle is a piece of cake for me.

99
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,850
But the one who solved it is me...

100
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,350
With 300,000 yen, I can spend a leisurely vacation in Paris.

101
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,050
Because the streets of Paris are absolutely my style.

102
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,850
But then I thought I shouldn't have all the fun myself.

103
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,250
Since we don't have many opportunities like this,

104
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,950
I decided to bring them here and have fun together.

105
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,750
That's my idea.

106
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,850
I'm a nice guy, huh?

107
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,950
Yeah...

108
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,050
So, what are our room numbers?

109
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,150
I'm really sorry.

110
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,050
It seems that we didn't receive your reservation.

111
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,650
Seriously?

112
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,950
Hey, hey...

113
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,550
Wait...wait a minute.

114
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,750
I'm sure I made a reservation!

115
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,650
But I didn't find your name on the reservation list.

116
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,750
Are we going to sleep on the street?

117
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,950
This is a sub-tropical island.

118
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,650
There might be poisonous bugs here.

119
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,550
I wouldn't come here if I knew this earlier.

120
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,250
There must be a solution.

121
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,550
It's not like we're in a foreign country
where we speak a different language.

122
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,050
Haibara-san looks like an adult.

123
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,350
At least we can be sure that she is not a child.

124
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,350
The front desk said they'll call the Tourism Division.

125
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,550
There's nothing to worry about, I guess.

126
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,650
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,650
But when on the phone, that man promised me

128
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,050
the reservation was confirmed.

129
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,950
Well, you really made me confused.

130
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,350
Hello, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting.

131
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,250
You must be Mr. Kogoro Mouri-san,

132
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,450
the famous detective...

133
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,750
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,550
I'm Iwanaga from the Tourism Division.

135
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,850
The amount of tourists has suddenly increased this month.

136
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,450
All the hotels are full.

137
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,150
Actually, we're quite happy for this busyness.

138
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,450
But I've managed to make your reservations.

139
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,550
After all, you are the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri.

140
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,450
Please come with me. I'll show you the way.

141
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,450
I can't bear with that guy. What's wrong with him?

142
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,350
Who are those guys?

143
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,350
They must be treasure hunters, I guess.

144
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,250
Treasure hunters?

145
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,150
Are they plumbers?

146
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,450
Flushing toilets or something like that?

147
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,750
It's not like that, Genta-kun.

148
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,150
They are people who look for treasures all over the world.

149
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,750
But how do you know that they are treasure hunters?

150
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,050
Take a closer look at them.

151
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,450
Those guys are very tanned,

152
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,650
but only on their hands and heads, and not anywhere else, right?

153
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,650
This means they always wear diving suits.

154
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,650
And the color of their hair has faded because of the sea water.

155
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,450
But if that's the case,

156
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,650
maybe they are just people who like diving, right?

157
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,250
Indeed, you're right.

158
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,650
But if you look at that poster,

159
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,350
you'll know why I would think that way.

160
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,460
(Koumi Island, How about coming along
and looking for ancient treasures?)

161
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,550
Ah... Treasure!

162
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,150
That's right.

163
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,550
They're probably dreaming...

164
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,550
Dreaming of getting the treasure
sleeping at the bottom of the sea.

165
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,870
(Detective Conan
Jolly Roger in the Deep Azure)

166
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,550
I am a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

167
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,450
What? I don't look like a high schooler?

168
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,450
She is my childhood friend and my classmate, Ran Mouri.

169
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,250
When I went to the amusement park with Ran,

170
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,650
I witnessed a suspicious transaction made by a man in black.

171
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,850
I was too preoccupied with watching at that time,

172
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,850
and didn't notice another accomplice approaching from behind.

173
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,850
He made me take the poison by force.

174
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,550
When I woke up, I found...

175
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,350
my body became smaller.

176
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,850
If those guys knew that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

177
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,550
not only would my life be in danger,

178
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,150
but I would also get people around me involved.

179
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,750
At the suggestion of Professor Agasa,
I concealed my true identity.

180
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,450
When Ran asked me for my name,

181
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,950
I took the name of Conan Edogawa.

182
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,150
Ran's father is a detective.

183
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,850
In order to collect information about those guys,
I moved in with Ran.

184
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,750
This middle-aged man is Ran's father, Detective Kogoro Mouri.

185
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,850
He is known as the "Sleeping Kogoro".

186
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,950
As for the reason...

187
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,750
That's what happened.

188
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,950
She is Sonoko Suzuki.

189
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,350
She's Ran's classmate.

190
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,350
By the look of her, you would never know
she comes from a wealthy family.

191
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,250
She is an easy-going girl.

192
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,150
This old man is Professor Agasa.

193
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,750
Professor has invented a lot of interesting gadgets

194
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,250
for me since my body became smaller.

195
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,250
She is Ai Haibara.

196
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,450
Her real name is Shiho Miyano.

197
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,650
She used to work with those guys in black.

198
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,450
But when she escaped from the organization,

199
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,050
she took the same drug as the poison I took.

200
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,650
Her body has become smaller as well.

201
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:31,850
Although I don't know the true identities of
the men in black yet,

202
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,850
I swear on my honor as a detective,

203
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,950
I'll have it out with them one day.

204
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,450
Although my body is smaller, my mind is still flexible.

205
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,850
The famous detective who can solve all kinds of cases.

206
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,050
Only one truth will prevail!

207
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,250
Speaking of which...

208
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,950
Why would treasure hunters come here?

209
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,850
Because someone found some treasure here two weeks ago.

210
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,450
Treasure?

211
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,750
So, I heard they found silverware in Seabed Palace.

212
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,150
So it's true, right?

213
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,550
I guess it's true.

214
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,350
What's Seabed Palace?

215
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,950
See that uninhabited island over there?

216
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,050
That's Yorioya Island.

217
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,750
(Yorioya Island)
200 meters east of that island,

218
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,350
there's a sunken huge stone building in the seabed.

219
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,650
People say there are ancient ruins near Koumi Island.

220
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,850
It's been rumored since about 10 years ago.

221
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,650
Many scholars have investigated it,

222
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,050
but there is no conclusion as to

223
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,350
whether it is man-made or natural.

224
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,350
It is said that the part of Yorioya Island that
used to be exposed above water was larger before.

225
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,150
About 300 years ago, earthquakes caused it
to sink into the ocean depths.

226
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,150
That's why it looks like this now.

227
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,450
You said it sank because of earthquakes?

228
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,850
Was it like a landslide?

229
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,750
Yeah.

230
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,050
I heard that in the seabed nearby,

231
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,050
there's a layer of methane hydrate.

232
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,150
The earthquakes' shaking made it break down in one go,

233
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,650
then caused a landslide.

234
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,950
That's the most cogent explanation so far..

235
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,750
Hey, Conan. Can you explain for me?

236
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,150
What is the "method high tree"?

237
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,650
It's "methane hydrate".

238
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,750
In a low temperature and high pressure environment,

239
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,350
water molecules combine with methane

240
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,950
and form the so-called water cage.

241
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,350
It can also be called "combustible ice".

242
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,950
Combustible ice?

243
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,350
Water cage?

244
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,150
I didn't follow you.

245
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,250
To put it simply,

246
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,850
you've all built castles with playing cards, right?

247
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,150
Water molecules build castles just like that.

248
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,750
Each room is filled with methane.

249
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,950
So when the temperature rises or the pressure falls,
it becomes unstable.

250
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,350
The castle will collapse and release methane gas.

251
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,050
So that's how it works.

252
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,350
That's why the island that was held up by methane

253
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,050
lost its support and caused a landslide.

254
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,750
That's kind of what I meant.

255
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,450
They talked about it on TV last time.

256
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,550
Oh, I see.

257
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,850
What an idiot.

258
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,250
Excuse me, Mima-san.

259
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,150
This is Iwanaga from the Tourism Division.

260
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,350
Mima-san, are you there?

261
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,350
(Koumi Inn)
Mima-san?

262
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,250
It's a lot different from the hotel.

263
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,150
You're right.

264
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,850
I'm sorry, looks like he's not here right now.

265
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,650
I just tried calling for him.

266
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,950
What's all the noise for? Annoying.

267
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,550
Mima-san.

268
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,150
These are Mouri-san and his friends,
of whom I just mentioned over the phone.

269
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,550
Two meals for one night, 5,000 yen.

270
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,650
Take it or leave it.

271
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,850
Wait...Mima-san!

272
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,350
What a cocky guy.

273
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,850
Sorry, he's actually very nice.

274
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,050
He's just a little eccentric.

275
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,150
Who's going to participate in the treasure hunt?

276
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,450
Me!

277
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,650
Me!

278
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,350
Two young ladies, are you going to go diving?

279
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,150
Yes.

280
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,150
If you want to go right now, I can give you a ride.

281
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,750
We'd like that, thank you.

282
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,950
How about you two?

283
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,650
Treasure hunt is really fun.

284
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,350
I want to relax. Don't worry about me.

285
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,750
How about you, Mouri-san?

286
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,450
Want to participate in treasure...

287
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,950
No, just tell me where I can get the best local drinks...

288
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,850
and find a pretty hostess there.

289
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,250
You're Miss Ran Mouri-san and Miss Sonoko Suzuki-san, right?

290
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,050
You rented the whole set, right?

291
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,850
Right.

292
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,050
Kimiko.

293
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,050
Coming.

294
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,950
How about these wet suits for both of you?

295
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,150
I think Size M fits you two.

296
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,550
Okay.

297
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,750
No problem.

298
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,750
Great.

299
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,150
Because we don't have a big selection of wet suits here.

300
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,850
No such thing.

301
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,850
This wetsuit looks great.

302
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,950
Really?

303
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,250
Excuse me.

304
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,550
You guys, clean up after you're done.

305
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,450
We'll be back.

306
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,050
Those guys are treasure hunters, right?

307
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,950
Are we going to dive with them?

308
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:11,650
No.

309
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,650
They're just here to borrow the air compressor.

310
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,850
There have been more of them these days.

311
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,050
It's really annoying.

312
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,950
Is it related to the discovery of the silverware?

313
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,450
And there's the rumor saying that Anne escaped from prison

314
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,950
and hid the treasure on this island.

315
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:28,950
Who's Anne?

316
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,150
That's her.

317
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,950
270 years ago, during the Kyoho Era of the Edo period,

318
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,250
it is said that the entire Seabed Palace was still above water.

319
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,350
The evidence was the two items found inside Seabed Palace,

320
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,950
a cutlass and a pistol.

321
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,050
Judging from the initials on the cutlass and the pistol,

322
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,150
These weapons used to belong to two female pirates
who were active around 1730,

323
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,150
whose names were Anne Bonny and Mary Read.

324
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,050
They were both led by Captain Jack Rackham...

325
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,950
Female pirates?

326
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,050
Yeah.

327
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,050
Anne Bonny and Mary Read.

328
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,150
They were both pirates under Captain Jack Rackham.

329
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,050
But when the British came to attack them,

330
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,550
all the men were hiding below deck,

331
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,450
this two women still fought bravely, back-to-back.

332
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,250
Back to back?

333
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,450
That's right. Let your partner
to take care of the enemy behind you,

334
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,550
so that you can concentrate on the enemy in front of you.

335
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,550
Without this kind of mutual trust, it wouldn't work.

336
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:41,950
Ran...

337
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,550
You're the only one I trust to watch my back.

338
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,050
Sonoko...

339
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,350
Just kidding!

340
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,450
The only one you can trust
to watch your back is Shinichi-kun, right?

341
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,650
Who cares about that guy?

342
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,050
Really?

343
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,650
Really!

344
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,850
Anne, who escaped from a prison in the Bahamas,

345
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,350
moved her activities to the Pacific Ocean.

346
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,150
She continued as a pirate

347
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,950
while waiting for Mary to escape from prison as well.

348
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,950
Later, this story was confirmed.

349
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,050
That's why it was rumored that the treasure they stole together

350
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,850
had been hidden on this Koumi Island.

351
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,750
Everyone, let's look for Anne and Mary's hidden treasure!

352
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,250
Can this be true?

353
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,650
I don't know.

354
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,150
If it's true, this will definitely cause a lot of trouble.

355
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,350
Maybe it's just a fabrication

356
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,550
to publicize the island.

357
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,850
If so, it will cause even more trouble.

358
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,150
Looks like it's troublesome either way.

359
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,950
Sorry, sorry.

360
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,950
Sorry to keep you waiting.

361
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,150
Hey, hey...

362
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,650
Here, this is a map for the treasure hunt.

363
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,450
Starting from here,

364
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,850
you need to go to each of 5 points
hidden on the map, press the seal,

365
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,950
and then solve the puzzle.

366
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,650
The first point is there.

367
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,950
Take the seal there and press it on the blank space
at the bottom of the map,

368
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,850
then take a hint card for the next point

369
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,250
from the treasure chest next to it.

370
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,550
It simply is a trick for kids.

371
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,450
Don't say that.

372
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,450
They look very enthusiastic about it.

373
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,950
10 and 12.

374
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,850
This is the key to the location of the treasure.

375
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,950
The next point is...

376
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
"Even if the sun doesn't set, a pirate still shines."

377
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,750
What's this?

378
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,450
Go for it!

379
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,750
If you find where the treasure is,

380
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,450
you'll get a special gift.

381
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,850
Is that special gift something to eat?

382
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,250
You'll know when you solve the mystery.

383
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,450
Okay, I'll work really hard for it!

384
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,950
You don't know if it's something to eat yet.

385
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,350
Hey, Uncle.

386
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,550
What is it?

387
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,150
Did you come up with all these codes yourself?

388
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,250
Ah? You can say that.

389
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,750
Oh, right.

390
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,650
You can rent bikes at the district office next door.

391
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,450
Why don't you take bikes?

392
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,950
You'll be tired if you walk.

393
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,550
Yes!

394
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,050
Looks like you're enthusiastic too, Kudo-kun.

395
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,950
Okay, all set!

396
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,450
Now, just follow Kimiko's instructions.

397
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,950
Enjoy a safe, fun dive!

398
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,450
Pay special attention to the area south of Seabed Palace.

399
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,050
It's very deep over there.

400
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,150
Please don't scare us.

401
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,850
It's okay, I'll be with you.

402
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,750
Indeed.

403
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,650
Thank you for that!

404
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,250
So quick.

405
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,250
Did something happen?

406
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,850
Sharks!

407
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,550
Because that hint mentioned the sunset,

408
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,350
we came to the far west side of the island.

409
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,650
But where is the treasure chest mentioned by that hint?

410
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,850
Oh! I see!

411
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,550
The hint was "even if the sun doesn't set,
a pirate still shines", right?

412
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,050
So that must be...

413
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,050
The surface of the sea!

414
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,250
I see.

415
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,450
Then what?

416
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,850
Is it possible that there is a seal on the surface of the sea?

417
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,050
Ah, that's not possible, indeed...

418
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,250
That's right...

419
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,950
Look over there.

420
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,350
What's that?

421
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,150
It's a large school of fish!

422
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,050
Are they eels?

423
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,450
There won't be any eel in this kind of place.

424
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,150
So that's how it is.

425
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,650
Hey, Conan!

426
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,450
What do you mean by "so that's how it is"?

427
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,950
Did you find anything?

428
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,250
Do you know why the fish are gathering together?

429
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,350
Why...

430
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,850
Because they want to play together?

431
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,250
Or perhaps because they are hungry
and want to eat something together?

432
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,550
Bingo!

433
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,650
Then, what is it that fish eat?

434
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,050
Plankton?

435
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,350
Correct.

436
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,450
Awesome!

437
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,850
What's down here?

438
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:38,950
Look.

439
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,750
It's sea fireflies!

440
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,050
Right! "Even if the sun doesn't set, a pirate still shines."

441
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,550
That's what it means.

442
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,650
Found it.

443
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,150
"Thin pirates will laugh."

444
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,750
Even fat pirates can laugh, can't they?

445
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,250
What's wrong, Haibara?

446
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,950
Someone in a wet suit, covered in blood, was just carried away.

447
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:15,850
What?

448
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,450
I don't know if it's Ran-san, though.

449
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,850
Conan-kun!

450
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,950
I need to leave with Edogawa-kun for a while.

451
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,750
You guys just go ahead.

452
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,450
Haibara-san is leaving too.

453
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,250
Don't worry.

454
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,550
I'm still here with you.

455
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,750
Let's find the treasure by ourselves.

456
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,350
You're right.

457
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,550
Ran-nee-chan!

458
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,650
Conan-kun?

459
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,150
Ai-chan is here too?

460
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,950
Are you... Are you okay?

461
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,950
We're fine.

462
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,950
How is it? Officer Uehira?

463
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,550
Kimiko-chan.

464
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,450
Kimiko-chan, were you there too when it happened?

465
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,350
No.

466
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,850
I was diving with my clients nearby.

467
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,050
But I was really shocked back then.

468
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,150
I saw that shark attacking a person.

469
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,350
There were actually three people there.

470
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,350
But only one was attacked.

471
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,850
What do you mean?

472
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,350
Nothing.

473
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,550
But it's really troublesome.

474
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,250
It's been a long time since sharks attacked people.

475
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,650
Speaking of which,

476
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,150
that's the first time I've seen sharks at that spot.

477
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,450
What's wrong?

478
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,750
Kimiko-san said that there were three of them diving together,

479
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,350
but only one was attacked.

480
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,950
You don't think it was an accident?

481
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,950
Since those guys are professionals,

482
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,450
they should at least know how to deal with sharks.

483
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,750
Did you find anything?

484
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,050
A plastic bag.

485
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,050
Fish blood?

486
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,950
So this must be the cause.

487
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,950
Right.

488
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,850
Someone put fish blood in a thin plastic bag,

489
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,650
sealed it well and then hid it
inside the buoyancy control jacket.

490
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,550
Underwater, atmospheric pressure increases
by one for every 10 meters.

491
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,450
Sea lever is at 1 atmospheric pressure.

492
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,450
It becomes 2 atmospheric pressure when you dive 10 meters.

493
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,650
When you get to 30 meters, it becomes 4.

494
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,450
With such a high water pressure,

495
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,450
the plastic bag's seal will definitely be broken.

496
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,750
Sharks can hear sounds from miles away.

497
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,650
Even if the blood is diluted a million times,

498
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,950
with their sense of smell, they can still smell it.

499
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,950
This is a murder case...

500
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:52,850
Yes.

501
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,450
Although it's still an attempted murder yet.

502
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,050
Hey, brat with glasses!

503
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,950
What are you two doing sneaking around here?

504
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,750
There's a case, Uncle Mouri.

505
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:03,950
What?

506
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,050
Why didn't they inform me...

507
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,550
I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri, after all.

508
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,750
This shark's mouth is really big.

509
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,050
But he was just bitten by a shark.

510
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,450
It's not a case, but an accident, isn't it?

511
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,950
What are you fussing about?

512
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,450
What is this?

513
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,950
How's it going, Doctor?

514
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,250
We did everything we could.

515
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,350
But because he bled too much...

516
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,250
I'm so sorry for your loss.

517
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,450
Damn it!

518
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,150
How could this happen?

519
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,250
Why would there be an accidental death here?

520
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,350
No, it wasn't an accident.

521
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,150
You're the famous detective...

522
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,050
Kogoro Mouri.

523
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,750
Dad?

524
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,550
Uncle.

525
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,650
Hey, why did you say it wasn't an accident?

526
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,350
Someone lured sharks to attack you on purpose.

527
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,150
Someone put a plastic bag full of fish blood

528
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,650
in this buoyancy control jacket.

529
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,950
By the way, given that you are all treasure hunters,

530
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,550
things can't be that simple, right?

531
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,050
Ran-nee-chan.

532
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,050
Where are the buoyancy control jackets usually kept?

533
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,350
Well...

534
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,050
Usually, we won't take them back to the hotel rooms.

535
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,750
I think people around here will send them to the diving stops,

536
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,250
and fill their oxygen tanks there too.

537
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,750
If someone wants to tamper with this buoyancy control jacket,

538
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,450
it should be here.

539
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,550
It would be too risky to do it
after someone's already taken it out.

540
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,350
Hey, Kudo-kun!

541
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:22,950
What is it, Haibara?

542
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,450
Look at this.

543
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,750
People usually wash away the seawater from the instruments here,

544
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,650
so this place is always damp.

545
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,450
Sorry, can you take some pictures with this for me?

546
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,550
I still have other things to investigate.

547
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,650
Since when did I become your assistant?

548
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,250
No, not an assistant. You're more like my partner.

549
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,150
That's a nice way of putting it.

550
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,650
Then, I'm counting on you.

551
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,050
All right.

552
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,950
Hey, onee-san.

553
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,450
What is it?

554
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,650
Is there anyone in this shop at night?

555
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,650
Oh, you're playing a detective game, right?

556
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,850
My house is right behind this shop.

557
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,750
Kimiko lives in an apartment near the port.

558
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,450
So there's no one here at night.

559
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,350
I see.

560
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,950
And since there are no thieves on this island,

561
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,250
we usually don't lock the door.

562
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,050
Kimiko, you were in charge of closing the shop last night, right?

563
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,050
Yes, why do you ask?

564
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,150
Because this little detective asked me a lot of questions.

565
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,950
I see.

566
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,850
You're investigating who could have done something
to that buoyancy control jacket, right?

567
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,750
Mhm.

568
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:42,850
I closed the shop last night and opened it this morning.

569
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,850
But since the door was unlocked,

570
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,050
anyone could have snuck in and done something.

571
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:51,650
How is it?

572
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,650
Do you have any clues?

573
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,150
No.

574
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,950
We haven't found anything yet...

575
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,350
I hope you can find something.

576
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,750
What's wrong?

577
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,450
How can you have the nerve to ask what's wrong?

578
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,350
What are you doing, Conan?

579
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:11,950
We can't find pirates' treasure without you!

580
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,650
You guys should try to use your brains once in a while.

581
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,950
We can't find it on our own!

582
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,150
Where are you right now?

583
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,450
We're heading to a hanging bridge.

584
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,750
Hanging bridge?

585
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,050
It's drawn on the treasure map.

586
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,350
The treasure map...

587
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,250
Okay, I found it.

588
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,350
Hurry up and get over here!

589
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,750
Got it.

590
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,050
I guess I have no choice.

591
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,550
Hey, Haibara. Wanna come with me?

592
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,750
I'm not going.

593
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,550
I knew it.

594
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,550
Hey, what is this?

595
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:48,650
The way is completely blocked.

596
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,950
Geez...

597
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,450
Hey, are you here alone?

598
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,150
Yeah.

599
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,750
I think they're still by the hanging bridge up there.

600
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,650
That's where I want to go.

601
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,050
But there's a prohibitory traffic sign there.

602
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,550
Sorry, sorry.

603
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,350
Last week, an earthquake caused a landslide
which blocked the road.

604
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,250
If you go a little further,

605
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,150
you'll find a pathway that turns left.

606
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,750
Can you use that pathway?

607
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,550
Mhm.

608
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,550
Thank you, Iwanaga-san.

609
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,950
Be careful, then.

610
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:18,850
Okay!

611
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,750
That's enough. I don't know the answer.

612
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,950
Conan-kun will be here soon. It will be fine.

613
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,850
It's okay even if Conan-kun is not here.

614
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,050
We can solve this puzzle ourselves.

615
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,850
Ah, there seems to be a sign on the other side of the bridge.

616
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,450
What is it?

617
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,950
Let's go check it out.

618
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,250
I'm hungry.

619
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,150
Hey, wait for me!

620
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,350
Wait a minute!

621
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,550
Don't move!

622
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,350
Why...why?

623
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,050
This... this is...

624
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,400
Warning: Passage forbidden
to anyone who weighs over 40 kilograms.

625
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,150
What is going on?

626
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,950
Genta-kun, how much do you weigh?

627
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,750
39 kilograms!

628
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:28,450
Lying!

629
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,450
I've put on a little weight. Maybe 45 kilograms...

630
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,750
You can't come over here.

631
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:38,350
This hanging bridge will break
if someone over 40 kilograms crosses it!

632
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,150
Are you serious?

633
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,950
So that's it! I see!

634
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,550
Thin pirates will laugh. It's telling us
to walk across this hanging bridge, right?

635
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:47,950
Right!

636
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,050
Thin pirates will laugh, that is to say, a fat pirate will cry.

637
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,250
Help me, Mama!

638
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,750
Found it.

639
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,850
What does "pirates never cry" mean?

640
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,350
It's already 4:00.

641
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,050
Let's continue tomorrow.

642
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,750
Yeah, but how do we get back?

643
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,950
Yeah.

644
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,750
If Genta keeps squatting there,

645
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,450
once we step on,

646
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,050
this hanging bridge will definitely break.

647
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,950
Hey, what are you doing?

648
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,950
Conan-kun, we found it!

649
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,950
Well done. Not bad for you!

650
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,550
The next hint is "pirates never cry"!

651
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,550
But this bridge

652
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,750
will break if someone
who weighs over 40 kilograms goes across it.

653
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,850
He might fall off!

654
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,450
Is that what is written on that sign?

655
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,550
No.

656
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,450
What's written on it is "passage forbidden
to anyone who weighs over 40 kilograms".

657
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,350
I see.

658
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,450
That's why "thin pirates will laugh".

659
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,350
It's okay. You can walk through.

660
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,650
That sign is just a hint.

661
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,750
The only people who could weigh under 40 kilograms
are women and children.

662
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:01,050
There can't be a code that only these people can solve.

663
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:30,050
Thank you for coming, Inspector!

664
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,850
But did you have to come all the way here...

665
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,250
Because I found some aspects to be weird...

666
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,750
Inspector...

667
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,550
Thank you for coming all the way here.

668
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,650
I'd like to know all of the details.

669
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,750
Understood!

670
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,550
You treat us like we're criminals.

671
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,750
We are victims, aren't we?

672
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,050
If you really are the victim...

673
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,150
then tell us the truth like a real victim would do!

674
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,350
Have you ever seen these two people?

675
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,750
Well... I've never seen them before.

676
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,250
These two men attacked a supermarket in Shinbashi last night.

677
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,250
and took all the cash from the store.

678
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,950
They said you told them to do so,
as an initiation to join your group.

679
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,750
How could I know?

680
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,850
I think they were just talking nonsense to get rid of you police.

681
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,650
You bastard!

682
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,950
Do you have any evidence? Evidence!

683
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,250
All you have is only the testimony of those two people, right?

684
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,250
All right, all right.

685
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,650
Calm down, everyone.

686
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,350
Let's have some refreshing drinks now.

687
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,450
Well, if there are no other questions,

688
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,050
I'd like to return to my room and get some rest.

689
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,250
You really don't know who might want to kill you?

690
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,650
Matsumoto-san.

691
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,650
I really don't know.

692
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:08,550
Bye, then.

693
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,350
Excuse me, can I borrow a match?

694
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,850
I forgot my lighter.

695
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,950
Here.

696
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,150
Oh, thanks.

697
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,450
Thank you very much.

698
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,750
Alas, what a waste of time!

699
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,750
Can I have a sip of that?

700
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,550
I'm a little thirsty.

701
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:41,950
It's okay. They didn't touch them at all.

702
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,450
I thought we could get their fingerprints.

703
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:45,850
Yeah.

704
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:48,750
But even if we could get their fingerprints,

705
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,650
it's gonna take a lot of time

706
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,150
to get the results on this island,

707
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,950
regardless of whether we got someone to come analyze them
or sent them back for testing.

708
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,350
But then again, Takagi-kun...

709
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,950
Do you smoke?

710
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,150
I'm sorry.

711
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,650
Do you have three-second glue?

712
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,750
What should we do when we have a meal?

713
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,350
lame quiz?

714
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:19,750
Answered correctly.

715
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,750
Here you go again.

716
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,350
You're gonna do this now?

717
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,450
I knew it's about time for this.

718
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,350
In the fish kingdom near the ruins on the seabed,

719
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,150
because the evil deeds of the previous king were revealed,

720
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,850
the sea bream became the next king.

721
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,050
So which of the following was the previous king?

722
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,350
1. Squid.

723
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,650
2. Octopus.

724
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,950
3. Crab.

725
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,850
So, which one is it?

726
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,450
Ah, I got it.

727
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,150
It's the third one! Crab!

728
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,450
Why?

729
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,350
It cut off the heads of those ones it hated with its pincers.

730
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,350
That was too much!

731
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,750
Don't be ridiculous.

732
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,950
Well, it seems to be a bit cruel.

733
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,750
Sorry...

734
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,650
It's the octopus, right?

735
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,250
Oh, so why is that?

736
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,150
The king octopus took all the kingdom's property for itself.

737
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,250
Imagine how an octopus looks.

738
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,050
That is to say, baldies make a lot of money, right?

739
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,350
Right!

740
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,650
But I don't think that's a right answer.

741
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,250
Then it's the first choice, squid!

742
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,150
Well, why?

743
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,050
Please leave it to me!

744
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:33,650
I'll answer correctly this time!

745
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,650
The king (osama) can be split into "o" and "sama".

746
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,850
If it was squid (ika), it would be "ika" and "sama".

747
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,950
Ika-sama...

748
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:45,050
Ikasama?

749
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,850
-So it means cheat!

750
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,550
That's correct...

751
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,350
There is something fishy...

752
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,670
Ah, Conan-kun...

753
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,590
The King is squid, which means "ikasama".
The evil deeds are its cheat, that's why squid is the king.

754
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,650
This is the real...

755
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:00,850
Cheat.

756
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,750
What a beautiful moon!

757
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,450
Forgive me for my rudeness, but why would you
provide lodging to tourists at your house?

758
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:19,050
Actually, I can make a living by fishing.

759
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,350
The district office asked me to provide lodging.

760
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,050
I heard that it was because they wanted to attract more tourists.

761
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,150
I see.

762
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,950
Maybe we're interfering with your life.

763
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,250
It's better to have you stay than those treasure hunters.

764
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,350
Speaking of treasure hunters,

765
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,750
is there really treasure here?

766
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:45,250
Coyotes don't gather where there is no prey,

767
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,350
although it may not be the prey they're expecting.

768
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,450
I don't know!

769
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,950
Why do pirates never cry?

770
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,250
Try to think about it carefully, Genta-kun.

771
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,150
Hey, kids!

772
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,450
"Pirates never cry" is a hint?

773
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,150
Yeah, that's right.

774
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,450
I'd know the answer if it was "pirates cry".

775
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,250
"Pirates cry"?

776
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,850
Maybe there's a hint there.

777
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,850
Do you want to take a look now?

778
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,250
Are you going out at this hour?

779
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,450
It's already dark outside. Why don't you go tomorrow?

780
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,750
Nobody knows if the weather will change tomorrow.

781
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,550
You mean it's going to get worse?

782
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:28,350
When the south wind starts blowing, we don't go fishing.

783
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,750
The waves might get very violent.

784
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,750
That is the life knowledge, right?

785
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:36,550
Then let's go together. It can be an after-dinner walk.

786
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,750
Okay.

787
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,750
What are you going to do, Takagi-kun?

788
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,250
It's called cyanoacrylate

789
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,150
The vapor of butyl acrylate of isocyanuric acid,
a component of three-second glue,

790
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:00,250
reacts to the water in the secretion.
It can help us to collect fingerprints.

791
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,650
Then, just wait for a while,

792
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,650
the fingerprints will emerge themselves.

793
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,150
When did you learn this method?

794
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:11,450
Actually, I saw it in a movie one time.

795
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,550
Then I confirmed it with the Forensics Officer Tome.

796
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,350
Well, I hope this works as smoothly as it did in the movie.

797
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,550
Is this where the answer of "pirates never cries" hides?

798
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,650
I'm not sure about the answer.

799
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,050
But the crying place is here.

800
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,050
Crying...

801
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,450
Could it be the sound of the wind?

802
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,550
It sounds like someone crying.

803
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,050
Wow, really.

804
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,950
I heard it on the way here, too.

805
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,650
I knew that already.

806
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,250
The sand here contains a lot of quartz.

807
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,050
And the sand is fine too.

808
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,850
I see.

809
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,450
Hey, Conan!

810
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,050
Did you find out anything?

811
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,550
Listen carefully.

812
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,850
Ah, so it is singing sand! It sounds crying!

813
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,450
So, that's why "pirates cry"!

814
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,050
You'll have to figure out the rest on your own.

815
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,550
Got it.

816
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,950
Next is "pirates never cry", right?

817
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:32,350
Could it be there?

818
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,950
Come on! There is no sound here!

819
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:41,650
So there is where pirates never cry, right?

820
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,150
They created a good atmosphere.

821
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,350
The next one is "souls of pirates will go to heaven".

822
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,550
Another inexplicable hint.

823
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:04,750
But the head of the Tourism Division
does have a rich imagination.

824
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,550
The head of the Tourism Division, Iwanaga-san.

825
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,750
Didn't he say he came up with these codes himself?

826
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,850
That's his job, that's all, right?

827
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,550
Such a killjoy...

828
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:21,950
What's wrong?

829
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,050
Conan-kun, what's wrong?

830
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:30,950
Things are getting interesting.

831
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,350
Conan-kun?

832
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,550
Sorry, I need to go somewhere.

833
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,550
You guys go back first.

834
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,750
Wait, Conan!

835
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:40,450
Not again...

836
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,550
This brat has no team spirit at all.

837
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,950
Conan-kun...

838
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:58,150
Here it is!

839
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:02,350
Now we just have to change it into data
and send it by email, then we'll know the results.

840
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,050
Good job, Takagi-kun!

841
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:04,850
Nothing...

842
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,250
If you ever want to transfer to
the Identification Division, just let me know.

843
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:12,750
If you don't mind, I can write a recommendation letter for you.

844
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,650
Please don't joke with me.

845
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:17,450
Anyway, let's send it back to headquarters.

846
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,550
Got it!

847
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,450
What are you doing?

848
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,550
I got lost while taking a walk.

849
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:00,750
Could you please tell me where Koumi Inn is?

850
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,050
That way.

851
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,750
Thank you. Good night.

852
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,550
How's it going, Takagi-kun?

853
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:13,150
Have you heard back from headquarters?

854
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,150
No, not yet.

855
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:16,650
I see...

856
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,950
What... What's wrong?

857
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,650
The alarm in the Tourism Museum has gone off!

858
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,750
So there must be something happened in the Tourism Museum.

859
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,250
Actually, the alarm here often malfunctions...

860
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,350
Just in case, let's check it out there!

861
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,250
Where is it?

862
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,750
Right next to the district office.

863
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:43,750
Borrow us your car.

864
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:44,750
Sure.

865
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,250
Headquarters might send a report back later.

866
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,050
Please take care of it for us.

867
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,150
I got it.

868
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,850
Geez, why are there so many incidents happening these days?

869
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,650
Oh, coming!

870
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:13,950
Well...

871
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,650
This is...

872
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:50,550
Get in!

873
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:47,350
What I asked for is stores with beautiful hostesses.

874
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,050
Geez!

875
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,250
Can't I have a drink in peace?

876
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,250
That's why I hate tourist spots that much!

877
00:49:58,650 --> 00:49:59,850
I'm going to get angry!

878
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,950
Hey, can't you just shut up!

879
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,550
Ah? What's wrong?

880
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:07,250
Hey, wait a minute!

881
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,850
What are you doing?

882
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:14,450
How could you tell me this is the store with beautiful hostess?

883
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,450
Head of the Tourism Division!

884
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,250
What does it matter?

885
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,950
She'll look beautiful when she's in a dark room!

886
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,450
You're responsible for this!

887
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:23,050
I'm very busy right now!

888
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:23,850
Why?

889
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,350
A thief broke into the exhibition room of the museum!

890
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:27,850
What?

891
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,850
A thief?

892
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:30,550
Get out of the way!

893
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:32,350
Wait a minute.

894
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,250
Get on!

895
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,350
Or I'll go without you!

896
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:38,450
Hold on, please...

897
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,850
Hold on tight! I'm going to go fast!

898
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:44,850
Wait, you haven't paid yet! Customer!

899
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,750
What happened, old lady?

900
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,650
Uehira-chan, a man didn't pay his bill! Please catch him for me!

901
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,550
Geez... Another incident?

902
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,550
They broke the display counter and stole the display items.

903
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,150
That was a bold move.

904
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,650
How is it, Sato-kun?

905
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,350
Just as Conan-kun said, there are signs of gunshots.

906
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,150
There are still blood stains at the scene.

907
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:13,850
I see.

908
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,150
Can you protect the scene?

909
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,050
It would be a little difficult.

910
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:19,750
I guess so.

911
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,650
Anyway, take pictures of the crime scene and then come back here.

912
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:24,350
Got it.

913
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,250
The cutlass and the pistol were stolen!

914
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,250
Are they something valuable?

915
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,350
They were precious items found inside Seabed Palace.

916
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,850
Anne Bonny's cutlass and Mary Read's pistol.

917
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,350
There's nothing to worry about! I can handle it!

918
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,050
Mouri, your face is so red!

919
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,250
No...

920
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:50,950
That's because everyone is here...

921
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,650
Kogoro Mouri, you're under arrest!

922
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,950
I'm arresting you for not paying your bill,
stealing a bicycle and riding it while drunk!

923
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,250
Hey, hey...

924
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,750
Is that true?

925
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:07,550
Yes.

926
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,650
He didn't pay his bill at the pub,

927
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,350
stole Iwanaga-san's bicycle and fled.

928
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,950
That's what the hostess of that pub told me.

929
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,550
I didn't steal and flee!

930
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,850
The head of the Tourism Division was sitting right behind me!

931
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,850
Right? Right?

932
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:20,950
Yes...yes.

933
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:27,250
Oh right, Inspector. The results of
the fingerprint analyzation arrived.

934
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,650
Hey, is this true?

935
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,250
Mitsushi Matsumoto

936
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,150
He has stolen important cultural artifacts
from ruins all over the world,

937
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,350
along with committing theft
and burglary of works of art, and even murder.

938
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:40,450
He's a big fish.

939
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,150
So they're international fugitives.

940
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:48,450
They're here for Anne and Mary's treasure.

941
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:49,950
What do you mean by that?

942
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,350
There's more treasure besides the stolen cutlass and pistol?

943
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:55,950
Ah, yeah.

944
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:59,550
Anne Bonny and Mary Read were female pirates.

945
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,950
Legend has it that three hundred years ago,

946
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,750
they hid their treasure on this Koumi Island.

947
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,350
Is it true that they hid their treasure here?

948
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:11,050
Yes.

949
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,350
The stolen pistol and cutlass are the best proof.

950
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,450
Hey, uncle, didn't you go to the store
with the beautiful hostess?

951
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:31,550
It was not a store with a beautiful hostess.

952
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,050
What's worse, it was just a store with an old hag.

953
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,250
As expected...

954
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,850
It's that smell.

955
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,550
Uncle, you've got something on you.

956
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,350
What is this?

957
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:45,950
I see.

958
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:50,150
How do you get off of this island?

959
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:53,450
There's only one scheduled ship every afternoon.

960
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,450
Apart from that, the only way to leave here
is taking a fishing boat.

961
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:56,550
Good.

962
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,850
Ask everyone to be extra careful

963
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,650
to avoid having their fishing boats stolen.

964
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,250
I...I got it.

965
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,250
Hey, what about these handcuffs?

966
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,350
Hey...

967
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,150
Well... Inspector Megure.

968
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,450
That Matsumoto guy...

969
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:16,850
I saw that he paying off the diving shop owner, Mabuchi-san.

970
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:17,750
What?

971
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,550
Inspector Megure, we're back.

972
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:21,850
Thank you for your hard work.

973
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,250
Sorry, but there's another task I need you to do right away.

974
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:26,550
The diving shop owner seems to have some contact with Matsumoto.

975
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,050
You two go to the diving shop.

976
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,650
We're going to the hotel where Matsumoto is staying.

977
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:32,750
Yes, sir.

978
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,950
Inspector, my handcuffs!

979
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,650
How's the weather?

980
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:51,650
The wind is strong.

981
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,550
But the sun is out, so it should be fine.

982
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,050
Let's zoom in.

983
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,350
The pattern of the tires is completely different.

984
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,450
As suspected, it's not this bike.

985
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:06,850
Conan-kun.

986
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,650
Coming!

987
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,250
Conan-kun, the food is ready!

988
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,550
I'll be right there!

989
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,250
What is it?

990
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,350
It looks like a GPS.

991
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,550
GPS?

992
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,350
Why would it be placed on a bicycle?

993
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,550
Geez, what is Conan doing?

994
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,550
He said he's coming. Just give him a minute.

995
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,750
Look, he's here.

996
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:29,650
Sorry to keep you waiting.

997
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:32,550
Conan, you're so slow! I'm starving!

998
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,550
Sorry, sorry...

999
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:37,250
Ah, where's Uncle Mouri?

1000
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:40,050
He said he had a meeting with the police this morning,

1001
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,550
so he went down to the district office.

1002
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,650
Well, now that everyone is here.

1003
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,550
I'm starting!

1004
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,450
I'm starting!

1005
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,950
I didn't realize it'd be nearby.

1006
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,050
Yummy! I want another one!

1007
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,850
Did you meet Iwanaga-san on the way to the hanging bridge?

1008
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,650
Iwanaga-san?

1009
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,550
Oh, the head of the Tourism Division?

1010
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,050
Yeah.

1011
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,050
No, we didn't see him.

1012
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,250
Right?

1013
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:13,950
Right.

1014
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,450
We found that place by ourselves.

1015
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:18,450
I see...

1016
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,450
Do you have enough food?

1017
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:27,750
Yeah, thank you very much.

1018
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,150
Are you going for a dive today as well?

1019
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:35,350
No, because of what happened yesterday,
I'm still a little scared.

1020
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,150
But we may not have much time to have fun tomorrow,

1021
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,350
so we'd like to go on a boat trip today.

1022
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,350
Better not to go out to sea in the afternoon.

1023
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:45,150
The waves might be very violent.

1024
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,550
Really?

1025
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,150
Then we have to hurry up and find the treasure.

1026
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,450
Yeah.

1027
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,550
There's only one puzzle left now.

1028
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,850
Let's work together, Conan-kun!

1029
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:00,150
Ah, I need to go somewhere...

1030
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,850
So you guys go find it yourselves.

1031
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:09,450
Then, let's forget about this odd guy.

1032
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:13,150
Let's find the treasure ourselves and split it among ourselves.

1033
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,850
Agreed!

1034
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,150
As expected, none of the other bikes have GPS trackers.

1035
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,250
Director Iwanaga, this is
the latest information on the low pressure!

1036
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,250
That's terrible. It's almost like a typhoon.

1037
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,450
Anyway, let's inform the fishing association and hotels.

1038
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,250
Yes, sir.

1039
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,950
What a pain in the ass...

1040
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,950
Matsumoto and Izuyama didn't return to the hotel.

1041
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,550
But there's no sign of them leaving the island.

1042
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,250
So they must be lurking somewhere.

1043
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:05,250
At least one of them was shot with a rifle.

1044
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,650
They would need a doctor, right?

1045
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,950
I've checked with the clinics.

1046
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:11,250
They haven't shown up yet.

1047
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,150
About Mabuchi, the owner of the diving shop,

1048
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:17,150
I've figured out what Conan-kun saw last night.

1049
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:20,350
Matsumoto asked her to prepare a boat for them to escape.

1050
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,250
Let me be clear,

1051
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,750
I have no idea where Matsumoto and the others are hiding.

1052
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,850
It's hard to make money from this diving shop,

1053
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,650
so I agreed to help Matsumoto.

1054
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,550
I never thought I'd have such bad luck.

1055
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,250
I see.

1056
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:39,650
The shell casings Takagi-kun took back

1057
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,050
were worn-out.

1058
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,450
They must have been stored for a very long time.

1059
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:49,150
We're checking with the hunting club about the rifle.

1060
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:51,250
Please come in.

1061
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,150
Sorry for the intrusion.

1062
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:55,450
I just got a call.

1063
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:59,450
They said that Mineo-san of the hunting club has lost his rifle.

1064
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,550
Is that so?

1065
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,350
Who's that Mineo-san?

1066
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,750
He's an old man living all by himself.

1067
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:11,350
His niece, Chika Mabuchi,
who runs the diving stop, takes care of him.

1068
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,950
Go ask Mineo-san for more details!

1069
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,650
And ask Mabuchi-san to come over here as well.

1070
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,050
Yes, sir!

1071
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,550
Please find back the stolen cutlass and pistol for us.

1072
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:27,750
I'm counting on you!

1073
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,150
We'll do our best.

1074
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,250
But we police are all here,

1075
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,850
why did they wait until now to steal them?

1076
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,350
That's right.

1077
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:40,850
When Uehira-san was the only police officer,

1078
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,450
it would be easier to leave this island.

1079
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,750
Maybe the criminal was worried that if this continued,

1080
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,750
it would be only a matter of time
before their identities were revealed.

1081
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:52,150
What about the backup from Tokyo?

1082
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,450
Because of the low air pressure,

1083
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,650
I heard that the helicopters and ships can't go out.

1084
00:59:58,050 --> 00:59:59,650
We have to depend on ourselves.

1085
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:03,150
Not only to look for Matsumoto and the others,

1086
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:06,650
but also to find out the culprit who attempted to kill them.

1087
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,650
Here it is.

1088
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:19,550
Found it!

1089
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,550
Great!

1090
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,050
The last hint is really easy.

1091
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:28,550
"Souls of pirates will go to heaven."
The only answer would be the watchtower.

1092
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,750
"The words on the seals are the hint."

1093
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:36,550
"Now, let's find out our treasure."

1094
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,450
My boss just went to go check on the situation at sea.

1095
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:41,850
Please wait a moment.

1096
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,750
Okay.

1097
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,150
Sorry for the wait.

1098
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,850
Sorry.

1099
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,550
We can't go out to sea today.

1100
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,350
The waves are really rough.

1101
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,050
Too bad.

1102
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,350
I guess we have no choice.

1103
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,950
Then, how about we go to a beach?

1104
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,650
Good morning, Uehira-san.

1105
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,350
Good morning.

1106
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,050
Why do you look so serious?

1107
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:04,350
Did something happen?

1108
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,550
Chika-chan, come with me for a moment.

1109
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,050
Inspector Megure has something to ask you.

1110
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,350
Uncle!

1111
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:21,850
Yeah, what is it?

1112
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:30,550
Why did those hunters steal the cutlass and pistol
from the Tourism Museum?

1113
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,150
Treasure hunters' target should be treasure, right?

1114
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,950
But they stole those items.

1115
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:44,350
That means those items are necessary to find the treasure, right?

1116
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:49,750
So I think those people have already left
for where the treasure is hidden.

1117
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,550
Uncle, do you know where it is?

1118
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,750
Why are you asking me about this?

1119
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,250
You used to be a treasure hunter too, right?

1120
01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:11,850
Even if I were a treasure hunter,

1121
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:16,050
how can you be so sure that I know where the treasure is?

1122
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:18,650
Didn't you say that yesterday?

1123
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:23,950
Speaking of the treasure hunters, is there really treasure here?

1124
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:28,750
Coyotes don't gather where there is no prey,

1125
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,150
although it may not be the prey they're expecting.

1126
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,950
"Although it may not be the prey they're expecting."

1127
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:37,150
In other words,

1128
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:41,050
you know what the treasure is, right?

1129
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:46,650
Follow me.

1130
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:57,450
Why are some of the numbers read, and some blue?

1131
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,150
Give me the scissors.

1132
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:02,850
Ah, okay.

1133
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,750
There are two questions.

1134
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,850
Besides the question that why the numbers
are separated into two colors,

1135
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:13,350
there is another question, what do these numbers mean?

1136
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:17,350
Could the numbers be the address of the island?

1137
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:21,450
Oh right, let's go ask Uncle!

1138
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:22,850
Uncle!

1139
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:35,150
But then again, what would Inspector Megure
want to ask Mabuchi-san?

1140
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,850
Could it be related to the case?

1141
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,350
There must be a mistake.

1142
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:40,650
You guys get in the car.

1143
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,450
Okay!

1144
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,250
How about you put this in the car for me too?

1145
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:52,850
Wait, you...

1146
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:55,650
Get back in the car!

1147
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:59,750
You don't want anything to happen to your friend, do you?

1148
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:28,150
Uncle, did you used to be a treasure hunter?

1149
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:30,750
Yeah, when I was young,

1150
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:34,650
I came to this island to find Anne and Mary's treasure.

1151
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:37,250
And I've been here ever since.

1152
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,850
I fell in love with a woman on the island,
married and started a family with her.

1153
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,450
Then I became a fisherman.

1154
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,450
This map is 300-year-old.

1155
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,650
You were right.

1156
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,650
They are drawn according to this map.

1157
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,000
These numbers are drawn by Iwanaga,

1158
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,950
the head of the Tourism Division,
according to the same ancient map as this one.

1159
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:16,350
Because, so far, no one has been able to solve these codes.

1160
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:19,950
This map may have been drawn 300 years ago.

1161
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,750
And, by Anne Bonny herself.

1162
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:23,950
Yeah...

1163
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,050
If so, could it be that...

1164
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,550
we'll find the real treasure if we solve these codes?

1165
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:30,650
That's right.

1166
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:36,450
There were no addresses here 300 years ago, I guess.

1167
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:39,850
The most common way to solve this would be to use the alphabet.

1168
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,850
So, 5 is...

1169
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:44,950
5 is... A, B, C, D, E... It's E!

1170
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:45,650
Right.

1171
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:49,950
7 is G.

1172
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:54,750
12 is... A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L...

1173
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,350
The 12th one is L!

1174
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:58,150
L!

1175
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,850
Letters are all written down.

1176
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:15,750
The red numbers are on top,

1177
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,250
and the blue numbers are on the bottom.

1178
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,950
All the numbers have been converted to letters.

1179
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,250
Now we just have to arrange them.

1180
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:22,650
Is it someone's name?

1181
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,450
Red could be the last name,
and blue could be the first name or something.

1182
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,050
Good point.

1183
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,850
Could this be a name related to pirates?

1184
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,550
Well... it's possible.

1185
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:35,450
Look, look!

1186
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,450
If we arrange them like this, it looks like a name of a person.

1187
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,350
"Jolly"...

1188
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:44,450
Jolly...

1189
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,550
You two, run!

1190
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:06,250
Don't move!

1191
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:09,250
Ran!

1192
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:12,650
Seems like you know a little karate, little girl.

1193
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,050
If you do anything stupid, I'll kill your friend immediately.

1194
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:37,150
This is our boat...

1195
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,750
Why would it be in this place...

1196
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,950
I asked your boss to prepare it.

1197
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,250
I paid her.

1198
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,150
How could...

1199
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:49,150
You're of no use anymore.

1200
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:54,150
Because we don't have enough oxygen tanks.

1201
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:55,150
Kimiko-san!

1202
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:55,650
Don't move!

1203
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,650
You! Don't move!

1204
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,650
Hurry up and get on the board!

1205
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,950
I'm really not good at this kind of thing.

1206
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,450
What about this?

1207
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,350
What is this?

1208
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,550
Could it be Grroe?

1209
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,450
Jolly Grroe?

1210
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,050
No.

1211
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:22,150
Roger.

1212
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,250
Jolly Roger.

1213
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:26,750
Jolly Roger?

1214
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:28,250
Who's that?

1215
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,850
Some famous pirate?

1216
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:33,050
The direct translation would be "Happy Roger", huh?

1217
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,750
Jolly Roger...

1218
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:40,550
was the last thing sailors wanted to see in the 17th century.

1219
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,450
It is said, originally, this name

1220
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,150
consists of "Jolly Rouge", which means "Red Flag",

1221
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,450
and "Old Roger", which means "Devil".

1222
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:49,850
Flag?

1223
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,550
Devil?

1224
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:53,750
That's right.

1225
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:55,850
The so-called "Jolly Roger"

1226
01:08:55,850 --> 01:08:58,650
is this pirate flag drawn on this map.

1227
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:00,950
Conan-kun, you're awesome!

1228
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,550
Correct answer.

1229
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:08,950
What is this?

1230
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,550
About 300 years ago,

1231
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:16,650
it was drawn by a Spanish sailor
who was passing through the sea off this island.

1232
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:20,250
Since then, the island has sunk into the sea.

1233
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:23,750
I heard that it was because of methane gas or something.

1234
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:31,650
It is said that the part of Yorioya Island
that used to be exposed above water was larger before.

1235
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:34,850
About 300 years ago, earthquakes caused
it to sink into the ocean depths.

1236
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:37,350
That's why it looks like this now.

1237
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,150
Yorioya Island...

1238
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,450
Is there a treasure hidden on that island?

1239
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:50,950
Yes, it's possible.

1240
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:53,650
But there should be other clues.

1241
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:57,350
Clues that suggest the exact location.

1242
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:59,850
What's wrong, Conan?

1243
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:01,550
Did you think of something?

1244
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,550
The pirate flag on this ancient map.

1245
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:07,450
The skull's teeth...

1246
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,550
Don't you think they look like characters?

1247
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:14,950
Really.

1248
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:16,950
They look like letters from the alphabet.

1249
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,750
The teeth on top are DOS,

1250
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:26,050
The teeth on the bottom are DIOSAS.

1251
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:28,250
What does it mean?

1252
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:29,950
Dos Diosas.

1253
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:34,150
In Spanish, it means "two goddesses".

1254
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:36,250
Awesome!

1255
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:38,550
Not bad for you, Haibara-san!

1256
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:40,250
Is that all?

1257
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,450
We must go to the island to check out the rest.

1258
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:46,650
But aren't the treasure hunters looking for treasure in the sea?

1259
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:49,250
So, the treasure is hidden on the seabed?

1260
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,150
No, if it was on the seabed,

1261
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:54,250
there would have been a hint about the sea.

1262
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,850
And Poseidon is the male god of the sea.

1263
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,950
Those guys are probably looking for other entrance.

1264
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,650
The entrance of the two goddesses

1265
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,850
collapsed during the last earthquake.

1266
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,950
Adults are unable to pass through.

1267
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:12,750
So they have found the entrance.

1268
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:16,050
That's why even with the police investigating on the island,

1269
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:19,550
they still decided to risk stealing the cutlass and the pistol.

1270
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,750
The girl from the diving shop!

1271
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,250
What's wrong?

1272
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,250
Where's Mouri-san?

1273
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:34,250
He's not here. He should be at the district office.

1274
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:36,950
Ran-chan and Sonoko-chan were kidnapped...

1275
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:39,050
They were taken to the boat...

1276
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:41,250
Who was it? Who took them away?

1277
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:46,150
Matsumoto... That treasure hunter.

1278
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,650
They must have gone to Yorioya Island!

1279
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:54,050
You guys, go to the district office
and tell Uncle Mouri about this.

1280
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,450
Got it!

1281
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:03,250
Be careful.

1282
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:04,150
Mhm.

1283
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:11,650
Uncle.

1284
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:14,650
Could you please drive the boat?

1285
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,950
I need you to take me to that island.

1286
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:18,250
What?

1287
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,450
It's not because of the treasure.

1288
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:22,550
I want to save Ran-nee-chan and Sonoko-chan.

1289
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,550
Shinichi.

1290
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:30,450
Conan-kun, I heard that Ran-kun and Sonoko were kidnapped, right?

1291
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:31,350
Mhm.

1292
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,050
I know you'll go save her, even if I tell you not to go.

1293
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,850
Wait a minute, I have something for you.

1294
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:42,450
I'm going to get the boat ready.

1295
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:43,650
Got it.

1296
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:49,950
Take these with you.

1297
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:51,850
These are mini-oxygen tanks.

1298
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:54,150
Just pull this from here,

1299
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:56,250
put it in your mouth, and you'll get 10 minutes worth of oxygen.

1300
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,550
But unfortunately, I only have two of them.

1301
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:00,450
So, use them as a last resort.

1302
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,450
Thank you, Professor.

1303
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,850
You two share one oxygen tank.

1304
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,050
Now that you're already here, you don't need us anymore, do you?

1305
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:19,250
You gotta stay with us a little longer.

1306
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:23,050
Hurry up and get everything ready!

1307
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,250
Could it be...

1308
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:38,450
Sonoko!

1309
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,150
It's your turn, little girl.

1310
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,650
What exactly do you want us to do?

1311
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,550
Your turn's next.

1312
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:53,350
What?

1313
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:56,450
Ran and Sonoko were kidnapped by Matsumoto?

1314
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:58,150
Where did they go?

1315
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,950
They went to an island!

1316
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:01,350
They went to Yorioya Island!

1317
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:05,250
They've known where the treasure is. They're going to get it now!

1318
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:06,650
Please get the boat ready as soon as possible.

1319
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:08,550
We're going to save Ran and Sonoko.

1320
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:10,150
Got it.

1321
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,050
But why did those guys take hostages with them?

1322
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:19,850
If they are going to find the treasure,

1323
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,550
it's troublesome to take hostages, isn't it?

1324
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,250
Because they have some other use.

1325
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:24,350
Some other use?

1326
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:28,150
They were injured by rifle shots last night.

1327
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:31,250
The place they're going to dive down

1328
01:14:31,650 --> 01:14:33,250
is the same place they were attacked by sharks yesterday.

1329
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:35,650
Are they going to be used as bait?

1330
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:37,350
Most likely.

1331
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,050
Right there!

1332
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:05,050
As expected...

1333
01:15:06,450 --> 01:15:08,450
What should we do? There is not much time left.

1334
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,350
I'm going to Yorioya Island.

1335
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,450
What?

1336
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:14,950
I'm small enough to pass through
the entrance of the two goddesses, right?

1337
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:25,150
Not much oxygen left.

1338
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:13,250
Impressive, you're still alive.

1339
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:16,250
Go get those torches and come over here.

1340
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,850
Otherwise, you won't be able to see the way

1341
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:21,650
You'll only die if you stay here.

1342
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:27,450
Keep moving.

1343
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:30,450
Don't push me!

1344
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:34,950
This place is...

1345
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:37,850
We've been here several times.

1346
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:43,150
I must get the treasure of Anne Bonny and Mary Read today!

1347
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,950
Stay there for now, you two.

1348
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:56,450
A little further ahead of you is a small temple.

1349
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:58,950
There are statues of two goddesses inside.

1350
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,650
The entrance is right behind there.

1351
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:01,350
Got it!

1352
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,350
You can only stay for 30 minutes at most.

1353
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,150
Otherwise, you won't be able to come back.

1354
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:06,850
Thank you!

1355
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:10,450
I'll definitely bring Ran-nee-chan and Sonoko-nee-chan back!

1356
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:19,550
Anne Bonny and Mary Read...

1357
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:39,850
Strange, an adult should be able to go through too.

1358
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:44,750
Last week, an earthquake caused
a landslide which blocked the road.

1359
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:48,550
I see. The earthquake made this entrance bigger.

1360
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:53,450
Could it be that Ran have already been...

1361
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:56,250
No, since they brought them here,

1362
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:57,350
I don't think they would kill them.

1363
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:58,050
But...

1364
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:01,950
Last night Matsumoto and his teammate
were injured by rifle shots.

1365
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:04,950
As soon as they dive down,

1366
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,050
the smell of blood would attract sharks.

1367
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:09,550
So?

1368
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:14,450
Ran-san and Sonoko must have been used as bait.

1369
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,050
Wait a minute, Mouri-san!

1370
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,150
What are you doing?

1371
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,750
Let go of me! I can't just leave them alone!

1372
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,250
It's no use, Mouri-san.

1373
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,550
The weather is going to get worse.

1374
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:27,150
I don't care! Let go of me!

1375
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:28,150
I'm sorry.

1376
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:35,450
What should we do now?

1377
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,650
We have to go back for now.

1378
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:39,850
Although it's hard to make this decision...

1379
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,950
Hurry and come inside.

1380
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,150
It's too dangerous to stay out here.

1381
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:50,050
But...

1382
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:54,950
Conan-kun, Ran-onee-san and Sonoko-onee-san are in danger now.

1383
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:55,750
Yeah...

1384
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:56,950
Indeed...

1385
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:06,250
The water level has begun to go down.

1386
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:07,350
The tide is ebbing, right?

1387
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,750
Are we going into that cave?

1388
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,250
You're right.

1389
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:14,150
That cave is a shortcut to the treasure.

1390
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:17,750
Okay, bring those oxygen tanks and follow us.

1391
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:38,950
So the legend of the pirates is true.

1392
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:40,450
It seems so.

1393
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:57,850
Put the oxygen tanks down. You two, go in first.

1394
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,850
Ah, but...

1395
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,150
Shut up! Just go inside!

1396
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,750
Skeletons... Skeletons... Skeletons...

1397
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:19,650
Looks like this place is safe this time.

1398
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:21,850
The gas...

1399
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:22,350
Gas?

1400
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:26,650
When the wind isn't blowing hard enough,
this place is full of gas.

1401
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,150
That's why you asked us to go first?

1402
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:32,750
What else do you think we took you here?

1403
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:34,450
Hurry up and keep moving.

1404
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:44,050
What's that?

1405
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:45,650
This is it!

1406
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:49,850
I found it!

1407
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:54,450
What an idiot.

1408
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,950
Who asked you to put this fake one in? That's why you died.

1409
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,250
You must use this one...

1410
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:15,150
You, go open it.

1411
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,250
Me?

1412
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,550
I'll do it.

1413
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:30,050
Ran!

1414
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,250
Bah! We failed again?

1415
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,150
Just give up!

1416
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:47,350
So that's it. I see.

1417
01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:48,650
Did you figure out?

1418
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:53,150
Anne and Mary always fought back to back.

1419
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:54,850
That means...

1420
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:57,350
they should be put this way.

1421
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,650
We found it! We found it!

1422
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:22,150
Give me the torch.

1423
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:43,150
Impressive.

1424
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:45,850
Treasure... Where's the treasure?

1425
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,750
No rush!

1426
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:53,550
Ran, what should we do now?

1427
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:55,250
Now we have a chance to run away,

1428
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:56,850
but without oxygen tanks,

1429
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,650
it's impossible to get to the surface
in this kind of terrible weather.

1430
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:00,350
That's right...

1431
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:03,550
We can only wait here for help.

1432
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:05,050
That's right.

1433
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:12,450
There's wind.

1434
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:13,550
There's a channel down there.

1435
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:14,950
Damn it!

1436
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:18,150
There's no treasure anywhere!

1437
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:22,050
There's not even a dime! Not to mention the treasure!

1438
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:23,950
I don't know who it is,

1439
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:27,850
there must be someone who came first and took it all!

1440
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,650
Hey, this isn't like what you told me before!

1441
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:32,750
I came to this place because you said there was treasure!

1442
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,150
Shut up! You're annoying!

1443
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:40,950
Anyway, there's no other choice.
We gotta get out of here right now.

1444
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:45,350
But first, let's get rid of the deadweight.

1445
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,150
I'm sorry.

1446
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:53,750
But this is your destiny.

1447
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:56,150
Don't move!

1448
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:58,250
Ran, I'll trust you to watch my back.

1449
01:25:58,550 --> 01:25:59,750
Sonoko, be careful!

1450
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:16,150
Damn it!

1451
01:26:16,650 --> 01:26:18,150
This woman is a fighter!

1452
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:20,450
And she's a good one.

1453
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:24,950
But no matter how good they are,

1454
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,250
they're no match for this.

1455
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,850
Always play your trump card last.

1456
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,050
Get down, you two!

1457
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:52,350
Are you all right?

1458
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,450
Ran-nee-chan! Sonoko-nee-chan!

1459
01:26:56,450 --> 01:26:57,950
Well done, little man!

1460
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,450
How did you know about this place?

1461
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,550
There is a tunnel between this place and Yorioya Island.

1462
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:07,150
So the pirates' treasure really exists.

1463
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:09,950
There is no treasure here.

1464
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:13,550
They said that it was all taken by someone
who came to this place first.

1465
01:27:15,250 --> 01:27:16,350
So that is the end!

1466
01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:17,950
What a pity, huh?

1467
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:20,950
I guess it's okay to show your face now.

1468
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:24,050
You were sneaking behind me and following me here, weren't you?

1469
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:36,250
Inspector, we can take the boat out now.

1470
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,650
The wind has died down now.

1471
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:39,350
Mouri-san.

1472
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:43,950
The weather forecast said the storm won't stop until dawn.

1473
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,950
But... You can look for yourself.

1474
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:48,150
It's really dying down.

1475
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,350
Please calm down, Mouri-san.

1476
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:52,350
How can I calm down after this happened?

1477
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,150
Ran was kidnapped!

1478
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:57,150
But the only one who went save her was that brat with glasses!

1479
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:01,950
We adults can do nothing but wait!

1480
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:02,850
Mouri-kun!

1481
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:04,850
I understand how you feel,

1482
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,550
but if we can't go out to sea by boat,

1483
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:08,350
there is nothing we can do about it.

1484
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:14,050
As soon as the storm subsides,
we will go save Ran-kun and Sonoko immediately.

1485
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:15,950
Please try to be patient now.

1486
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:18,750
Damn it!

1487
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,150
I guess it's okay to show your face now.

1488
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:27,150
You were sneaking behind me and following me here, weren't you?

1489
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:29,150
Iwanaga-san.

1490
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:37,850
Don't say like that. "Sneaking" is kind of an ugly word.

1491
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:41,050
I was just trying to save them.

1492
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:43,350
Then why are you carrying a rifle here?

1493
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:47,150
Because I heard they were international fugitives.

1494
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:50,750
That rifle is the one stolen from Mineo-san, right?

1495
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:53,050
No...

1496
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:55,950
You brought it to stop them from taking the treasure away, right?

1497
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:58,150
It has nothing to do with the treasure!

1498
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:01,550
Iwanaga-san.

1499
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:05,250
You said the codes for the treasure hunt you gave us

1500
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:07,250
were all your ideas?

1501
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:08,550
Ah...Yeah.

1502
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:13,750
But I saw the same codes at Mima-san's house.

1503
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:20,450
They were from a 300-year-old map left behind by Anne Bonny.

1504
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,550
That means...

1505
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:26,850
you has seen that map before, Iwanaga-san.

1506
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:28,150
In other words,

1507
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:31,250
you couldn't solve the mystery of the treasure map on your own,

1508
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:35,150
so you wanted the tourists on the island
to solve it for you, right?

1509
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:36,650
Come to think of it,

1510
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:40,550
you even tried to persuade my dad to join the treasure hunt too.

1511
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,650
I see.

1512
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:43,150
Compared to these kids,

1513
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:46,450
the probability of a famous detective
solving it would be much higher.

1514
01:29:46,850 --> 01:29:50,650
Besides, in order to track the participants' movements,

1515
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,950
you also installed GPS trackers on the rental bikes, right?

1516
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:57,450
That was because I must protect the safety of the participants.

1517
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:02,550
If you changed the numbers on the map into
the letters of the alphabet, it would be "Jolly Roger".

1518
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:04,750
That is, "pirate flag".

1519
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:10,050
This Yorioya Island used to look like a skull.

1520
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:11,950
That's why Anne Bonny left these clues.

1521
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:16,050
I think the origin of the name "Yorioya"

1522
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:18,450
came from the pronunciation of the words "Jolly Roger".

1523
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:23,150
I'm sure you've thought of that too, Iwanaga-san.

1524
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:26,450
But there's another meaning behind the "Jolly Roger".

1525
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:27,350
What?

1526
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:33,450
On the real map, there is a pirate flag, or Jolly Roger, right?

1527
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:37,550
There is a second hint on the skull.

1528
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:42,750
Dos Diosas, two goddesses.

1529
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,550
Conan-kun...

1530
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:46,550
That's right.

1531
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:49,350
You should have seen them when you followed me.

1532
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:52,750
The statues of the two goddesses in that small temple.

1533
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:55,350
They suggested that there was an entrance.

1534
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:57,550
So that's it.

1535
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,950
How did you know that?

1536
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:04,050
Damn it, was I wrong from the beginning?

1537
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:09,250
You tampered with the buoyancy control jacket,

1538
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:12,650
and shot the treasure hunters with the rifle.

1539
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:14,050
You did all of those, didn't you, Iwanaga-san?

1540
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:16,550
Both behind the cave,

1541
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:19,350
and at the place
where the bullet shells from the rifle were dropped,

1542
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,750
there were tire marks of your bicycle left.

1543
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:27,750
I made some mistakes that even a schoolboy would notice.

1544
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:30,350
It wasn't a schoolboy.

1545
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:35,250
It was Uncle Kogoro.

1546
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,050
I heard these all from Uncle Kogoro.

1547
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:39,850
He told me that...

1548
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:43,250
Iwanaga-san had the smell of gunpowder on him.

1549
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:45,650
It's probably because that rifle was too old.

1550
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:49,750
So when he fired it, the gunpowder residues
would fly all over the place.

1551
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,350
What?

1552
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,550
I knew it.

1553
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,050
As expected of the famous detective, Kogoro Mouri.

1554
01:31:59,450 --> 01:32:00,150
Earthquake?

1555
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:04,250
It stopped.

1556
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,750
Not good. We gotta get out of here!

1557
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,750
That's right. We should take those two treasure hunters with us.

1558
01:32:10,950 --> 01:32:11,250
Mhm.

1559
01:32:14,050 --> 01:32:15,450
Iwanaga-san, please give me a hand!

1560
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:24,550
That's bad!

1561
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,050
What should we do? The entrance is blocked.

1562
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:30,250
It's gas.

1563
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:31,950
Let's get to the ship!

1564
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,350
Hurry up!

1565
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:50,150
Damn it, if this continues...

1566
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:53,150
Conan-kun, what should we do now?

1567
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:56,550
Anyway, let's bring them to the cabin.

1568
01:32:57,050 --> 01:32:59,450
Just in case, hook an oxygen tank up to them.

1569
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:01,350
Don't let them breathe in the gas.

1570
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:04,750
And Ran-nee-chan, you two can use these.

1571
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,550
What are these?

1572
01:33:07,150 --> 01:33:09,750
They're mini-oxygen tanks invented by Professor Agasa.

1573
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:11,050
Conan-kun, where is yours?

1574
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:13,450
I have another one, it's okay.

1575
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:16,250
I see...

1576
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:27,150
Damn, what should I do?

1577
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:29,050
If this goes on, the gas will...

1578
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:31,150
Gas?

1579
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:36,350
The gas is probably methane.

1580
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:38,550
It would be concentrated near the top of the cave.

1581
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,050
If we can make use of the gas...

1582
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,250
Is there anything... Anything I can use?

1583
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:47,150
Found it.

1584
01:33:48,650 --> 01:33:50,250
Ran-nee-chan. Sonoko-nee-chan.

1585
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:51,950
Listen to me carefully.

1586
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:55,250
Since the water can flow into this place,

1587
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:57,450
the rock layer is probably not very thick.

1588
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:01,150
So, I want to detonate the gas and blow up the top of the cave.

1589
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:02,450
This way, we can let the whole ship...

1590
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:06,250
Are you gonna let us to ride the ship out to escape?

1591
01:34:06,350 --> 01:34:07,550
Is that okay?

1592
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,150
I don't know.

1593
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:11,250
But at this rate,

1594
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,550
we'll all die from methane poisoning,

1595
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,350
or we'll drown in the sea.

1596
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:15,850
Since we'll die anyway, why don't we...

1597
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:19,550
We might as well give it a try.

1598
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:20,250
Mhm.

1599
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:22,750
What are we going to do, Conan-kun?

1600
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:27,450
I'll kick the chain upwards,

1601
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:28,950
letting it hit the rocks at the top of the cave.

1602
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:32,750
If it goes well, it will create a spark,
which should be able to make the gas explode.

1603
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:36,750
Ran-nee-chan, you two go into the cabin
and breathe through the oxygen tanks.

1604
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:40,950
When the gas explodes, all of the oxygen in the air
will be consumed in an instant.

1605
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:43,050
Conan-kun, what about you?

1606
01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:48,250
I'll be fine. After kicking the chain up,
I'll run into the cabin.

1607
01:34:48,450 --> 01:34:49,150
No need to worry about me.

1608
01:34:57,850 --> 01:34:58,650
I got it.

1609
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:08,450
Inspector...

1610
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:09,250
Mhm...

1611
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:10,850
Get the boat ready!

1612
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:12,150
Prepare for the rescue operation!

1613
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:13,150
Yes, sir!

1614
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:33,450
Everything is ready here, Conan-kun.

1615
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:40,350
Alright.

1616
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:40,850
Not good...

1617
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:02,750
Conan-kun. Conan-kun!

1618
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:05,150
Conan-kun, hang in there!

1619
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:09,250
Ran...

1620
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:18,450
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1621
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:20,550
Full speed!

1622
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:40,550
Pirate ship?

1623
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:58,050
Ran!

1624
01:37:59,450 --> 01:38:01,350
Are you okay?

1625
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:03,350
I'm fine!

1626
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:04,350
Finally, we're saved!

1627
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:18,950
Everybody, run!

1628
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:21,050
Watch out!

1629
01:38:21,050 --> 01:38:22,550
Jump into the sea!

1630
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:23,450
Sonoko!

1631
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:27,750
Quick!

1632
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:53,150
So, did you find the treasure?

1633
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:54,250
No.

1634
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:57,050
All we found was that dilapidated pirate ship.

1635
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,150
Maybe that ship is the treasure.

1636
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:05,450
Maybe the map left behind by Anne Bonny wasn't a treasure map.

1637
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:10,950
It was a message for Mary Read, who was in prison back then.

1638
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:12,850
A message?

1639
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:17,450
I'm here! I will always be here waiting for you!

1640
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:18,550
Shinichi.

1641
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:19,950
Just kidding.

1642
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:21,350
Sonoko!

1643
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:27,150
How can you be so sure about that, you little brat?

1644
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:30,750
No... Maybe what he said was true.

1645
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:34,150
Maybe Anne built that ship

1646
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:37,850
for Mary, in preparation for the day

1647
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:41,450
when Mary escaped from the prison
and conquer the seven seas with her again.

1648
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,950
That's why she built that ship.

1649
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:48,850
But... She never thought Mary would fall ill in prison,

1650
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:50,350
and died that way.

1651
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:54,750
Anne waited for her until the day she died.

1652
01:39:55,950 --> 01:39:59,850
And then, the ship was left behind in
that coffin-like cave under the sea,

1653
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:05,250
waiting for the day when it would sail to the sea again.

1654
01:40:05,950 --> 01:40:07,550
And today, three hundred years later,

1655
01:40:07,850 --> 01:40:10,750
it made its first and last voyage,

1656
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:13,750
carrying all of you to the surface.

1657
01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:18,350
After that, it vanished into the sea,
following in its master's footsteps.

1658
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:22,750
I guess I said something I shouldn't have.

1659
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:23,950
So, just forget it.

1660
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:33,450
Since it happened 300 years ago, nobody will know the truth.

1661
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:38,050
No, it's true that Anne had been waiting for Mary.

1662
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:38,850
Uncle Mouri.

1663
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:43,050
The proof is below the skull of the pirate flag.

1664
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:52,150
There are Anne and Mary's pistol and cutlass on it.

1665
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:51,750
Well...

1666
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:54,450
Ran-nee-chan, well...

1667
01:44:55,150 --> 01:45:00,050
Why did you know I didn't have an oxygen tank back there?

1668
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:05,850
Because you're a lot like... that guy.

1669
01:45:08,050 --> 01:45:09,950
I remember when we were in eighth grade,

1670
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:14,450
there was a sudden rainstorm on our way home from school.

1671
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:23,450
Geez!

1672
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:25,950
Here, take it.

1673
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:30,350
You need to hurry back home, right?

1674
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:32,750
Yeah, thanks.

1675
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:34,450
What about you, Shinichi?

1676
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:37,250
I'm a detective, you idiot!

1677
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:40,250
I knew this would happen.

1678
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:43,950
So I brought an extra umbrella.

1679
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:45,150
You did?

1680
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:48,350
That's great! I have a date with my mom.

1681
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,650
I'll borrow this, then.

1682
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:51,250
I'll give it back to you tomorrow!

1683
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:51,850
Okay.

1684
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:57,050
But Shinichi didn't bring an extra umbrella.

1685
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:01,150
He walked home soaking wet, and ended up getting a cold.

1686
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:06,350
Right. That's why I said you're just like him at that time.

1687
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:11,350
You looked just like that stubborn big idiot.

1688
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:16,950
Well, so sorry for being such an idiot.
