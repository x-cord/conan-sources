1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Love is eternal, labyrinths are mysterious.

2
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,940
Saturday nights are for mystery.

3
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,640
The urban legend that everyone is concerned about.

4
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,040
Women with long hair, beware.

5
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,640
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,540
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,240
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

8
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,760
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 1)".

9
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,260
What's up, Mister?

10
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,160
Are you looking for something?

11
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,560
Hey, hey.

12
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,460
Wait up.

13
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,960
You don't need to run from me.

14
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,160
Hey, Ran. Do you know?

15
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,560
About Hammer man?

16
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,660
I do! I do!

17
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,660
I saw it on the morning news.

18
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,260
I hear he appeared in a park near here last night!

19
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,860
Yep, he's said to be tall and over 180 centimeters.

20
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,060
And his targets

21
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,160
all seem to be women with long hair in all four cases.

22
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,260
Yes, just like you, Ran.

23
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,860
Stop it, Sonoko!

24
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,360
Well, but you would counterattack the Hammer man

25
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,660
with your Karate that you excel in though, Ran!

26
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,160
You can never tell

27
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,760
if he attacks out of the blue in the dark.

28
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,860
Really.

29
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,260
He's a real enemy of women!

30
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,660
I'm sure the police will arrest him in time.

31
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,060
Talk of the devil,

32
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,860
there's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato.

33
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,960
Right.

34
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,460
Let's go ask them about

35
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,860
how far they've investigated on the Hammer man!

36
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,960
Hold it!

37
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,660
I...

38
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,960
I couldn't hear you very well.

39
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,260
Then, let me say it again.

40
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,760
Kiss me.

41
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,160
Right now. A very passionate one.

42
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
What? Wait.

43
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,460
Come on, quickly!

44
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,060
Stop dilly-dallying.

45
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
Yes!

46
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,660
Then...

47
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,460
excuse me.

48
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,760
Stake out?

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,560
Right?

50
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,360
You idiot! How dare you intrude on them!

51
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
The best was just about to come and yet!

52
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,560
But Officer Sato and Takagi were

53
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,860
glaring at that condo for quite some time with scary looks on their faces.

54
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,960
After taking a good look,

55
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,760
I saw the figure of a person from the room on the third floor of that condo

56
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,560
through the curtains,

57
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,160
then, I saw Officer Sato suddenly put her arm

58
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,360
around Officer Takagi's neck,

59
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,760
so I thought that you suddenly pretended to be lovers

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,260
so that no one would notice that you were staking out.

61
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,960
-Am I wrong? -That's right!

62
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,560
Amazing, you figured it out!

63
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,260
So... so that's what it was.

64
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,960
What did you think it was?

65
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
Nothing.

66
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,160
If you were staking out, the more I'm sorry

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,760
for Conan intruding on you.

68
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,260
No problem at all.

69
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,060
He rather, helped us.

70
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,360
Helped you?

71
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,260
Because it's hard to believe that we're staking out accompanied by

72
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,560
girl high school students and an elementary school child, right?

73
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,660
That goes for Hammer man too.

74
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,160
Hammer man?

75
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,860
Didn't you see it on the news?

76
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,660
That Hammer man was witnessed somewhere near here last night.

77
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,860
Oh, yes.

78
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,360
On TV this morning.

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,260
The fact is that witness...

80
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,260
went after Hammer man after seeing him.

81
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,060
And he saw Hammer man goes into this condo.

82
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,760
We got a report of this and came here right away, you see.

83
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,860
We checked each room

84
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,560
and found that almost all the residents have an alibi.

85
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,960
And the only room with someone although apparently inside,

86
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,460
that we got no answer from, despite ringing the doorbell

87
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,760
was the room in the center on the third floor over there!

88
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,460
Then, why don't you just raid the room

89
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,260
after getting the spare key from the landlord?

90
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,660
We can't, we don't have a warrant.

91
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,760
But is the person in the room

92
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
really the Hammer man?

93
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,660
Maybe he just imitated the Hammer man and...

94
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,760
He's no imitator.

95
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,760
That man was called by the witness and...

96
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,260
What's up, Mister?

97
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,060
Are you looking for something?

98
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,960
He forgot the blood-smeared hammer

99
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
when he rushed to flee.

100
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,760
The same hammer that also had

101
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,460
the blood of the victims of the three previous cases too!

102
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,860
But it's amazing how that eye-witness caught up with the culprit.

103
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,360
Yeah, being that the Hammer man is said

104
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,660
to run 100 meters in 11 seconds.

105
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,660
That's just urban legend!

106
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,460
I've heard that he's actually not that fast.

107
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,860
Because after all,

108
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,160
that man is said to have been able to pursue the Hammer man

109
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,060
despite being drunk

110
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,560
But if you know where his room is,

111
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,860
you can also tell who lives there, right?

112
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,260
The thing is,

113
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,760
the person who lives in that room

114
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,160
is a backpacker who is currently travelling abroad.

115
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,060
The parents of the resident of that room said on the phone

116
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,960
that their son would be lending the room to a friend of his for a while.

117
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,060
You don't know who that man is?

118
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,360
Well, according to his next-door neighbor,

119
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,460
he seems to have been living there together with his girlfriend previously,

120
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,560
but it seems that his girlfriend recently hasn't been coming around,

121
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,460
and the only time he is seen going out is at night.

122
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,260
He seems to always be wearing a cap or hood.

123
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,060
It seems he doesn't clearly remember what the man looks like though.

124
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,560
Officer Sato and Takagi.

125
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Officer Chiba.

126
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,860
What? You used to go to that room?

127
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,060
Who are they?

128
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Well, we were staking the entrance of the condo from some distance

129
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,460
and saw these three go into and come out of the room in question.

130
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,760
They went in one after the other at ten-minute intervals.

131
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,860
You already told Inspector Megure about them, didn't you?

132
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Yes, Ma'am.

133
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,360
And what were the three doing in the room?

134
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,460
Doing what?

135
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,360
I just went to pick up the package that I was told to come

136
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,360
and get on the phone.

137
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,060
I came to pick up a package

138
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,960
that I was told to come get by motorbike too.

139
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,660
I came to deliver pizza.

140
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,960
Then, did all three of you see the resident of the room?

141
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,960
No, I didn't see him.

142
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,060
There was a piece of paper posted below the entrance.

143
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,960
It said that he was in bed with a cold,

144
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,060
so to just come in and take the cardboard box that was on the table.

145
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,860
The voucher was written

146
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,660
and the money was in an envelope on the box.

147
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,760
I see. What about you?

148
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,060
I didn't see him either.

149
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
Instructions for what I should do

150
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,060
was also written on the paper by the entrance.

151
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,860
It said that I was to take the bag that is on the table.

152
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,260
I got the address where I was to deliver the item

153
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,860
at the time he gave us a call.

154
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,660
The pizza delivery was also written on that paper.

155
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,960
It said the payment for the pizza

156
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,860
is inside the envelope on the table, so to take it.

157
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,660
And to leave the pizza on the table.

158
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,260
I'm pretty sure that's what was written.

159
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,760
In bed with a cold?

160
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,260
Yeah, the voice I heard when he called was hoarse.

161
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,560
Same here.

162
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,060
Me too.

163
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,860
But I wonder why he called people one after the other to his room.

164
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,360
There were two others besides you

165
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,060
who were staking the entrance, weren't there?

166
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,660
Yes, the other two officers

167
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,160
went to stop the courier and the motorbike courier.

168
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,960
I stopped the pizza delivery man who arrived last.

169
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,960
You mean that there are no officers watching the entrance now?

170
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,860
Officer Chiba! Take care of them, will you?

171
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,160
Okay.

172
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,360
The more people he calls over to the room,

173
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,960
each time the police has no choice but to stop the person

174
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,160
and ask him what he came to the condo for!

175
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Moreover, if the officer who goes after the person

176
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,060
is the one who actually saw that person, it would be perfect!

177
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,260
He schemed to flee

178
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,960
while he used his strategy to decrease the number of officers

179
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,060
who were staking out the condo!

180
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,460
A memo in front of the door.

181
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,660
The pizza is untouched.

182
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,560
He ordered the pizza in order to flee after all.

183
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,660
Officer Sato.

184
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,160
Right after Officer Chiba went after the pizza delivery man to stop him,

185
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,060
the officer that went to stop

186
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,360
the first delivery person that came, also returned,

187
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,460
and took over watching in Officer Chiba's place,

188
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,860
but says that no one left the room.

189
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,060
It can't be.

190
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,860
Then, it means that Hammer man is still inside the room.

191
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,160
Could it be that he's waiting to ambush us?

192
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,460
No.

193
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,260
I don't think he had any intention

194
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,960
to ambush anybody.

195
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,860
Suicide?

196
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,560
It seems that he's still breathing, though.

197
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,360
Officer Takagi, get an ambulance!

198
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,560
Yes!

199
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,960
I see.

200
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,760
He had prepared a coat and hat

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,460
so that he could flee,

202
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,860
but after figuring that he couldn't possibly flee,

203
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,260
he decided to kill himself.

204
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,560
But before he could complete what he set off to do,

205
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,060
the rope came off

206
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,960
and he fell to the floor passed out.

207
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,660
I don't think he committed suicide.

208
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,460
See, look at his neck.

209
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,160
There's practically no trace of the rope around his neck.

210
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
You... you're right.

211
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Besides, his hat.

212
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,760
I don't think that a person who has his mind set on committing suicide

213
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
would wear a hat

214
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,460
that would get in the way of putting the rope around his neck.

215
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,860
Then, why the hat?

216
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,660
This... this is...

217
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,060
Just what does this mean?

218
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,960
Hammer man was struck

219
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,360
by one of the three people who came to this room!

220
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,294
Officer Chiba?

221
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:10,594
Just a while ago, there were three people

222
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:13,594
who went in and out of Hammer man's room, weren't there?

223
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:14,694
Yes.

224
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:17,394
Will you please bring those three here?

225
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:19,494
I have something I want to ask them.

226
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:23,494
But since all three of them seemed busy,

227
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:27,194
and asked to be interrogated after work,

228
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:29,494
I let them go just a while ago.

229
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,694
What?

230
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:34,394
Hey, hey.

231
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:39,394
Then, what you are saying is

232
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:42,494
while you were staking out Hammer man's room,

233
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:45,594
three people went in and out of the room.

234
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:48,794
You thought that Hammer man summoned these three people

235
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:51,494
to use them as a strategy to help Hammer man flee,

236
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,594
and busted into this room,

237
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,894
but you ended up finding Hammer man on the floor

238
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,394
after being struck by someone,

239
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:59,994
unconscious and in critical condition.

240
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,694
Judging from the circumstances,

241
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,994
the one who struck him has to be one of the three.

242
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:08,194
But since you never imagined this to be happening,

243
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:12,294
you very politely let the three go home.

244
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:14,294
Am I correct?

245
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:16,094
-Yes. -Yes.

246
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:18,694
-Well... -You...

247
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,694
idiots!

248
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:24,194
Just how many years have you been working as police detectives?

249
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:28,294
We have no word of apology for our carelessness...

250
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:32,694
And? What were the characters of the three people?

251
00:15:32,694 --> 00:15:35,694
Yes. Well...

252
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:37,594
They were a courier,

253
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:38,994
a motorbike delivery person,

254
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:40,794
and a pizza delivery man.

255
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:42,594
Conan?

256
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:45,794
Well, we just happened to run into him.

257
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,294
I'm pretty sure that

258
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:52,494
the courier was a tall man who was more than 180 centimeters.

259
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,994
The motorbike person was

260
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,694
a woman, a small person less than 160 centimeters.

261
00:15:57,694 --> 00:15:59,694
And the pizza delivery man

262
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:02,894
was a thin person about 170 centimeters tall.

263
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:06,894
Conan is a lot more dependable than all of you.

264
00:16:06,894 --> 00:16:09,594
Like always.

265
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,594
Right?

266
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:15,594
But why on earth did the culprit strike Hammer man?

267
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:16,794
It's most likely

268
00:16:16,794 --> 00:16:19,894
that a person connected to one of the victims of the four assault cases

269
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:22,494
committed by Hammer man

270
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,994
held a grudge against him and did it.

271
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:27,194
Although no one has died yet,

272
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:30,594
all four victims were inflicted serious injuries.

273
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:31,894
In other words,

274
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:33,894
the culprit found out through the news

275
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,594
that an incident occurred in this vicinity,

276
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,794
and set his target on this condo where he witnessed officers

277
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:39,894
that seemed to be staking out,

278
00:16:39,894 --> 00:16:41,494
disguised himself as someone

279
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:44,094
who wouldn't be suspected of going in and out of the room,

280
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:45,894
and struck Hammer man.

281
00:16:45,894 --> 00:16:47,894
That's the story.

282
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:51,594
But why'd you let them go without even asking for their names?

283
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,694
Oh, well...

284
00:16:53,694 --> 00:16:56,394
because all three said that they left invoices in the room,

285
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:58,494
with their names as well as their company names on them,

286
00:16:58,494 --> 00:17:00,394
if they needed to be contacted.

287
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,894
The only invoice found was that of the pizza shop.

288
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:04,594
What? No joke.

289
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:06,994
Hey, Chiba.

290
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,894
But we have the invoice from the pizza shop,

291
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:13,594
so we could

292
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:16,694
call the shop and find out if he's the culprit or not.

293
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:22,294
Huh? He hasn't returned?

294
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:23,494
You mean the person who went out to make the delivery

295
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:25,194
hasn't come back yet?

296
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:28,694
No, he left about 40 minutes ago

297
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:32,194
after receiving a phone order from that condo.

298
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:35,294
It's already about time that he should be back.

299
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:38,194
Did something happen to our part-time worker, officer?

300
00:17:38,194 --> 00:17:39,994
Oh, no.

301
00:17:39,994 --> 00:17:42,594
If so, it could be that

302
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,494
the culprit pretended to be the resident of the room,

303
00:17:45,494 --> 00:17:47,794
and placed an order for pizza delivery,

304
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:51,294
kidnapped the delivery person who came along,

305
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:52,994
took the clothes off the delivery man

306
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:54,794
and in turn disguised himself as the delivery man

307
00:17:54,794 --> 00:17:58,394
and broke into this room?

308
00:17:58,394 --> 00:18:00,194
If so,

309
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:03,594
did the courier and motorbike delivery just happen to come by?

310
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:06,394
It could've been camouflage.

311
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:09,694
Just the pizza delivery man coming would be too conspicuous.

312
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:10,794
Besides, all three said

313
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:14,894
that the voice of the man on the line was hoarse.

314
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,894
It could be that the culprit did so deliberately

315
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:19,294
because he didn't want his voice to be identified.

316
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:21,894
The pizza delivery man who arrived there last

317
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:24,294
could've crumpled the invoices of the courier and the motorbike delivery

318
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:25,894
that came after him.

319
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:29,094
But isn't it strange?

320
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:32,894
Because when the first courier came,

321
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,494
there was a note in front of the door that said,

322
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:40,294
"I'm in bed with a cold, so go ahead and do what you have to".

323
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:41,694
So, he went ahead into the room, just as was written

324
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:44,194
and took the parcel with him, right?

325
00:18:44,194 --> 00:18:46,994
If the pizza delivery man came last,

326
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,894
I don't think he could've put the note there.

327
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,294
True,

328
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:52,294
the only one who could've put it there,

329
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:55,094
would've been the courier who got there first.

330
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:58,194
In other words, the culprit didn't come to get the parcel,

331
00:18:58,194 --> 00:18:59,794
but rather, feigned to have come to make a delivery,

332
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:01,994
forced himself into the room,

333
00:19:01,994 --> 00:19:04,394
knocked Hammer man down,

334
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,894
and when leaving the room,

335
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,894
left that note behind to lure the motorbike delivery person

336
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:11,694
and pizza delivery man into the room.

337
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,894
And set it up so that he alone wouldn't be suspected.

338
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,794
But if so, the invoice of the motorbike person

339
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:20,094
should've been found in the room.

340
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,594
The ones who can hide the invoices of the courier

341
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,494
and the motorbike delivery person

342
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:28,994
are either the motorbike delivery person or the pizza delivery man, so...

343
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:31,994
But if the pizza delivery man is the culprit,

344
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:34,994
why did he leave his own invoice behind?

345
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,994
The one who can get rid of the invoice for the pizza that came last

346
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:39,694
is the man who delivered the pizza,

347
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:42,294
so maybe he deliberately left it behind.

348
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,694
I see.

349
00:19:43,694 --> 00:19:47,694
Which of the three is the culprit?

350
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:53,194
At any rate,

351
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:56,494
let's leave looking for the three to the other officers,

352
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,794
and investigate this room!

353
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:05,394
You haven't found any definite evidence yet that Hammer man

354
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:06,994
is really a resident of this room, have you?

355
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:09,094
True.

356
00:20:09,094 --> 00:20:12,694
Okay! Search each nook and cranny!

357
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,094
-Yes, Sir! -Yes, Sir!

358
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,394
Say, Officer Takagi.

359
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:24,694
-Did you find anything? -No.

360
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:27,094
Not anything worth mentioning.

361
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:31,894
Only that this toilet and bathtub were used very cleanly.

362
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:33,594
Don't you think it's too clean?

363
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:37,294
Because, see, take a look.

364
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:40,394
The dining room is quite messy,

365
00:20:40,394 --> 00:20:43,794
and yet the toilet and bathtub being spic-and-span is strange.

366
00:20:43,794 --> 00:20:47,794
Besides, the electric shaver that is on the washbasin...

367
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,894
Electric shaver?

368
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:53,894
Although it's the chargeable kind, it's not plugged in.

369
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:56,794
It's strange that although there is a shampoo bottle, soap and toothpaste,

370
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:59,794
there is no toothbrush.

371
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,694
True.

372
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,294
Something's really not right.

373
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:06,794
Something's really strange after all!

374
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:10,194
Because the drain of the bathtub...

375
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:13,894
There is no hair or anything else stuck inside!

376
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:14,994
No way!

377
00:21:14,994 --> 00:21:16,194
Really?

378
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:30,894
I... I'm sorry.

379
00:21:30,894 --> 00:21:33,194
I seemed to have tripped.

380
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,794
Oh, no.

381
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,194
Excuse me.

382
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:47,294
The drain, was it?

383
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:48,494
Let's see.

384
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:53,994
It's strange after all.

385
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:56,894
Why has only the bathroom been cleaned thoroughly?

386
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:03,494
Kiss me.

387
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:07,394
Right now. A very passionate one.

388
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:08,794
Come on, quickly!

389
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,294
Stop dilly-dallying.

390
00:22:13,794 --> 00:22:14,894
Inspector Megure!

391
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,694
We found gloves with blood on them!

392
00:22:20,994 --> 00:22:22,194
Where'd you find it?

393
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:23,694
Over here!

394
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:26,594
When we checked inside the dryer and washing machine,

395
00:22:26,594 --> 00:22:30,194
we found these gloves among the laundry.

396
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:36,194
Is the man who was found lying on the floor of this room Hammer man?

397
00:22:36,194 --> 00:22:40,594
And is one of the three people who came to this room,

398
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:43,494
the one who attacked Hammer man?

399
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,894
"Next Episode" -Chiba, you staked out with Officer Sato

400
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,894
in the past, didn't you?

401
00:24:09,894 --> 00:24:13,794
I could never forget that soft touch.

402
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:16,194
What?

403
00:24:16,194 --> 00:24:18,394
He wasn't here to begin with.

404
00:24:18,394 --> 00:24:20,294
The man called Hammer man.

405
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,394
Sonoko?

406
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:26,494
That queer dance...

407
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:30,194
We were dancing around.

408
00:24:30,194 --> 00:24:31,594
Next Conan,

409
00:24:31,594 --> 00:24:35,594
"The Truth of the Urban Legend (Part 2)".

410
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:53,294
Next Conan's Hint:

411
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:55,594
"Shift pad".

412
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:56,994
This time for sure, I'm going to make it with Ms. Sato.

413
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:58,294
Please don't get in my way, okay, Conan?

414
00:24:58,294 --> 00:25:00,494
I wonder about that.
