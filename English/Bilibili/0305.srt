1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,240
Love and hate are brought together.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,040
Through both reasoning and suspense.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,840
Today, we're on the set of a drama.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,840
The members of the cast are human, too!

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,440
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,340
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,440
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:47,228
Good evening, everyone.

9
00:01:47,228 --> 00:01:50,228
I am Detective Kogoro Mouri.

10
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:54,228
The stage for today is this remote western style building.

11
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:59,428
A mystery entangled with love and hate.

12
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:04,028
The focal point of this case is "colour".

13
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:06,128
When people go shopping,

14
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:11,128
they tend to unconsciously select the colour they like...

15
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:16,128
Even at the scene of a crime.

16
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:19,428
Let's meet again at the end of the show.

17
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:21,628
This was Kogoro Mouri.

18
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,928
Okay, cut!

19
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:30,728
Fantastic! Mr. Mouri, you were just great.

20
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:36,028
Dad, you were really awesome.

21
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,428
Oh, really?

22
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:40,828
You could've cut out that wink at the end of the scene, though.

23
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:48,328
"Invisible Suspect (Part 1)"

24
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:54,828
Well, thank you very much. You were really a great help!

25
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:58,628
The popular actor who always does the opening prologue for this drama

26
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:01,028
caught a nasty cold.

27
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:02,928
You don't have to use me just as a pinch-hitter,

28
00:03:02,928 --> 00:03:05,228
do feel free to call on me anytime!

29
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,328
If it's okay with you, I don't mind acting

30
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:10,128
in this detective drama as a special guest or something either.

31
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,528
Well, not really.

32
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:13,728
That's impossible, Mr. Detective.

33
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,428
Because in this story...

34
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:21,928
There are only the widowed mistress, her daughter the shrew,

35
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,728
their decrepit butler...

36
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:29,328
"Yoshiki Kazami (28)" -and aside from the daughter's murdered husband

37
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:32,828
and my role as a detective, there are only these five characters.

38
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:36,828
Hey, what's with that shrew bit?

39
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,228
"Kasumi Namihara (26)" -I'm supposed to be a character

40
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:40,428
that slightly like flashy things. That's about all, isn't it?

41
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,828
The character turns out a shrew because you're the one playing the role.

42
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,628
What did you just say?

43
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:46,928
By the way, Kazami,

44
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:49,328
"Akira Nagumo (60)" -I didn't like you remark, "decrepit" either.

45
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,628
I just turned 60.

46
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:54,328
I wasn't referring to your age.

47
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:57,328
I meant that your acting is decrepit.

48
00:03:57,328 --> 00:03:58,928
What?

49
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,428
I hear that you were a great actor some time in the past, though.

50
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:04,328
Now, now.

51
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,228
Cool it, Dad.

52
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:10,228
"Nobuharu Nagumo (31)" -Let's not quarrel just before shooting the drama.

53
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,828
Mr. Kazami, please calm down.

54
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,728
Ms. Ujo sure is late, though.

55
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:21,228
Are you referring to that Ms. Ujo...

56
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:25,028
The one who used to be the number one comforting actress, Ruri Ujo?

57
00:04:25,028 --> 00:04:27,628
Huh? Yes.

58
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:30,728
You mean, I get to see Ms. Ujo in person?

59
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,928
Huh? Get to see her in person?

60
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:36,628
She's the one who named you to substitute to do the opening prologue.

61
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:37,728
What?

62
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:41,628
I don't know if she's some former healer type actress...

63
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:47,428
I sure wouldn't want to be healed by an old maid like her.

64
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:50,728
Oh, my. I wouldn't want that either.

65
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:54,128
You're no more than a failure of an idol kid

66
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,328
"Ruri Ujo (37)" -who smells like piss.

67
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:02,128
You're really her!

68
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:05,828
You're even prettier than on TV!

69
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:08,128
Well, hello.

70
00:05:08,128 --> 00:05:10,528
How do you do? I'm Kogoro Mouri.

71
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,028
I hear that you're the one who named me to take this job?

72
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:15,228
I don't think it's the fist time we're meeting, is it?

73
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:18,528
Really? Have we met somewhere before?

74
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,728
Oh, come on.

75
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,028
Doesn't this mole under my lips remind you either?

76
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:25,928
Kogoro!

77
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,728
Mole?

78
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:37,528
Ruri Doigaki?

79
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:39,328
Bull's eye!

80
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:42,928
Rurippe? Long time no see!

81
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,028
You can say that again!

82
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:45,728
We haven't seen each other since junior high school!

83
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:49,528
Huh? Don't tell me they know each other?

84
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:50,728
No kidding.

85
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:53,928
I had no idea whatsoever!

86
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,628
Your last name is different, too.

87
00:05:55,628 --> 00:05:59,928
And besides, back then you were wearing glasses with super thick lens.

88
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:02,828
Well? I turned out to be pretty foxy, don't you think?

89
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:04,528
You did, you sure did.

90
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:08,128
But why haven't you gotten married yet?

91
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:09,228
Being as beautiful as you are,

92
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:11,628
I'm sure you've got a multitude of guys to pick from.

93
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:12,928
Don't be silly.

94
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:16,428
It's because one-sidedly in love with you all these years, why else?

95
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:21,628
Please stop joking with him.

96
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,128
Because he's bound to take you seriously.

97
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:25,628
Oh, my. Who is she?

98
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:29,028
She is just some girl who lives in the neighborhood.

99
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,928
I am his daughter, Ran!

100
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:33,528
Oh, my. Then, she's Eri's daughter?

101
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,628
Do you know my mother?

102
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:38,028
Yes.

103
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:41,528
I was with her all the way from kindergarten to junior high school.

104
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:43,928
But it still is sure a mystery.

105
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:48,128
As to why Eri, the smartest girl in school

106
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:51,028
and Kogoro, the most mischievous boy

107
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:53,028
fell so lovey-dovey in love as they did

108
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,528
and finally ended up marrying each other.

109
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,528
Very true.

110
00:06:57,528 --> 00:07:00,828
You mean they were in love with each other for that long?

111
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:02,728
Hey...

112
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:04,228
Yes!

113
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:07,528
Eri who always kept her cool would really get upset

114
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,028
and go all out when her counterpart was Kogoro!

115
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:14,228
So, we all took it to be a lover's quarrel.

116
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:15,728
And they were constantly being teased.

117
00:07:17,128 --> 00:07:19,528
They're still quarreling to this day.

118
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:21,128
What a surprise though.

119
00:07:21,128 --> 00:07:24,928
That the Kogoro that I used to know is now a renown detective.

120
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:33,028
Okay, let's start camera rehearsal for scene 134!

121
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:35,428
Ready, start!

122
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:41,728
The corpse in front of the fireplace is covered with a gray tablecloth.

123
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:46,728
And the victim's black coat is hanging on over the chair of that table.

124
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:50,128
Near the corpse, on the floor

125
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:52,928
is the murder weapon,

126
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:55,428
a golf club with a white head cover on it.

127
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:01,128
I guess we can say that the case has already been solved.

128
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,628
Don't keep us in suspense, just spit it out!

129
00:08:03,628 --> 00:08:05,928
Come on, tell us who it is.

130
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:09,228
Who on earth is the killer?

131
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:13,928
I was actually supposed to explain what went on, but...

132
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,128
Hey.

133
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,028
There's no such dialogue in the script.

134
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,028
Tonight, Detective Mouri...

135
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:22,128
Let's have you solve the case.

136
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,428
Huh?

137
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:27,928
First, tell us why the killer covered the corpse with a tablecloth.

138
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:30,428
That's probably because...

139
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:35,628
Because the killer loved the victim.

140
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,428
That's why the killer didn't want to leave the corpse there

141
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,328
without doing anything about it.

142
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,528
But the coat was on the chair, you know.

143
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:45,028
Why did the killer go to the trouble of using the tablecloth?

144
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:47,028
The reason is...

145
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:52,128
because the gray tablecloth seemed to be warmer than the black coat.

146
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,128
Huh?

147
00:08:53,128 --> 00:08:57,328
Hey, don't tell me that you're serious about what you just said.

148
00:08:58,428 --> 00:08:59,628
Give me a break.

149
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:02,928
You were dropping hints in the opening prologue yourself.

150
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:06,928
Why does gray seem warmer than black?

151
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:09,228
Huh? Don't you think so?

152
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:13,728
Your friend's not all that great either, is he?

153
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:16,428
Dad, talk seriously.

154
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:19,528
Come on. Get serious, Kogoro!

155
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:23,028
No way! This is as far as this old man goes.

156
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:30,028
Gosh.

157
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,628
He has appeared!

158
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:33,828
The Sleeping Kogoro!

159
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,728
Excuse me.

160
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,928
Since the deduction was so simple,

161
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,528
I sort of felt like playing a bit of a prank.

162
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:40,828
What?

163
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:42,828
It wasn't that the killer

164
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:45,728
wanted to cover the corpse with the gray tablecloth,

165
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:49,128
the killer didn't want to cover the corpse with the black coat.

166
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:52,328
Because the killer likes the colour black.

167
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:56,828
It's most likely that the killer subconsciously thought

168
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:59,228
that using a favorite colour at the scene of the murder

169
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,728
may bring on suspicion.

170
00:10:02,528 --> 00:10:05,028
See, please take a good look at the golf bag

171
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,628
that is left standing against the fireplace.

172
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:13,328
Only the club with the black head cover is sticking out, right?

173
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,628
This is because the killer was going to use the club with the black cover

174
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,228
as the murder weapon,

175
00:10:17,228 --> 00:10:18,928
but decided against it while pulling it out.

176
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:21,028
It's an evidence that the killer decided to use the white ones instead.

177
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,728
Furthermore, taking into consideration that the furniture in this room

178
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,928
as well as the curtains are all coordinated with the colour black,

179
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:28,728
shows that the owner of this house

180
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,428
that is the killer is wearing a black dress.

181
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:35,128
Rurippe, it's the role you're playing,

182
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,128
who is the mistress of this house.

183
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:42,528
Don't you agree?

184
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:48,928
Amazing! Just as expected of the Sleeping Kogoro.

185
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,128
He hit the bull's eye.

186
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:57,428
Just as rumor has it, you didn't let us down, Kogoro.

187
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:02,228
Gosh. Why didn't you start off seriously to begin with?

188
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,328
The real thing is distinguished after all.

189
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,128
Corpses aren't supposed to move!

190
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:08,328
Hey!

191
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:12,328
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

192
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,528
Are you okay, Nobuharu?

193
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:17,928
Kasumi?

194
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,228
So, after that playwright, you're switching over to that guy?

195
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:23,228
Huh?

196
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:25,228
This was still supposed to be off the records, right?

197
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:28,828
Hey, you! Enough is enough!

198
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:32,828
Are you sure want to talk to me like that, old fart?

199
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:38,928
I know about you secretly seeing a young lover night after night.

200
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:39,928
What?

201
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:45,028
I'm not really sure who or where that lady is yet,

202
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:47,828
but I sort of have an idea.

203
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:50,728
I do have an idea.

204
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,428
Let me go!

205
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:00,428
What's with that look on your faces, you guys?

206
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,828
I could make this drama go down the drain

207
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:04,428
if you want it that way, you know?

208
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,328
What a bummer.

209
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,928
I'm going to go take a nap in the room until I feel more up to it,

210
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,328
so go ahead and film the scenes that I don't appear in.

211
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,608
What's with that guy?

212
00:12:29,608 --> 00:12:31,708
He's the oldest son of the owner of the newspaper agency

213
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,508
that is the main sponsor for this drama.

214
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:35,108
I see.

215
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:38,108
That's why he knows so much of what's going on behind the scenes.

216
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:39,408
Yes.

217
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:42,708
And to make things worse, his obnoxious character

218
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,708
seems to be getting high ratings among the viewers.

219
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,108
To be honest, I really don't want to act on a program

220
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:50,208
where he's the star of the show, but I have no choice.

221
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,808
Because my office says I should since the rating is high.

222
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:54,608
Well, it doesn't bother me much

223
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,008
now that I got to see you after so long, Kogoro.

224
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:02,308
Okay. Why don't we take a 30 minute break?

225
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:04,308
And start shooting again after refreshing our feelings a bit!

226
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:05,608
Yes, sir...

227
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:07,808
What?

228
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:10,208
Fighting over sauce and shoyu?

229
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,408
You mean Mom and Dad?

230
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:13,508
That's right.

231
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,108
They got into a great battle during home economics class

232
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:17,908
in elementary school over whether sauce or shoyu

233
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:19,508
should be used on sunny side up.

234
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,108
Eri insisted that sauce should be used

235
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,808
because sunny side up is a western style dish,

236
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:26,208
but Kogoro insisted that the Japanese should use shoyu.

237
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,708
It puzzles me even more.

238
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,008
So, why'd they get married?

239
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:36,508
But the order in which they ate what was made

240
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:38,608
was exactly the same,

241
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:40,808
so the entire class burst out laughing.

242
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:45,108
Next, they get into a fight saying, "Stop copying me!"

243
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:49,108
It's really hard to tell whether they get along or not.

244
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:51,708
Never mind about the past already.

245
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,408
No. Please tell me more about it!

246
00:13:54,408 --> 00:13:55,608
Hey.

247
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,708
Huh? What is it?

248
00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:07,108
Snow.

249
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:09,408
See, it's snowing.

250
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:15,008
They did say that it may snow today on the weather forecast.

251
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:18,408
Hey, why don't we all go outside and watch the snow?

252
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:22,208
But we've only got five minutes of break time left.

253
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,508
Who cares if it's only five minutes?

254
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:26,208
It's the first snowfall this year, you know!

255
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,408
I guess so.

256
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,008
Come on, let's hurry.

257
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,508
I love it when it snows after all.

258
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,108
Right, Conan?

259
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:42,108
What seems to be the matter?

260
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:44,608
I don't see Ruri around.

261
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,108
Huh?

262
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:47,908
Where's Ruri?

263
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:49,208
Huh?

264
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,408
I thought I came out together with her.

265
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:56,508
Rurippe?

266
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:57,708
Darn it!

267
00:15:02,808 --> 00:15:04,008
Rurippe?

268
00:15:04,908 --> 00:15:06,208
Rurippe?

269
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,508
Kogoro.

270
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:26,808
No good, his pupils are completely dilated.

271
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:28,608
He's already dead.

272
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,508
Ran, call the police.

273
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:33,808
Okay.

274
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,808
But who did it?

275
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,408
Who could've done something so ruthless like this?

276
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,408
Beats me.

277
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:43,708
He was the type to make enemies so...

278
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,608
But in cases like this

279
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:48,008
isn't the first one to be suspected

280
00:15:48,008 --> 00:15:49,208
is the one who first found the body?

281
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,408
Huh?

282
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,908
No, I didn't do it.

283
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,508
When I came to this room,

284
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,908
he was already smeared with blood!

285
00:15:57,908 --> 00:16:01,008
It's true. Please believe me, Kogoro.

286
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:02,608
Yes, I believe you.

287
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,108
We won't be fooled by your crying and all!

288
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,208
An actress' tears is one of her weapons.

289
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,108
Hey, Kasumi.

290
00:16:21,108 --> 00:16:22,608
But if things go as is,

291
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,108
we may also be suspected of homicide, you know?

292
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,208
Everything will be fine. We'll be okay.

293
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:33,008
The victim is Mr. Yoshiki Kazami, age 28.

294
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,408
The cause of death is loss of blood due to damage

295
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:36,708
to the carotid artery.

296
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:41,908
He was probably attacked while asleep on this sofa here

297
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,508
and slashed in the throat or something.

298
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:46,208
The estimated time of death

299
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,908
is between 7:50 pm when the victim came here to take a nap

300
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:54,308
to the time he was found dead at 8:20 pm.

301
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:55,808
A period of 30 minutes.

302
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:58,108
I think it was shorter.

303
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:03,708
Because when we were looking around this house

304
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,908
and came into this room on the way, he was snoring away and sleeping.

305
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:09,208
Hey, Conan!

306
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:13,108
That was just around 8:00 pm. Isn't that right, Ran?

307
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,508
Yes. Because Dad looked at his watch

308
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:19,108
saying that he was fast asleep in 10 minutes.

309
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:21,808
Ran and Conan!

310
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,408
Which means that...

311
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:27,708
Mr. Mouri!

312
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:30,908
So, you're here after all.

313
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:35,108
Thank you for looking after my younger brother the other day.

314
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:36,708
Oh, no.

315
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,208
That was really no big deal.

316
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,608
Kogoro, do you know him?

317
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:44,208
Yes.

318
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,808
How do you do?

319
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:49,108
I'm Inspector Yokomizo from the Shizuoka Prefectural Police.

320
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:51,808
I've finally got to meet you, Mrs. Mouri!

321
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,008
Huh?

322
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:56,008
Am I wrong?

323
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,108
No.

324
00:17:57,108 --> 00:18:00,808
Well, I guess you're wrong. But then again maybe not.

325
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:02,308
Wrong!

326
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,908
I'm only joking. It's a just a joke.

327
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:09,008
Huh? Don't tell me that you're...

328
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:11,808
Ruri Ujo, the actress?

329
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:13,808
Yes.

330
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:16,608
Huh? And you're...

331
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:19,608
You and you, too.

332
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:22,008
What's going on here?

333
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,608
Why are there so many actors and actresses here?

334
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:27,808
It's just as if you're shooting a drama or something here.

335
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:30,408
That's what we're doing here.

336
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,508
So, this is how it goes?

337
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:36,308
You're shooting a detective story here at this European style building

338
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:39,208
out in the rural side of Mountain Fuji

339
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:43,008
when a real homicide happened to occur.

340
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:46,408
So, this is indeed a case of the biter being bitten.

341
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:48,808
Well, I guess so.

342
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:51,408
And? In the 20 minutes after 8 pm,

343
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,908
when the murder is thought to have been committed,

344
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:56,608
the shooting was stopped so everyone could take a break.

345
00:18:56,608 --> 00:19:00,008
And all you staff members stayed in groups of more than two people,

346
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,908
so all of you have an alibi.

347
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:06,108
The ones without an alibi are Ms. Ruri Ujo, who found the corpse

348
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:08,008
and each of the actors and actresses who went back

349
00:19:08,008 --> 00:19:11,008
to their respective rooms to check the dialogue in the script.

350
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,208
Which is Ms. Kasumi Namihara.

351
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:15,308
Mr. Akira Nagumo,

352
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:17,808
and Mr. Nobuharu Nagumo,

353
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,208
the four of you.

354
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:22,508
Ms. Ujo.

355
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,408
Please explain how things were when you discovered the corpse.

356
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:26,508
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,408
Since we decided to take a break, Kogoro here...

358
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,308
No. Mr. Mouri and everybody else including myself

359
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:34,208
went looking around inside the building.

360
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,708
Then, we noticed that it began to snow.

361
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,108
So, we invited the staff to come along

362
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,408
and went outside to look at the snow.

363
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:44,208
Since the snow was so beautiful,

364
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,308
I wanted Mr. Kazami to take a look at it, too.

365
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:48,008
So, I came over to this room.

366
00:19:48,008 --> 00:19:49,708
Besides, he was sulky

367
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:52,008
after going through what he did during the shooting, too.

368
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:54,508
But when I opened the door,

369
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:56,808
he was lying on the floor smeared with blood.

370
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:01,608
I thought he was joking and shook him,

371
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:03,808
but he didn't answer.

372
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:07,608
That's when I finally realized that he was dead and screamed.

373
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,208
I see.

374
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,608
So, the three of you heard her scream and ran over here.

375
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:14,708
Yes.

376
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,108
That's right.

377
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:19,108
Okay. Will the four of you

378
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:22,308
go to the other room and go through a body check?

379
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,008
Huh? Why?

380
00:20:25,008 --> 00:20:27,308
We can't find it.

381
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,108
It isn't anywhere in this building.

382
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:33,608
We haven't found the approximately 10 centimeter long blade

383
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,108
that was used to slit Kazami's throat.

384
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,608
Inspector Yokomizo!

385
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:44,708
How about it?

386
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,508
Did you find the weapon?

387
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:50,608
Well, all four of them had nothing like that on them.

388
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,408
We also checked the staff's belongings,

389
00:20:52,408 --> 00:20:56,008
and the other rooms from one end to the other.

390
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:57,708
But things that could've been used as the murder weapon

391
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,508
were only the knife in the kitchen,

392
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,508
a small knife for cutting fruit,

393
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:05,108
and a cutter knife that was found in the tool box of the staff.

394
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:09,908
We found no luminol reaction from any of those things.

395
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:13,408
All the victim had on him

396
00:21:13,408 --> 00:21:16,508
was this pack of cigarettes, this lighter, and his wallet.

397
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,408
We're searching inside the drains

398
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:21,908
and around the building with a metal detector,

399
00:21:21,908 --> 00:21:24,108
but we haven't got any report that anything was found yet.

400
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:25,308
Darn it.

401
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,808
Even though we've already found the golf club and coat

402
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:31,308
that the killer might have used to commit the murder...

403
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:35,108
why can't we find the murder weapon?

404
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:37,108
Moreover, the glove and the coat

405
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,808
are props that are used when filming dramas,

406
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:41,208
but it seems that nobody was in the room

407
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,808
where these things were during break time.

408
00:21:44,408 --> 00:21:48,108
Which means that anybody could've taken it with considerable ease.

409
00:21:48,108 --> 00:21:51,108
And? Where are the four suspects now?

410
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:54,408
I have them waiting in the room together with Mr. Mouri.

411
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:00,408
If the killer is among them,

412
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:02,508
it would be impossible to get rid of the murder weapon

413
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:05,908
by taking it somewhere far away in such a short time.

414
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,608
And yet, why?

415
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:12,208
Why can't the murder weapon be found?

416
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:49,008
"Next Episode" -Something's not right.

417
00:23:49,008 --> 00:23:52,308
I can't figure out why Ruri suddenly invites everyone to go outside

418
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:54,608
after seeing the snow through the window.

419
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:58,308
Oh, no!

420
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:00,608
That brat!

421
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,208
He's roaming around the scene of the crime again.

422
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,608
Hey!

423
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,908
I see! I got it!

424
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:15,908
