1
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.440
The love story of two police officers.

2
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.740
The Youth Detective Squad plays a part.

3
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.440
And the case takes a surprising turn!

4
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.940
His name is Detective Conan!

7
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.625
Sorry...

8
00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:04.525
Officer Sato?

9
00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:06.525
What is it you want to talk to me about?

10
00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.025
What do I do?

11
00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:15.725
Officer Takagi, just get inside!

12
00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:17.225
Oh, okay!

13
00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:20.825
What it is? What in the world is it?

14
00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.525
I wonder if I did something wrong again?

15
00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:25.725
Officer Sato's birthday is in April.

16
00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:28.525
I kept her company at karaoke too.

17
00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.025
Don't tell me that...

18
00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:33.725
She's going to ask me to break up with her?

19
00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:35.125
Wait...

20
00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:36.225
No way.

21
00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:42.125
What?

22
00:02:45.925 --> 00:02:48.125
I got you! You fell for it.

23
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:49.325
What?

24
00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:58.125
How'd you like it?

25
00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.925
Just great, isn't it, Officer Takagi?

26
00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:01.325
This toy!

27
00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:07.725
I'm going to try it on Officer Yumi next!

28
00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:11.525
Officer Sato!

29
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:15.225
Don't tell me you brought me all the way here just to try that on me?

30
00:03:15.225 --> 00:03:16.625
Exactly.

31
00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.125
Is there anything wrong?

32
00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:20.825
We're finished work and ready to go home anyway.

33
00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:24.425
Come on.

34
00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:27.125
Or are you saying that

35
00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:30.525
I can't ask you to come with me unless I have something important to do?

36
00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:32.525
Police Sergeant Takagi?

37
00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:35.725
No.

38
00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:38.125
They sure are in love.

39
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:40.025
No. They're no way close to being in love yet...

40
00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:42.125
Well... They're probably going to make it soon.

41
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:43.725
No! Not for sometime yet.

42
00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.525
Stop it, will you, Officer Sato?

43
00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:55.225
"Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 1)"

44
00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:59.425
Request for dispatch from the Tottori Prefectural Police?

45
00:03:59.425 --> 00:04:00.525
Yeah.

46
00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:03.825
You know of them, don't you, Megure?

47
00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:06.925
The band of thieves that started raiding that area

48
00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:08.725
and are now stealing nationwide.

49
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.525
Okay. See you.

50
00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:17.425
A joint investigation headquarters was set up in Tottori

51
00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:20.725
and they're asking for people from the First Investigation Division here.

52
00:04:20.725 --> 00:04:22.225
But, Sergeant!

53
00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:24.325
Isn't it supposed to be taken care of by the Third Division?

54
00:04:24.325 --> 00:04:26.125
Have you forgotten, Megure?

55
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.325
They've also committed attempted murder in Tokyo too.

56
00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:31.825
Oh, that's right.

57
00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:33.425
Of course, they're sending one person from the third division

58
00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:35.525
but they'll also be sending one from the first division.

59
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.925
Who would you recommend?

60
00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:39.725
Well...

61
00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:42.625
Someone who's single, brilliant and has robust enough

62
00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:44.425
to tolerate the hard work in a different prefecture.

63
00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:47.225
If that person is familiar with the area it's even better.

64
00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:51.325
That's right.

65
00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:55.325
Hey, Megure! Wasn't his hometown somewhere in Tottori?

66
00:04:55.325 --> 00:04:56.525
Who?

67
00:04:56.525 --> 00:04:59.925
What? Who do you mean?

68
00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.625
Him. Takagi! Officer Takagi!

69
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.725
What? Takagi?

70
00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:09.725
Oh, no!

71
00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:13.725
I think he's a good candidate, don't you?

72
00:05:13.725 --> 00:05:15.825
Yes, I guess so.

73
00:05:15.825 --> 00:05:18.125
Although his appearance doesn't show it,

74
00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:21.025
he's pretty sharp and I hear he's solved a lot of cases too.

75
00:05:21.025 --> 00:05:22.425
Okay then, Sergeant.

76
00:05:22.425 --> 00:05:25.525
I'll notify him tomorrow morning.

77
00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.825
Thanks. That'll be a great help.

78
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:35.225
It's sad to think that he's going to go far away.

79
00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:39.025
Hide's really going abroad.

80
00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:41.125
We still don't know for sure, do we?

81
00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:44.625
England is the place where soccer originated, right?

82
00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:45.625
If you're a fan,

83
00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:48.625
wouldn't you like to see him play at the original location?

84
00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.625
That's true but...

85
00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:52.525
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

86
00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:55.225
I feel that it's a good idea to go abroad and get tough,

87
00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:56.525
more so, for the World Cup.

88
00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.025
That's right.

89
00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.825
The World Cup.

90
00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:04.525
The World Cup?

91
00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:05.825
It seems like it's stopped raining.

92
00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:07.725
Oh, true.

93
00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:09.125
I see.

94
00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:21.625
That man was heaving hard

95
00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:23.225
and he seemed to be having a hard time.

96
00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:26.725
Of course! Because he's jogging.

97
00:06:26.725 --> 00:06:30.025
Come on, we'd better hurry or we'll be late for school!

98
00:06:30.025 --> 00:06:31.025
She's right!

99
00:06:31.025 --> 00:06:32.525
Let's go!

100
00:06:36.825 --> 00:06:38.025
What?

101
00:06:38.025 --> 00:06:41.425
That's what I heard. And...

102
00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:42.725
Hey! Are you listening?

103
00:06:42.725 --> 00:06:44.825
Miwako?

104
00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:47.025
Oh. Yeah.

105
00:06:47.025 --> 00:06:49.025
Oh, no! I'm barely going to make it.

106
00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:50.925
Good morning!

107
00:06:59.225 --> 00:07:01.125
Sorry...

108
00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.125
Is there anything on my face?

109
00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:10.225
Officer Yumi?

110
00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:11.825
Officer Takagi.

111
00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:14.125
Yes?

112
00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:22.925
Goodbye...

113
00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:25.525
Wait...

114
00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:27.025
Just what do you mean?

115
00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:34.425
What?

116
00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:36.625
I'm going to be dispatched

117
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.825
to the joint investigation headquarters in Tottori?

118
00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:40.525
Maybe you got the wrong person.

119
00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:44.825
Stupid! You're the only Takagi here!

120
00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:46.325
Don't play dumb!

121
00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:50.325
According to Yumi, you should've gotten a call from Inspector Megure.

122
00:07:50.325 --> 00:07:52.325
What? Come to think of it,

123
00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:54.825
I did get a call from the inspector this morning.

124
00:07:54.825 --> 00:07:58.525
I was still drowsy, so I didn't really follow what he was saying.

125
00:07:58.525 --> 00:08:00.925
See. It's that phone call.

126
00:08:00.925 --> 00:08:02.325
What?

127
00:08:02.325 --> 00:08:06.625
But I get to come back after the case is solved anyway so...

128
00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:09.325
You don't understand anything, do you?

129
00:08:09.325 --> 00:08:10.825
The headquarters is pursuing the robbers

130
00:08:10.825 --> 00:08:13.525
that are committing the serial robberies nationwide, you know?

131
00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:17.125
In most cases like these, who knows how many incidents there are.

132
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.225
And besides, if there are several members involved,

133
00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:21.725
who knows when the case'll be solved.

134
00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:23.825
Well, things'll work out.

135
00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:26.625
With his ability...

136
00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:29.325
Three years will probably enough to solve the case.

137
00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:31.125
Three years...

138
00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:33.225
Three years?

139
00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:41.225
Three years. 1,095 days. 26,280 hours.

140
00:08:42.825 --> 00:08:45.325
The Heavens have not forsaken me.

141
00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.025
I'm happy for you!

142
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:48.625
The air is clean in Tottori

143
00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.825
and you can eat all you want of Matsuba crab!

144
00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:53.125
You can ride camels at the sand dunes of Tottori too!

145
00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:56.325
-No, I will not! -Officer Takagi.

146
00:08:56.325 --> 00:08:58.625
Officer Sato.

147
00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:05.825
Don't forget to send me 20th Century Japanese Pears, okay?

148
00:09:05.825 --> 00:09:07.525
They're my favorite.

149
00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:09.725
What?

150
00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:11.525
That's the word!

151
00:09:11.525 --> 00:09:13.125
That's my favorite.

152
00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.325
Matsuba Crab is our favorite.

153
00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:17.525
Don't forget the camels while you're at it, okay?

154
00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:19.925
What's with all this noise?

155
00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:22.525
We've got a case!

156
00:09:22.525 --> 00:09:23.625
The scene of the crime is

157
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:27.425
on the third floor of a skyscraper located on Beikacho Yonchome!

158
00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:29.425
A man was found stabbed to death.

159
00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:30.725
According to report by investigators,

160
00:09:30.725 --> 00:09:33.025
the one who found the corpse seems to be a woman.

161
00:09:34.225 --> 00:09:36.725
Sato and Takagi, go to the scene of the crime on the double!

162
00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:37.725
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

163
00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:40.825
And Megure you take care of giving orders at the scene.

164
00:09:40.825 --> 00:09:42.025
Oh, no, well...

165
00:09:42.025 --> 00:09:46.425
Please have Mr. Chosuke take care of things this time, Sergeant!

166
00:09:46.425 --> 00:09:47.525
Mr. Chosuke!

167
00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:48.625
Okay.

168
00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:51.925
On the double!

169
00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:52.925
Yes, sir!

170
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:55.125
Officer Chosuke!

171
00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:58.625
This is the first time I'm teaming with you, isn't it, Officer Chosuke?

172
00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:00.525
Yeah, let's get to work.

173
00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:01.525
Officer Takagi.

174
00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:02.925
Yes, sir!

175
00:10:02.925 --> 00:10:06.325
Mr. Chosuke is a veteran that's two years older than me.

176
00:10:06.325 --> 00:10:08.625
Learn a lot from him, will you?

177
00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.425
Yes, sir! Of course!

178
00:10:10.425 --> 00:10:11.725
And...

179
00:10:11.725 --> 00:10:14.825
This may be the last time he'll be teaming with you.

180
00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:15.925
What?

181
00:10:20.025 --> 00:10:22.125
Officer Takagi. Goodbye!

182
00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:25.325
Are you serious?

183
00:10:30.447 --> 00:10:34.147
Hide's press conference was from noon, right?

184
00:10:34.147 --> 00:10:35.647
Oh, no!

185
00:10:35.647 --> 00:10:37.847
We'd better hurry or we'll miss it!

186
00:10:37.847 --> 00:10:39.247
We'll make it!

187
00:10:39.247 --> 00:10:42.047
Hide's press conference will be the top news of today!

188
00:10:42.047 --> 00:10:44.847
It'll probably be aired several times all night.

189
00:10:44.847 --> 00:10:47.447
Something seems to have happened.

190
00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:49.847
Yeah.

191
00:10:50.947 --> 00:10:53.547
The name of the man that was stabbed is Mr. Hirotoshi Nakamoto,

192
00:10:53.547 --> 00:10:55.747
age 27, an office worker.

193
00:10:55.747 --> 00:10:59.047
The murder weapon is an 18 cm knife.

194
00:10:59.047 --> 00:11:00.647
The estimated time of death is

195
00:11:00.647 --> 00:11:03.847
between 7 am to 7:30 am today.

196
00:11:03.847 --> 00:11:10.747
You, his colleague at work, came here at 1 pm and found him dead.

197
00:11:10.747 --> 00:11:11.747
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:11.747 --> 00:11:14.247
I took a day off from work today

199
00:11:14.247 --> 00:11:17.847
and was supposed to go with him to reserve our wedding hall.

200
00:11:17.847 --> 00:11:20.447
How could something like this happen?

201
00:11:20.447 --> 00:11:21.847
And...

202
00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:25.147
Do you know of anyone who may have had a grudge against him?

203
00:11:25.147 --> 00:11:28.647
"Yui Shimura" -He was the type to make enemies.

204
00:11:28.647 --> 00:11:31.147
It seems the killer is an acquaintance of his.

205
00:11:31.147 --> 00:11:33.747
Yes, the door was locked.

206
00:11:33.747 --> 00:11:36.647
Then, will you pick out the person that you think

207
00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:39.447
may have had a grudge against him from the album?

208
00:11:39.447 --> 00:11:40.747
I'll go check the person out.

209
00:11:42.547 --> 00:11:44.747
Can you see something?

210
00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:47.547
It's Officer Takagi and Officer Sato!

211
00:11:47.547 --> 00:11:49.347
So take care of it, okay?

212
00:11:49.347 --> 00:11:51.147
Yes.

213
00:11:51.147 --> 00:11:52.847
Did something happen?

214
00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:54.847
I'll bet it's a homicide case?

215
00:11:54.847 --> 00:11:56.847
Yeah, well...

216
00:11:56.847 --> 00:12:01.447
Didn't it happen around a little after 7 am this morning?

217
00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:03.547
Officer Sato.

218
00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:05.147
How do you know about it?

219
00:12:05.147 --> 00:12:08.747
We saw a suspicious looking person on our way to school.

220
00:12:08.747 --> 00:12:10.847
On the street near this condominium!

221
00:12:10.847 --> 00:12:12.947
Come on, Conan!

222
00:12:12.947 --> 00:12:15.547
That man was just jogging and...

223
00:12:15.547 --> 00:12:18.047
Remember! Just before we passed that man,

224
00:12:18.047 --> 00:12:20.147
it stopped raining, right?

225
00:12:20.147 --> 00:12:23.747
Yes. It was a rain shower that lasted about 10 minutes.

226
00:12:23.747 --> 00:12:27.447
But that guy's clothes was hardly wet at all.

227
00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:29.047
Why do you think it wasn't wet?

228
00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:31.947
Maybe he was taking shelter from the rain somewhere?

229
00:12:31.947 --> 00:12:34.647
Because it started raining while he was jogging.

230
00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:38.147
And he started running again because it stopped raining!

231
00:12:38.147 --> 00:12:42.347
Idiot! If he rested 10 minutes, he wouldn't be heaving like that!

232
00:12:42.347 --> 00:12:46.547
In other words, he wasn't out of breath because he was jogging.

233
00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:52.547
But because he was hyper from having stabbed someone in a room near here.

234
00:12:52.547 --> 00:12:55.447
That's what you wanted to say, right, Sonny?

235
00:12:58.847 --> 00:13:01.447
Is that man here?

236
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.447
What?

237
00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:04.147
I think...

238
00:13:04.147 --> 00:13:05.847
This man!

239
00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:08.047
This man sort of looks like him!

240
00:13:08.047 --> 00:13:11.747
That man... He's Mr. Kato, a colleague of his at work!

241
00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:14.647
If I remember correctly, I heard that he was freeloading

242
00:13:14.647 --> 00:13:15.947
at his friend's place.

243
00:13:15.947 --> 00:13:17.347
Do you know where that house is?

244
00:13:17.347 --> 00:13:18.447
Oh, yes.

245
00:13:19.547 --> 00:13:22.747
What? A little after 7 am this morning?

246
00:13:22.747 --> 00:13:25.947
"Akira Kato" -I was here right through.

247
00:13:25.947 --> 00:13:29.447
No! You're the one who stabbed Hirotoshi, aren't you?

248
00:13:29.447 --> 00:13:32.047
What? Me? Commit murder?

249
00:13:32.047 --> 00:13:34.247
Just what are you talking about? Out of the blue like that.

250
00:13:34.247 --> 00:13:36.047
What's going on? Cut out the noise.

251
00:13:36.047 --> 00:13:39.847
I told you to get rid of door-to-door sales, didn't I?

252
00:13:39.847 --> 00:13:42.147
Oh, well... The thing is...

253
00:13:42.147 --> 00:13:44.647
So, what's the problem?

254
00:13:44.647 --> 00:13:45.747
What?

255
00:13:45.747 --> 00:13:48.447
-What? -Officer Chiba?

256
00:13:48.447 --> 00:13:49.647
Yeah.

257
00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:55.247
This is interesting.

258
00:13:55.247 --> 00:13:58.247
What? Suspect of a homicide case?

259
00:13:58.247 --> 00:14:00.047
You mean Kato?

260
00:14:00.047 --> 00:14:01.547
Yes, that's right.

261
00:14:01.547 --> 00:14:06.547
His colleague at work, Mr. Hirotoshi Nakamoto, was murdered.

262
00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:08.447
The murder weapon was a knife.

263
00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.247
It was found on the floor beside the body.

264
00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:13.547
And the estimated time of death was?

265
00:14:13.547 --> 00:14:17.047
Between 7 am to 7:30 am this morning.

266
00:14:17.047 --> 00:14:20.547
Then, he couldn't have committed the crime.

267
00:14:20.547 --> 00:14:23.347
Because he woke me up at 7 am,

268
00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:27.047
and we were here together watching TV until 8 pm.

269
00:14:27.047 --> 00:14:28.047
Right?

270
00:14:28.047 --> 00:14:29.047
Yeah.

271
00:14:29.047 --> 00:14:30.147
Is it true?

272
00:14:30.147 --> 00:14:34.647
Yes. We were watching Nichiuri TV's live morning broadcast

273
00:14:34.647 --> 00:14:37.747
"Morning Live Seven", a news variety program.

274
00:14:37.747 --> 00:14:40.247
But, Officer Chiba, he woke you up, didn't he?

275
00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:42.947
Then it could be that he showed you something that

276
00:14:42.947 --> 00:14:45.247
he had video taped some time ago, right?

277
00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:47.247
No way!

278
00:14:47.247 --> 00:14:49.047
I've got proof too.

279
00:14:49.047 --> 00:14:51.647
By the way, why am I suspected in the first place?

280
00:14:51.647 --> 00:14:54.247
Because you're my ex-boyfriend!

281
00:14:55.347 --> 00:14:57.347
There's an eye-witness

282
00:14:57.347 --> 00:14:59.847
that says he saw you a little past 7 am near the condominium!

283
00:14:59.847 --> 00:15:03.547
Are you sure that guy wasn't half asleep and mistook me for someone else?

284
00:15:03.547 --> 00:15:05.947
We weren't half asleep!

285
00:15:05.947 --> 00:15:07.847
I saw it clearly!

286
00:15:07.847 --> 00:15:09.147
It was him!

287
00:15:10.247 --> 00:15:12.247
He was wearing a gray parka top.

288
00:15:12.247 --> 00:15:14.947
You were running with a black knapsack on your back!

289
00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:18.147
Just as if you were jogging.

290
00:15:19.347 --> 00:15:22.247
Let's have Officer Chiba show us in!

291
00:15:22.247 --> 00:15:24.847
And show us proof that he was watching TV with that man

292
00:15:24.847 --> 00:15:27.447
from 7 am to 8 am in the morning.

293
00:15:29.347 --> 00:15:32.147
Wait... What's this?

294
00:15:32.147 --> 00:15:34.347
What a mess!

295
00:15:34.347 --> 00:15:37.547
I can see why you're always late for work.

296
00:15:37.547 --> 00:15:39.947
I'm doing the best I can!

297
00:15:39.947 --> 00:15:42.747
I'm recently not as tardy as I used to be, right?

298
00:15:42.747 --> 00:15:44.847
Come to think of it, that's true.

299
00:15:44.847 --> 00:15:46.047
How come?

300
00:15:46.047 --> 00:15:49.047
Oh, well, I sort of did something to give me initiative to get up.

301
00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:51.647
What's with these toys here?

302
00:15:51.647 --> 00:15:53.947
Don't tell me that you're some special effects freak or something?

303
00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:55.747
Who cares?

304
00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:57.247
I mean after all, it's just a hobby.

305
00:16:00.547 --> 00:16:02.047
It's Gomera! Gomera!

306
00:16:02.047 --> 00:16:03.847
Masked Yaiba is here too!

307
00:16:03.847 --> 00:16:08.747
-That's a rare object made of tin! -Hey! Don't get rough with them.

308
00:16:08.747 --> 00:16:10.047
I told you all to wait in the car

309
00:16:10.047 --> 00:16:14.247
with Mr. Kato and Ms. Shimura, didn't I?

310
00:16:14.247 --> 00:16:15.847
And, where is it?

311
00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:20.247
The proof you mentioned that both of you were watching TV together.

312
00:16:20.247 --> 00:16:23.047
Oh, yes, sir! It's this video tape.

313
00:16:25.847 --> 00:16:29.347
Hi! This is "Yoko Okino's Four-minute Cooking"!

314
00:16:29.347 --> 00:16:31.747
It's February 25th, Friday.

315
00:16:31.747 --> 00:16:36.247
I video tape this corner of "Morning Live Seven" each time.

316
00:16:36.247 --> 00:16:39.747
Last night, I watched rental videos with Kato while drinking

317
00:16:39.747 --> 00:16:40.947
and fell asleep here.

318
00:16:40.947 --> 00:16:42.647
I forgot to pre-set the program to record it

319
00:16:42.647 --> 00:16:44.447
so I recorded it myself today.

320
00:16:44.447 --> 00:16:48.847
That's why he couldn't have shown me something he recorded beforehand.

321
00:16:48.847 --> 00:16:52.147
Besides that, there is only one video tape deck is being used.

322
00:16:52.147 --> 00:16:54.947
But, there's another deck here.

323
00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:58.347
That's one that we only use sometimes for dubbing!

324
00:16:58.347 --> 00:16:59.747
If he used that deck,

325
00:16:59.747 --> 00:17:01.847
the cord would show in front of the TV,

326
00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:04.547
and I would notice it no matter how drowsy I may be.

327
00:17:04.547 --> 00:17:08.447
If you think it's a lie, call the TV station and confirm it!

328
00:17:09.947 --> 00:17:14.547
It's the corner after Nichiruri TV's "Morning Live Seven"'s

329
00:17:14.547 --> 00:17:17.247
weather forecast of today, February 25th, Friday.

330
00:17:17.247 --> 00:17:20.847
Gosh. You have many marks in other places too.

331
00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:22.647
Even the cable TV programs are marked.

332
00:17:22.647 --> 00:17:25.047
There are so many programs I want to watch.

333
00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:26.347
I see.

334
00:17:26.347 --> 00:17:30.347
That's why you've got so many memo pads stuck all over the TV.

335
00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:35.347
And? After watching the program until 8 pm, what did you do?

336
00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.547
I watched videos from 8 pm.

337
00:17:37.547 --> 00:17:39.247
What video?

338
00:17:39.247 --> 00:17:41.647
Oh, well... That's...

339
00:17:42.847 --> 00:17:45.047
Chiba! Hey!

340
00:17:45.047 --> 00:17:47.147
Don't tell me?

341
00:17:47.147 --> 00:17:48.547
X-rated videos?

342
00:17:48.547 --> 00:17:51.047
What? No!

343
00:17:51.047 --> 00:17:52.747
"Masked Yaiba" -It's this video...

344
00:17:52.747 --> 00:17:53.847
This.

345
00:18:04.147 --> 00:18:06.547
"Masked Yaiba"

346
00:18:06.547 --> 00:18:08.547
-It's "Masked Yaiba"! -It's "Masked Yaiba"!

347
00:18:08.547 --> 00:18:10.047
Amazing!

348
00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.447
Yaiba kick!

349
00:18:23.447 --> 00:18:26.747
This is first episode of the first Yaiba!

350
00:18:26.747 --> 00:18:28.747
The mask of the first Yaiba was really gross

351
00:18:28.747 --> 00:18:30.947
but that was one of the good points!

352
00:18:30.947 --> 00:18:35.247
And how long were you watching this children's program?

353
00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.647
I watched one 120 minute tape.

354
00:18:37.647 --> 00:18:40.247
You mean you watched it for two hours?

355
00:18:40.247 --> 00:18:42.047
No, it's taped on triple the regular speed

356
00:18:42.047 --> 00:18:43.847
and the commercials aren't cut so...

357
00:18:43.847 --> 00:18:45.947
-Six hours? -Six hours?

358
00:18:47.147 --> 00:18:50.447
Did you video tape all the tapes, Officer Chiba?

359
00:18:50.447 --> 00:18:54.247
No, Kato gave me the ones he taped before.

360
00:18:54.247 --> 00:18:57.147
And were you with him right through?

361
00:18:57.147 --> 00:19:01.247
No, after watching half the program I went to take a shower,

362
00:19:01.247 --> 00:19:03.147
for about 30 minutes.

363
00:19:03.147 --> 00:19:05.247
Then, I started watching again.

364
00:19:05.247 --> 00:19:08.147
I watched all the way to episode 12 and stopped the video.

365
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.347
Then professional baseball was being aired so.

366
00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:14.247
You know, the game from 2 pm the Falcons versus the Jaguars!

367
00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:15.647
Officer Chosuke and the others came along

368
00:19:15.647 --> 00:19:18.047
while I was watching that game.

369
00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:19.847
I see.

370
00:19:19.847 --> 00:19:22.147
From here to the victim's condominium,

371
00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:24.747
it would take at least an hour by car.

372
00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:26.447
If after watching TV for an hour,

373
00:19:26.447 --> 00:19:29.347
they watched the video for approximately six hours together,

374
00:19:29.347 --> 00:19:31.247
his alibi is established.

375
00:19:31.247 --> 00:19:34.747
Just to be sure, let's look for the gray parka top

376
00:19:34.747 --> 00:19:37.647
and black knapsack the man had on him.

377
00:19:50.347 --> 00:19:52.647
What? Is that for real?

378
00:19:52.647 --> 00:19:53.647
What? What is it?

379
00:19:53.647 --> 00:19:54.847
Did you find something?

380
00:19:54.847 --> 00:19:56.447
No.

381
00:19:56.447 --> 00:19:57.647
Nothing really.

382
00:19:57.647 --> 00:20:01.347
Gosh. If there's nothing, don't shout!

383
00:20:01.347 --> 00:20:03.347
-Sorry. -Sorry.

384
00:20:03.347 --> 00:20:06.547
And how long is the dispatch to Tottori going to be?

385
00:20:06.547 --> 00:20:09.947
The guys at the first division says it'll be about three years.

386
00:20:09.947 --> 00:20:12.747
And what did Officer Sato say?

387
00:20:12.747 --> 00:20:15.947
She wants me to get her some 20th Century Japanese Pears.

388
00:20:15.947 --> 00:20:17.747
Is that it?

389
00:20:17.747 --> 00:20:19.247
That's it.

390
00:20:19.247 --> 00:20:20.647
Strange.

391
00:20:20.647 --> 00:20:24.147
It's more natural that she would get more upset.

392
00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:25.347
Well...

393
00:20:25.347 --> 00:20:28.847
although I'll be dispatched, it seems I get to take off once a month,

394
00:20:28.847 --> 00:20:30.447
and I can call her frequently too.

395
00:20:30.447 --> 00:20:32.447
I hope you don't end up like Kato.

396
00:20:32.447 --> 00:20:33.447
What?

397
00:20:33.447 --> 00:20:37.847
He was abroad on a business trip till last month,

398
00:20:37.847 --> 00:20:38.947
but as soon as he got back,

399
00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:42.147
he called me and asked me to put him up here.

400
00:20:42.147 --> 00:20:43.647
He said that while he was away, the woman he was living with

401
00:20:43.647 --> 00:20:45.347
started going out with another man,

402
00:20:45.347 --> 00:20:47.947
so he was left without a place to stay.

403
00:20:47.947 --> 00:20:49.647
And...

404
00:20:49.647 --> 00:20:52.147
He used to call her everyday, and yet,

405
00:20:52.147 --> 00:20:54.847
he complained he could never understand women.

406
00:20:54.847 --> 00:20:56.347
If you're serious about her,

407
00:20:56.347 --> 00:20:59.047
I think you should let her know, don't you?

408
00:20:59.047 --> 00:21:02.747
About how you feel and what your plans are for the future.

409
00:21:02.747 --> 00:21:06.447
And, you never know what'll happen to you either, right?

410
00:21:06.447 --> 00:21:07.447
Me?

411
00:21:07.447 --> 00:21:08.547
Maybe...

412
00:21:08.547 --> 00:21:11.447
Maybe end up finding a lover over there!

413
00:21:11.447 --> 00:21:13.747
-What? -That's right.

414
00:21:13.747 --> 00:21:16.947
If that happens, he won't be coming home for a while.

415
00:21:16.947 --> 00:21:18.047
No way.

416
00:21:18.047 --> 00:21:21.447
Yes. It is said that the hearts of people proportionately pull apart,

417
00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:24.747
the more time passes.

418
00:21:24.747 --> 00:21:27.047
Although there rarely seems to be exceptions at times.

419
00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:28.047
Hey.

420
00:21:28.047 --> 00:21:30.947
I will never go with a woman other than her!

421
00:21:30.947 --> 00:21:32.647
Never!

422
00:21:32.647 --> 00:21:34.247
What do you mean?

423
00:21:34.247 --> 00:21:36.247
Just who are we talking about?

424
00:21:36.247 --> 00:21:38.247
Who?

425
00:21:38.247 --> 00:21:39.347
What?

426
00:21:39.347 --> 00:21:41.747
We were talking about Hide.

427
00:21:41.747 --> 00:21:43.947
Because he may be going abroad.

428
00:21:43.947 --> 00:21:45.947
Oh, Hide.

429
00:21:45.947 --> 00:21:49.347
It seems that Hide decided to remain in Japan.

430
00:21:49.347 --> 00:21:50.747
-What? -Really?

431
00:21:50.747 --> 00:21:53.247
You saw the press conference they had in the afternoon?

432
00:21:53.247 --> 00:21:56.247
No, right after "Morning Live Seven" started,

433
00:21:56.247 --> 00:21:58.747
there was a flash news report subtitle displayed on the screen.

434
00:21:58.747 --> 00:22:01.147
It said, "Player Akagi Hideo of the Tokyo Spirits

435
00:22:01.147 --> 00:22:02.747
have announced that he will remain!

436
00:22:02.747 --> 00:22:05.447
A press conference will be held at 12 noon."

437
00:22:05.447 --> 00:22:09.147
Did the newscaster mention anything about that news later?

438
00:22:09.147 --> 00:22:12.247
No, not in particular.

439
00:22:12.247 --> 00:22:13.447
Wait a second.

440
00:22:13.447 --> 00:22:14.647
Maybe...

441
00:22:18.347 --> 00:22:20.947
I see, so that's the story!

442
00:22:20.947 --> 00:22:22.147
But, it's not possible.

443
00:22:22.147 --> 00:22:24.547
Even if this trick were to be used, there are still...

444
00:22:24.547 --> 00:22:27.247
There are still some parts I cannot explain.

445
00:22:27.247 --> 00:22:29.047
How was it done?

446
00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:30.947
How was the time rigged?

447
00:23:59.547 --> 00:24:01.447
"Next Episode"

448
00:24:01.447 --> 00:24:03.747
It doesn't seem to be around.

449
00:24:03.747 --> 00:24:05.447
Not here, anyways.

450
00:24:05.447 --> 00:24:08.247
Why don't you ask Officer Chiba, then?

451
00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:14.247
Chiba! I'm asking if you swear by this Cherry Blossom crest!

452
00:24:14.247 --> 00:24:18.047
I'll go over there and become a fine police officer!

453
00:24:18.047 --> 00:24:19.547
So, before I go,

454
00:24:19.547 --> 00:24:23.147
please...

455
00:24:23.947 --> 00:24:29.547
Next Conan, "Love Story at Police Headquarters 6 (Part 2)"

456
00:24:30.274 --> 00:24:32.074
Next Conan's Hint:

457
00:24:32.074 --> 00:24:34.774
"Clock"

458
00:24:34.774 --> 00:24:36.074
-The next episode... -Will be about...

459
00:24:36.074 --> 00:24:37.374
-The two police officers... -Finally...

460
00:24:37.374 --> 00:24:38.574
Breaking up.
