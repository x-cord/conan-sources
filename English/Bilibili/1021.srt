1
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.450
Mitsumoto Takeshi (35)

2
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.120
Mitsumoto Takeshi (35)
A single blow to the back of the
head with a blunt object, huh?

3
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.230
You again?

4
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.740
I happened to pass by.

5
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.210
Just happened to, huh?

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960
I suppose I'll tell you what happened.

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.650
We haven't found the weapon, but
it was some kind of metal pipe.

8
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.090
He was probably killed
last night around seven.

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.090
His name is Mitsumoto Takeshi.

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.580
Officer Higashino (30)

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.350
Officer Higashino (30)
He had a bad reputation.

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.350
So he was a troublemaker.

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.610
Does that mean the motive was a grudge?

14
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.730
Inspector!

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.070
Did you figure something out?

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.280
Yes.

17
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.600
Around seven last night, someone saw a man
running away from this park in a hurry.

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.200
The witness apparently knew him.

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.580
The man who came running from the
park is a ruffian named Hosaka.

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.580
Hosaka Yorimitsu?

21
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.870
He often hung out with Mitsumoto Takeshi.

22
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.660
They seemed to get up to trouble together.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.590
What?! Impossible!

24
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.140
Th-That's Hosaka Yorimitsu.

25
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.510
Th-That's Hosaka Yorimitsu.
Hosaka Yorimitsu (35)

26
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.100
Hosaka Yorimitsu (35)

27
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.090
Stabbed once in the chest with a knife.

28
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.190
Judging by the body's stiffness, it's been
about 17 or 18 hours since he was killed.

29
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.620
There's blood on his index finger.

30
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.410
Could it be?

31
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.410
Isn't this a dying message
identifying the culprit?

32
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.030
Isn't this a dying message
identifying the culprit?
Shida

33
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.090
Shida

34
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.920
Shida
Shida?

35
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.350
Shida...

36
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.230
Shida Yasuho.

37
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.010
He frequently hung out
with Mitsumoto and Hosaka.

38
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.930
Like Hosaka, Shida seemed like a shady guy.

39
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.540
Shida

40
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.440
Shida
This is the place.

41
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.750
Why...?

42
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.920
Three troublemakers murdered
one after another...

43
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.440
What's going on here?

44
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.100
Finally arriving after
swaying back and forth,

45
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.980
draw close to mysteries and
begin deducing the truth!

46
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.140
With a twirl, a case connecting
three shady men emerges!

47
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.630
Always determining the one truth

48
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.330
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

49
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.920
his name is Detective Conan!

50
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.560
Rondo in Bad Company

51
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.920
Rondo in Bad Company
"Rondo in Bad Company!"

52
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.000
Rondo in Bad Company

53
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.510
Shida Yasuho (35)

54
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.760
Looks like he was poisoned.

55
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.770
People keep dying one after another.

56
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.420
What's going on here?

57
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.850
Since he was spotted near the crime scene,

58
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.020
it's likely that Mitsumoto Takeshi-san
was killed by Hosaka Yorimitsu.

59
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.090
And Hosaka's dying message indicates
that it was Shida Yasuho who killed him.

60
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.540
But Shida was killed by someone as well.

61
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.410
What's going on here?

62
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.160
Then Shida-san's murder couldn't be
linked to a falling out between them.

63
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.670
The poison was inside that bottle.

64
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.330
Apparently Shida day drank everyday.

65
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.100
The culprit must've added the
poison sometime between last night

66
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.680
after he drank that afternoon and
when he started drinking today.

67
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.380
Then the other two could've done it.

68
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.680
But if that's the case,
then why did they do it?

69
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.910
Inspector!

70
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.230
I found ten stacks of 100 thousand yen.

71
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.570
That's ten million yen.

72
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.570
There's ten million more yen here, too.

73
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.020
And here.

74
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.830
I haven't counted it yet, but there
seems to be 30 million yen total.

75
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.550
30 million yen? Since that's
divisible by three...

76
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.210
What? Could it be?

77
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.260
I've got it!

78
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.390
Shida-san was killed for this money.

79
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:17.770
There must be a witness who saw a suspicious
person enter this room and poison the bottle.

80
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.400
Does he really think
it'll be that convenient?

81
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.740
We're looking for last night's footage.

82
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.050
That's Shida exiting building A.

83
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.050
He enters the convenience store, and...

84
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.680
Mitsumoto Takeshi?

85
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.000
Is this when he poisoned the bottle?

86
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.760
Looks like Shida-san's murder was
connected to their falling out.

87
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.820
But...

88
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.010
Why would these three who always
hung out together do that?

89
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.350
Huh?

90
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.770
The amount of 30 million yen fits perfectly
with the fact that there were three of them.

91
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.570
Is this connected to that
incident in Haido City?

92
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.570
That must be it!

93
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.820
The armed robbery case?

94
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.570
Three days ago, 30 million
yen in cash was stolen

95
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.000
from a financier in the
neighboring Haido City.

96
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.370
He was robbed by three masked men.

97
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.330
That must've been Shida and his friends.

98
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.170
They probably split the
money 10 million yen each,

99
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.940
but they all got greedy.

100
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.340
Then, last night...

101
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.100
Hosaka-san killed Mitsumoto-san and
took his 10 million yen home with him.

102
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.330
Don't worry, Mitsumoto.

103
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.500
I'll have fun spending this.

104
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.610
But Shida-san had the same idea.

105
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.690
Don't worry, Hosaka.

106
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.480
I'll have fun spending all of this.

107
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.990
Shida

108
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.200
He killed Hosaka-san and
took the 20 million yen,

109
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.760
but the first victim Mitsumoto-san
was plotting the same thing.

110
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.260
I could take your money now,

111
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.740
but as long as you're alive,
you'd just take it back.

112
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.310
Unaware that Mitsumoto-san had poisoned the
bottle, Shida-san celebrated with a drink.

113
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.030
That's what happened. Right, Mister?

114
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.530
Probably something like that.

115
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.040
That explains Shida-san's last words, too.

116
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.940
Why...?

117
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.680
He thought he'd get to keep all
the stolen money for himself.

118
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.790
He must've wondered why that happened.

119
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:55.180
So three troublemakers motivated by greed ended
up killing each other, and now they're all dead.

120
00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:00.270
And to prove it, each one killed
another in a perfect chain.

121
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:00.350
And to prove it, each one killed
another in a perfect chain.
Hosaka Yorimitsu

122
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.330
Hosaka Yorimitsu

123
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.820
Hosaka Yorimitsu
Hosaka Yorimitsu, Mitsumito
Takeshi, and Shida Yasuho.

124
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.820
Hosaka Yorimitsu, Mitsumito
Takeshi, and Shida Yasuho.
Mitusmoto Takeshi

125
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.680
Hosaka Yorimitsu, Mitsumito
Takeshi, and Shida Yasuho.
Shida Yasuho

126
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.200
Shida Yasuho

127
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:07.900
Shida Yasuho
Their names link together in a circle.

128
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.190
Their names link together in a circle.

129
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.610
That's an inconsequential
discovery, but it's true.

130
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.100
Regardless of the coincidence
concerning their names...

131
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.120
That explains all three murders.

132
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.060
The three of them killed each other.

133
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.020
It certainly makes sense,

134
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.670
but one was bludgeoned to death,

135
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.420
one was stabbed to death,

136
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.840
and one was poisoned.

137
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.140
Why were all three methods different?

138
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.780
What?

139
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.010
There are three culprits.

140
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.150
It's not that odd for their
methods to be different, too.

141
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.680
Wouldn't it be more natural
for there to be some overlap?

142
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.260
I must be overthinking it.

143
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.020
What's that about?

144
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.690
What is it, son?

145
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.880
Well...

146
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:16.910
Well...
Nishikawa Mamoru (6)

147
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.300
Nishikawa Mamoru (6)

148
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.190
Got it.

149
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.760
Thanks for telling me.

150
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.370
What is it?

151
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.670
The boy's name is Nishikawa Mamoru-kun.

152
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.780
He lives on the floor above Shida.

153
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.610
Last night around eight,
he saw a suspicious man.

154
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.120
It was a very large man concealing
his face with a mask and sunglasses.

155
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.180
He was trying to get into Shida's apartment.

156
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.290
When Mamoru-kun saw him, he said...

157
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.280
Forget you saw me!

158
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.000
That man may be the real culprit.

159
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.770
I see.

160
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.590
That's a curious piece of information.

161
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.350
The question is how he's
connected to this case.

162
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.850
Maybe they didn't kill each other.

163
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.580
Maybe that man killed Mitusmoto and Hosaka.

164
00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:18.360
And maybe he poisoned Shida's
alcohol when Mamoru-kun saw him.

165
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:26.370
He put Mitsumoto and Hosaka's 10
million yen in Shida's apartment

166
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.620
so it would look like they
killed each other out of greed.

167
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.130
When you think of it that way, it also
explains why all three methods were different.

168
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.630
He did it deliberately to make us
think there were three culprits.

169
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.210
I see.

170
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.640
It does make sense.

171
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.820
So this was a series of murdered
committed by one true culprit

172
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.930
made to look like the three
men killed each other.

173
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.330
It's certainly possible.

174
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.190
Where'd that brilliant idea
suddenly come from, Chiba?

175
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.690
It must've been a flash of inspiration.

176
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.930
But, Detective Chiba...

177
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.570
If you're right, then the dying message
could've been fabricated by that man,

178
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:08.370
If you're right, then the dying message
could've been fabricated by that man,
Shida

179
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:08.380
If you're right, then the dying message
could've been fabricated by that man,

180
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.960
but what about Hosaka-san and
Mitsumoto-san's suspicious behavior?

181
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.960
The man must've cleverly manipulated them.

182
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:23.970
Do you really think there's someone who could
manipulate them into doing exactly as he said?

183
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.470
I'm sure we'll find him.

184
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.110
There's surely a large man familiar with all
three of them who held a powerful grudge.

185
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.480
Our true culprit X.

186
00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.450
It's worth checking out.

187
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:37.830
We'll split up and look for him.

188
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.870
Hey, mister.

189
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.610
Since the three victims were troublemakers, it's
possible that someone held a grudge against them,

190
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.120
but do you think they'd murder them?

191
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.750
Killing all three of them is
pretty crazy, don't you think?

192
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.670
Those three must've done something
to X to really make him hate them.

193
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.420
Then why did Shida-san ask
"why?" just before he died?

194
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.430
Who knows?

195
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.560
Inspector, I've found someone
matching the description.

196
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.720
I was unable to meet with him since he was
out, but he's a large man at least 180 cm tall.

197
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.910
He probably resented the three men as well.

198
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.200
Who is he?

199
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.300
Shida's last words were
the real dying message

200
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.090
revealing the identity of the true culprit.

201
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.960
What do you mean?

202
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.160
The three of them were
middle school classmates.

203
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.930
Their homeroom teacher at the
time was Minamide Kokichi.

204
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:52.930
Their homeroom teacher at the
time was Minamide Kokichi.
Minamide Kokichi

205
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.810
Apparently the students called him Nande.

206
00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.560
Nande?

207
00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.700
The three men were already
troublemakers in middle school.

208
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:19.440
Their homeroom teacher Minamide-sensei
did his best to reform their behavior,

209
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.470
but his efforts never paid off, and 20
years later, they were still troublemakers.

210
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:32.380
When Minamide learned they
stole 30 million yen,

211
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.270
he wondered how much more
trouble they would cause!

212
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.350
His only choice was to kill them!

213
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:45.280
As their former homeroom teacher, he
felt it was his duty, so he killed them!

214
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.160
He made it look like they killed each
other over the money they stole

215
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.200
to teach the world's children
that people who commit evil acts

216
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.750
end up destroying themselves!

217
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:07.660
Though he retired long ago, Minamide Kokichi
must've been a teacher to the core.

218
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.140
Their former homeroom teacher
could've made up some excuse

219
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.510
to influence Hosaka and Mitsumoto's behavior.

220
00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.100
I can't believe there was actually
someone who met all the conditions.

221
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.600
It certainly does make sense.

222
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.110
He's out right now?

223
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.070
That's the curious thing.

224
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.610
Apparently the last time his
neighbors saw him was yesterday.

225
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.730
Having fulfilled his duty as
their former homeroom teacher,

226
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:34.990
could he have killed himself?

227
00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.000
Do you have business with me?

228
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.710
Are you Minamide Kokichi-san?

229
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:45.010
Minamide Kokichi (70)

230
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:45.940
Minamide Kokichi (70)
Yes.

231
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.490
Minamide Kokichi (70)
Are you the police?

232
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:48.300
Minamide Kokichi (70)
When I ran into my neighbor over there,
they said you were looking for me.

233
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.720
When I ran into my neighbor over there,
they said you were looking for me.

234
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.600
I've been at Spa Land
Utamaro since yesterday.

235
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.190
Stone saunas are awesome.

236
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.630
Spa Land Utamaro?

237
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.950
I'll go check it out.

238
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:13.570
We'd like to ask you a few questions concerning
Mitsumoto Takeshi and Shida Yasuho's murders.

239
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.970
Mitsumoto and Shida?

240
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.540
Who are they?

241
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.540
They were your students 20 years ago.

242
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.980
My former students?

243
00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.520
I don't remember them at all.

244
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.590
I was able to confirm his alibi
for yesterday afternoon to today.

245
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.250
He has an alibi?

246
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.310
No way!

247
00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.060
What's wrong with him?

248
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.070
If it's not Minamide, then who is X?

249
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.320
In any case, we have to find him!

250
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.820
Find the large man who
resented all three of them!

251
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.780
Yes, sir!

252
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.280
I'll help, too.

253
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:07.750
But where else are we going to find
someone who meets all the conditions,

254
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.060
like a former homeroom teacher?

255
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.670
Wait a minute.

256
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.800
Nishikawa

257
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:15.970
Yeah.

258
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.800
Last night when I came back
from running an errand...

259
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.810
Forget you saw me!

260
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.060
I only saw him trying to open the door.

261
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.560
He didn't need to get so mad.

262
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.820
I don't understand grown ups.

263
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:42.420
He put his ear against the door
to listen for anyone inside

264
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.480
and looked shocked when he saw something.

265
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.990
Could it be?

266
00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.460
Wouldn't that mean we headed
in the wrong direction?

267
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.250
In any case, I have to find him.

268
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.810
It could conceivably be A and K.

269
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.570
Mister, did you threaten a boy last night?

270
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.610
He saw you doing something bad, right?

271
00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.830
Or rather, something embarrassing.

272
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:33.200
I knew it.

273
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.090
A large man wearing a mask and sunglasses?

274
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:40.770
Yeah.

275
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.100
I checked it out, and you
were right after all, Mister.

276
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760
Mori-san?

277
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.240
What does that mean?

278
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.810
What?

279
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.100
I, uh, you know...

280
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.540
The weather sure is nice today.

281
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.740
The weather...

282
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.000
That's right.

283
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.990
Mamoru-kun was talking
about Kitahara-san here.

284
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.490
The true culprit X.

285
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.440
No.

286
00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:09.290
Kitahara Kensaku (56)

287
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.970
Kitahara Kensaku (56)
I came to visit my newly
wedded daughter's household.

288
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.500
Kitahara Kensaku (56)
They were going to let me stay
with them for a few days.

289
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.320
They were going to let me stay
with them for a few days.

290
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.510
Last night, I...

291
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.220
You mean to visit room 402 in building K,

292
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.520
but you misremembered the building
number as A instead of K.

293
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.670
They know I'm coming.

294
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.840
There should be someone home.

295
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.710
What if something happened to them?

296
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.480
You realized your mistake
when you saw the door plate,

297
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.320
but Mamoru-kun saw you.

298
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.560
Forget you saw me!

299
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.140
I thought my daughter and her husband
would laugh at me if he told them,

300
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.490
so I threatened a child.

301
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.170
I'm sorry.

302
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.010
In other words...

303
00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.480
Kitahara-san had nothing to do with the case.

304
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.300
Then why are you hiding your face?

305
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.460
I have a bit of a cold,

306
00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.140
and my eyebrow was shaved off
when I went to get a haircut.

307
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.000
So he had nothing to do with it.

308
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.150
Then who killed Shida and the others?

309
00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.260
About that...

310
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.110
It's me.

311
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:26.980
What?

312
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.950
The weapon was found during a thorough
search of the area around the crime scene.

313
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:40.780
A metal pipe with Mitsumoto Takeshi's blood
and hair on it was found near the park.

314
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:46.570
A knife with Hosaka Yorimitsu's blood
was found near his apartment as well.

315
00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.610
They found fingerprints on them, too.

316
00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.080
Hosaka's were on the pipe, and
Shida Yasuho's were on the knife.

317
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.730
What does that mean?

318
00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:04.360
We may eventually find a bag or wrapper
with the poison used in Shida's murder, too,

319
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.990
with Mitsumoto Takeshi's fingerprints on it.

320
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:08.870
Could it be?

321
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.980
Since their fingerprints are on
the weapons, we can only assume

322
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:19.790
Mitsumoto Takeshi was killed by Hosaka
Yorimitsu, Hosaka was killed by Shida Yasuho,

323
00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.880
and Shida was probably killed
by Mitsumoto Takeshi.

324
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.880
In other words...

325
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.890
There is no true culprit X.

326
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.580
The three of them killed each other.

327
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.140
Our first suspicion was correct.

328
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.650
Now we're back where we started.

329
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.400
We should make sure we don't
make this kind of mistake again.

330
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.370
Though police and detectives are
professionals at logical deduction,

331
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:51.090
that sometimes makes us read too deeply into
situations and head in the wrong direction.

332
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:55.160
We mustn't assume people unrelated
to a case are suspects.

333
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.310
It's a terrible mistake to make.

334
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.050
Some kind of crazy murder could happen here.

335
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.570
Sadohara Ken
Kenzaki Mitsuhiko
Hikone Katsue
Eda Junshi
Shimura Misa

336
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:38.360
Sadohara Ken
Kenzaki Mitsuhiko
Hikone Katsue
Eda Junshi
Shimura Misa
This time it's five names
connected in a circle.

337
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:38.850
Sadohara Ken
Kenzaki Mitsuhiko
Hikone Katsue
Eda Junshi
Shimura Misa

338
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.180
Stop reading too deeply into things.
