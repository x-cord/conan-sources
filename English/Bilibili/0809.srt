1
00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.624
Invited by Heiji Hattori,

2
00:00:02.624 --> 00:00:04.724
we came to a hot spring inn

3
00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:08.324
that is famous for their kudzu drink.

4
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:10.424
We go to the storeroom of the inn

5
00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:13.424
and encounter an incident where Pops Kogoro, Hattori

6
00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:18.724
and a guest at the inn, Ms. Midori Koyanagi are slashed.

7
00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:19.824
And furthermore...

8
00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:23.824
Grand Master!

9
00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:31.824
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart.

10
00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:34.024
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

11
00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:35.724
Kamaitachi that runs over water.

12
00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:38.224
The deduction of the two exposes the demon.

13
00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:39.724
He sees through the one and only truth.

14
00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:41.524
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

15
00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:43.924
His name is Detective Conan!

16
00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:33.854
"Kamaitachi Inn (Part 2)"

17
00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.454
Grand Master?

18
00:02:36.454 --> 00:02:37.754
Grand Master!

19
00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:40.254
Don't go into the room!

20
00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:42.854
He's already dead.

21
00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:45.954
Rigor mortis hasn't set in yet,

22
00:02:45.954 --> 00:02:49.254
so he died just less than 30 minutes ago.

23
00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:51.454
Why is the sickle here though...

24
00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:53.854
Wasn't the Gunma police investigating it?

25
00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:56.554
Oh, that's because when we checked it a while ago,

26
00:02:56.554 --> 00:02:58.754
there was no luminol reaction.

27
00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:00.454
I thought it wasn't involved with the case,

28
00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:02.354
so I returned it to the storeroom.

29
00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:05.254
The forensic officers were all sent back the station too.

30
00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:06.654
I see.

31
00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:10.154
Which means the perp could take this sickle out freely.

32
00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:13.054
Something's strange.

33
00:03:13.954 --> 00:03:15.854
The sliding door

34
00:03:15.854 --> 00:03:18.354
was cut by the sickle that is poked into gramps, right?

35
00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:21.054
Yeah. Most probably.

36
00:03:21.054 --> 00:03:25.054
Then why is there blood on the top part of the cut place?

37
00:03:25.054 --> 00:03:26.554
Well, after all a human's been slashed,

38
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:27.554
so no doubt blood would be on it.

39
00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:33.154
But that means that gramps was slashed with this sickle first

40
00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:35.754
before slashing the paper sliding door,

41
00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:39.154
then poked again with the sickle, right?

42
00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:41.154
True.

43
00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:42.754
A performance.

44
00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:47.454
To make it look as if he was attacked by Kamaitachi.

45
00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:49.254
Then,

46
00:03:49.254 --> 00:03:52.554
was keeping the light from turning on also a performance?

47
00:03:52.554 --> 00:03:55.754
The breaker of this annex was shut down,

48
00:03:55.754 --> 00:03:59.454
and there's a strange trace at the place the perp snuck in too.

49
00:03:59.454 --> 00:04:01.054
A strange trace?

50
00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:02.054
This way!

51
00:04:04.854 --> 00:04:07.654
This is probably where the perp snuck in from.

52
00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:10.154
The glass is broken.

53
00:04:10.154 --> 00:04:12.354
And what about the strange trace?

54
00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:16.354
The footprints from this porch to that fence are mine but...

55
00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:19.854
On the side in the snow, there is a shallow dug, right?

56
00:04:19.854 --> 00:04:22.254
Isn't that because the perp walked back and forth

57
00:04:22.254 --> 00:04:25.654
erasing his footprints with the sickle, no?

58
00:04:25.654 --> 00:04:27.354
We know that too.

59
00:04:27.354 --> 00:04:30.454
The real problem is what lies beyond this fence.

60
00:04:30.454 --> 00:04:32.654
Beyond it? Don't tell me...

61
00:04:33.254 --> 00:04:35.154
The outdoor bath?

62
00:04:35.154 --> 00:04:39.754
Look, the arch is dug only to here.

63
00:04:39.754 --> 00:04:42.154
In other words, when the culprit committed the crime...

64
00:04:42.154 --> 00:04:45.954
He ran across the water...

65
00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:48.854
as if he was riding on the wind.

66
00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:51.654
No way. Could such a feat be done?

67
00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:53.154
It's Kamaitachi!

68
00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:55.954
Kamaitachi does exist after all?

69
00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:57.754
Don't be ridiculous!

70
00:04:57.754 --> 00:04:59.954
There's some kind of trick involved here!

71
00:04:59.954 --> 00:05:03.054
Of course, done by an authentic human!

72
00:05:03.054 --> 00:05:05.054
Kamaitachi.

73
00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:06.854
Kamaitachi appeared?

74
00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:09.154
Is it true, Heiji?

75
00:05:09.154 --> 00:05:10.554
How do you know?

76
00:05:10.554 --> 00:05:12.554
Inspector Yamamura came a while ago and...

77
00:05:12.554 --> 00:05:14.854
Told us!

78
00:05:14.854 --> 00:05:18.354
The suspect is Kamaitachi.

79
00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:21.654
Some idiot pretending to be Kamaitachi appeared.

80
00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:24.154
But, wasn't it the Kamaitachi that messed up this room

81
00:05:24.154 --> 00:05:26.254
that we were decorating too?

82
00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:27.954
The fluorescent light suddenly cracked,

83
00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:31.254
and all the balloons that we decorated all burst too!

84
00:05:31.254 --> 00:05:32.354
Airsoft pellets.

85
00:05:33.354 --> 00:05:36.254
There are airsoft pellets on the floor.

86
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:38.754
Come to think of it,

87
00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:43.054
your late husband used to play survival games, correct?

88
00:05:43.054 --> 00:05:44.054
Yes.

89
00:05:44.054 --> 00:05:46.354
Where's that air gun now?

90
00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:47.754
My husband's belongings,

91
00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:50.354
everything except what's precious is in the storeroom.

92
00:05:50.354 --> 00:05:52.954
Then the perp probably took it out of the storeroom

93
00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:55.054
and fired through the sliding paper door.

94
00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:58.454
See, one of the sections can be flipped open.

95
00:05:58.454 --> 00:06:00.754
But there were about 10 balloons and yet

96
00:06:00.754 --> 00:06:02.754
all of them practically burst at once.

97
00:06:02.754 --> 00:06:05.754
You can't do something like that in the dark!

98
00:06:05.754 --> 00:06:08.354
Well, if you keep firing, you could probably hit at least 10.

99
00:06:08.354 --> 00:06:12.054
I don't think the balloons were cracked by airsoft pellets.

100
00:06:12.054 --> 00:06:14.454
Because there are only about three pellets on the floor.

101
00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:16.854
What's this smell?

102
00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:19.054
What? What's wrong?

103
00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:20.654
Don't you smell something?

104
00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:22.354
Be careful, you two.

105
00:06:22.354 --> 00:06:23.654
Because the cracked pieces of fluorescent light

106
00:06:23.654 --> 00:06:25.754
are still on the floor.

107
00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:29.154
My wristwatch light is ready to go out.

108
00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:31.354
Well, I guess I've got to use the light of my smartphone.

109
00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:33.954
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

110
00:06:33.954 --> 00:06:36.254
What? What about me?

111
00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:40.654
It's not you Kazuha. It's 'cooking'.

112
00:06:40.654 --> 00:06:44.254
I thought this smell reminded me of some side dish.

113
00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:46.054
I'm gonna get you for this!

114
00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:47.154
Sorry.

115
00:06:47.154 --> 00:06:48.354
It's not the smell of a side dish

116
00:06:48.354 --> 00:06:50.554
but rather of the bathroom and detergent!

117
00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:54.454
And it was cold, like rain water or something.

118
00:06:54.454 --> 00:06:56.954
Right, right? Some got on me too.

119
00:06:56.954 --> 00:07:00.254
The window wasn't open and yet really strange, right?

120
00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.754
Well, either way there's no doubt that

121
00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:05.254
all those here aren't the perp.

122
00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:07.354
Because when the scream of the Grand Master was heard,

123
00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:09.854
everybody was standing in front of this room.

124
00:07:09.854 --> 00:07:11.954
But it's amazing how you could tell that

125
00:07:11.954 --> 00:07:15.754
it was the voice of the Grand Master just by hearing the scream.

126
00:07:15.754 --> 00:07:20.154
I just thought it was and confirmed it with Takami.

127
00:07:20.154 --> 00:07:23.954
It's because I've heard a familiar scream once before in the past.

128
00:07:23.954 --> 00:07:26.054
When was that? Where?

129
00:07:26.054 --> 00:07:28.554
When the TV station came for an interview before,

130
00:07:28.554 --> 00:07:33.254
we were offering a vital point foot massage service to the guests.

131
00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:36.654
Since the guests become hesitant in front of TV cameras,

132
00:07:36.654 --> 00:07:40.154
Grand Master had no choice but to undergo the massage himself.

133
00:07:40.154 --> 00:07:42.054
The scream that he let out when there was pain

134
00:07:42.054 --> 00:07:44.554
was very similar to the scream a while ago.

135
00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:47.954
You've got that program recorded tape, do you?

136
00:07:47.954 --> 00:07:51.954
Yes. I think we can take a look at it at the office.

137
00:07:51.954 --> 00:07:53.854
-Let's go there, then! -Okay!

138
00:07:53.854 --> 00:07:56.754
All the rest of you, be sure to stay close together in one room!

139
00:07:58.254 --> 00:07:59.454
Gosh.

140
00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:01.954
I had something I wanted to tell you,

141
00:08:01.954 --> 00:08:04.154
but everything's gone down the drain because of Kamaitachi.

142
00:08:04.154 --> 00:08:07.254
What did you want to talk to me about?

143
00:08:07.254 --> 00:08:11.554
Well, the other day on Ebisu Bridge in Osaka...

144
00:08:11.554 --> 00:08:13.954
"Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?"

145
00:08:13.954 --> 00:08:16.254
"I'm gonna get you!"

146
00:08:16.254 --> 00:08:20.354
You mean Hattori really said that to the investigator?

147
00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:23.154
I may be exaggerating things a bit,

148
00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:25.354
but, it was more or less like so.

149
00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:28.454
And how was Hattori after that?

150
00:08:28.454 --> 00:08:31.354
He kind of played dumb.

151
00:08:31.754 --> 00:08:35.354
Maybe Heiji... he...

152
00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:38.254
What about you, Kazuha?

153
00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:42.554
Really thinks of me just as his "subordinate"?

154
00:08:44.354 --> 00:08:47.854
You see, like they usually say in samurai movies!

155
00:08:47.854 --> 00:08:50.954
Keep your hands off my cute subordinate and so forth...

156
00:08:51.754 --> 00:08:53.154
Kazuha!

157
00:08:53.154 --> 00:08:56.854
I don't think he thinks of you as a subordinate!

158
00:09:02.454 --> 00:09:05.954
This massage seems to be really effective.

159
00:09:05.954 --> 00:09:10.054
-Oh, yes. -It sure sounds the same.

160
00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:12.154
By the way, were there any guests who had a grudge against

161
00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:13.254
the Grand Master?

162
00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:19.054
He was full of hospitality, so I think the guests liked him.

163
00:09:19.054 --> 00:09:21.554
To the guests, which means?

164
00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:26.654
Yes. He was very strict towards me, the waitstaff, and the cooks.

165
00:09:26.654 --> 00:09:30.854
I heard that there was once a chief of the waitstaff who was fired

166
00:09:30.854 --> 00:09:33.054
and kicked out of this inn before.

167
00:09:33.054 --> 00:09:35.554
Do you remember that person name?

168
00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:36.654
No.

169
00:09:36.654 --> 00:09:40.454
I heard about it when I married and came here.

170
00:09:40.454 --> 00:09:43.554
If I remember correctly, she seemed to have had a child with her.

171
00:09:43.554 --> 00:09:48.954
By the way, do those two writers frequent this inn?

172
00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:51.654
Yes. Ms. Koyanagi only comes sometimes,

173
00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:54.054
but Mr. Nakama comes frequently.

174
00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:57.454
Come to think of it, a year ago

175
00:09:57.454 --> 00:09:59.154
on the day that Kohei almost drowned,

176
00:09:59.154 --> 00:10:02.254
those two were staying here too.

177
00:10:03.354 --> 00:10:06.854
The storeroom was first broken into that day, too.

178
00:10:06.854 --> 00:10:10.954
Kohei had to be taken to the hospital, and the police came over.

179
00:10:10.954 --> 00:10:13.254
It was total chaos.

180
00:10:13.254 --> 00:10:16.854
So, I wasn't even able to clean the outdoor bath that day.

181
00:10:16.854 --> 00:10:21.054
Did the two make any strange moves that day?

182
00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:23.254
No, I didn't notice anything in particular.

183
00:10:23.254 --> 00:10:27.854
But, they seem a bit different from the usual this time.

184
00:10:28.254 --> 00:10:31.954
Mr. Nakama didn't have a goatee before.

185
00:10:31.954 --> 00:10:35.854
And Ms. Koyanagi wasn't wearing glasses.

186
00:10:35.854 --> 00:10:39.254
Maybe they just felt like changing how they looked?

187
00:10:39.254 --> 00:10:41.554
I guess so.

188
00:10:41.554 --> 00:10:44.954
This snow isn't letting up, though.

189
00:10:44.954 --> 00:10:45.954
True.

190
00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:47.954
Oh, no!

191
00:10:47.954 --> 00:10:51.554
One hour and 28 minutes have already passed since the corpse was found.

192
00:10:51.554 --> 00:10:53.054
We've got to solve the trick as soon as possible

193
00:10:53.054 --> 00:10:55.054
or the situation surrounding the crime scene will change

194
00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:56.354
because of the snow.

195
00:10:56.354 --> 00:11:00.054
How do you know the time so accurately?

196
00:11:00.054 --> 00:11:02.654
Because back then, it was dark for a while.

197
00:11:02.654 --> 00:11:04.954
My watch is a luminous painted watch,

198
00:11:04.954 --> 00:11:07.054
so I can see it clearly even in the dark...

199
00:11:08.054 --> 00:11:10.454
I see, so that's it!

200
00:11:10.454 --> 00:11:12.754
That's why back then, the perp...

201
00:11:13.154 --> 00:11:16.554
I don't know if this is the appropriate time to say this but...

202
00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:19.354
Would you like some Kudzu drink because it's cold?

203
00:11:19.354 --> 00:11:21.554
Oh, yes, by all means!

204
00:11:21.554 --> 00:11:22.854
It would really be warming!

205
00:11:23.754 --> 00:11:25.254
I see.

206
00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:28.354
So, that's the story.

207
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:31.254
Now I see the demon's...

208
00:11:31.254 --> 00:11:33.354
True colors...

209
00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:45.021
What? You want to recreate the crime?

210
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:48.621
Yeah. After hearing the Grand Master scream,

211
00:11:48.621 --> 00:11:51.921
we came to this outdoor bath that is the short cut to the annex,

212
00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:55.121
But since we had to cross the bath to get to the annex,

213
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:57.221
we went outside of the inn once

214
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:59.521
and decided to go from the back door.

215
00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:02.021
That was of course after we checked that

216
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:04.921
there were no transparent plates inside the water.

217
00:12:04.921 --> 00:12:07.021
Okay then, let's go outside once

218
00:12:07.021 --> 00:12:09.621
and go to the annex from the back door!

219
00:12:09.621 --> 00:12:12.121
Hey, aren't you going?

220
00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:15.621
Nope. Because it's cold outside and the annex is far!

221
00:12:15.621 --> 00:12:16.821
Gosh.

222
00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:22.321
And so we came to the annex through the back door.

223
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:23.821
But the lights of the annex were out

224
00:12:23.821 --> 00:12:26.321
because the breaker was shut down and it was pitch dark.

225
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:28.521
Having no other choice, we turned on the lights.

226
00:12:28.521 --> 00:12:31.121
And found the torn sliding paper door.

227
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:32.721
Then when we went inside,

228
00:12:32.721 --> 00:12:37.021
we found the Grand Master had been killed with the sickle!

229
00:12:37.621 --> 00:12:39.821
The progression of what happened is correct, right?

230
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:41.621
I think so.

231
00:12:41.621 --> 00:12:44.421
And where does this take us?

232
00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:47.121
Maybe he means that there's somebody who got here faster

233
00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:49.921
than the people who went through the back door?

234
00:12:49.921 --> 00:12:53.021
I mean, how come you're here?

235
00:12:53.021 --> 00:12:56.621
I came through the outdoor bath so I got here fast.

236
00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:59.021
-The outdoor bath? -Yes!

237
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:02.921
But your clothes don't look all that wet.

238
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:07.221
Don't tell me that you came naked and splashed through the water?

239
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:09.021
No.

240
00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:10.621
I ran!

241
00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:13.121
Over the water of the outdoor bath!

242
00:13:14.421 --> 00:13:16.521
You mean you can really run over it?

243
00:13:16.521 --> 00:13:17.721
Yes!

244
00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:19.421
I'll show you!

245
00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:20.621
Hey!

246
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:30.121
He went and ran over the water like he said!

247
00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:31.321
No joke?

248
00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:32.421
See!

249
00:13:32.421 --> 00:13:36.121
I'm sure there's some transparent plate or something in the water.

250
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:39.521
Hey. What's that?

251
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.921
I guess there're no plates.

252
00:13:43.921 --> 00:13:47.921
I mean, what's this slimy water anyway?

253
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:49.821
Kudzu water.

254
00:13:49.821 --> 00:13:51.021
Kudzu water?

255
00:13:51.021 --> 00:13:52.721
Right. More accurately said,

256
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:54.421
it's right in between liquid and solid matter

257
00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:56.421
before turning into kudzu.

258
00:13:56.421 --> 00:13:58.621
It's a phenomenon known as dialatancy.

259
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:03.021
When weak force is slowly applied, the outcome is a slimy liquid,

260
00:14:03.021 --> 00:14:05.221
but if strong force is applied at once,

261
00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:09.121
it solidifies and becomes hard!

262
00:14:09.921 --> 00:14:14.521
As proof of that, Kohei said he chased after the Kamaitachi

263
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.321
and almost drowned, right?

264
00:14:16.321 --> 00:14:20.421
That was because the water back then was the same as this!

265
00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:23.121
This is like quicksand, you see.

266
00:14:23.121 --> 00:14:24.521
True.

267
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:27.021
Then, the perp went through here too?

268
00:14:27.021 --> 00:14:28.021
Yeah!

269
00:14:28.921 --> 00:14:34.621
And after killing the Grand Master, the perp joined us.

270
00:14:34.621 --> 00:14:36.021
Isn't that right?

271
00:14:36.021 --> 00:14:38.521
Writer Ms. Midori Koyanagi.

272
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:42.321
That's why you shut down the breaker of the annex

273
00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:45.221
and went out of your way to slash the paper door.

274
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:47.521
Because with our attention on the torn paper door

275
00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:49.321
after turning on the light,

276
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.521
joining us without being noticed is easier.

277
00:14:51.521 --> 00:14:53.821
How was the kudzu powder brought here?

278
00:14:53.821 --> 00:14:55.521
I think you'd need a large amount of kudzu powder

279
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:57.621
to make this special water?

280
00:14:57.621 --> 00:15:01.121
It seems that the storeroom was burglarized a few days ago

281
00:15:01.121 --> 00:15:03.721
so I guess it was stolen back then.

282
00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:05.821
But, what was she going to do

283
00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:08.621
with this large amount of kudzu powder left in the water?

284
00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:11.221
The water in this hot spring flows directly from the source.

285
00:15:11.221 --> 00:15:14.221
So, it'll wash away on its own in time.

286
00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:16.421
Then, the person who messed up

287
00:15:16.421 --> 00:15:18.521
the decoration for Kohei's birthday party was also...

288
00:15:18.521 --> 00:15:20.221
Ms. Koyanagi.

289
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:22.921
Because if it hadn't been for that commotion,

290
00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:25.221
and the police didn't pull away from that storeroom,

291
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:27.921
she couldn't take the sickle out of that storeroom.

292
00:15:27.921 --> 00:15:32.021
But how did she crack the balloons that were decorated?

293
00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:33.521
The water pistol!

294
00:15:34.321 --> 00:15:39.321
Remember? Kohei said it smelled like the bathroom or detergent, right?

295
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:42.721
I think it was the smell of lemon or something.

296
00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:47.121
Maybe she put the juice of the fruit in the water pistol and fired.

297
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:49.321
Because the rubber of balloons are melted

298
00:15:49.321 --> 00:15:51.321
with the substance inside the juice of fruits.

299
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:54.821
The water pistol is also your late husband's belonging too, right?

300
00:15:54.821 --> 00:15:57.821
Wasn't it in the storeroom together with the air gun?

301
00:15:57.821 --> 00:15:58.821
Yes.

302
00:15:58.821 --> 00:16:02.021
I think you've already forgotten

303
00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:06.921
but my cheek was slashed by someone inside the storeroom!

304
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:10.621
And I wasn't standing near the light bulb when it cracked.

305
00:16:10.621 --> 00:16:12.721
In the first place, as to the trick you just mentioned,

306
00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:15.821
anybody other than I could've done it, no?

307
00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:17.321
The chewing gum.

308
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:20.821
You stuck it onto the light bulb, didn't you?

309
00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:23.221
By deliberately hitting your head against it, right?

310
00:16:23.221 --> 00:16:25.121
Pretending to be annoyed.

311
00:16:25.121 --> 00:16:29.521
The science teacher said that when something sticks onto old light bulbs

312
00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:33.521
and there is a difference in the surface temperature, they crack easily!

313
00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:36.521
And besides I think that the perp

314
00:16:36.521 --> 00:16:40.921
slashed out using the light from Heiji's luminal wristwatch

315
00:16:40.921 --> 00:16:45.821
and Pops Kogoro's cigarette light as a guide.

316
00:16:45.821 --> 00:16:50.021
Why were you, who had nothing that gave off light on, get slashed?

317
00:16:50.021 --> 00:16:52.021
That's...

318
00:16:52.021 --> 00:16:54.821
Because you slashed yourself.

319
00:16:54.821 --> 00:16:58.821
With the blade or something that you had embedded in your nail!

320
00:16:58.821 --> 00:17:00.321
As to the blood that was on the nail,

321
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:02.721
if you touched your cheek that was slashed,

322
00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.221
everybody would be deceived.

323
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:05.421
Besides, you're the one

324
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:08.621
who got everyone to go to the storeroom in the first place.

325
00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:10.921
You did all this, made everyone believe that

326
00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:12.721
Kamaitachi existed and had them call the police.

327
00:17:12.721 --> 00:17:15.321
Then, you messed up the room that was decorated for the birthday party

328
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:17.821
using your air gun and water pistol

329
00:17:17.821 --> 00:17:20.921
to get the police away from the storeroom.

330
00:17:20.921 --> 00:17:25.321
After everyone gathered in front of the decorated room,

331
00:17:25.321 --> 00:17:28.321
you played the scream of the Grand Master.

332
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:31.821
Played?

333
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:35.021
Yeah! She recorded the scream of the Grand Master

334
00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:38.121
when the TV station came over on her smartphone or something

335
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:40.721
and set the time, then played it.

336
00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:42.721
And to complete the scenario

337
00:17:42.721 --> 00:17:44.721
while we used the back door to go to the annex,

338
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:48.821
she ran over the water and got to the annex before us,

339
00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:52.321
where, she stabbed and killed the Grand Master with the sickle!

340
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.221
All she had to do after that was slash the paper door

341
00:17:55.221 --> 00:17:58.121
and shutdown the breaker, and join us who got there later.

342
00:17:58.121 --> 00:17:59.921
If the police were there at that time,

343
00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:01.621
they would prove that she wouldn't have been able to

344
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:04.421
commit the crime.

345
00:18:04.421 --> 00:18:05.921
Am I wrong somewhere?

346
00:18:05.921 --> 00:18:10.421
Wrong or not, you've got no proof of anything like that!

347
00:18:10.421 --> 00:18:14.621
Don't you normally wear contacts, Miss?

348
00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:19.321
Because Takami said that you didn't wear glasses before.

349
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:22.121
When people who aren't used to, suddenly wear fake nails,

350
00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:26.521
they mentioned on TV that wearing contacts is difficult.

351
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:30.021
Isn't that why you decided to wear glasses today?

352
00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:34.421
In other words, it means that you usually don't wear fake nails.

353
00:18:34.421 --> 00:18:37.921
So, you probably don't have spare nails on you, right?

354
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:40.621
Which means it should still be there,

355
00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:47.421
the blood that got on it when you slashed Pops and me with it!

356
00:18:50.121 --> 00:18:55.021
But why would you do that to Grand Master?

357
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:57.021
That chapped skin...

358
00:18:57.421 --> 00:18:59.721
My mother had it too.

359
00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:03.521
Because that Grand Master used to be hard on her.

360
00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:05.921
Then, maybe that head waitstaff

361
00:19:05.921 --> 00:19:10.421
that was fired by the Grand Master in the past was your...

362
00:19:10.421 --> 00:19:11.621
Yes, that's right.

363
00:19:11.621 --> 00:19:13.421
She was my mother!

364
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:18.121
My mother found another work place right away but...

365
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:21.121
The bad reputation that she was fired here spread,

366
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:23.321
so no other inns would hire her.

367
00:19:23.821 --> 00:19:27.421
And in order to feed me, she had to suffer a lot

368
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:30.121
and died two years later.

369
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:32.621
But, why did he fire her?

370
00:19:32.621 --> 00:19:34.221
Because there was talk of marriage

371
00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:38.221
of the young master here who was intimate with my mother.

372
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:41.021
She was the only daughter of an inn

373
00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:43.021
and if they got married, they could merge the two inns

374
00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:44.621
and enlarge it.

375
00:19:44.621 --> 00:19:46.921
Don't tell me that it's...

376
00:19:46.921 --> 00:19:48.921
Right! If you weren't around,

377
00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:52.921
my mother would never have had to go through such hard times!

378
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:56.421
You were one of my targets too!

379
00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:02.821
But when I saw your chapped hands just like my mother had,

380
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:04.721
I decided against it.

381
00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:07.921
Besides, I didn't want that boy

382
00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:10.421
who was about to drown in the outdoor bath

383
00:20:10.421 --> 00:20:13.621
to go through what I did either.

384
00:20:15.221 --> 00:20:16.221
Which means that

385
00:20:16.221 --> 00:20:18.221
you were the one who took a picture of that Kamaitachi

386
00:20:18.221 --> 00:20:20.121
and sent it to the magazine company?

387
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:22.321
Yes. I wanted to experiment

388
00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:25.021
whether I could really run over the water too, besides.

389
00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:27.421
I thought that if the rumor of Kamaitachi went around,

390
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:30.021
people would stop coming to this outdoor bath

391
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.321
and I could work the trick out easier.

392
00:20:32.321 --> 00:20:34.821
But, why Kamaitachi?

393
00:20:34.821 --> 00:20:38.021
Because the start of her grudge was chapped skin, maybe?

394
00:20:38.921 --> 00:20:42.121
The cause of Kamaitachi used to previously be thought that

395
00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:44.121
the skin was slashed due to the vacuum

396
00:20:44.121 --> 00:20:47.021
that was created in the center of the whirlwind,

397
00:20:47.021 --> 00:20:51.121
but now it is said that the temperature of the surface of the skin

398
00:20:51.121 --> 00:20:53.921
is cooled in an instant due to heat vaporization

399
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:56.421
and that causes the skin to break open.

400
00:20:56.421 --> 00:21:00.221
That's why there are many Kamaitachi legends in snow countries.

401
00:21:01.221 --> 00:21:04.321
I heard about it on a TV program on demons.

402
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:27.621
See.

403
00:22:27.621 --> 00:22:31.021
I erased the audio data file like I promised.

404
00:22:31.021 --> 00:22:32.421
"File deleted" -Thanks!

405
00:22:32.421 --> 00:22:34.721
You're such a good boy, Conan!

406
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:35.921
Hattori.

407
00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:38.421
I heard from Kazuha!

408
00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:42.321
You said, "Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?", right?

409
00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:45.121
What, that again?

410
00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:49.321
I didn't say 'my girl', I said darn it.

411
00:22:49.321 --> 00:22:52.121
I said, "Darn it, what did you do to Kazuha?"

412
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:53.721
That's what I said!

413
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:58.421
After all, Kazuha is like a little sister to me.

414
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:01.721
My... darn it...

415
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:03.521
Well, that's the story!

416
00:23:04.821 --> 00:23:07.021
-You idiot imbecile, Heiji! -Just what did you say?

417
00:23:07.021 --> 00:23:09.021
-Kazuha? -It takes an idiot to know one.

418
00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:10.521
Idiot...

419
00:23:10.521 --> 00:23:12.521
Idiot Heiji!

420
00:23:13.521 --> 00:23:15.321
In the first place,

421
00:23:15.321 --> 00:23:18.821
Kudo gets to confess his love in front of the Big Ben in London.

422
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:20.221
So, how could I ever say that

423
00:23:20.221 --> 00:23:21.921
I confessed to something as important as that

424
00:23:21.921 --> 00:23:24.321
on the Ebisu Bridge, idiot?

425
00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:28.821
Oh, by the way, as to that audio data.

426
00:23:28.821 --> 00:23:33.021
The members of the Detective Squad dubbed it and have it too.

427
00:23:33.421 --> 00:23:36.321
Haibara is using it as her ringtone.

428
00:23:36.721 --> 00:23:39.621
Ringtone?

429
00:23:39.621 --> 00:23:42.421
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

430
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.321
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

431
00:23:45.721 --> 00:23:48.521
Just what did you do to my girl, Kazuha?

432
00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:56.121
I'm Bishamonten.

433
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:58.921
The woodpecker strategy, Ran!

434
00:23:58.921 --> 00:24:01.121
One-eyed?

435
00:24:01.621 --> 00:24:04.121
Wipe out the woodpecker.

436
00:24:04.121 --> 00:24:06.021
Don't you know?

437
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:09.121
They said that you may have to shoot them.

438
00:24:09.121 --> 00:24:13.021
Don't tell me... he is really...

439
00:24:13.521 --> 00:24:15.121
I am the god of war.

440
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:17.321
Next Conan,

441
00:24:17.321 --> 00:24:21.221
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 1)"

442
00:24:21.864 --> 00:24:24.064
Next Conan's Hint:

443
00:24:24.064 --> 00:24:26.164
"Kawanakajima"

444
00:24:26.564 --> 00:24:27.564
Once more.

445
00:24:27.564 --> 00:24:29.264
Hey, what art thou doing to Kazuha?

446
00:24:29.264 --> 00:24:31.264
I don't think it's working.
