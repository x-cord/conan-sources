(Massachusetts, USA)

2
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,700
Boy wonder Hiroki Sawada, at a tender age of 10,

3
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,900
is a graduate student at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,980
His development of the method of
tracking a person's ancestors

5
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,720
using skin and blood data,

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,800
called the "DNA Search Program",
was a recent amazing accomplishment.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,960
And Hiroki is now developing a mechanical brain,

8
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,700
which grows five human years in a span of one year.

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,990
This is been fully supported by the top of the IT industry,

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,000
Schindler Company president, Thomas Schindler.

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,700
Hiroki's parents divorced two years ago.

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,900
Hiroki parted with his father

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,200
and moved to America with his education-minded mother.

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,080
With his mother died of an illness,
and Hiroki was left all by himself,

15
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,600
Mr. Schindler became Hiroki's adoptive father.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,100
It is said that the mechanical brain Noah's Ark will be

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,200
the greatest invention in the history of humankind.

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,200
And Hiroki is placed in tight security.

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,200
He's not allowed to play in the park like a normal child.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,100
Noah's Ark is a reference to Noah's ark in the Old Testament.

21
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,900
God created a big flood to purge corruption from the world,

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,000
and only Noah, who had followed God's way,

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,200
was allowed to create an ark

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,500
that his family and a variety of animals could ride.

25
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
So that they could escape the big flood.

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,400
(Noah's Ark)

27
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,700
Boss, there's something strange.

28
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,800
The phone line. It looks like the program data...

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
Hiroki, what are you doing?

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,500
Noah's Ark sailed out.

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,300
Goodbye, my friend.

32
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,500
Open up, Hiroki!

33
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,800
What are you doing?

34
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,100
Hiroki!

35
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,900
Hiroki!

36
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,700
Will I be able to fly like Noah's Ark?

37
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,500
Hiroki, where are you?

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,900
Hiroki!

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,700
Boss!

40
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,600
Look at that!

(Detective Conan
The Phantom of Baker Street)

44
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,400
I am a high school detective, Shinichi Kudo.

45
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,100
When I went to the amusement park

46
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
with my childhood friend, Ran Mouri,

47
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,900
I witnessed a suspicious transaction made by a man in black.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was too preoccupied with watching at that time,

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,200
and didn't notice another accomplice approaching from behind.

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,100
He made me take the poison by force.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,100
When I woke up,

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
my body became smaller.

53
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,000
If those guys knew that Shinichi Kudo was still alive,

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
not only would my life be in danger,

55
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,800
but I would also endanger my families and friends around me.

56
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,540
At the suggestion of Professor Agasa,

57
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,000
I concealed my true identity.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
When Ran asked for my name,

59
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,000
without time to think it over, I took the name of Conan Edogawa.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,900
In order to collect information about those guys,

61
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,100
I moved in with Ran whose father is a detective.

62
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,100
Are you ready?

63
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Among them, the only one who knows my real identity,

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
except the Professor,

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,700
is Ai Haibara.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,500
She used to work with those men in black,

67
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
but when she escaped from the organization,

68
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,700
she took the same drug as me,

69
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,100
so her body has also become smaller.

70
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,600
And these are my parents who, no matter how old they are,

71
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
always like playing pranks and always act like little children.

72
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,300
My father is a world-renowned mystery novelist.

73
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,200
Speaking of the "Dark Baron" series by Yusaku Kudo,

74
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,700
it's universally known to all the reasoning enthusiasts.

75
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,200
My mother, Yukiko Kudo, was a legendary idol actress

76
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
who retired and got married at the age of 20.

77
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,400
But now she's just a nagging granny.

78
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,400
For now, I am ostensibly the child of their distant relatives.

79
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,500
I haven't seen them lately.

80
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,300
I don't know how my parents are doing.

81
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm doing well.

82
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,300
Although my body is smaller, my mind is still flexible.

83
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,300
I am the famous omniscient detective.

84
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,900
Only one truth will prevail!

(Beika City Hall)

87
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
Right here, at the Beika City Hall,

88
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,500
Japanese game makers and Schindler Company

89
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,400
will soon hold the grand first presentation

90
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,900
of their co-developed virtual experience game.

91
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,600
President Schindler of Schindler Company has arrived at the site.

92
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,700
According to the information sent to us,

93
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,200
this game, also nicknamed "Cocoons",

94
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,900
allows players to enter the cocoon-like capsules

95
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,400
and play in the virtual world

96
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,900
under hypnosis while conversing with the game

97
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,900
that has a voice recognition system.

98
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,650
We can say that this game is a collection of

99
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,000
the essence of the latest technology.

100
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,400
The game provides five scenarios for players to enjoy.

101
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,100
What exactly is this virtual world really like?

102
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,200
The children will find out the answer after today's experience.

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,000
The presentation will not be open to the public.

104
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,200
50 children from junior high and elementary schools

105
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
selected to participate

106
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,200
will be the first to experience "Cocoons" in Japan.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,100
I can't understand!

108
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
It's just a presentation on an ordinary video game.

109
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,500
Why are they making such a big deal about it?

110
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,700
I heard that even before this presentation,

111
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,600
there are already many commercial spies working on it.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,800
It's said that the emergence of "Cocoons"

113
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,000
will change the whole video game world in one fell swoop.

114
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
What's that thing?

115
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600
Could it be that...

116
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
those are "Cocoons"?

117
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
I want to play "Cocoons" too!

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,300
That's impossible.

119
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,800
Although we were invited to this party,

120
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,000
we weren't chosen to experience "Cocoons".

121
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,800
But, actually, to experience historical events in the game

122
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,700
is quite interesting to me.

123
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,600
Yeah!

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,200
It feels like we travel back in time, right?

125
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,000
It's just a game, that's all.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,700
Conan-kun, you're not good at video games, right?

127
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,100
You haven't even finished the "Space Dragon" yet.

128
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,700
I guess your fingers are not very nimble.

129
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Stop nagging.

130
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,700
(At the party venue)

131
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,000
So many people! And so much wine!

132
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,800
Dad!

133
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,400
The top brass in the police department seems to be here too.

134
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,800
Don't drink too much.

135
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,500
I know.

136
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,900
I won't get drunk on the finest wines.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600
That's not what she meant.

138
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,300
This is an all-you-can-eat buffet, isn't it?

139
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,500
I guess so.

140
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Lucky me! Lucky me!

141
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,800
The lucky ones should be those kids.

142
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,400
Look, they're getting their badges for the game.

143
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,080
I guess they are the kids

144
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,000
who were selected to participate in the game.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,170
Grandson of the deputy director of

146
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,500
Metropolitan Police Department.

147
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Grandson of a capitalist in the financial world.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,400
Son of a ruling party politician.

149
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,920
The second and third generations responsible for Japan's future

150
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,400
are all here.

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,200
I can feel people jealously staring at us.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,300
This is the epitome of the ugly hereditary rule in Japan.

153
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,800
Along with this hereditary rule,

154
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,300
the history of human evil will be repeated again and again.

155
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,800
I don't know what any of those words mean, Haibara-san.

156
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,500
Haibara.

157
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,300
Didn't I tell you to speak like a child?

158
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,000
The son of a politician will become a politician.

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,800
And the son of a banker will become a banker.

160
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,500
At this rate, no matter how long it takes,

161
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,600
Japan will not change.

162
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,100
Blah, blah, blah...

163
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,000
There were a lot of things like that in yesterday's news.

164
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,300
How's that? Happy now?

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,100
So scary.

166
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,300
Ran!

167
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,600
Sonoko.

168
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,100
Hi, boys and girls.

169
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,900
Sonoko-san, is that badge...

170
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,000
You mean this one?

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,700
Did you get chosen too?

172
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,100
Because our Suzuki Group also financed their game development.

173
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,000
That's so nice.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
I want it too!

175
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,700
Give up!

176
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,500
We are not in the same position.

177
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,400
Come to think of it, were you really invited?

178
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,000
How can you be that rude?

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,300
I personally invited these kids, okay?

180
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,200
Isn't this the young lady from the Suzuki Group?

181
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,900
You know what,

182
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,100
a person's life has been determined since birth.

183
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Even beautiful clothes choose their owners.

185
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,730
Those who are not chosen can only stand around,

186
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,900
look at us with envy, that's all.

187
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,400
These guys are really annoying.

188
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,000
Dad, you should come teach them a lesson!

189
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,900
Listen up, youngsters.

190
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,300
Don't be this naive about life.

191
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,200
Even in a seemingly smooth life, there can be pitfalls.

192
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,400
You will see what I am saying when you grow up.

193
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,100
Like your wife would run away or something?

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
I know things about you.

195
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
Sleeping Kogoro.

196
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,050
It's because your wife run away while you were asleep

197
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,700
that you got this nickname, right?

198
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,500
You brats...

199
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,700
It's not while sleeping!

200
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,900
Mom left while Dad was in the bathroom.

201
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,700
Am I right?

202
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,700
You are not making this better.

203
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
Come on, let's play a mini soccer game.

204
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,500
Thinking of these kids inheriting their fathers' businesses

205
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,000
and being Japan's future leaders,

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
the future seems really hopeless.

207
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,400
I feel the same way.

208
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,600
What are you doing?

209
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Give it back to me.

210
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,300
You're disturbing other guests.

211
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,400
If you want to play, go outside.

212
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,100
Who are you, old man?

213
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,900
I'm the development director of "Cocoons", Kashimura.

214
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,700
It's because my grandfather's sponsorship

215
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
that you're able to complete this game, isn't it?

216
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,500
Didn't your parents ever teach you about public morality

217
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,800
and how to talk to seniors?

218
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,600
Look how cocky you are!

219
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
We don't lend you any more money!

220
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Old man, I guess you don't know us, do you?

221
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
If you dare to mess with us,

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,600
you'll lose your job tomorrow!

223
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,200
Well, then before that,

224
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,900
I'll get you out of here first.

225
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
Go.

226
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,700
Wow, what a handsome man!

227
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Not like someone else.

228
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,900
Shinichi should be here too.

229
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,200
You haven't seen each other in so long,

230
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,300
you must be looking forward to a father-son reunion, right?

231
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,000
Professor, please keep our relationship under wraps.

232
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,700
I know it.

233
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,700
Ladies and gentlemen, please take note of the stage.

234
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:03,500
Now, Mr. Yusaku Kudo, who helped design the scenes for "Cocoons",

235
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,600
has already arrived from the United States.

236
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,200
Oh boy, he's finally back!

237
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,200
I just wondered where you'd been this month.

238
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,200
So you went to help with my father's work.

239
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,400
I went to help him finish the final stage of the project.

240
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,900
Where's my mom?

241
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,700
She said she hadn't been back to Japan for too long.

242
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,000
So she went to a classmates' party.

243
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,100
Here, your gift.

244
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
The badge for the game?

245
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm happy, though,

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,800
I can't go playing this game alone.

247
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,100
I was just thinking you'd love it.

248
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
Although it's still not public yet,

249
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
this game is set in London a hundred years ago,

250
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,600
that is to say, in the late 19th century.

251
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
London a hundred years ago?

252
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Dad hasn't changed at all. He still loves that world that much.

253
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,100
You are just the same as your father.

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,900
So dark.

255
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,300
I can't see anything.

256
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,300
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,400
Annoying.

258
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,100
Don't run around in the dark, okay?

259
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,600
Next,

260
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,900
please enjoy this next-generation game machine, "Cocoon".

261
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,200
This capsule is equipped with five kinds of human senses.

262
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,400
Whether sense of touch, sense of pain, or sense of smell,

263
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,940
all the senses will expose players to a world

264
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,200
exactly the same as the reality

265
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,300
It stimulates the central nervous system through electricity,

266
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
which is completely harmless to the human body.

267
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,800
It's so boring to stand by and watch.

268
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,900
Only by participating in can the game be fun.

269
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,400
Oh, you're all here.

270
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,800
So, just to kill time, let's guess a riddle.

271
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
Here he goes again.

272
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,400
The Professor's classic boring riddle that makes people cold.

273
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,500
Run away?

274
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,100
He must have worked hard to come up with it.

275
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,400
Let's just let him speak it out.

276
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,500
Mr. A of this game company

277
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,800
couldn't help but get totally hooked on

278
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,400
playing "Cocoons" at work.

279
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,200
After seeing that scene, what would his boss do with Mr. A?

280
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,500
First, commended him for winning the game.

281
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,500
Second, fired him for playing the game at work.

282
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,270
Third, let him keep sleeping in "Cocoon"

283
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,500
because he was sleeping soundly.

284
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Third, let him keep sleeping.

285
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,600
Why?

286
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Because "Cocoon" looks like a cradle.

287
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,700
That's not true.

288
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
I choose the first, commend him.

289
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,800
That's not true either.

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,700
So the answer is the second, but why?

291
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,100
Ai-kun, you should know the reason, right?

292
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Can you explain it for me?

293
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm not wearing much today.

294
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
So please ask Edogawa-san for help.

295
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,300
Hey, she named you.

296
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
"Cocoon" is referring to the silkworm cocoon.

297
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,240
And the one who spits out the silk to make the cocoon

298
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:04,900
is the silkworm (kaiko in Japanese).

299
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,200
In other words,

300
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,700
Kaiko has another meaning in Japanese, that is, dismissal.

301
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,800
So cold.

302
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,800
I'll go get a hot drink.

303
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,200
I'll go with you.

304
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,300
I'll go too.

305
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,700
Strange.

306
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,190
Seems like the air conditioner

307
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,000
is blowing too much cold air for the kids.

308
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,100
Seven minutes left.

309
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,700
It's a nice bronze statue, isn't it?

310
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,100
I heard this is Mr. Schindler's favorite one of his collections.

311
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh...

312
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,800
He even went to all that trouble to move it here.

313
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,700
It seems he really likes it.

314
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,320
It's not that common to find a bronze statue of this kind

315
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,000
with such a feeling of aggressiveness.

316
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,100
He may think that it's just like himself.

317
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm screwed.

318
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Hideki, don't play soccer here.

319
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,500
I see.

320
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,500
We were a bit out of line, I guess.

321
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,000
We were not.

322
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,900
They all look like some bargains.

323
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,000
No way!

324
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,030
How could they possibly put expensive things

325
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,300
in this kind of place?

326
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,100
You got a good point.

327
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,100
Tadahashi Kashimura, the development director of "Cocoons",

328
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,300
is a good college friend of mine.

329
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,300
Thanks to this cooperation,

330
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
we had a chance to rekindle our old friendship.

331
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,800
Thank you.

332
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,000
TMS Shimuzu reports.

333
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,500
Where is Mr. Kashimura?

334
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,000
I'd like to see him.

335
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,600
Okay, I'm gonna go find him right now.

336
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Mr. Kudo.

337
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,300
Autograph here, please.

338
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,400
Mr. Kudo, please give me an autograph too.

339
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm happy to see that you look well.

340
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,900
You, too.

341
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,200
(Kashimura's Office)

342
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,400
I gotta get back to the venue right away.

343
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
So let's get down to business, all right?

344
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,800
The DNA Search Program Hiroki gave to you...

345
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
How much are you going to sell it?

346
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm not trying to extort money from you.

347
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,900
I just want you to atone for your sins.

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,900
Hiroki found out that thing.

349
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,900
The thing that would destroy the Schindler Empire.

350
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
Your secret...

351
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,600
But without Hiroki's ability, you had no way to complete AI.

352
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,300
So you pushed Hiroki to work on it,
forced him to finish it as soon as possible.

353
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,900
The morning just after completing AI,

354
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Hiroki, under great mental pressure at that time,

355
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,200
thought he would be killed by you soon.

356
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,700
That's why he released Noah's Ark,
which can be considered another him,

357
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,300
through the phone line,

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,800
and then jumped from the top floor of his apartment.

359
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,600
Soon thereafter,

360
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,600
my computer was hacked by the DNA Search Project.

361
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,300
It was the work of Noah's Ark, the successor to Hiroki's spirit.

362
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,600
I think it was a cry from Hiroki's spirit to me.

363
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,500
I will atone for my sins.

364
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,400
I will make all this come to light.

365
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,900
I am willing to accept any due punishments.

366
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,300
But before that, can I take a look at it?

367
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,300
I mean that DNA Search Project that you said Noah's Ark sent you.

368
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,200
Okay.

369
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,500
This is the one who traveled time and space to modern times,

370
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,100
the phantom of London.

371
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
My name is Noah's Ark.

372
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Director, Mr. Kudo wants to see you.

373
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Director.

374
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,700
Forgive my rudeness.

375
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,200
Director!

376
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,800
What happened, Director?

377
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,000
So, what is it this time?

378
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,000
Now...

379
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,600
please enjoy the performance

380
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,200
of our special guest today, Miss Yoko Okino.

381
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,300
What? Yoko's here too?

382
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,800
I gotta go grab the front-row seat!

383
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
Chiba, block all entrances and exits.

384
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Yes, sir.

385
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,500
Attention, all vehicles on standby!

386
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,100
Seems like there's a lot of big shots here.

387
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah.

388
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
Deputy Director of Metropolitan Police Department.

389
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Industrialist from the financial world.

390
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
There are also a few council members.

391
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,400
We must be careful.

392
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,200
Awesome!

393
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,100
Golden Superman Cards!

394
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,800
They're already unavailable on the market.

395
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,000
I want them!

396
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,900
You can exchange these cards for game badges.

397
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
But I want to play the game too.

398
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,000
You still have the chance to play "Cocoons" later,

399
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,600
but you know, if you miss

400
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,800
this golden card this time

401
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,700
you may never get it again.

402
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
What should we do?

403
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
Haibara, we've got them!

404
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,300
Look, this one is for you!

405
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,200
Wow, you guys are really something!

406
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,100
In order to have common topics with you guys,

407
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,600
maybe it's not a bad idea to participate.

408
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
Excuse me, got to get by.

409
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,300
Kashimura?

410
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,000
Take me there, please.

411
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,900
Yes, sir.

412
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,600
All right, sorry to keep you waiting.

413
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,900
Please make your way to the venue where "Cocoons" are placed.

414
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,500
Where's dad and Conan-kun?

415
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Officer!

416
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,300
Oh, Mouri.

417
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,800
You're here too!

418
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,700
I was trying to sober up on the balcony,

419
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,500
but then I saw the police cars.

420
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,300
He is the development director of "Cocoons".

421
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,200
He was stabbed in the heart and died.

422
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,300
The murder weapon was taken away.

423
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,400
The blood was wiped off.

424
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,200
The murder weapon is probably
something important to the murderer.

425
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,800
Or perhaps the murderer would be exposed if the weapon was left.

426
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,100
But then again,

427
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,900
why would the development director stay in this kind of basement?

428
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,200
Yes.

429
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,300
Director said he couldn't concentrate in a place
with a lot of people coming and going.

430
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,000
That's why he was here alone.

431
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,700
There's blood on the R, T and J.

432
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,100
Well, actually, there's another inexplicable thing.

433
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,700
All the data on the hard drive was destroyed.

434
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,800
Data?

435
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,300
This is the act of rival company's sabotage.

436
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,600
But if so, that's too late, isn't it?

437
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,100
Because "Cocoons" has already been completed.

438
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,800
When did you get in here, little brat?

439
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,800
Could the keyboard on the desk
be the message he left before he died?

440
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,600
What?

441
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,900
There's blood on the keyboard.

442
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,600
He probably pressed these keys just before he died.

443
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,400
R, T, J.

444
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,900
JR and JT.

445
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,100
Tram and cigarette?

446
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,100
RTJ.

447
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,800
TJR.

448
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,300
TRJ.

449
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,200
JTR.

450
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,100
JTR.

451
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,400
London a hundred years ago.

452
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,500
Could it be?

453
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,800
Isn't that Conan-kun?

454
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,400
Why is Conan-kun in the game participants' group?

455
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,300
Here.

456
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It's okay. You can go participate for me.

457
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,500
You care about that boy, right?

458
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,200
You're his protector.

459
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,300
But Sonoko, you...

460
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,700
It's okay. It's okay.

461
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,200
I'm not interested at all.

462
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,400
All 50 participants are on board.

463
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,600
Brainwave transmission set.

464
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,900
Capsule shells closed.

465
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,900
Main hardware connecting.

466
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,600
Area code in progress.

467
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,900
Coupler connecting.

468
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,800
Fine-tuning of coordinate axes in progress.

469
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,600
Adjustment of coordinate points has been done.

470
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,500
Locked.

471
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,800
Screen display. System on.

472
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,700
Energy setting has been done.

473
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,700
Game start.

474
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,800
It should be there.

475
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,800
In this game,

476
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,900
there should be a key to solve this murder mystery.

477
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Kashimura!

478
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,200
I heard that Kashimura-san was your old friend.

479
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,800
Do you know anyone who might want him dead?

480
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,600
I thought you were with him,

481
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,500
that boy with the glasses?

482
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,100
You mean Conan?

483
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,600
He was here a while ago,

484
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,800
but after seeing the death message left on the keyboard,

485
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,900
his face suddenly changed

486
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,600
Death message?

487
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,800
JTR?

488
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,100
What did you say?

489
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,600
Could it be that Conan-kun used the gift I gave him?

490
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800
Let's go, Professor.

491
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,000
Wait...wait a minute, Yusaku-kun!

492
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,700
What exactly do these three letters mean?

493
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,400
This is short for a character who will appear in the game.

494
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,200
That's what Kashimura and I call him.

495
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,900
Jack the Ripper?

496
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,000
Right.

497
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:58,100
He was a murderer who actually existed in London
at the end of the 19th century,

498
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,100
an insane murderer who killed five women with a knife

499
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,500
and caused a great panic in the city of London at that time.

500
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,200
In the end, the London police still failed to arrest him.

501
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,600
This serial killer remains a mystery.

502
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,800
Judging from Kashimura's death message,

503
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:19,000
Conan should have found out that
there are clues of the culprit in the game.

504
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,400
Mr. Schindler,

505
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,800
this is Inspector Megure from the Metropolitan Police Department.

506
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,800
Metropolitan Police Department?

507
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
What do you want from me, officer?

508
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,000
Please suspend the game.

509
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Suspend?

510
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,700
Ridiculous.

511
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,900
Mr. Schindler.

512
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,500
Something wrong happened to the system.

513
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,200
What?

514
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,900
It's out of control.

515
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,200
Let me get by.

516
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,800
What is it?

517
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,300
Ran!

518
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,000
What are you doing in there?

519
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,500
My name is Noah's Ark.

520
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,700
What?

521
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,100
My name is Noah's Ark.

522
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,300
The game can't be stopped.

523
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,100
The virtual experience game, "Cocoons"

524
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,900
has been under my control.

525
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,700
What... What is this?

526
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,100
What is "Noah's Ark"?

527
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,400
All I know is that it seems to be an artificial intelligence

528
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,900
which grows five human years in a span of one year, right?

529
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,400
Right.

530
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,300
It was completed two years ago

531
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,600
by Hiroki, whom I loved like my own son.

532
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,500
So I think it must be the same age as Hiroki now.

533
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,400
Noah's Ark.

534
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,900
Why do you control the children's game?

535
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Because I want to

536
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,000
give Japan a new life.

537
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,900
What?

538
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Conan-kun!

539
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,100
Ran-nee-chan?

540
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,600
Why are you here?

541
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,000
Because I'm worried about you!

542
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,100
Conan-kun!

543
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,700
Even you guys are here?

544
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,500
It took us a lot of efforts to get here.

545
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,200
After all that talk,

546
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,600
it turns out that you want to play this game too.

547
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,300
Yeah, I do.

548
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,700
But even though we're under hypnosis now,

549
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
we don't feel that way.

550
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,000
It's like we're dreaming.

551
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,900
We can even move around as we please.

552
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,100
But I see just the opposite.

553
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,800
There's no freedom at all.

554
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:38,900
All our senses of sight,

555
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,700
sound,

556
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,700
smell,

557
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,500
taste,

558
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,300
and touch

559
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,200
are controlled by the computer.

560
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
All right, everyone who's experiencing
"Cocoons" for the first time.

561
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,200
The game has begun.

562
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,800
My name is Noah's Ark.

563
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Nice to meet you.

564
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
Nice to meet you!

565
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,400
I'm going to show you
the demo videos of five different scenarios.

566
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,900
Please choose one world you want to play in.

567
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,900
But there is one thing to note.

568
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,300
This is not an ordinary video game,

569
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,600
but a game that relates to your lives.

570
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,300
Our lives?

571
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,200
If all of you are out of the game,

572
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,100
you'll never return to the real world.

573
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,600
So, you must take this game very seriously.

574
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,400
As long as one of you makes it to the end,

575
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
you will win.

576
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,200
All the kids who are out of the game before
will also be able to wake up

577
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,700
and go back to the real world.

578
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
This is the rule of the game I set.

579
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,700
Understand?

580
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,500
What's going on?

581
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,300
When all of you are out of the game,

582
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,500
I will release a special electromagnetic wave

583
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,900
to destroy your brains.

584
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,800
That is to say, the rebirth of Japan will bet on this game.

585
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,800
What does the rebirth of Japan mean?

586
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,400
Although you can't hear the sound of the real world here,

587
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
an adult just asked a question.

588
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,700
So I'll answer it.

589
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,700
If you look at yourself,

590
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
you'll see that the son of a dirty politician

591
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,900
will only become another dirty politician,

592
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,400
the kids of avaricious doctors

593
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,900
will only end up as such avaricious doctors.

594
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,000
To make Japan a better country,

595
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,100
we must cut off this kind of connection once and for all.

596
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,900
Stop this nonsense!

597
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,700
You don't have the right to decide human life, do you?

598
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,300
No, I don't.

599
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,400
Just like adults don't have the right to decide Hiroki's life.

600
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,400
All right, the kids have waited too long.

601
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,300
Almost time to start the game.

602
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,200
The first scenario, Vikings.

603
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,600
You will become Vikings who travel to seven seas

604
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,700
and challenge a variety of adventures
with a strong will and courage.

605
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,100
The second is the Paris-Dakar Rally.

606
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,500
You will participate with world-renowned drivers

607
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,300
and compete for the championship in this tough rally.

608
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,700
The third is the Ancient Roman Coliseum.

609
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,000
You will be armed with powerful weapons and armors

610
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,600
and see how great you are in the Roman Empire.

611
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,600
You must defeat the toughest demon warrior.

612
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,600
The fourth is Solomon's Treasures.

613
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
You will play jewel hunters

614
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,300
and search for Solomon's treasures buried around the world.

615
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,700
And finally, the fifth is London in the Olden Days.

616
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,700
Here you will experience a scary suspense story.

617
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,700
Your target is a serial killer

618
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,176
who appeared in London in 1888

619
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,100
and remains a mystery to this day,

620
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,200
Jack the Ripper.

621
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,400
Your mission is to bring him to justice.

622
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
As expected,

623
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,200
there seems to be a clue here.

624
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,800
A clue of the murderer who killed Kashimura.

625
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,800
If we're all out of the game,

626
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,900
are we really going to die?

627
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,700
Why is this happening to us?

628
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,900
It's not like I chose to become my father's child by myself.

629
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,900
I don't think I'll survive.

630
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,300
Everyone! Please try to make it to the end!

631
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Help me!

632
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,100
Pull yourself together, everyone!

633
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,200
Don't give up before the game is over.

634
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,300
That's right!

635
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,300
As long as one of us can make it to the end, we'll be fine.

636
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,500
Now let's start to pick the scenario
where we think we may have a chance of surviving.

637
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,300
I guess we have no choice but to take on this challenge.

638
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,200
Moroboshi-kun, which scenario are you going to choose?

639
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,400
Whatever.

640
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,900
(Solomon's Treasures)

641
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,600
(Paris-Dakar Rally)

642
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,800
(London in the Olden Days)

643
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,600
Are you gonna be with us?

644
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,600
Don't get in our way.

645
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,700
It should be us who say this.

646
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,400
All right, all right. No fighting.

647
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,400
In each scenario there is a character who will help you.

648
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,100
You can count on that person if you need to.

649
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,500
Then, game on!

650
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,700
Alright, let's go.

651
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,500
Okay.

652
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,100
How is it going, Professor?

653
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,700
"Cocoons" do store a very large amount of energy,

654
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,900
enough to destroy the brains of 50 people.

655
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,500
I don't have time to waste here.

656
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,700
I'm taking my son back.

657
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,200
I'll take my son back too.

658
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,500
Sir...

659
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,200
Get out of my way!

660
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,500
It's dangerous! Stop them!

661
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,800
Are you all right?

662
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,700
Did you get hurt?

663
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,700
No one will be allowed to interfere with the game.

664
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,300
I just gave them a little electric shock.

665
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,400
Next time, I won't be that gentle.

666
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,000
Damn, how can he be such a jerk!

667
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,100
But then again, Mr. Schindler...

668
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,900
How come Hiroki-kun's artificial intelligence

669
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,700
could become so out of control?

670
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,800
Well, it's because...

671
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
Let me explain.

672
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,600
The reason why Hiroki-kun left his father

673
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,100
and moved to America with his mother

674
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,000
is because he couldn't adapt to Japanese school education.

675
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Hey, Hiroki!

676
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,300
Because you're weak, I let you rest.

677
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,100
But I didn't say you could play on the computer.

678
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,900
It is said that the rigid educational institution

679
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,700
that inhibits the development of a child's individuality

680
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,300
sees Hiroki as a weird child who is addicted to computers.

681
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,400
Not only the educational institution,

682
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,100
even the entire Japan doesn't recognize individuality.

683
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,500
The reason why Hiroki wanted to develop artificial intelligence

684
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,000
is because he had experienced this kind of pain.

685
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,700
In other words, Hiroki committed suicide

686
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,900
before finding a way to give Japan a new life,

687
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,750
and the artificial intelligence Noah's Ark,
inherited his unfinished mission,

688
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,500
kept growing while fleeing,

689
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,600
and finally found this specific solution.

690
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,800
It believes that if it can seize
the opportunity of this game presentation

691
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,200
bringing together the second and third generations of Japan,

692
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
to destroy the social phenomenon of
"just following the path laid down by your parents",

693
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,900
Japan will change.

694
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,700
But Mr. Kudo, why do you know that?

695
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,800
In fact, over the past year,

696
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,300
I have been serving as the detective,
and Kashimura had been my client.

697
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,800
Detective?

698
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,400
What did he ask you to investigate?

699
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,600
He asked me to investigate Hiroki-kun's suicide again.

700
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,500
Are you saying that Hiroki didn't commit suicide,
but got killed by someone else?

701
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
No.

702
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,000
Judging from that situation, it should be a suicide.

703
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,900
But what drove Hiroki-kun to his death?

704
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,700
Kashimura asked me to investigate.

705
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,400
What was the relationship between Kashimura-san and Hiroki-kun?

706
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Kashimura was Hiroki-kun's father.

707
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,100
Am I right?

708
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Hiroki-kun parted from him when he was a child.

709
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,500
He never thought his son would die in that way.

710
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Kashimura had been blaming himself for that.

711
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Conan-kun and the others have entered the Whitchapel area.

712
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,300
Are we going in here?

713
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,400
Let's go.

714
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,000
Hurry up, please.

715
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
What are you doing?

716
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,100
Because you're moving too slow, Genta-kun!

717
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,900
Now we're at the city of flog, London.

718
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,800
It's not so much romantic as spooky.

719
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,600
Even the air feels dirty.

720
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,700
And it stinks.

721
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,200
London's fog

722
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,500
is not just a clean substance condensed from water vapor,

723
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,400
but a smog combining fog and soot

724
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,100
generated by burning coal and oil.

725
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,700
So there is already smog in this era.

726
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,700
Jack the Ripper!

727
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,100
Hey, Conan!

728
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,800
Stop!

729
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,600
I won't let you escape!

730
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
It hurts!

731
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Are you okay, Conan-kun?

732
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,800
It seems that Professor Agasa's invention

733
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,500
can not be used in the game world.

734
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,600
Indeed.

735
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,700
Although the antenna can still be retracted,

736
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,100
it's just an ordinary pair of glasses,

737
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,000
and this is also just an ordinary watch.

738
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Oh my god!

739
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,000
It's Jack the Ripper!

740
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,500
What is he saying?

741
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,200
Seems like he's speaking English.

742
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,100
Call the police!

743
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,500
Please switch to Japanese.

744
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,700
Yes, sir.

745
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,000
What's going on?

746
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,100
There's another victim.

747
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,300
This is already the third victim.

748
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,700
Ah, they speaks Japanese now!

749
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,200
It's exactly like the real world.

750
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,000
It's not just what we see and hear.

751
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,500
Even the cold air seems real.

752
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,900
Even the pain in my feet feels real.

753
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,300
Hey, get out of the way!

754
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,100
Stand back, please.

755
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,100
Hey, call Inspector Lestrade right away.

756
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,900
Yes, sir.

757
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,700
Inspector Lestrade?

758
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,500
Professor, can we talk to them?

759
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,300
I'll try.

760
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,500
Since you're in charge of developing this game.

761
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,700
You should know how to win this game, right?

762
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,700
I do.

763
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,500
A long as I can talk with them,

764
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,500
I'll give instructions to help them.

765
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Then this problem can be solved.

766
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,400
We'll definitely win this game!

767
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,600
But...

768
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,100
If Noah's Ark can predict things that haven't happened yet...

769
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,900
Professor, the rest is up to you.

770
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,200
I gotta go to the scene.

771
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,100
I see.

772
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,400
It just told us to catch the killer, that's all.

773
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,800
But where are we going to find him?

774
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,500
I guess we'll have to wait until dawn.

775
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,800
It's cold.

776
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,500
Put this on.

777
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,000
Is it okay?

778
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,500
So warm!

779
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,900
Haibara-san, please put on this coat.

780
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,800
Oh, thank you.

781
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,800
You're welcome.

782
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,300
Put this on.

783
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,400
But what about you, Genta-kun?

784
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,100
It's okay. The cold doesn't bother me.

785
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,200
Thank you.

786
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,700
Can you hear me, Conan-kun?

787
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
This is Agasa.

788
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,300
I can hear you, Professor.

789
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,200
Listen.

790
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:01,900
In this game, if you get hurt or get caught by the police,

791
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,800
you are out.

792
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Your current location is

793
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,900
near the Whitechapel area in East End.

794
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,700
If you want to find the character who can help you...

795
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,000
What's wrong?

796
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,300
What happened, Professor?

797
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,700
I can't hear you!

798
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,100
Catch me!

799
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,500
Conan, hold on!

800
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,200
It was so dangerous!

801
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
It seems that you haven't understood that

802
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,000
this game is totally under my control.

803
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,900
Don't try to cheat. It's useless.

804
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,000
I'll let you listen to the sound over there.

805
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,700
You can enjoy the cries of pain from your children.

806
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,500
How can there be such a nasty computer?

807
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,800
We can't hear Professor's voice now.

808
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,400
Looks like Noah's Ark has cut our communication with outside.

809
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,600
Then, how can we find the character who can help us?

810
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,400
Didn't the police tell us the answer?

811
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,200
Call Inspector Lestrade.

812
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,800
Could he be the same Inspector Lestrade in the novel?

813
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,900
But he's just a fictional character
in Conan Doyle's novel, isn't he?

814
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
It is possible that

815
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,900
this game is a world where reality and fiction
are integrated together.

816
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,000
So the person who can help us is...

817
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,600
Yeah, he should exist in this world.

818
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,900
That Sherlock Holmes.

819
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,900
Really? With Sherlock Holmes on our side,

820
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,400
it's like we have the help of 100 people.

821
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,800
We'll definitely win this round!

822
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,400
Let's get going. Go to Baker Street!

823
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,100
Good, as long as they meet Holmes...

824
00:45:55,100 --> 00:46:00,300
But it's really a long way
from the Whitechapel area to Baker Street.

825
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,400
Hey, don't you think that clock is a bit strange?

826
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,900
Its minute hand is going backwards.

827
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,300
Ah, it went backwards again.

828
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,000
50 changed to 49,

829
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,500
and then changed to 48.

830
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,100
I see.

831
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,700
That's the number of kids playing the game.

832
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,100
So two minutes backwards means...

833
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,400
two people are already out of the game in other scenarios?

834
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,100
Yasuhiro!

835
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,400
Two people were eliminated in the Vikings scenario.

836
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,600
Miyuki...

837
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,900
Mirekoga...

838
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,700
Now two people were eliminated in the Ancient Roman Coliseum.

839
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,500
Faster.

840
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,400
Get out of the game faster.

841
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,300
If those kids find out the real identity of Jack the Ripper,

842
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,400
I'm done.

843
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,100
Three more eliminated in Solomon's Treasures.

844
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,500
43 people left, right?

845
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,400
I heard in the alley of Miter Street.

846
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,600
there was another one killed.

847
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,600
Two cases within one hour.

848
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,400
That's the fourth one.

849
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
What a scary world.

850
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,200
It's horrible.

851
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,900
We've come to a scary time.

852
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,200
Although the end of the 19th century in London

853
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,400
was considered to be the last era of prosperity
of the British Empire,

854
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:59,600
actually, it was an era of the widest wealth gap,

855
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,400
rampant crimes,

856
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,900
and depravity of the people.

857
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,000
It reminded me that Shinichi once said,

858
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,600
if we referred to Sherlock Holmes as the light of the times,

859
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,500
then Jack the Ripper was the shadow of darkness.

860
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,200
Then let's go find the light of the times.

861
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,900
We're almost at Baker Street.

862
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,800
Watch out for Jack the Ripper!

863
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,000
He's waiting for you on the road at night.

864
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,100
If you don't want to die,

865
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,000
what should you do?

866
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,100
You must be covered in blood too.

867
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,400
What does that mean?

868
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,500
It means you must kill your rival before he kills you, right?

869
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,100
Covered in blood?

870
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,800
There's a metal detector at venue's entrance.

871
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,600
How did the culprit bring the murder weapon in?

872
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,600
We were not.

873
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,600
They all look like some bargains.

874
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
No way!

875
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,700
How could they possibly put expensive things
in this kind of place?

876
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,900
(Baker Street)
221B.

877
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,792
(Baker Street)
This is the place, right?

878
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,400
So this is where that Sherlock Holmes lives?

879
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,600
This is the apartment he rented with Dr. Watson.

880
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,900
Who is it this late?

881
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,900
I... I'm Ran Mouri.

882
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,200
I came for Mr. Holmes.

883
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,400
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson are away on a case.

884
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,400
On a case?

885
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,200
Oh, yes.

886
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,200
To a village called Dartmoor.

887
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,900
If you don't mind, what's the date?

888
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,500
September 30th.

889
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,900
September 30th, Dartmoor...

890
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
Oh, I remember.

891
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,700
It's the Hound of the Baskervilles case.

892
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,800
Yeah, both of them left London at this time.

893
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,400
Hey, Professor.

894
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,500
What exactly is going on?

895
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,900
Sorry to bother you.

896
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,000
Let me see the video around the time of the crime, please.

897
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Got it.

898
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,200
Yes.

899
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,300
What's going on?

900
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,100
Seems like we underestimated Noah's Ark before.

901
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,900
Neither Holmes nor Watson was in Baker Street.

902
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,800
So he really predicted it.

903
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:51,500
There was even a strange accordion-wielding
character that I didn't put in.

904
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,200
Things are not looking good.

905
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,600
Hey, what is the plot that you originally planned?

906
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,800
The player and Sherlock Holmes would work together

907
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,900
to find out the real identity of Jack the Ripper.

908
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,100
And they would finally found out that the monstrous serial killer

909
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,800
was an aristocrat with a terminal illness.

910
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,200
I've got an even better ending for you.

911
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,000
Damn it, if the kids win,

912
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,700
I swear I'll throw this computer into a large landfill!

913
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,300
Try you best, Shinichi!

914
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,300
It's you kids, right?

915
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,700
Two weeks ago,

916
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,800
you helped Mr. Holmes solve the case, didn't you?

917
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,700
Come on in, please.

918
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,300
I'll get you some hot milk tea.

919
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,400
Seems like she has mistaken us for someone else.

920
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,500
I see.

921
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,300
She must have confused us with the Baker Street Irregulars.

922
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,000
What's that?

923
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,300
It's a group of homeless kids hired by Sherlock Holmes.

924
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,700
They go into places where adults can't go to gather information.

925
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,500
All of them were brave kids.

926
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,900
So they're our Detective Boys' predecessors?

927
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
That's right.

928
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,600
They finally got into the apartment.

929
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Awesome!

930
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,400
It's exactly like what I saw on TV.

931
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,700
I'm so excited!

932
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,200
Shinichi would definitely be envious if he knew this.

933
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,500
He's so like Shinichi.

934
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,600
Oops, he's so like Sherlock Holmes.

935
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,400
He always thinks in this position!

936
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,200
So that's it.

937
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,400
He's just imitating Sherlock Holmes.

938
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,600
Then, before I'm done making tea,

939
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,800
you kids can enjoy yourself here.

940
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,500
Thank you.

941
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,900
Hey, this person in this photo really looks like someone.

942
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,500
Although he has hair, everyone can see that he's Professor Agasa.

943
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,700
They must be Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, right?

944
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,100
Dad and Professor...

945
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,100
Can you two be more childish?

946
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,100
Hey, we don't have time to waste here, right?

947
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,500
But, Moroboshi-kun,

948
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,300
what should we do now?

949
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,800
That four-eyed boy must know.

950
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,600
Since he's Sherlock Holmes,

951
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:29,000
he must have collected a lot of information
about Jack the Ripper.

952
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,500
Then, let's split up and find out.

953
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,200
Okay, I'll look over here.

954
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,400
But how can we find out? These are all English books.

955
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,400
This one.

956
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,300
Initial investigation for crime.

957
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,500
Oh my god!

958
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,900
I'm a genius?

959
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,500
I can read English!

960
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,700
Me too.

961
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,700
It seems that the player is programmed to read English.

962
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,000
If so, I hope I can stay in the game forever!

963
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,900
What are you talking about, Genta-kun?

964
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:03,400
If this continues, we'll be eliminated and die!

965
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,000
I'm just kidding.

966
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,500
What a dirty ball!

967
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,700
This is...

968
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,600
Hey, Emouri!

969
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,000
This is soccer from a hundred years ago!

970
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,400
Wow, really!

971
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,800
I found it. Is it this one?

972
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,200
An analysis of Jack the Ripper.

973
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
The latest case took place on

974
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,100
September 8th.

975
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,400
The second victim was Honey Charleston,

976
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,700
a 41-year-old female who lived alone.

977
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,000
The location where the body was found was

978
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,800
a vacant lot next to St. Mary's Church in the Whitechapel area.

979
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,500
There were two rings of different sizes left at the scene.

980
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,100
Rings of different sizes?

981
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,800
Judging from the fact that
he caused such tremendous social unrest,

982
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,000
I am sure that Jack the Ripper,
who has plunged London into extreme panic,

983
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,500
must be connected with the head of evil, Professor Moriarty,

984
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,400
Professor Moriarty?

985
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,100
Even this guy is in the game?

986
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,300
Who is this guy?

987
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,800
Don't forget about us, alright? We don't understand.

988
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,400
He's Holmes' arch-enemy.

989
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,500
He controls the dark forces of London.

990
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,700
It is said that he has a great influence on the whole Europe.

991
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,800
The Napoleon in the criminal world.

992
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,900
But, although Professor Moriarty is
the one who manipulates behind the scenes,

993
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,300
he rarely reveals his whereabouts.

994
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,100
How can we catch him?

995
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,700
Since we can't find the professor,

996
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,500
we gotta go find someone related to him.

997
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,100
Colonel Sebastian Moran.

998
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,400
Indeed.

999
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,900
Colonel Moran, the professor's top general.

1000
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,200
But where is he?

1001
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,800
He must be...

1002
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
Holmes' notes say

1003
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,600
he frequents

1004
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
the bridge club downtown.

1005
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,000
Because he's the second most dangerous man in London.

1006
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,900
We must be careful with him.

1007
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,800
Conan-kun, you really know a lot.

1008
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,000
Because Shinichi-san often told me about this.

1009
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,600
So that's it? I knew it.

1010
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,900
But who knew that the words of that nagging Sherlock Holmes fan

1011
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,200
could be useful this time?

1012
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,800
There is no need to say the word "nagging".

1013
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,300
Wow, it's a real gun!

1014
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,700
Put it back, Genta.

1015
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,600
But aren't we going to meet a dangerous guy?

1016
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,300
A weapon you don't know how to use well won't help.

1017
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,500
It'll only cause trouble!

1018
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,800
Put it back!

1019
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,600
Looks like you're the scarier one.

1020
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,400
Then, let's get going before it's too late.

1021
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,100
Hey, Moroboshi!

1022
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,500
We gotta take our life in our own hands.

1023
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,800
There are 30 people left.

1024
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,000
There's a lot of people out.

1025
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,500
I guess there should be someone

1026
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,000
among us about to be out too, right?

1027
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,200
Don't jinx it, okay?

1028
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,000
Toru!

1029
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,100
Emi!

1030
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,100
Takuya!

1031
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,000
(Bridge Club)

1032
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,900
Wait for me here, everyone.

1033
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,000
I'll go in through the back door and see what's going on inside.

1034
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,200
Be careful.

1035
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,200
One card.

1036
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,800
I'll give two.

1037
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,200
It's Colonel Moran.

1038
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,100
The monkey?

1039
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,100
How is it, four eyes?

1040
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,800
What are you doing here?

1041
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,100
You want to be the hero alone? I won't let you.

1042
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,400
Straight.

1043
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,200
I'm sorry.

1044
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,300
Flush.

1045
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,200
What?

1046
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Looks like I'm pretty lucky tonight.

1047
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,800
Damn it!

1048
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,800
So Moran is pretty good at poker?

1049
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,300
He's cheating.

1050
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,400
How do you know that?

1051
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,900
That monkey over there

1052
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,500
is telling Colonel Moran his opponent's cards.

1053
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,200
Right hand means heart or spade.

1054
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,200
Left hand means diamond, or club.

1055
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,700
It will eat berries based on card's color and number.

1056
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,800
If it's a three of spade,

1057
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,700
it will take three black berries with his right hand to eat.

1058
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,200
A crafty cheater!

1059
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,500
Huh?

1060
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,400
What's wrong with that seat?

1061
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,400
Why did they put such things there?

1062
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
He cheated!

1063
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,100
Moran cheated.

1064
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,900
Watch your mouth, kid.

1065
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,700
Do you have proof that I cheated?

1066
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,200
Of course I do.

1067
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,200
That monkey is your friend.

1068
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,500
Right?

1069
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,600
What?

1070
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,600
It was watching this guy's cards.

1071
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,000
If it's a three of spade,

1072
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,700
it will take three black berries with its right hand to eat.

1073
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,900
If it's a five of diamond,

1074
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,600
it will take five red berries with its left hand to eat.

1075
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,300
Moran, you're tricky!

1076
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,500
You fell for it because you are too stupid.

1077
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,900
What did you say?

1078
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,100
You'd better save the fight for later.

1079
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,100
Where's Professor Moriarty?

1080
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,600
How do you know him, brat?

1081
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,700
Don't move!

1082
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,200
Catch this brat!

1083
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,200
You little brat!

1084
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,800
Are you okay, Conan-kun?

1085
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm here to help, Conan!

1086
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,400
I've knocked one down!

1087
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,200
This is awful.

1088
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,000
Now all of us are out!

1089
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,000
Watch out, Conan-kun!

1090
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,000
Kikukawa-kun!

1091
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,200
Hey, hang in there!

1092
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,000
I've been knocked down!

1093
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,500
You saved me, now I returned the favor.

1094
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Hey.

1095
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,000
Kikukawa...

1096
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,900
Seiichiro!

1097
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,800
Ayumi-chan, are you okay?

1098
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,400
Thank you, Mitsuhiko-kun.

1099
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,000
It's okay.

1100
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,500
Mitsuhiko-kun!

1101
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,200
Ayumi-chan, seems like we're going to be eliminated.

1102
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:43,400
Conan-kun, please bring us all back to life!

1103
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,200
Ayumi! Mitsuhiko!

1104
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,300
Damn!

1105
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,600
If this continues, everyone will be out!

1106
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,200
SH...

1107
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,300
Sherlock Holmes.

1108
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,800
Conan! Watch out!

1109
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,700
Genta!

1110
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,200
I'm out.

1111
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:25,100
Conan, you must catch that Jack the Ripper.

1112
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,700
Game over.

1113
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,000
I was planning to catch you and then ask you who you work for,

1114
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,200
but now that there is no need to ask.

1115
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,900
Because this gun belongs to Holmes.

1116
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,600
Damn, what to do?

1117
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,700
What should I do?

1118
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,200
The thing in that man's hands...

1119
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,100
I remember it was...

1120
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,400
the wine on that seat.

1121
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,900
I see!

1122
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,500
So that's what happened!

1123
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,400
Okay then, who should I start with?

1124
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,500
You little bastard!

1125
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,500
If you shoot, this bottle of wine will be broken!

1126
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,300
What do you mean by that?

1127
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,000
The empty seat at the table where you were playing cards,

1128
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,000
that specially decorated chair,

1129
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,600
and the wine and glass prepared for the upcoming person

1130
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:24,300
told me one thing, that is, that upcoming person

1131
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,300
must be Professor Moriarty.

1132
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,100
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1133
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,500
Then shoot,

1134
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,400
if it's okay to make the professor's wine broken.

1135
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,100
Damn it!

1136
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,300
Conan-kun.

1137
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,100
Mr. Moriarty wants to see you.

1138
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,400
Professor Moriarty?

1139
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,200
He's waiting for you in the carriage.

1140
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,200
This way, please.

1141
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,500
Please wait.

1142
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,100
Are you trying to disobey Mr. Moriarty?

1143
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,700
I brought them here.

1144
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:38,900
Well done.

1145
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,100
All right, little kid.

1146
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:42,100
Give me that bottle of wine.

1147
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,000
Yes, sir.

1148
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,900
This scent...

1149
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,400
You have the guts to compete with Colonel Moran.

1150
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,800
As befits the disciple of Sherlock Holmes.

1151
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,600
What do you want from me?

1152
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,900
If you don't mind, are you Professor Moriarty?

1153
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,600
Of course I am.

1154
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Is that so?

1155
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,400
You're testing us in this way, aren't you?

1156
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,400
What do you mean?

1157
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,900
You can drop the act.

1158
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,900
You're not Professor Moriarty, right?

1159
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,200
What are you talking about, Conan-kun?

1160
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,300
Because the real Professor Moriarty

1161
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,600
is this one.

1162
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,000
How come...

1163
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,200
Are you serious?

1164
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,500
Everything he said was spoken through your ventriloquism, right?

1165
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,000
I didn't think you'd see through that.

1166
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,900
How did you know?

1167
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,400
Because Colonel Moran said "please wait" to you.

1168
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,500
I see.

1169
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,700
Colonel Moran only uses honorific terms with Professor Moriarty.

1170
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,000
Is that all?

1171
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,200
There's one more thing.

1172
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,600
I've heard that Professor Moriarty

1173
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:56,200
is a fashionable elderly man
who loves to use natural vanilla cologne.

1174
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,800
Did you smell it when you were returning his wine?

1175
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,400
Beautiful.

1176
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,300
You're totally a mini Sherlock Holmes.

1177
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,800
But then again,

1178
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,800
what do you want with me?

1179
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,700
Jack the Ripper

1180
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,200
is the guy you put on the streets

1181
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,400
to make London a city of terror, right?

1182
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,300
You're only half right.

1183
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:24,700
Jack the Ripper is a vagrant I picked up in the slums.

1184
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,600
Although he was just a homeless vagrant
who had been abandoned by his mother,

1185
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,400
I sensed his talent right away.

1186
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,700
The talent to become a criminal.

1187
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:42,200
I trained him to become a top-class killer.

1188
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:46,000
Why did he kill innocent women?

1189
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,400
The Ripper has become a murderous monster beyond my imagination.

1190
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,100
All this series of cases is the result of the kid's craziness.

1191
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,200
If you want to deal with Jack the Ripper,

1192
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,800
I will assist you.

1193
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,400
Assist?

1194
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:08,200
Though Jack the Ripper has gone crazy,

1195
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,600
I think if I give him an order to kill someone, he'll still obey.

1196
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,600
All you have to do is get there first and wait for him.

1197
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,000
What will you do?

1198
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,100
I'll put a message in tomorrow's Sunday Times billboard

1199
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,300
for him to read.

1200
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,300
Who are you going to order him to kill?

1201
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,300
You'll know when you read tomorrow's paper.

1202
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,000
Hey, do you really believe this old guy's words?

1203
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,800
I'll take a chance.

1204
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,300
Good luck to you.

1205
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,200
Be careful with Reichenbach Falls in three years.

1206
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,100
What's Reichenbach?

1207
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,700
Three years later, Professor Moriarty

1208
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,800
faced off with Holmes

1209
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,400
at Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland.

1210
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,100
Both of them fell into the waterfall.

1211
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,300
Although Holmes miraculously survived,

1212
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,800
Professor Moriarty died there.

1213
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:24,300
Why would I warn him to be careful?

1214
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:30,200
I probably like this bad guy as much as I like Holmes.

1215
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,300
Feel so familiar. I remember at that time...

1216
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,800
Actually, I also like Professor Moriarty very much.

1217
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,800
Of course I only like this guy in the world of fiction.

1218
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,900
When they dueled in Holmes' apartment,

1219
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,600
my heart beat really fast.

1220
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,700
I really like what Holmes said at that time.

1221
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,500
Do you know what it is?

1222
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,000
No, I don't.

1223
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,600
That is...

1224
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,300
What exactly did Shinichi say?

1225
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,600
It was a rare opportunity for us to date,

1226
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,500
but Shinichi just kept talking about Sherlock Holmes.

1227
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,000
That's why I didn't even concentrate on his words.

1228
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,800
Conan-kun.

1229
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,000
What is it?

1230
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,200
Nothing.

1231
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,400
I'm so stupid.

1232
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,400
How can Conan-kun possibly know about it?

1233
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,200
Hey, four eyes.

1234
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,800
I'm sorry.

1235
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,900
Because of our recklessness,

1236
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,900
we got four people out of the game.

1237
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:42,100
It's no use regretting what has already happened.

1238
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,700
You guys can think this way,

1239
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,500
it means you've already grown up a lot.

1240
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,700
That's right.

1241
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,900
What's important is what we do next.

1242
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,100
For all our sakes, let's try our best together.

1243
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,400
(Whitechapel Area)

1244
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,400
Here is the scene where the body

1245
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,900
of the second victim, Honey Charleston, was found.

1246
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,900
The parent-child bazaar will be held again
on the second Saturday in October.

1247
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,800
On the second Saturday?

1248
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,800
I remember the date that Honey Charleston was killed is...

1249
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,200
September 8th, Saturday.

1250
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1251
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,600
You're so slow. Where have you been?

1252
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,800
Just went to have a little bit adventure on the street.

1253
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,400
You're so relaxed.

1254
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,300
Today is the day of the duel.

1255
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,500
Jack the Ripper is back.

1256
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,400
There are two victims this time!

1257
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:08,800
One for me, please.

1258
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,900
Okay.

1259
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,300
Oh, no. I don't have pounds.

1260
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,200
80 yen.

1261
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,100
Ah, really?

1262
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,500
It's really convenient.

1263
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,700
Here it is.

1264
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,100
Clean up the stage of the opera house tonight.

1265
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,600
M to J.

1266
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,400
M to J.

1267
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,200
Moriarty to Jack the Ripper.

1268
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,000
Clean up the stage of the opera house.

1269
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,400
Is that an order?

1270
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:40,400
Maybe this means he'll murder an actor performing on stage.

1271
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,000
There it is.

1272
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,700
Triumph Public Performance.

1273
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,200
The star of the Wallosa Royal Opera.

1274
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,300
Irene Adler.

1275
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,000
Professor Moriarty.

1276
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,200
This villain has gone too far.

1277
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,300
Who is Irene Adler?

1278
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,300
It is said that she was the only woman
Holmes ever loved in his life.

1279
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:04,100
That means he's going to murder the woman Holmes loves.

1280
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,200
00:06.

1281
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:16,700
That means...

1282
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,900
All participants in the other scenarios are out.

1283
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,000
That is to say, the six of us
are responsible for all of their lives.

1284
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,500
(Opera Theater)

1285
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,400
Hey!

1286
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,800
Unauthorized people are not allowed in here.

1287
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,600
We are friends of Irene Adler.

1288
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,600
We want to give her some encouragement before she goes on stage.

1289
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,500
Oh, you're her friends.

1290
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,700
Yes, may I know where the lounge is?

1291
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,400
It's the last room with the poster at the end of the hall.

1292
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,300
This is the room, right? I'm curious what kind of person she is.

1293
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:05,600
I'm so nervous.

1294
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,800
Since she's made by dad,

1295
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,500
and also the woman Holmes loves...

1296
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,500
Please come in.

1297
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,900
Sorry to bother you.

1298
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,400
Shinichi's mother?

1299
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,000
I knew it.

1300
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,400
How rude you are! I'm still single.

1301
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,700
After a divorce, to be exact.

1302
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,200
These are flowers from Sherlock Holmes.

1303
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,100
Ah, thank you.

1304
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,400
Where's Holmes?

1305
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,200
He was looking forward to the show tonight.

1306
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,800
But he was out investigating a case, he couldn't come.

1307
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,100
Really? What a pity.

1308
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:49,200
Please cancel the show tonight.

1309
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:49,900
Oh...

1310
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,600
Holmes' arch enemy.

1311
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,900
Professor Moriarty sent an assassin to kill you.

1312
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,100
Why did he want to kill me?

1313
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,700
Because he wanted to see

1314
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,200
Holmes's pained look after losing you.

1315
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,100
I also wanted to see

1316
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,700
how much Holmes would grieve for me?

1317
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,300
Do you really not care

1318
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:12,200
about being the fifth victim of Jack the Ripper?

1319
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,900
You will protect me, won't you?

1320
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,300
In place of Holmes.

1321
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,400
This woman must have a lot of nerve.

1322
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:26,200
Yeah, that's so like her.

1323
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,300
Die a beautiful death.

1324
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
Irene Adler.

1325
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,000
Where is he hiding?

1326
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,000
What's wrong? What's going on?

1327
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:18,700
Watch out!

1328
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,000
Emouri!

1329
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,000
Takizawa-kun!

1330
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,800
Emouri, you are...

1331
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,200
Takizawa-kun, you are also...

1332
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,000
We're out.

1333
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,700
How come?

1334
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:36,100
Thank you.

1335
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,200
Thanks to you, I'm still alive.

1336
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,600
This is the first time someone thanked me like this.

1337
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,600
Feels not bad.

1338
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,400
The rest is up to you, Moroboshi.

1339
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,400
Don't worry.

1340
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:01,800
Akira!

1341
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,800
Shinya!

1342
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:06,100
Counting Ran-kun and Conan-kun,

1343
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,700
there are only four people left now.

1344
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,200
Well done, Jack the Ripper!

1345
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,700
Turn this world into hell!

1346
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,600
Hurry up! Go through the back door!

1347
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:35,400
Run, Haibara!

1348
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,100
That way!

1349
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,500
Watch out!

1350
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,200
Haibara, are you alright?

1351
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,700
Don't give up, Kudo-kun!

1352
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,600
Although we can't find that character to help us,

1353
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,900
you are our Sherlock Holmes.

1354
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,700
You have this ability.

1355
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,300
There is no case that Sherlock Holmes can't solve, right?

1356
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,200
Ai-kun.

1357
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,300
Hurry up!

1358
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,400
Get out of here!

1359
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:25,600
Behind you!

1360
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,000
Stop right there!

1361
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,400
Bye, you'll be safe with the police.

1362
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,500
Hey, kid!

1363
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:42,500
I haven't asked your name yet.

1364
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,200
My name is Conan Edogawa.

1365
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,900
The same name as your creator's.

1366
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,600
Conan?

1367
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,200
I will not let you run away.

1368
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:00,900
How's it going?

1369
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:04,200
Conan-kun and the others have run into Jack the Ripper.

1370
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,900
They're chasing him now.

1371
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Charlie Cross Station?

1372
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,200
(Charlie Cross Station)

1373
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,300
Conan-kun, you go up first.

1374
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,700
Things are going from bad to worse.

1375
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,400
What's the problem?

1376
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,800
On the last train from Charlie Cross Station,

1377
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,000
there will be the final and most dangerous climax of the story.

1378
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,700
Jack the Ripper blended in with the passengers in disguise.

1379
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,600
Please gather all the passengers in one carriage.

1380
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,200
I see.

1381
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,300
Mr. Conductor, please listen to me.

1382
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,700
Everyone, please put your hands in the air

1383
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:28,700
to make sure you don't have the murder weapon in our hands.

1384
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,100
Let me hear how you deduce it.

1385
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,500
I will now explain to you

1386
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,300
the information written by Mr. Holmes.

1387
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,300
Honey Charleston, the second victim

1388
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,800
murdered by Jack the Ripper, who is hiding here,

1389
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,300
used to get married in a town called Windsor.

1390
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,400
But this woman was a dreamer.

1391
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:58,800
Ten years ago, she left her husband and son for London.

1392
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,300
These two rings

1393
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,000
were left behind at the scene where Honey Charleston was killed.

1394
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,900
One belongs to Honey,

1395
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,900
but the other, exactly same in design as the last one,

1396
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,000
doesn't fit either of Honey's fingers.

1397
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:14,400
Here's what Mr. Holmes deduced.

1398
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,400
Could these two rings

1399
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,000
be proof of paternity between the victim,
Honey Charleston and Jack the Ripper?

1400
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:26,000
Are you saying that this smaller ring belongs to Jack the Ripper?

1401
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,100
Yes.

1402
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,900
Honey put the same shaped ring

1403
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:31,200
on her son's finger before she left home.

1404
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,600
Does that mean Jack the Ripper killed his own mother?

1405
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,100
According to the information,

1406
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,400
Honey Charleston was murdered on September 8th.

1407
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,500
It happened to be the second Saturday of every month,
the time when the church in the Whitechapel area

1408
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,400
holds a parent-child bazaar
to sale items made by parents and children.

1409
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Jack the Ripper probably knew about it, too.

1410
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,500
Even this kind of thing was written in?

1411
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,800
That is to say,

1412
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,100
Jack the Ripper wanted to participate in
the bazaar with his mother,

1413
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,200
that's why he left the ring?

1414
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,700
Mhm, I guess so.

1415
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:14,100
So the motive for the murder was
resentment against his mother for abandoning him.

1416
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,000
I've had enough! I didn't do anything bad.

1417
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,400
Why does everyone hate me?

1418
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,700
But...

1419
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:27,000
Interwoven in the desire for killing is
a fusion of love and hate.

1420
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,100
How pathetic.

1421
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,500
I heard that he chose the unrelated woman as the first victim

1422
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,500
just to confuse the police.

1423
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:41,400
But there was a third and fourth victim.

1424
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,400
Professor Moriarty's brilliant education

1425
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,700
turned Jack the Ripper into an abnormal criminal.

1426
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,200
Even though he has avenged himself on his mother,

1427
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:55,500
he still continued to attack women who resembled his mother.

1428
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,300
Which one is he?

1429
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,800
He had been wearing the same ring since he was a child.

1430
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,600
What do you think will that finger be like?

1431
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:09,000
I presume that among the ten fingers,

1432
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,900
only the finger that had worn the ring was unusually thin

1433
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,900
Jack the Ripper

1434
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:16,900
is you.

1435
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,200
But that person is a woman.

1436
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,100
The ring finger on the right hand is so thin.

1437
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,400
I'll handle him.

1438
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,400
Don't go, Ran-nee-chan!

1439
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,300
Oh no, it's a smoke bomb.

1440
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,700
Open the window!

1441
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,700
They're gone.

1442
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:54,900
Hey!

1443
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,800
All the passengers have disappeared.

1444
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,300
What's going on?

1445
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:11,600
All right, let's find out who killed Kashimura too.

1446
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,800
You already know who the killer is?

1447
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:18,400
The point is how the killer prepared the murder weapon.

1448
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,700
There's a metal detector at the entrance of the city hall.

1449
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,900
So the only explanation we can think of is that

1450
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:31,900
the murder weapon was arranged in the venue from the beginning.

1451
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,700
But where is it?

1452
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:38,200
Among the bronze statues in the venue,

1453
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,000
there was one statue holding a short sword.

1454
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,900
There were so many guests in the venue.

1455
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,000
If someone pulled it out, people would definitely see it.

1456
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:52,300
He pulled it off when the lights went out.

1457
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:55,900
He has determined the time of action in advance
according to the schedule.

1458
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,400
But, if the sword was missing,

1459
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,300
someone would have noticed it, right?

1460
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,600
He put a fake one on it.

1461
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:06,700
He put a sword made of cardboard and aluminum foil or something.

1462
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,800
Are you saying that the sword in the statue's hand
now is the murder weapon?

1463
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:12,700
Yes.

1464
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:18,000
I have asked someone to do the luminol test
and detect fingerprints on the sword.

1465
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,800
We found the blood of the same blood type
as Kashimura on the blade,

1466
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,700
and fingerprints on the hilt.

1467
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,400
It's your fingerprint.

1468
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,000
Mr. Schindler.

1469
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,800
Of course it is.

1470
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,800
The bronze statues were moved from my house.

1471
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,200
This is the surveillance video

1472
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:42,900
taken at the party around the time of the crime.

1473
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:47,900
Luckily, there were cameras all around the venue,

1474
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,900
so all the angles I need can be recorded.

1475
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,600
Moroboshi kicked the ball into the bronze statue,
knocking down the sword.

1476
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,000
Then he picked up the sword,

1477
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,800
and put it back into the statue's hand

1478
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,500
I see.

1479
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,000
If the sword kicked down was real,

1480
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,700
that boy's fingerprints would have been detected.

1481
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,800
But only Mr. Schindler's fingerprints were detected on the sword.

1482
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,400
Humph. It's because I touched the sword after that boy.

1483
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,600
His fingerprints were covered up by mine.

1484
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:19,800
Mr. Kudo.

1485
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,500
Found it.

1486
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:24,200
We found the sword made of cardboard and aluminum foil

1487
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,000
in the garbage dump in the basement.

1488
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:26,800
How about the fingerprints?

1489
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,400
Just as Mr. Kudo said,

1490
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,900
there are the fingerprints of both Moroboshi and Mr. Schindler.

1491
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:39,500
If there is someone other than the boy
who put fingerprints on the fake sword,

1492
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,300
then that person must be the culprit.

1493
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,100
Nonsense!

1494
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,400
I'll protest to the Japanese government.

1495
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,800
Besides, I had no motive to kill Kashimura.

1496
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,500
No one there.

1497
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,300
There's only the locomotive room ahead.

1498
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,000
Driver is not there.

1499
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,800
We gotta stop the train first.

1500
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,600
The brakes are broken.

1501
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,800
It's accelerating.

1502
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,300
Hey, we still can't find her,

1503
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,643
I'm afraid things are gonna go out of control.

1504
01:26:27,643 --> 01:26:28,200
Ran!

1505
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,400
Where are you?

1506
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,300
Where did you go?

1507
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:31,700
Wait a minute.

1508
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:35,100
There she is!

1509
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,500
Ran-nee-chan!

1510
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,500
Don't come over!

1511
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,900
I roped myself and this lady together.

1512
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:55,300
That means if I fall, she will fall with me.

1513
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,400
Come on, what are you gonna do?

1514
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,600
Damn it!

1515
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,136
I heard that the sword on the bronze statue

1516
01:27:03,216 --> 01:27:08,100
is an antique family heirloom of the Schindler family, isn't it?

1517
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,000
Yes, you're right.

1518
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,900
Why would you use this sword as the murder weapon?

1519
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:19,200
Why did you have to use this sword as the murder weapon,

1520
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,000
in that case?

1521
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,800
What on earth do you want?

1522
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:27,800
Jack the Ripper.

1523
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,500
What do I want?

1524
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,200
You've avenged yourself by killing your mother,

1525
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,300
what more do you want?

1526
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,800
I want to live.

1527
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,500
I want the blood of sin flowing in my body

1528
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,600
to pass on to the next century by Noah's ark.

1529
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,800
That's why you killed Kashimura, right?

1530
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,300
Jack the Ripper's blood,

1531
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,300
as if sitting on Noah's ark,

1532
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,400
now still exists in the world.

1533
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,300
You're the descendant of Jack the Ripper, aren't you?

1534
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,600
Descendant...

1535
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,600
of Jack the Ripper.

1536
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,300
Hiroki probably found out about this
through the DNA Search Project.

1537
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,200
The giant of the IT industry

1538
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,100
is the descendant of a serial killer a hundred years ago.

1539
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,400
If this comes to light,

1540
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,900
you will lose everything.

1541
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,900
So, to silence Hiroki, you forced him to commit suicide.

1542
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:28,400
Furthermore, you killed Kashimura.

1543
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:34,400
That was when Hiroki came to see my collections.

1544
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:40,800
It was said to be a gold cup used by the Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu.

1545
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:43,800
Next is the Buddhist Text of the monk Ganjin.

1546
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:48,100
And this is the original manuscript of
Rampo Edogawa's "psychological test".

1547
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,100
Awesome!

1548
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,000
What's this short sword?

1549
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,800
That's...

1550
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:56,700
It's said to be

1551
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,100
the murder weapon used by the evil serial killer

1552
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:02,600
Jack the Ripper a hundred years ago.

1553
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,600
Nobody knows if it's true.

1554
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,300
In order to do the experiment,

1555
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:18,000
Hiroki collected information from everyone around him
and entered it into the computer.

1556
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,300
The DNA of Honey Charleston detected from the short sword

1557
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,000
is identical to your DNA.

1558
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,000
So you got scared.

1559
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,100
If Hiroki found out

1560
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,500
Jack the Ripper is Honey's son,

1561
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,400
then it's only a matter of time before he knows that

1562
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:38,700
you are the descendant of Jack the Ripper.

1563
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,800
I am scared of...

1564
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:44,000
of this sinful blood flowing in my body.

1565
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,200
What does it matter if it's the blood of an evil killer or not?

1566
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,800
What does it matter what the world thinks of you?

1567
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,600
Why don't you fight against it?

1568
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,700
Just like Conan-kun and the others are doing now.

1569
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Tomas Schindler

1570
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,700
I'm arresting you for the murder of Tadaaki Kashimura.

1571
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,100
You can't catch me by dodging.

1572
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,700
In ten minutes we'll arrive at the terminal.

1573
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,400
What will happen to this driverless train?

1574
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:31,700
But...

1575
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,200
Looks like you'll die even before the train enters the station.

1576
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,400
Conan-kun, behind you!

1577
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,900
Game over, kid!

1578
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:51,900
Conan-kun!

1579
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,600
Let go of four eyes!

1580
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,800
Moroboshi-kun!

1581
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,000
Are you okay?

1582
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,400
I'm fine.

1583
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,800
All right, where should I start cutting?

1584
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,300
What should I do?

1585
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,800
Shinichi.

1586
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,200
What would Shinichi do at this point?

1587
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:18,200
I really like what Holmes said at that time.

1588
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,900
Do you know what it is?

1589
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:21,700
No, I don't.

1590
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,000
That is,

1591
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,500
if I can really destroy you,

1592
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,400
I'm glad to embrace death for the sake of the public.

1593
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:36,800
Four eyes!

1594
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,700
Reichenbach Falls, Conan-kun!

1595
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,600
Aren't you...

1596
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,700
Sorry I can't be with you until the end.

1597
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,500
Stop, Ran!

1598
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,600
No way!

1599
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,800
Damn it!

1600
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,100
Conan-kun, I trust you.

1601
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,000
Ran!

1602
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,000
Four eyes, we must stop the train.

1603
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,000
Hey, we can't survive if we don't stop the train, right?

1604
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,400
We haven't won the game yet!

1605
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,300
Stand up, four eyes!

1606
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,100
There are still 48 lives counting on us.

1607
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,800
Are you going to fail them?

1608
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,400
Idiot, I don't want to give up either!

1609
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:53,800
Think about it.

1610
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,400
The train is accelerating.

1611
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,100
The train is moving at approximately 100 kilometers per hour.

1612
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,100
The train will arrive at the terminal in less than 5 minutes.

1613
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,100
The only way to save us

1614
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:08,100
is to cut the connecting part
between the locomotive and carriages.

1615
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:10,300
But how can we possibly break the connecting part

1616
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,400
with only two of us?

1617
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:13,900
Yes.

1618
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:17,800
I did think that we could make it with Ran's help.

1619
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,200
That's why Noah's Ark

1620
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,500
made all the passengers disappeared.

1621
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,500
That's it.

1622
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,200
There's nothing I can do.

1623
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:33,500
I failed, dad.

1624
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,700
Hey, hey, hey! Don't give up!

1625
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,700
You must find a way to survive!

1626
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:40,300
and save Ran's life!

1627
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,600
Shinichi.

1628
01:33:50,100 --> 01:33:53,000
You are not yet covered in blood.

1629
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:55,400
You are still alive, aren't you?

1630
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,600
Have you already given up?

1631
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,300
But you have already

1632
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:04,500
put your hands on the knot of the truth.

1633
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:10,400
Wrapped in the colorless rope of life

1634
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,800
is a red thread called murder.

1635
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,500
Isn't it our job to untie this knot?

1636
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,600
Holmes?

1637
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,700
He should be in Dartmoor.

1638
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,500
Is it a bug?

1639
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,200
What does that mean?

1640
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:31,300
Jack the Ripper is already dead.

1641
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,600
Why do we still have to be covered in blood?

1642
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:35,500
That's it.

1643
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,600
So this is what it means.

1644
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,800
Cargo room!

1645
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:39,100
Hey, wait!

1646
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,100
What are you going to do?

1647
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,200
Don't ask! Just follow me!

1648
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,900
Break the wine barrels with that axe hanging there.

1649
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:51,800
Be quick!

1650
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,000
Dive down when I give you an order.

1651
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:11,600
Okay.

1652
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,500
Right now!

1653
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,600
Where are their voices?

1654
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
We can't hear anything yet.

1655
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,400
Conan! My dear lord!

1656
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,300
Please save Ran.

1657
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:20,500
So that's it

1658
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,700
This is what he called covered in blood.

1659
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:26,000
It means using the red wine to reduce the impact force.

1660
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,700
Thanks to you, we're saved, Holmes.

1661
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,500
No, father.

1662
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,700
Four eyes, you're awake.

1663
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,200
Looks like you won.

1664
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,300
You are...

1665
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,800
I had guessed right.

1666
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:48,600
I'm glad that I trusted you.

1667
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,100
Thank you.

1668
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:52,300
You're too polite.

1669
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,000
Noah's Ark.

1670
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,400
Maybe it's better to call you Hiroki-kun.

1671
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
You used Moroboshi-kun's data

1672
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,000
and participated in this game with us, right?

1673
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,500
When did you find out?

1674
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,500
No need to worry.

1675
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:15,900
I've cut off communication with the real world now.

1676
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:19,200
The first time I found it was strange was at Big Ben.

1677
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,200
You noticed it before the hour hand moved.

1678
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,300
You were trying to tell us

1679
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,000
the meaning of the time on Big Ben, right?

1680
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,200
Then it was the soccer.

1681
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,200
At that time, you said it was a dirty ball,
and then threw it in the back.

1682
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,600
Moroboshi is crazy about soccer.

1683
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,900
It's impossible for him to not be interested in soccer
from a hundred years ago.

1684
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:46,200
Despite all the dangers you put us in,

1685
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:50,300
you believe that we would unite to overcome all the crises.

1686
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,100
Don't you?

1687
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,400
The rebirth of Japan

1688
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,700
doesn't mean wiping out
the second and third generations of Japan,

1689
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:00,600
but making them overcome obstacles without parents' strength.

1690
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:05,600
What you expect is that we can grow up through the game.

1691
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,400
You can't make yourself ruthless.

1692
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:11,800
The appearance of Holmes at the end is the evidence.

1693
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:16,200
In the final climax, you still let the character
who can help us make an appearance.

1694
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:23,500
The reason I borrowed Moroboshi-kun's body
to participate in the game

1695
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:26,600
is because I want to play with my friends.

1696
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,200
Even if it's just once.

1697
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,200
Because I'm always working.

1698
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,900
I'm sorry to put you all in danger.

1699
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:39,200
But I really enjoyed myself in it.

1700
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,500
I really envy you.

1701
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:47,800
Even through you and your father are apart,
you two can still communicate from mind to mind.

1702
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,700
Your father avenged my father.

1703
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,300
Thank you.

1704
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,000
It's almost time to say goodbye.

1705
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,800
Your heart

1706
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,000
will be beating in Noah's Ark forever, right?

1707
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:09,900
If a computer like me continue to exist,

1708
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:12,900
it will only be used by adults to do bad things.

1709
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,200
Artificial intelligence or something

1710
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,200
can not yet exist in the world.

1711
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,800
All right, go back to your world.

1712
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,700
When you wake up,

1713
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,200
I hope you can tell everyone one thing.

1714
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:31,700
Life in reality is not as easy as in the game.

1715
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,900
I hope you can meet your father.

1716
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,900
Goodbye.

1717
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:50,200
Shinichi Kudo.

1718
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:35,000
Ran!

1719
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,400
Looks like he made it.

1720
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,700
Thank god! You're back safe!.

1721
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:57,500
It was so fun!

1722
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,000
I tried very hard!

1723
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Well done!

1724
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,600
Conan-kun, thank you for bringing us back to life.

1725
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:09,500
We worked hard too, didn't we?

1726
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:11,700
It was really a great adventure!

1727
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:17,500
It's better in the real world.

1728
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,400
What's going on?

1729
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,900
I knew that you'd make it.

1730
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:31,200
But Ran-nee-chan,

1731
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,300
wasn't it too reckless to pull that guy down?

1732
01:41:34,300 --> 01:41:38,800
Because I remembered a line from
Sherlock Holmes that Shinichi likes.

1733
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,000
You mean the line that Holmes said

1734
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,300
when he first met with Professor Moriarty?

1735
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:47,200
Strange. How did you know that?

1736
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:49,000
Oh, it's just...

1737
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,200
I heard it from Shinichi-nii-chan too.

1738
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,600
So that's how it is.

1739
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:55,000
Anyway, thanks to his nagging,

1740
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,600
we were saved this time.

1741
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:58,400
Didn't I say

1742
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,400
there is no need to say the word "nagging"?

1743
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,200
Ran!

1744
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,200
Dad!

1745
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,500
Great! Great!

1746
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,700
You're back safe!

1747
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:28,800
It took too long for you this time.

1748
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:31,700
Ah. That was fun.

1749
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,300
Noah's Ark is going to end his life.

1750
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:55,100
Rest in peace, Hiroki-kun.

1751
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:03,000
I must practice well to impress them!
