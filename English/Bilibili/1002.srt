don't touch it and let me know instead.

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,500
Jeez.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,220
Why do we have to clean
up the shopping center?

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,000
This is part of our class, too.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,690
It's an activity for getting
to know our local community.

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,530
It may be part of class,

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,450
but that doesn't mean picking up
trash isn't a pain in the butt.

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,050
If we pick up their garbage, it'll
make it harder for adults to litter.

17
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,760
Yeah, but...

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,260
No matter how much we pick up,
people will never stop littering.

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,450
Then what about the garbage right here?

20
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,250
Ayumi-chan, stop playing with that
stray cat and help us over here.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,970
It's not a stray.

22
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,220
See?

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,420
You're right.

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,480
What's going on here? Oh.

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,470
That's Isojima-san's cat.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,290
Isojima-san?

27
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,990
Yeah.

28
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:36,570
She always cleans up around this area.

She's in the hospital right now.

33
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:53,340
Maybe that cat thought they'd get to
see their owner if they came here.

34
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,300
Hey, what the heck is this?

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,840
I thought adults weren't supposed to
litter while kids are cleaning up.

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,660
This is pretty awful.

00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,210
There definitely was, right?

41
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,970
Then where did it go?

42
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,030
What is it?

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,660

It's an international sports festival
held once every four years,

57

and this year, it's being held in Tokyo.

58
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,510
That's right. Tokyo is hosting the WSG.

59
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,740
So we're asking students of all
years and classes to submit ideas

for entertaining the guests coming to Japan.

The best ideas will be implemented
here at Teitan High School!

62
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,400
Oh, they were originally a stray cat,

63
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,900
so they get outside sometimes.

64
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,410
But it's okay. They always come
home when it's time to eat.

I was looking forward to
watching WSG Tokyo with my cat.

71
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,020
But in my current condition, I can
barely get around in a wheelchair.

72
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,540
I can't go home yet.

73
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,160
But you were well enough to clean
the shopping center until recently.

74
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,020
That's true.

75
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,180
Oh, right.

76
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,790
Do you know why the garbage
bin that was here is gone now?

77
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,290
Oh, that garbage bin?

78
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:03,470
Whenever I cleaned this area,
I'd dispose of my garbage in this bin.

79
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:10,310
The bin is probably gone because there's a
feud going on at the nearby store association.

80
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,760
Thank you!

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,510
Hey, you.

82
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,020
Are you sure...

83
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,530
...you didn't...

84
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,750
...drop something?

85
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,650
We're sorry!

86
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,060
Good grief.

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,500
They ran off without picking up their trash.

88
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,670
This is all the fault of you eateries!

89
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,180
Now, now.

90
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,550
That's why the shopping center
is overflowing with trash!

You're wrong. It's because

there are more tourists.

That's because you eateries recommend that
people walk and eat at the same time.

97
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,240
That's because you eateries recommend that
people walk and eat at the same time.

98
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,310
That's why there's garbage all over town.

Now, now.

101
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,570
In any case, it sounds like the
eateries should install garbage bins.

102
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,700
Why should we be the only
ones to pay for garbage bins?

103
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,490
That's what the store
association budget is for.

104
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,420
Most of the litter around town comes
from people walking and eating.

105
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,850
Most of the litter around town comes
from people walking and eating.
Mister, you're part of the store association?

106
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,010
Most of the litter around town comes
from people walking and eating.
I'm here representing Poirot.

107
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,930
I'm here representing Poirot.
Now, now.

108
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:25,060
We're currently experiencing
problems because of you eateries.

109
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,760
But that's no reason for you to remove
the garbage bin in the empty lot.

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,510
Now there's trash all over the empty lot.

111
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,510
That garbage bin was paid for using
the store association budget.

112
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,770
But recently, most of the litter around
town comes from people walking and eating.

113
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,240
And it was constantly overflowing.
It wasn't very sanitary.

114
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,650
You eateries should've been
frequently collecting the trash.

115
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,280
Why are we the only ones
responsible for collecting it?

116
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,950
Because most of it comes from
people walking and eating.
Now, now.

117
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,560
Because most of it comes from
people walking and eating.

118
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,360
Because most of it comes from
people walking and eating.
This isn't going anywhere.

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,910
That's because there aren't
enough garbage bins.

120
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,600
Who's there? Who's watching me?

121
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,710
Huh? It's gone.

122
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,350
Come to think of it, I feel like the number
of garbage bins around town has decreased.

123
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,380
Apparently it's because people throw
their trash into garbage bins,

124
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,360
even if they're overflowing.

125
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,240
And installing bins and
collecting trash costs money.

126
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:39,280
Come to think of it, the store association
was arguing about that today.

127
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,670
What? We're playing games at
the professor's house again?

128
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,340
Same old, same old.

129
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,670
Then what do you want to do?

130
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,720
Again.

131
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,000
What's wrong with people? We worked
so hard to clean this up yesterday.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,950
Seriously. It's unforgivable.

133
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,490
All right, guys.

134
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,440
Indeed.

135
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,190
Yeah.

136
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,650
I have a bad feeling about this.

137
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,280
Me, too.

138
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,450
The Detective Boys will find the culprit!

139
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,490
Yeah!

140
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,510
I knew it.

141
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,620
What? Who dumped their trash?

142
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,430
Yes, where the garbage bin
used to be in the empty lot.

143
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,970
Probably someone walking and eating again.

144
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,880
But there was other trash, too.

145
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,200
Well... no, wait.

146
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,680
Maybe the guys who run the eateries did it.

147
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,430
What? Why would the store
owners dump garbage there?

148
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,210
So we'll put back the garbage bin we removed.

149
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,590
You said there was trash besides
food-related garbage, right?

150
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,440
I wonder why?

151
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,640
Why would someone dump all
their trash in a place

152
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,950
where there used to be a garbage bin?

153
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,700
That was probably the
work of the bicycle shop

154
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,580
and the other stores opposed
to installing garbage bins.

155
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,460
Here you are.

156
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,330
Thank you.

157
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,470
Why would the other stores
dump garbage there?

158
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,470
To force the eateries to
install a garbage bin.

159
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,290
They claim most of the litter comes
from people walking and eating.

160
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,940
A little more to the right.

161
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,600
Right?

162
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,450
That's your left.

163
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:31,940
This way?

164
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,570
Yes, attach it around there.

165
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,280
Okay.

166
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,190
Professor.

167
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,300
Hey. How does it look, Ai-kun?

168
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,230
Looks good. Now walk sideways.

169
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,700
All right. Can you see me?

170
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,200
Yes, I can see you clearly.

171
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, Haibara?

172
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,240
All right. Now we should get
a great look at the culprit.

173
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,750
I see. So that's how it is.

174
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,040
How about maps of phone charging locations

175
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,060
and WiFi hotspots for foreigners
that are written in English?

176
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,000
That seems cliché, too.

177
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,400
Then... I know.

178
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,920
How about a map showing the foreign
cuisine restaurants in Beika City

179
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,010
for when the foreigners are feeling homesick?

180
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,130
Are there any restaurants
like that around here?

181
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,720
Seriously? You come up with some ideas, Ran.

182
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,810
Sorry.

183
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:00,030
I feel like I'm right on
the verge of an epiphany.

184
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,590
Ran-neechan.

185
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,660
Hey, brat.

186
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,790
Isn't it a little late for you
to be walking home from school?

187
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,160
Yeah, I took a little detour.

188
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,240
You were playing games at the
professor's house again, weren't you?

189
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,490
No, not that.

190
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,370
Soccer, then?

191
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,450
Yeah.

192
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,930
Subaru-san.

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,450
Hey. Are you all on your
way home from school?

194
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,870
Yes. Are you coming back from
your college classes as well?

195
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,940
You dummy, Subaru-san is a grad student.

196
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,690
You're a grad student at the Toto
University Engineering School, right?

197
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,570
I'm surprised you remember, Conan-kun.

198
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,200
This tote bag sure is cool.

199
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,420
What do you keep in here?

200
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,830
Hey, Sonoko.

201
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,570
What's this?

202
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,370
It's a circuit board for
measuring electronic noise.

203
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,840
I use it in my grad school classes.

204
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,840
I bet it's the receiver
for a listening device.

205
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,610
How about this?

206
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,220
It's called a tester.
It's for measuring voltage.

207
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,980
That's probably a bug detector.

208
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm sorry, Subaru-san. Jeez, Sonoko.

209
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,890
Yeah, but doesn't this bag look
so cool that you wouldn't

210
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,970
expect to find
such lame stuff inside of it?

211
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,030
You're right.

212
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,310
The inside is divided.

213
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,280
Yes.

214
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,800
Since I use it to transport precision
instruments, it has cushioned partitions.

215
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,460
Huh.

216
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,380
If you're walking around with that stuff, does
that mean you're doing something for the FBI?

217
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,630
That's right.

218
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,390
The man who outwardly presents
himself as grad student Okiya Subaru

219
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,140
is actually FBI agent Akai Shuichi.

220
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,400
But that's a story for another time.

221
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,440
I know!

222
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,150
What the?

223
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,410
What? We're playing games at
the professor's house again?

224
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,300
Same old, same old.

225
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,850
Then what do you want to do?

226
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,420
You guys are always having
the same conversation.

227
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,380
Again.

228
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,800
What's wrong with people? We
just cleaned this up yesterday.

229
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,140
Haibara.

230
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,390
Nobody's showing up.

231
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,650
Someone came.

232
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,590
He's acting suspiciously.

233
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,450
Hey, isn't he...?

234
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,360
I know him.

235
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,740
Handmade Side Dishes

236
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,530
Handmade Side Dishes
I buy croquettes at his store all the time.

237
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,870
I buy croquettes at his store all the time.

238
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,280
Here you are.

239
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,510
That's one tuna corn dog and one
cod roe croquette rice ball.

240
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,990
Thanks.

241
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,260
I told you, I just went to check it
out because I noticed the camera.

242
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,380
I'm impressed you noticed from so far away.

243
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,270
Despite how I look, I've got a keen eye.

244
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,480
But mister, it looked like you were
carefully observing your surroundings

245
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,130
as you approached the camera.

246
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,690
That's because I was wondering
what the camera was filming.

247
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,490
Really?

248
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,520
Yes, really.

249
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,630
Come on, you're interfering with my business.

250
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,940
Get out of here.

251
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,200
Welcome.

252
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,720
That guy is definitely suspicious.

253
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,330
Yeah. He's the only one caught on camera.

254
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,540
Hold on.

255
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,170
What's this?

256
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,050
What is that? I'll rewind
the video a little bit.

257
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,670
Something came down.

258
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,620
Could you play that again in slow motion?

259
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,430
Got it.

260
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,810
It's a crow.

261
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,730
Just a crow?

262
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,380
No, it's possible that
the crow is the culprit.

263
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,360
What?

264
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,120
I have heard that crows
will gather food or trash.

265
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,490
Then is this crow the culprit?

266
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,590
Haibara, can you tell if this
crow has any trash in its beak?

267
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,530
Give me one minute.

268
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,360
Apply high-speed digital signal processing,

269
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,990
reduce noise, and adjust contrast.

270
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,860
That's probably the best I can do.

271
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,640
It doesn't look like this crow
has anything in its beak.

272
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,450
Our theory about the crow being
the culprit has fallen apart.

273
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,890
Then was it that man after all?

274
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,640
If only the camera had
caught him dumping trash.

275
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,400
We did set up the camera at an angle
that would capture the person's face.

276
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,000
In other words, this camera has a blind spot.

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,410
That is what that means.

278
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,570
Then couldn't we determine
the range of that blind spot?

279
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,060
Based on our calculations,

280
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,490
we've determined that the
camera captures an adult

281
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,640
from the knees up no matter
where they approach from.

282
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,460
However, once they're right
in front of the camera,

283
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,970
we can't see what's below it.

284
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,540
That height is roughly 115 centimeters.

285
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,220
In other words, a culprit shorter than 115
centimeters wouldn't be caught on camera.

286
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,600
But even if there were a culprit like that,

287
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,970
in order to avoid being caught on camera,

288
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,520
they'd have to approach from the fence side.

289
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,640
they'd have to approach from the fence side.

292

Is there anybody that small?

293
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,060
Does that mean a tiny child is the culprit?

294
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,910
Huh?

295
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,870
Now that I look closely, there's a hole here,
like something passed through the bushes.

296
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,150
You're right.

297
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,520
Yeah.

298
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,870
What made this hole?

299
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,870
Conan-kun, did you figure it out?

300
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah.

301
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,660
The culprit is probably...

302
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,160
Isojima-san.

303
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,880
There something we'd like to ask you today.

304
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,860
Beika City Store Association
Office

305
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,140
Beika City Store Association
Office
Really?

306
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,910
You figured out who's been dumping trash?

307
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,640
Yes.

308
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,770
You mean they were captured on that camera?

309
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,920
Yeah, they were.

310
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,400
First, take a look at this image.

311
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,450
Doesn't the camera seem a bit low?

312
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,280
We won't be able to see the culprit's face.

313
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,540
Hey, isn't that...

314
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,040
...Isojima-san's cat?

315
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,340
So the creature who was gathering
garbage in that place every day...

316
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,040
...was the cat.

317
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,350
Isojima-san would clean that area every day.

318
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,730
She said she'd dispose of the trash she
collected in the garbage bin at that empty lot.

319
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,050
We asked Isojima-san about it yesterday.

320
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,170
Now that you mention it...

321
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,560
You might be right.

322
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,510
That's why this cat has continued
to collect trash in this place

323
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,190
where the bin used to be.

324
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,930
I see.

325
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,950
That's why you snuck out
of the house every day.

326
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,450
Everyone, I'm terribly sorry for
the trouble my cat has caused.

327
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,400
Oh, no.

328
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,580
That's okay.

329
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,210
I'll get better soon so I can get
back to cleaning with this cat.

330
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,260
You don't have to do that.

331
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,450
Maybe we should reinstall the garbage bin.

332
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,720
We should install some in areas where
people are likely to walk and eat, too.

333
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,850
Then we'll be reinstalling
the garbage bin at the lot

334
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,730
as well as several more in other locations.

335
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,800
But the store association budget
isn't enough to cover that, is it?

336
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,650
You're right.

337
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,150
Then what are we going to do?

338
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,730
Uh, um...

339
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,240
Why don't you use this?

340
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,910
Ran, what are you doing here?

341
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,430
Our class' idea is being
turned into a product.

342
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,270
It was mostly Ran-kun's idea.

343
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,650
This is it.

344
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,040
A tote bag?

345
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,540
Not just any ordinary tote bag.

346
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:57,500
I call it the "garbage takeout bag."

347
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,820
I call it the "garbage takeout bag."

348
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,230

At first glance, it looks like an ordinary
tote bag with a Japanese-style pattern,

350
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:03,800
Garbage Takeout Bag
but when you hang a garbage bag
off of the clips inside the bag,

351
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,140
but when you hang a garbage bag
off of the clips inside the bag,

352
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,390
it turns into a partition that allows
you to separate out your trash.

353
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,060
You can put dirty things
inside the trash bag.

354
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,600
In other words,

355
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,300
it's a bag that lets you take home
whatever garbage you produce.

356
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,620
But because of its attractive appearance,

357
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:26,070
it doesn't look like you're
carrying trash around with you.

358
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,880
So if you use it without
attaching a garbage bag,

359
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,330
it functions as a reusable shopping bag.

360
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,770
And since it folds up so small,

361
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,750
it makes a great souvenir for foreigners.

362
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,210
I hope they take home both the idea
of bringing their trash home with them

363
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,840
and a piece of Japanese
culture as a souvenir.

364
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,660
How nice.

365
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,970
I'd love to sell those at my store.

366
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,350
We'd love to have you sell
them in the shopping center.

367
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,270
Why don't you use the profits
to install more garbage bins?

368
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,860
What a wonderful idea!

369
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,830
We'll use those bags and garbage
bins to clean up the town.

370
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,240
How marvelous.

371
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,970
Is everyone okay with
proceeding with this plan?

372
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,240
Yes.

373
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,490
Your Ran-neechan did a good job.

374
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,160
What?

375
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,970
An invitation to a party?

376
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:48,940
Yeah.

377
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,970
Only WSG Tokyo sponsors can attend the party.

378
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,230
Apparently several of Sonoko's
dad's companies are sponsors.

379
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,100
So why are you inviting us?

380
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,450
Sonoko said it was a reward for finding
the culprit who was dumping the trash.

381
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,990
You kids had better be on your best behavior.

382
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,940
I don't really get it, but it sounds
like we'll be treated to great food.

383
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,870
I know this hotel.

384
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,580
It's the newly constructed big
hotel by the Toto Railway Station.

385
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,010
Really?

386
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,500
I bet they have tons of tasty food.

387
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,680
Like eel, and eel, and eel...

388
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,510
Like eel, and eel, and eel...
And that's how we ended up
attending the WSG Tokyo party.

389
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,010
And that's how we ended up
attending the WSG Tokyo party.

390
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,430
And that's how we ended up
attending the WSG Tokyo party.
