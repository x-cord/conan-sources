1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,470
"Yotsubishi Bank"

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,070
A fake bomb threat made to a bank caused a panic.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,770
Genta, Sumito Kagura, and others were injured as collateral damage.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,670
According to his friends, Go Kochiyama and Haruka Ibe,

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,670
Kagura also suffered collateral damage half a month earlier.

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:26,770
It's hard to believe two incidents in half a month is a coincidence.

7
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,070
After getting a taste for the compensation he received

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,570
after the first incident,

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,770
perhaps he caused the panic himself

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,970
in order to receive more money.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,870
We suspected Kagura

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,370
and even discovered testimony backing it up.

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,570
But just as we were setting out to find conclusive evidence...

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,570
Kikuhide Otsubo, another one of the victims, was murdered.

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,870
It's possible Edogawa is right,

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,670
and Otsubo learned a grave secret about yesterday's incident

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,570
and was killed for it.

18
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,170
What? Wouldn't that mean

19
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,370
that Otsubo was killed by Kagura?

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,370
-Huh? -What?

21
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,470
It makes sense, but...

22
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,070
There's something...

23
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,670
You guys keep talking about evidence,

24
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,670
but even without it, I'll put the screws on him until he confesses!

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,470
-Genta! -Hey!

26
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,270
What should we do, Conan?

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,170
That might work.

28
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,170
What?

29
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,070
We won't give him a hard time,

30
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,570
but we might be able to pick something up by going directly to Kagura.

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,970
He might reveal something about himself.

32
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,970
Yeah. Let's go talk to Kagura.

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,170
Right now at this moment, light pierces the darkness.

34
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,170
Overcome all limits with your cool reasoning skills.

35
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,870
Adults with impure motives!

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,770
What are their unseen true intentions?

37
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,370
He sees through the one and only truth.

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,270
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

39
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,570
His name is Detective Conan!

40
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:53,827
"The Cost of Likes (Part 2)"

41
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:01,827
"Sumito Kagura (26)" -You're already here?

42
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:04,027
On the phone you said this afternoon.

43
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:07,627
Oh, it's you kids.

44
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,027
We need to talk.

45
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,427
What?

46
00:04:10,427 --> 00:04:13,827
I don't know what it's about, but we can talk on the way.

47
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:17,127
My payday was yesterday,

48
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:20,027
but I never withdrew the money because of the commotion.

49
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,527
Murdered?

50
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:27,127
Otsubo was?

51
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:29,327
You already know all about that, don't you?

52
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:32,327
Why would I?

53
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:35,827
By the way, Kagura,

54
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,527
didn't you previously tell your acting company

55
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:41,727
that you hoped to suffer collateral damage again

56
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:43,427
so you'd receive more money?

57
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:46,127
-Who said that? -You did!

58
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:50,727
I've never said anything that audacious.

59
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:51,727
Hey!

60
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:52,927
Wait.

61
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,127
That felt a little strange.

62
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:00,327
He doesn't seem to be lying.

63
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,627
Don't let him fool you!

64
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:03,927
He's an actor!

65
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:10,727
You're sure he said "some more tasty collateral damage", right?

66
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,927
You're doubting us?

67
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:14,027
And our detective skills?

68
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:16,227
"Chonenten"

69
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:19,527
Kagura clearly said it, right?

70
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,027
"Chiichiro Dewa (30)" -Yeah. That's what I heard.

71
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:23,727
You heard?

72
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:28,027
You didn't hear it directly from Kagura?

73
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,127
Oh, not directly.

74
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:33,527
I heard it from him.

75
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,827
Didn't Kagura say

76
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:39,827
he hoped to suffer more collateral damage so he'd get paid again?

77
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:42,427
Yeah, apparently.

78
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,027
Apparently?

79
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,627
So apparently, you heard it, too.

80
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,327
It's all starting to sound suspicious.

81
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,927
Then who told you?

82
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:52,427
Kochiyama.

83
00:05:52,427 --> 00:05:53,827
Not that you'd know him.

84
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,327
That Kochiyama?

85
00:05:57,327 --> 00:05:59,627
Hey.

86
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:01,227
We saw her yesterday, too.

87
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,127
She's a witness!

88
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:04,827
Didn't you say yesterday

89
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:08,627
that Kagura hoped to suffer more collateral damage?

90
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:12,027
That's what I heard from Kochiyama.

91
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,227
-Wait. -Wait.

92
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:15,027
Her, too?

93
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:18,827
It sounds like Kochiyama is the source of everything.

94
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:22,027
Kochiyama is Kagura's friend, right?

95
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:24,127
Do you guys know him, too?

96
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,627
We acted together in college.

97
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,927
He started working after graduation,

98
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,227
but we still hang out.

99
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:34,027
He even comes here sometimes.

100
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,527
So he's a former actor, too.

101
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,427
Oh, right. That might've been a lie.

102
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:40,927
A lie?

103
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:44,927
Kochiyama might've spread the rumor on purpose.

104
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:47,727
If Haruka thought Kagura were good for nothing,

105
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:50,827
she might go to him instead.

106
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,127
It's possible.

107
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:53,127
Yeah.

108
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,527
I wouldn't put it past him.

109
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,127
What does that mean?

110
00:06:57,127 --> 00:07:00,727
Isn't that the lady who was with them yesterday?

111
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:04,027
So they're not just three best friends after all.

112
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:09,727
In any case,

113
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:12,327
we'll know if Kagura actually said that or not

114
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:15,627
if we ask Kochiyama.

115
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:21,027
Yes, but even if he did, that's not conclusive.

116
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:24,227
What we need is conclusive evidence.

117
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:26,627
What would that be?

118
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:28,227
Are there any clues?

119
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:29,527
I knew it.

120
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,827
"How can this be a coincidence?" -Isn't that Kochiyama's post?

121
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:38,927
And the murdered Otsubo was following Kagura.

122
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:40,727
If he was following him, then...

123
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:42,927
Could it be...

124
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:45,227
What is it?

125
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,527
But then why would he...

126
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:50,627
Conan...

127
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,627
Where can we find her?

128
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:56,127
"Haruka Ibe"

129
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,427
This woman.

130
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:06,527
"Go Kochiyama (26)"

131
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,527
A love triangle?

132
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:12,727
Between Kagura, Kochiyama, and me?

133
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:15,727
"Haruka Ibe (24)"

134
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:20,027
No, no way. Absolutely not.

135
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:23,427
But the acting company mentioned something about one.

136
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:27,727
I was originally a fan of Kagura the actor.

137
00:08:27,727 --> 00:08:33,327
I joined the company a year ago because I wanted to act with him.

138
00:08:33,327 --> 00:08:37,327
Kagura introduced me to Kochiyama shortly after that.

139
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:40,527
This is Kochiyama.

140
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:44,127
I've been stuck with this idiot since college.

141
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:46,227
I'm the idiot.

142
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,327
What are you doing?

143
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,227
I'm Haruka Ibe.

144
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,527
We became close right away.

145
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:54,927
Here it comes, Kagura!

146
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:55,927
Bring it on!

147
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,527
Kagura and Kochiyama were so close.

148
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,227
I was jealous.

149
00:09:09,227 --> 00:09:11,327
He's a tough one! Back me up, Haruka!

150
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:12,327
Got it!

151
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:17,827
Two on one? That's not fair!

152
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:25,227
I was so happy that they allowed me to join them.

153
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:31,227
There's nothing romantic about our relationship.

154
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:37,227
Sorry. I'd better head back.

155
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:38,927
Later.

156
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:42,127
Even if she's not aware of it...

157
00:09:42,127 --> 00:09:44,527
Right?

158
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:48,327
Well, we can guess how they feel about her.

159
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:49,627
But what about it?

160
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:52,727
What did we come to confirm?

161
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:59,327
What's behind the bomb threat and Otsubo's case.

162
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,827
If you think of that way, it explains everything.

163
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:09,527
And if I'm right, then...

164
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,527
Thank you.

165
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:21,427
We investigated the connection between the bomb threat

166
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:25,127
and Kikuhide Otsubo's murder,

167
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:28,027
but we haven't found anything yet.

168
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,527
You've found clues

169
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,427
to the identity of the culprit who made the bomb threat, right?

170
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:38,927
No, not at all.

171
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:39,927
You haven't?

172
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:43,827
We heard a cleaning person was spotted

173
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:45,827
at the public phone in question

174
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:50,127
just before and after the call was made to the bank.

175
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,627
According to the cleaning company,

176
00:10:51,627 --> 00:10:54,327
no one was working around then,

177
00:10:54,327 --> 00:10:57,227
so that must have been the culprit.

178
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:01,927
But we don't have any clues to their identity.

179
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,527
Sounds like your reasoning was wrong.

180
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,427
-Yeah. -Yeah.

181
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:09,627
If they didn't leave any clues,

182
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,027
then the plan doesn't work.

183
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:14,027
What plan?

184
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:16,827
Inspector.

185
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:17,927
Yes.

186
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,127
What?

187
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:25,127
We received an anonymous call.

188
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:26,527
Last night around eight,

189
00:11:26,527 --> 00:11:31,527
someone was seen fleeing the scene of Otsubo's murder.

190
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:32,827
Around the time of the murder?

191
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:33,827
Yeah.

192
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:37,227
Apparently the caller asked if the suspicious figure

193
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,827
might've been the unlucky man who's been seen online recently,

194
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:42,727
but we have no idea who they meant.

195
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:45,027
They must mean Kagura.

196
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,527
I knew it was him.

197
00:11:47,527 --> 00:11:49,427
So that's how it is.

198
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:52,027
Their plan's not over yet.

199
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:56,427
If their ultimate goal lies beyond what I thought...

200
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,127
-Could it be... -Yeah.

201
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:02,327
That explains why there weren't any clues left in the public phone.

202
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:05,027
-What do you mean? -What do you mean?

203
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:07,827
Which means we'd better hurry!

204
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,227
Come with me!

205
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:10,827
Hurry!

206
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:12,127
Us, too!

207
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,527
-Let's go! -Yeah!

208
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:34,094
To bad luck and audacity.

209
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:37,194
And the nerve to use me for likes again.

210
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,094
Wait!

211
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:45,794
We're the police.

212
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:47,594
We're coming in.

213
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:48,994
You kids?

214
00:12:48,994 --> 00:12:50,594
The police?

215
00:12:50,594 --> 00:12:54,694
I don't think you should be drinking while you're injured.

216
00:12:54,694 --> 00:12:55,694
Or...

217
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:02,694
Would you care to drink like this instead, Kagura and Kochiyama?

218
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:03,694
What?

219
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:13,294
It wasn't a coincidence that Kagura suffered collateral damage yesterday.

220
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:16,394
He was set up by the culprit.

221
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,894
Isn't that right,

222
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:19,194
Kochiyama?

223
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,794
What do you mean?

224
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:27,794
Yesterday, the 25th, was your payday.

225
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:32,694
You were sure to go to that bank to withdraw the money.

226
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:36,894
And since you're friends, so naturally Kochiyama would knew that.

227
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:38,994
He disguised himself as a cleaning person

228
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:41,294
and waited for you to arrive.

229
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:45,094
Just when you arrived in front of the bank...

230
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:49,894
Several bombs have been placed around your bank.

231
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:55,594
Why would Kochiyama do that?

232
00:13:55,594 --> 00:14:00,194
Kagura, half a month ago, you received monetary compensation

233
00:14:00,194 --> 00:14:02,794
when you were injured by an unexploded bomb, right?

234
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:04,394
You got a taste for that money,

235
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:07,894
so you caused the panic yourself

236
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,594
and pretended to be a victim in order to receive more money.

237
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:13,494
That's what he wanted people to think.

238
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:16,394
I didn't do anything like that.

239
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:19,694
You even dropped hints in advance to his friends.

240
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:27,694
I heard Kagura say

241
00:14:27,694 --> 00:14:30,994
that he hoped to suffer more tasty collateral damage

242
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,494
so he could receive more compensation.

243
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:34,494
Like that.

244
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:37,094
I never said that.

245
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,994
He put another plan in motion yesterday.

246
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:44,694
He didn't make this post to earn likes,

247
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:48,494
but to frame you as the culprit.

248
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:49,894
Why?

249
00:14:49,894 --> 00:14:54,494
Kochiyama's comment posted under the handle Tanuki Ponkichi emphasizes

250
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,394
that it's hard to imagine it was a coincidence

251
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:01,094
that you experienced two similar incidents in half a month.

252
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:05,994
That's what made us suspect Kagura did it for the money.

253
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,694
We totally fell for it.

254
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:11,094
Just like he wanted.

255
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,294
Not that!

256
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:15,694
I'm asking why Kochiyama would try to frame me!

257
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:20,694
If he just wanted to frame you,

258
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:25,094
he would've left clues pointing to you.

259
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:27,194
But there weren't any.

260
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:28,494
None at all.

261
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,294
Why?

262
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:34,694
Because leaving evidence would cause the police to arrest Kagura,

263
00:15:34,694 --> 00:15:38,294
preventing him from reaching his ultimate goal, right?

264
00:15:39,694 --> 00:15:42,794
And you meant to try for that goal last night, didn't you?

265
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:47,294
Let's have a drink tonight to cleanse you of this evil.

266
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,794
You'll be at your apartment, right?

267
00:15:49,794 --> 00:15:55,094
But it didn't go as planned when Kikuhide Otsubo arrived.

268
00:15:55,094 --> 00:15:57,394
-Otsubo? -Yeah.

269
00:15:57,394 --> 00:16:01,894
His life's purpose was earning likes on interesting posts.

270
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,794
He was secretly following you for potential material

271
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:07,394
since you're so unlucky.

272
00:16:07,394 --> 00:16:08,794
Me?

273
00:16:08,794 --> 00:16:11,794
Otsubo also viewed Tanuki Ponkichi as his rival

274
00:16:11,794 --> 00:16:14,894
because he kept making interesting posts.

275
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:18,294
When that man appeared before him,

276
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:21,594
Otsubo decided to follow Kochiyama instead.

277
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:27,294
He hoped to stumble upon interesting material if he did.

278
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:31,294
But something made Otsubo realize

279
00:16:31,294 --> 00:16:33,794
that you were the one who made the bomb threat.

280
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:34,794
No, I...

281
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:37,494
So you silenced him.

282
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:41,894
Shocked by the murder, you canceled your plans for last night.

283
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:43,994
Today, you anonymously called the police

284
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:46,894
so you could reach your ultimate goal.

285
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:51,694
It might've been the unlucky man who's been seen online recently.

286
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:57,094
You were vague so the police wouldn't arrive immediately.

287
00:16:57,094 --> 00:17:00,994
In other words, this was the story you came up with.

288
00:17:00,994 --> 00:17:06,194
I successfully caused a commotion for money,

289
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:08,994
but Otsubo realized what I'd done,

290
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,294
so I killed him.

291
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:15,194
It's only a matter of time before I'm caught.

292
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:17,094
You planned to tell the police that's what he said,

293
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:19,694
and when they responded to your call...

294
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:21,194
I don't understand!

295
00:17:21,194 --> 00:17:22,894
I thought Kagura was just drinking a beer,

296
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:27,394
but then he suddenly started choking...

297
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:28,994
You planned to act

298
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:31,594
as if he killed himself out of desperation, didn't you?

299
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,894
You were going to kill me and make it look like a suicide?

300
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:36,994
Why?

301
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,394
Probably...

302
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:46,094
because of Haruka Ibe.

303
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:49,794
She has nothing to do with this!

304
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:54,494
Based on your reaction, it sounds like he's right.

305
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:59,894
Haruka? What about her?

306
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,894
Haruka told us

307
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:11,494
the three of you are very close,

308
00:18:11,494 --> 00:18:14,594
but there's nothing romantic about your relationship.

309
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,594
That's exactly how it is!

310
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:20,994
But maybe it was different for Kochiyama.

311
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:26,794
You have feelings for Haruka?

312
00:18:28,294 --> 00:18:31,394
While having fun together,

313
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:38,294
Kochiyama secretly desired to make Haruka his own

314
00:18:38,294 --> 00:18:42,194
and for you to disappear.

315
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:48,194
But the police would investigate if he simply murdered you,

316
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,794
so he thought to make it look like suicide.

317
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:53,894
You needed a motive for that.

318
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:58,594
That's when you suffered collateral damage from the unexploded bomb

319
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:00,894
and he came up with this plan.

320
00:19:02,194 --> 00:19:04,794
Having gotten a taste for the monetary compensation,

321
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:07,994
this time you called a bomb threat into a bank and caused a panic,

322
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:11,294
but things got out of control, so you took your own life.

323
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:14,094
He wanted that to be your motive for suicide.

324
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:17,694
In other words, his plan was already in motion when he took this picture.

325
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:21,594
Half a month ago...

326
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:26,894
Otsubo probably didn't know about the plan,

327
00:19:26,894 --> 00:19:30,794
but he wanted to frame you for it, too.

328
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,794
He went as far as to kill a person

329
00:19:32,794 --> 00:19:36,294
to strengthen your motive for suicide.

330
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:38,694
But everything I've said is speculation.

331
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,594
There's no evidence.

332
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:45,294
If we find poison in the glass Kagura was meant to drink from,

333
00:19:45,294 --> 00:19:49,194
the police will begin their investigation into this attempted murder.

334
00:19:49,194 --> 00:19:52,394
Then everything will become clear.

335
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:02,794
The boy's right.

336
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:07,094
You admit to killing Kikuhide Otsubo?

337
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,294
Apparently he saw me.

338
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,594
He saw a cleaning person making a phone call.

339
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:17,294
He didn't think anything of it at the time though.

340
00:20:20,494 --> 00:20:21,494
Hey.

341
00:20:22,494 --> 00:20:25,694
Aren't those clothes...

342
00:20:25,694 --> 00:20:30,294
Are you the one who made that call?

343
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:32,594
I didn't think anyone was following me!

344
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:37,694
You caused the commotion so you could post about it.

345
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:42,794
So Tanuki Ponkichi has been using underhanded techniques to earn likes.

346
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:47,794
He was confused about why I called, but...

347
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:50,294
I'll expose everything!

348
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,994
If he did that,

349
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:56,294
the plan I'd spent half a month on...

350
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:57,694
So before he could...

351
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:03,594
I had to kill him!

352
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,594
Kochiyama?

353
00:21:23,094 --> 00:21:26,394
Why are the police arresting you?

354
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:44,194
That idiot.

355
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,294
But they were three best friends.

356
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:20,194
It just means adults are complicated.

357
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:24,494
What is it, Genta?

358
00:23:24,494 --> 00:23:26,794
You look so serious.

359
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:30,094
I wonder how much compensation I'll receive.

360
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:31,494
What?

361
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,594
At least enough to buy a hundred broiled eels over rice, right?

362
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:36,494
The simple-minded are terrifying.

363
00:23:36,494 --> 00:23:38,694
Was he better off not knowing?

364
00:23:38,694 --> 00:23:40,694
Genta, you're the worst!

365
00:23:40,694 --> 00:23:42,894
You're the worst!

366
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:44,394
Hey, wait!

367
00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:46,594
I'll share with you guys!

368
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:48,294
That's not what we're talking about!

369
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,294
Don't follow us!

370
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,894
I'll throw in some eel liver soup, too!

371
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:52,294
What's that?

372
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:53,294
Gross!

373
00:23:54,294 --> 00:23:55,394
"Next Episode"

374
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,494
I killed them.

375
00:23:57,494 --> 00:24:03,194
Why were you suspected of running off with the ring?

376
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:04,594
It's all right.

377
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:09,994
None of the staff believed you took the ring.

378
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:17,794
A fire? Could it be...

379
00:24:18,794 --> 00:24:24,294
Next Conan, "The Cursed Tears of Borgia (Part 1)"

380
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:27,337
Next Conan's Hint:

381
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,237
"A TV film shoot"

382
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,437
Next week, there's no Conan!

383
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:32,637
-But Mai Kuraki... -Will sing a medley!

384
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,037
Maybe I'll sing, too.
