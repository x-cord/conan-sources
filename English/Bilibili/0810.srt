1
00:00:00,924 --> 00:00:04,024
"Mount Saijo, Nagano Prefecture"

2
00:00:13,524 --> 00:00:15,924
Hold it. Please wait.

3
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:19,224
I apologize. I'm sorry.

4
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,924
Besides, think about it, will you?

5
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:24,524
If they find out about this, you won't get away with it.

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,824
Your life will be over.

7
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:29,624
Those who crave to live, die.

8
00:00:33,624 --> 00:00:36,224
Those who crave to die, live.

9
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:02,424
I'm Bishamonten.

10
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:07,724
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

11
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,524
I'm the God of War!

12
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:13,624
The feeling that I've held all this time in my heart

13
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:15,824
We'll fly powerfully into our twentieth year.

14
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:17,524
The sound of woodpeckers echo through the old battlefield.

15
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,524
A case that shakes the police occurs.

16
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:21,324
He sees through the one and only truth.

17
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:23,024
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

18
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:25,324
His name is Detective Conan!

19
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:16,312
"The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 1)"

20
00:03:17,412 --> 00:03:19,912
Where is it you want to go?

21
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:23,412
Since we came all this way to Nagano,

22
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:26,912
we've to visit the place where Kenshin Uesugi and Shingen Takeda fought,

23
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:30,412
that is the old Battle of Kawanakajima!

24
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,712
Yes.

25
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,312
But were you that much of a history lover, Dad?

26
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:37,912
Didn't you know?

27
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:39,112
Come to think of it.

28
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:41,312
The other day Yoko Okino played the part of Princess Yu,

29
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:45,612
who Kansuke Yamamoto, the general of Takeda's army fell in love with

30
00:03:45,612 --> 00:03:47,712
on the history drama special,

31
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:51,212
Another thing that Nagano's famous for is their Shinshu noodles.

32
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:53,812
What was the strategy called?

33
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:58,612
The one that was used to fight that was named after a bird.

34
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:01,012
Woodpecker.

35
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:04,712
The woodpecker strategy, Ran!

36
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:06,212
Officer Yui.

37
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,112
That strategy was called the woodpecker strategy.

38
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:11,712
A woodpecker pecks on one side of the tree

39
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:14,112
and lies in wait on the opposite side of the tree

40
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:16,012
for the insects to come out.

41
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:18,712
One part of Takeda's army attacked Uesugi's forces

42
00:04:18,712 --> 00:04:22,412
that had taken up position in the mountains at night.

43
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:24,612
And the other part, took on the enemy forces

44
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:27,212
that came rushing down the mountains.

45
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:30,612
Thus, attacking the enemy from both sides and destroying them.

46
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:34,712
Besides, it's a famous strategy that is said to have been suggested

47
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:36,112
by Kansuke Yamamoto to Shingen Takeda!

48
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:37,712
Right, Kansuke?

49
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:41,312
Who cares? It's not like I came up with it.

50
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:45,112
Well, but Kenshin Uesugi expertly saw through this disappointing strategy,

51
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:49,412
that eventually drove Shingen Takeda into a predicament.

52
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,712
Like I just said, I didn't come up with it.

53
00:04:52,712 --> 00:04:55,112
What brings all three of you here today?

54
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,312
Is it a case?

55
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:59,112
No, we were asking around gathering information nearby

56
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,912
so we decided to drop by on our way back.

57
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:04,412
Besides, Inspector Yamato said he'd never been here before.

58
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:07,812
Nagano Prefectural Police, Inspector Kansuke Yamato.

59
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,312
One-eyed and big built.

60
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:12,012
He's got long hair and uses a cane.

61
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,612
The closest person to the description of Rum,

62
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:19,212
the number two of the Black Organization that Haibara mentioned.

63
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:22,812
Don't tell me that he's actually...

64
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:26,812
What is it, kid?

65
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:28,812
Is there something on my face?

66
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:30,312
Oh. No.

67
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:35,912
Hey, Yamato!

68
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:40,212
What're you doing in a place like this?

69
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:41,912
"Mamoru Saegusa (37)" -Don't tell me that you're on a date

70
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:46,312
with your childhood friend, Uehara, on duty?

71
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,612
It... It's nothing like that.

72
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,812
What brings you here, Mr. Saegusa?

73
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:56,212
We're on our way to the hide-out of a wanted robber,

74
00:05:56,212 --> 00:06:00,512
so we thought we'd pay our respects to Shingen before going.

75
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:03,012
We didn't come here to waste time.

76
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,712
After all, I'm not Aburakawa.

77
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:07,412
I'm not Aburakawa!

78
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:08,812
I'm Akiyama!

79
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:10,312
"Shinsuke Akiyama (26)" -I told you already, didn't I?

80
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:12,112
That my parents divorced last year,

81
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:15,012
and I took after my mother's maiden name, Akiyama!

82
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:16,312
Sorry...

83
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:18,912
By the way, have you seen our squad chief?

84
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,612
Squad chief? You mean Mr. Takeda?

85
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:22,612
"Shoji Kano (45)" -Yeah.

86
00:06:22,612 --> 00:06:25,112
We were supposed to join here.

87
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:28,012
But, he's nowhere in sight.

88
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,012
His cell phone won't connect either.

89
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:32,412
Darn, I wonder where and what he's doing?

90
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,412
Maybe he's waiting at the wrong place?

91
00:06:34,412 --> 00:06:36,512
After all, that man's pretty aged already.

92
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:37,712
Could be.

93
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:39,312
Let's go look elsewhere then.

94
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:40,912
Sorry to have intruded on you.

95
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:44,912
Oh, and if you see Takeda, tell him this.

96
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:48,212
That even though it's orders from the higher up,

97
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:51,312
I'll never go back to your squad.

98
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,612
I'd rather die than go back there!

99
00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:58,012
Yeah, I'll tell him.

100
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:01,312
I think you're the perfect fit for our squad.

101
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:02,712
Too bad.

102
00:07:05,012 --> 00:07:08,112
Did something happen between that officer named Takeda?

103
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:11,012
Yeah, just a little something in the past.

104
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:14,312
If you're going to the Battle of Kawanakajima,

105
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:15,712
would you like me to show you around?

106
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:17,612
You mean it's okay?

107
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:19,112
I guess so.

108
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:22,112
Since we still have some time before the investigation conference.

109
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,612
Even if we were go back to headquarters now,

110
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:26,512
all we have waiting there is for you to serve us your awful coffee.

111
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,712
How rude!

112
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:30,612
The chief said that my coffee's starting to taste better!

113
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:33,212
That was the previous chief of section one.

114
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:35,912
The current chief prefers black tea.

115
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:38,512
That man prefers tea with his looks?

116
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:41,712
You're not one to criticize other people's looks yourself, are you?

117
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,412
Let's hurry and go around.

118
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,112
"Kansuke Shrine" -First of all, this is the place

119
00:07:46,112 --> 00:07:49,412
that Kansuke Yamamoto is said to have died,

120
00:07:49,412 --> 00:07:51,412
The Kansuke Shrine.

121
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:55,012
"Yamamoto Grave" -And this is Kansuke's grave.

122
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:57,812
"Doai Bridge" -And this is the Doai Bridge

123
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:00,312
where Kansuke's head and body matched up perfectly.

124
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,612
-Matched up perfectly? -Matched up perfectly?

125
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:03,612
Right.

126
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:06,812
Kansuke's men managed to get back several of the heads

127
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:10,212
of the allied generals that were taken in battle by their enemy,

128
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:11,512
but since they were all smeared with blood,

129
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:14,212
they couldn't tell which head was Kansuke's.

130
00:08:14,212 --> 00:08:15,712
But when one of the heads matched up perfectly

131
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:19,212
with Kansuke's still armored body that was left back at the battlefield,

132
00:08:19,212 --> 00:08:21,512
they knew it was Kansuke's head.

133
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,312
And it happened on this bridge.

134
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:24,712
Oh.

135
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,212
But...

136
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:28,212
This is more like a tour visiting

137
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:31,512
the famous places involving Kansuke Yamamoto than the battlefield, right?

138
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,312
Oh, well, this is...

139
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,312
It can't be helped.

140
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:37,012
After all having a childhood friend

141
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:39,712
with a super similar name like Kansuke Yamato,

142
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:41,812
it's only natural that she'd be interested in this place.

143
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,112
But despite their similarities,

144
00:08:44,112 --> 00:08:49,112
I hope he doesn't do anything like die recklessly over a failed strategy

145
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,512
like the real Kansuke Yamamoto.

146
00:08:51,512 --> 00:08:56,812
Well, you don't look to be sensitive enough to regret failure though.

147
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,612
What?

148
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,712
Come... Both of you.

149
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:02,012
It's almost about time

150
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:03,512
so let's go take a look at the Chikuma River

151
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:05,512
and finish the tour of the battlefield.

152
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,512
Okay.

153
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:11,712
What beautiful scenery!

154
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:15,012
And, the river's so clear too!

155
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:19,212
It's hard to believe that a battle took place here in the past.

156
00:09:19,212 --> 00:09:24,112
Come to think of it, I think there was a poem about the river.

157
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:29,812
"The bones of the dead lying in the water"

158
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:33,512
"conjures images of warriors in the waters of the red river."

159
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,612
Water of the red river?

160
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:43,612
Just what does it mean?

161
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:47,512
I'm not sure if it's about Chikuma River here

162
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,712
but over thousands of men are said to have died

163
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:54,212
in the fierce Battle of Kawanakajima.

164
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:58,612
And Retsu Asai wrote this poem based on the legend.

165
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:00,712
That the river that flows in front of the shrine,

166
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:03,512
turned red with the blood of the fallen warriors

167
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:06,112
for three days and nights to put their souls to rest.

168
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:11,412
Since that battle, the river has been known as Akagawa, The Red River,

169
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:15,312
and the shrine, Akagawa Shrine, The Red River Shrine.

170
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:17,512
It's all exaggeration.

171
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:21,512
There's no way a river could turn red for three days and three nights.

172
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,112
Blood?

173
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:30,112
That's...

174
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:33,812
A person's head?

175
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:36,712
Call forensics right away!

176
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:37,812
Yes!

177
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,912
Hey! Was it really somebody's head?

178
00:10:48,912 --> 00:10:50,212
Yeah.

179
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:53,612
Moreover, it's the head of someone I know.

180
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,312
He's from the Nagano Prefectural Police First Investigation Section.

181
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:02,712
Inspector and Squad Chief, Shigeru Takeda.

182
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:03,912
But...

183
00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:06,212
Where's his body?

184
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,012
Over here it seems.

185
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:10,212
Unfortunately, on top of it having been burned,

186
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:13,112
it seems to have been slightly damaged too.

187
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:15,212
So, we won't be able to put them together

188
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:18,612
like Kansuke Yamamoto's was though.

189
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:24,312
Chief Takeda?

190
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:26,212
Who on earth?

191
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:27,412
Why?

192
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,312
Judging from the looks of it,

193
00:11:29,312 --> 00:11:32,512
it was burned over half a day ago.

194
00:11:32,512 --> 00:11:35,512
So, why did just the head come drifting along

195
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,412
just when I looked into the river from the bridge?

196
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:42,112
Maybe it's because the head was hung to the railing of the bridge?

197
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,512
See, over there!

198
00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:48,912
There's something that looks like a string hanging down.

199
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:53,612
The perpetrator probably put the head and fake blood into a plastic bag

200
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,412
and set it up so the string would break

201
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:58,612
and the bag would fall into the river after a certain amount of time.

202
00:11:58,612 --> 00:12:00,012
A stone or something was probably put in the bag

203
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,612
so only the bag would sink.

204
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,212
We heard a splashing sound

205
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:04,612
so I think there's no mistake about it!

206
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:06,412
Right, Pops Kogoro?

207
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:07,812
Yeah.

208
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,712
But how do you know it's fake blood?

209
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:12,112
Real blood would have congealed after a while

210
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:14,812
and wouldn't have come flowing in the river.

211
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:17,612
But why go through the trouble of using fake blood?

212
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,212
Probably to facilitate it being found.

213
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:22,812
I happen to spot it because I was looking at the river,

214
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:27,212
but otherwise it would have looked like trash drifting down the river.

215
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:31,112
There was an unnatural blood stain on the forehead

216
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:34,212
so we put luminol fluid on it and found a strange mark.

217
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,512
What?

218
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:40,012
Isn't this the alphabet X?

219
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:42,412
No, it's not an ordinary X.

220
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:44,612
It looks to be the footprint of an animal.

221
00:12:44,612 --> 00:12:46,912
A woodpecker.

222
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:53,612
Woodpeckers have feet that cling tightly to trees.

223
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:57,612
That's why their claws are shaped like an X.

224
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,512
Didn't you know?

225
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:04,612
A... A one-eyed man of big built?

226
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,879
But...

227
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:20,879
Takeda was sure hated, wasn't he?

228
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,279
Well, we can't be sure if this body is really Takeda's or not though.

229
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,479
Oh, well as to that, there's no mistake about it.

230
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,179
From the tip of his shoe that barely survived the fire,

231
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,479
we found his right big toe.

232
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,579
We should be able to do a DNA comparison.

233
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,879
I see. Then do it right away.

234
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,179
"Hyoe Kuroda (50)" -Come to think of it,

235
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,279
wasn't the Takeda Squad supposed to take an arrest warrant over

236
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,779
to the hide-out of the wanted robber?

237
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,679
But, we couldn't get in touch with him at all this morning.

238
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,679
And he didn't show up at the Hachiman Shrine

239
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,079
where we were supposed to meet him either.

240
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:57,879
Having no choice, we raided the robber's hide-out just the three of us,

241
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,379
but it seems he sensed us coming and the hide-out was empty.

242
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:05,479
After that, we split up and searched for Squad Chief Takeda.

243
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:08,679
Then we got word that a corpse was found.

244
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,579
Don't tell me that the squad chief went to the hide-out of that robber

245
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,979
before us and confronted him.

246
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:14,679
And was counterattacked.

247
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,879
Not old man Takeda, he would never do that.

248
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:22,879
He would willingly kill to arrest.

249
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,179
But, what bothers me is the mark of the woodpecker.

250
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,779
We've got to figure out what it means.

251
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,679
Maybe the perpetrator used the woodpecker

252
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,279
just to leave an X mark on the forehead?

253
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,179
It does look like a kill mark too.

254
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,079
Your deduction lacks finesse as usual.

255
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,079
Doesn't the connection between Takeda and a woodpecker

256
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,379
ring a bell in anybody?

257
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,279
-No. -Nothing in particular.

258
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,979
The Woodpeckers Club.

259
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,579
Just around the time, I married into the Torada family.

260
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,179
My late husband said.

261
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,779
That there seems to be a group called The Woodpeckers Club

262
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,679
at the Nagano Prefectural Police.

263
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,279
I've never heard of it,

264
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,379
but what kind of group is it?

265
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,379
Well... When I mentioned that I used to be a police detective,

266
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:10,479
he clammed up.

267
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:14,479
He didn't have nice things to say about it, though. That's for sure.

268
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,779
I see.

269
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,879
At any rate, if the body was burned under this bridge,

270
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,179
somebody may have witnessed fire or smoke.

271
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:25,979
Saegusa, Kano and Akiyama, go ask around this vicinity!

272
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,179
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

273
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:29,679
Yamato, Morofushi and Uehara,

274
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,279
go search for anyone that may had a grudge because of a case or something.

275
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,579
All right.

276
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:35,879
Be on your guard.

277
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,779
If as Yamato says, the woodpecker's footprint is a kill mark,

278
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:46,679
the suspect could be planning to come after us, the police force, next.

279
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,679
Detective Mouri.

280
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,679
I've heard about you.

281
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,479
I don't want to do this to you,

282
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:55,479
but I'm going to have you go around with Uehara and the others

283
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:58,479
because you're one of the first discoverers.

284
00:15:58,479 --> 00:15:59,779
Yes, sir!

285
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:01,379
Of course!

286
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,179
Officer Yui.

287
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,379
What is it, Conan?

288
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:08,579
I've something I'd like to ask you later.

289
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,379
"Nagano Prefectural Police Headquarters" -What?

290
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,479
He was unconscious for nearly 10 years in the hospital?

291
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,379
At the police hospital?

292
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,379
Investigation first Section Chief Kuroda

293
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,179
seems to have gotten into a terribly serious accident.

294
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:27,479
I see, that's why he was temporarily transferred at that age and came.

295
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:31,379
Yes. It's more natural to transfer from the National Police Agency

296
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,379
to the local police at a younger age.

297
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,679
Then, the burn that he had on his face was...

298
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,779
I think it was because of that accident.

299
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,879
His right eye seems to be artificial

300
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,079
and the nurse who undid his bandaged seemed to have gone weak in the hips.

301
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:47,379
His pitch black hair seems to have turned totally white

302
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,479
because of stress of the accident

303
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,679
and he seemed like a completely different person.

304
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,379
A different person?

305
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,179
Even now after he regained consciousness,

306
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:59,879
he says that he can't keep track of details here and there.

307
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,379
What is it, Conan?

308
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:03,079
Is something bothering you about the chief?

309
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,279
Oh, no.

310
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:06,879
Well, it's only natural that you'd be bothered.

311
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:11,579
Because he does look like some big shot of a certain organization.

312
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,079
Well, your face is a good match with his though.

313
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:17,079
I wished you'd shut up!

314
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,179
And? Did you find anything?

315
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,279
Yes.

316
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,879
I took a look at the cases Mr. Takeda handled

317
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:25,279
using the computer in the reference room.

318
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,779
And there were two cases that caught my eye,

319
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:30,679
in which Mr. Takeda shot and killed the suspect.

320
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,879
Shot and killed?

321
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:35,879
Yeah. The first was nine years ago.

322
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:41,679
A man used drugs and randomly fired his gun in town.

323
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,279
The second was six months ago when a man took people hostage

324
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,079
and confined himself in a bank.

325
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,979
Both of them were shot in the head with old man Takeda's gun and died.

326
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:54,279
And both of them were submitted to the prosecution with dead suspects.

327
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,779
Then you mean that the bereaved family of the two

328
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,579
held a grudge against him and...

329
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,379
I thought so at first

330
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,179
but the parents of the one who confined himself to the bank

331
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,679
regretted what their son had done and committed suicide.

332
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,079
He had no siblings either.

333
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:10,179
The parents of the man who randomly shot his gun

334
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:11,879
have also died of an illness.

335
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:15,579
The only person left is the grandmother of the suspect who's over 80.

336
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:18,779
But that old lady couldn't have done something like that.

337
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:21,479
Come to think of it, haven't you seen anything, Kansuke?

338
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,879
Like a suspicious smoke or a person.

339
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:28,879
I thought you used that bridge for rehabilitation of your legs.

340
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:33,579
Yeah. I had some things to attend to and didn't go today.

341
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,879
Oh, sorry. I've got something to attend to again.

342
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:39,179
If there's any progress, mail me, won't you?

343
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:40,279
Kansuke?

344
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:44,079
Inspector Yamato mentioned "that old lady" a while ago,

345
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,379
does he know the grandmother of the perpetrator?

346
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:47,379
Yes.

347
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:52,679
The man who shot the gun randomly in town nine years ago was in fact...

348
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,679
Inspector Yamato's childhood friend.

349
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,579
I remember that he and Kansuke used to play a lot together

350
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:01,079
until sundown when they were children.

351
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,779
To the point of making me a bit jealous.

352
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,479
You were jealous?

353
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,779
Oh, don't tell Kansuke this.

354
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,779
I won't.

355
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,979
I see, that's why he said what he did at the shrine.

356
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:14,879
I'll never go back to your squad.

357
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:17,279
I'd rather die than go back there!

358
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,879
Because his best friend was shot to death by that officer named Takeda.

359
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,079
Right.

360
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,879
Moreover, right before his eyes.

361
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:29,679
Back then Kansuke was at the crime site as a member of the Takeda Squad.

362
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,579
Since there were casualties in that shooting,

363
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:36,779
he said that Takeda had no choice but to shoot the suspect.

364
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,079
Where is it? Where is it?

365
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:49,379
The investigation documents of the case.

366
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:50,979
If I remember correctly...

367
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,179
Found it. This is it.

368
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:01,379
"Death by gunshot wound to the head".

369
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,579
I see. That's the story.

370
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:12,179
I've to hurry and let him know about this too.

371
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,279
Hey, where's Yamato?

372
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,679
Where the heck did he go?

373
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,779
Did something come up?

374
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,979
Saegusa and his group came up with something when they were asking around.

375
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:31,579
They found a witness who testified seeing somebody who looked like Yamato

376
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:33,479
near the crime site this morning!

377
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,379
What? But Kansuke...

378
00:20:35,379 --> 00:20:38,879
I mean... Inspector Yamato said that he didn't go there this morning.

379
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:42,079
Either way, we've got to talk to him.

380
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,079
"Kansuke Yamato" -It's from Kansuke.

381
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,879
-Kansuke. -Is Mr. Kano there?

382
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,379
He's asking if Mr. Kano is here.

383
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,679
Mr. Kano said that he realized something,

384
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,279
so he was going back home.

385
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:58,979
He has copies of the cases handled stored at his house, you see.

386
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:01,379
It seems he went home.

387
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,379
What about Mr. Kano?

388
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:08,879
I had about 10 somewhat missed calls from him!

389
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,379
I called him back but he isn't answering.

390
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:12,479
I'm sure something happened to him.

391
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,379
I'm going to head on over there, so you guys hurry up and come too!

392
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:16,979
Hey, wait.

393
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,379
What's up?

394
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,279
He says that he's anxious

395
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,979
about the number of missed calls he received from Mr. Kano

396
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:25,179
and is going directly over to his house.

397
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:28,679
I see. Then, let's head on to Kano's house too!

398
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:29,779
-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!

399
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,379
Morofushi.

400
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,079
Yes, sir!

401
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,379
Keep your eyes on Yamato from now on.

402
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:41,979
Today is the day that the random shooting occurred nine years ago.

403
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,679
It's the memorial day of his best friend.

404
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,079
You know what I mean, don't you?

405
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,579
Yes.

406
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,779
The lock is open.

407
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,479
Kansuke's shoes.

408
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,579
Hey, where are you?

409
00:22:00,579 --> 00:22:01,779
Mr. Kano!

410
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,679
I'm Bishamonten.

411
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:18,479
Oh, Kansuke.

412
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:22,079
I shall destroy the woodpeckers.

413
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,879
I'm the God of War!

414
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:53,579
"Next Episode" -There are...

415
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,379
three woodpecker's left.

416
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,779
Komei. Don't tell me that you...

417
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,879
Right, Kansuke.

418
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,579
It's you.

419
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,379
You find the clue to solving the case

420
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:07,879
from an unexpected perspective and support the deduction.

421
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,879
The wisdom bag of the Sleeping Kogoro.

422
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:15,779
It's rumored to be so at MPD, Conan Edogawa.

423
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:21,779
Next Conan, "The Darkness of the Prefectural Police (Part 2)"

424
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:24,622
Next Conan's Hint:

425
00:24:24,622 --> 00:24:26,622
"Rope"

426
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:28,222
The sound of woodpeckers.

427
00:24:28,222 --> 00:24:29,622
Peck...

428
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:31,222
Occupied.
