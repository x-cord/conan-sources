1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,140
Just as flowing water has no form and the breeze is invisible.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,940
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,640
At last, the two of us are out on a date.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,540
But an additional dish of trouble is added to our meal.

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,040
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,140
His name is Detective Conan!

8
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,899
While exploring a limestone cave,

9
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:58,699
I was shot by a gang of bank robbers.

10
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:01,899
Ran's blood is used for my transfusion and it saved my life.

11
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,899
This makes me decide to tell Ran about everything.

12
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,099
But then Haibara points a gun at me.

13
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,299
And then, on the day of Teitan High School's school festival,

14
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,399
while the play was going on in the gymnasium,

15
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:17,699
a murder takes place in the audience!

16
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,399
And from beneath the black knight's mask...

17
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:25,299
The crime was also bold and brazen.

18
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:27,599
Who are you?

19
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,299
It's been a long time, Inspector Megure.

20
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,299
It's me, Shinichi Kudo.

21
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:42,899
"Perilous Return: Shinichi Is Back"

22
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,399
Yes.

23
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,599
Yes?

24
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,999
Take your finger off that buzzer!

25
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,599
I heard you the first time!

26
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,399
Shinichi.

27
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:03,099
Do you really know today's schedule at school?

28
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,799
No problem, it's the same as last year.

29
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:05,999
All we're going to do is clean up

30
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:08,599
after the school fest anyway, right?

31
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,699
I'll go get ready, wait here.

32
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,899
There he is! It's Shinichi!

33
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,799
I wasn't dreaming.

34
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,799
He really came back.

35
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,499
Isn't that wonderful, Conan?

36
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,799
Huh?

37
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:33,799
Yes, this is much better!

38
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,999
This is my real body.

39
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,099
Don't get too comfortable, though.

40
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,599
Haibara!

41
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,799
Who do you think you are anyway?

42
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:44,599
The only reason she hasn't found out about you

43
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,299
is because of the special antidote I made

44
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,799
and the capsule and mask voice changer Doctor Agasa made

45
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,699
so that I could disguise myself as you.

46
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,499
You promised that all you would do was talk to her secretly

47
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,299
on the stage for a few minutes.

48
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,199
So why'd you show your face so dramatically?

49
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,499
Sorry!

50
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:03,199
But when I solved the case,

51
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,499
I just couldn't control myself.

52
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:09,399
Besides, I never thought the antidote you gave me

53
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,399
would completely restore me back to my old self.

54
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:15,699
Do you think I made a mistake?

55
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:18,699
You should thank that friend of yours from Osaka.

56
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,799
When you collapsed

57
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,899
and after I told him what was going on,

58
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:27,499
he told everyone not to talk about the case.

59
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,999
I don't know how well he convinced everyone though.

60
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:36,199
I guess I'll have to keep up this act and stay at Ran's place

61
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:37,599
until things cool down for your sake.

62
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,299
Hey, Haibara.

63
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:42,799
Why are you doing all this for me?

64
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,599
You made the antidote,

65
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:48,299
don't you want to take it and go back to your old life?

66
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:50,899
You fool.

67
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,799
I'm only helping you because if your cover is blown,

68
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:57,499
I'm going to get caught in the crossfire.

69
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:00,399
Besides, the antidote you took was a test product.

70
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,099
I don't intend to take it

71
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:06,999
until I've observed how it affects you.

72
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,399
By the way, Haibara...

73
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,899
What is it now?

74
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,599
Could you stop talking like a girl when you use Conan's voice?

75
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,099
It sort of gives me the creeps.

76
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,599
But why, I think it's rather charming.

77
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,599
That's so creepy.

78
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:22,499
I was so surprised.

79
00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:25,899
Who would've thought you were the black knight?

80
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,599
You didn't even have the lines memorized,

81
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,799
you had some nerve doing what you did.

82
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,199
If you had kept ad-libbing it,

83
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
the play would have been ruined.

84
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,599
Sonoko, you rat fink.

85
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,799
You got it?

86
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,499
The black knight suddenly grabs the princess

87
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:42,799
and gives her a big kiss!

88
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,799
Don't do any talking until then!

89
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,999
So what did you think?

90
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,299
You mean the play?

91
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,599
That's a tough question.

92
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,299
Not the play, Princess Heart!

93
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:58,099
It doesn't matter so much, but I'd like to know.

94
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,599
I liked you in that dress!

95
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,399
Like they say, fine feathers make fine birds.

96
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,199
You looked nice!

97
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,499
What do you mean by that?

98
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:10,199
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

99
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,499
There's Conan!

100
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,299
Congratulations on being released from the hospital!

101
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,899
Hey! How have you guys been?

102
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,599
Hello...

103
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,799
Hey, who's that guy?

104
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,799
That's the high school kid who lives next door to Doctor Agasa.

105
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:27,899
Oh, from that haunted mansion.

106
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,899
By the way, Haibara said she had a cold

107
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:32,099
and wouldn't be coming to school.

108
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:35,099
Did you catch yesterday's soccer game?

109
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,999
-Yes, I sure did! It was fantastic! -I see.

110
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:41,199
I was one of them until just a few days ago.

111
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,399
It's so unreal. As if it was a dream.

112
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,199
Shinichi!

113
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,699
Come on, we've got to hurry.

114
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,199
We're going to be late!

115
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,899
Wait for me, Ran...

116
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:54,499
Huh?

117
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,299
No...

118
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,499
I was only kidding.

119
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:00,599
Good grief, stop playing games.

120
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,699
Act your age for goodness sakes.

121
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,899
I told you it was just a joke.

122
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,499
Kudo!

123
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:12,099
You just got back and you're already walking to school as a couple?

124
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,499
Idiots. We're not like that!

125
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:19,999
By the way, the new English teacher is one good looker,

126
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,899
she's a foreigner with a great body.

127
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,799
-Really? -Wait.

128
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,399
You know, you still haven't told me.

129
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,399
Told you what?

130
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,999
You told me you had something important to talk to me about.

131
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,599
Oh, that.

132
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,199
Listen.

133
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:41,599
You nosey bunch.

134
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,199
Stop eavesdropping!

135
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,599
Mrs. Kudo, help us!

136
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,299
-Tonight at 8, -Your husband has gone mad!

137
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,199
Beika Center Building,

138
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,399
rooftop restaurant?

139
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:02,899
Are you sure you can afford this?

140
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,899
This place looks awfully expensive.

141
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:07,299
Don't worry about it.

142
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,499
I've got my father's card.

143
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:11,299
You're a very bad son!

144
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,499
How can you say that?

145
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:15,199
My parents are worse, they left me all alone

146
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,199
and took off on a trip.

147
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,999
You and Conan are so much alike.

148
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:24,899
His parents are abroad, too.

149
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,099
-Really? -You know...

150
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,899
I've been thinking about this along time.

151
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:34,399
It concerns you being Conan.

152
00:08:37,199 --> 00:08:39,899
I imagined that you got into some kind of trouble

153
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,899
and had to go into hiding,

154
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,199
so you took some kind of medicine or anything

155
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,999
that Doctor Agasa made to make you small.

156
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,899
Isn't that ridiculous?

157
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,699
You're almost right, though.

158
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,699
It's funny though.

159
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:57,699
Now that you're back, when I look at him,

160
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,699
he looks like a whole different person.

161
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:03,499
You idiot. Of course, he does.

162
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,799
Because someone else is disguising herself as me.

163
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,499
What did you want to talk to me about?

164
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:13,899
It's like this...

165
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,399
I just wanted to say...

166
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,799
"Beika Center Building's Observation Restaurant" -Sir.

167
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,199
Do you mean you're not going to the party?

168
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,199
Yes, I'm not feeling too good.

169
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,099
"Taiji Tatsumi (58)" -Give everyone my regards,

170
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,899
and ask them to work hard for the company.

171
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,899
Why is this elevator hall so dark?

172
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,299
Sir!

173
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:38,599
"Satoru Ooba (31)" -I got them to dim the lights...

174
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:40,999
for that surprise you're planning.

175
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:44,099
Oh, now I remember.

176
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:46,099
Well, say hello to everyone.

177
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:47,899
Goodbye...

178
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:55,099
Excuse me, could you tell me what room the party is in?

179
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:56,199
Ms. Sakurako!

180
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,299
The party's at the Italian restaurant back there.

181
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,399
I see.

182
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,299
Mr. Ooba!

183
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:04,499
Excuse me.

184
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,899
I have something to discuss with Ms. Sakurako.

185
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,999
Sure.

186
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,899
But the party's going to start soon, so don't be long.

187
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,199
Okay.

188
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,599
Mr. Ooba!

189
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,199
You're late.

190
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:22,899
You promised to meet me here before 8:30, remember?

191
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,199
"Sakurako Tatsumi (26)" -I'm sorry! It took me long to get ready.

192
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:30,199
But never mind that, did you tell dad about us?

193
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,499
Of course, I did.

194
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:33,399
I thought he'd be really mad,

195
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,399
but he gave his approval right away.

196
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,499
He said he trusted me and knew I'd take good care of you.

197
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,999
Then, we can married!

198
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,199
Yes.

199
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:46,099
Now, how about giving me a reward for being so brave?

200
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:47,399
Let's see...

201
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,899
How about a nice, big kiss?

202
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,099
Hey, the party has already started.

203
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,599
8:30, right on the dot.

204
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,499
Before we go to the party, here.

205
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:13,799
It's a present for you.

206
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,099
Oh, my. What is it?

207
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,099
It's a pink pearl necklace

208
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:21,299
matching with the earrings you're wearing tonight.

209
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:22,799
Thank you!

210
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,399
It's the least I could do.

211
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,999
Today is a very important day.

212
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:31,399
It's the day we become formally engaged.

213
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,599
So, you figured it out just by something like that?

214
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,599
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.

215
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,199
You know it!

216
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,599
And? What did you want to talk to me about?

217
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,999
About that...

218
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,499
Good grief. I know it's not easy to say,

219
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:55,499
but if you're a man, then act like one and get it over with.

220
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:56,699
You want to borrow my notes to study

221
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,199
for the time you weren't in class, don't you?

222
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,299
What?

223
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,499
Huh? Did I say something wrong?

224
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:03,599
I thought for sure that's what you wanted,

225
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,899
I brought you copies of it.

226
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,199
Well...

227
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,799
Actually, you're right.

228
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,999
I just didn't know how to ask.

229
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,199
I knew it.

230
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,899
Silly, that's not what I wanted to say!

231
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:23,599
The reason I asked you out to dinner is...

232
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:27,199
There's something I wanted to tell you.

233
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:33,299
It's...

234
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:40,399
What's that? Did someone scream?

235
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,399
Somebody probably just saw a cockroach or something,

236
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,499
don't worry about it.

237
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,399
Hey, come quick!

238
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,699
There's a dead body in the elevator.

239
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,699
Did anybody call the police?

240
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:53,899
So, here's what I wanted to say.

241
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,399
A gun, it's a gun!

242
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,099
They said the president of a company has been shot in the head!

243
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:00,699
It's like this...

244
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,299
You don't have to hold yourself back.

245
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:05,599
Huh?

246
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:08,899
I know you're dying to see what it's all about.

247
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,699
Well...

248
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:14,099
I'm not like some people, I won't run away or hide.

249
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:16,099
So go ahead and check it out,

250
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,899
Mr. Detective.

251
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:24,899
Get going! I might change my mind if you don't go now.

252
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,399
Ran.

253
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:29,399
Thanks.

254
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,899
I'll be right back.

255
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,399
Sure.

256
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:47,088
-Please, stand back. -So?

257
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:48,688
Has the victim been identified?

258
00:13:48,688 --> 00:13:51,888
The victim is Taiji Tatsumi, 58 years old.

259
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:54,188
He's the president of a game company.

260
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:56,488
Those three were first on the scene.

261
00:13:56,488 --> 00:13:58,188
They work for the same game company

262
00:13:58,188 --> 00:13:59,788
and they were going to take this elevator

263
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:02,388
to get something they had forgotten in the office

264
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:04,188
when they found the body.

265
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:05,688
What did they forget?

266
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:08,388
It was a bouquet they were presenting

267
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:11,088
at the company's 20th anniversary's party

268
00:14:11,088 --> 00:14:12,888
being held tonight at a restaurant here.

269
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:16,888
The game company occupies the 24th to the 36th floors of this building.

270
00:14:16,888 --> 00:14:20,788
And this is their private elevator.

271
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:23,088
Mr. Tatsumi said he wasn't feeling well,

272
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:25,888
so he was going to drop by the office then head home.

273
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,088
His clothes are rumpled,

274
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:31,588
the killer must have gone through them looking for money.

275
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:37,788
Hey, wasn't there a similar incident here before?

276
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,988
It was when I just became a detective,

277
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:43,988
a young kid came and interfered.

278
00:14:43,988 --> 00:14:47,388
I was still in elementary school then.

279
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:52,088
Excuse me, but I don't think this was a robbery.

280
00:14:52,088 --> 00:14:54,788
That's right, it happened just like this.

281
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:59,388
If the killer had a gun and wanted to rob him,

282
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:03,088
he would have taken him to some place remote.

283
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:06,588
If he intended to search him for money after killing him,

284
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:09,688
there was no telling when someone would use the elevator

285
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:11,788
so staying here would be too risky.

286
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:13,588
Besides, who takes the buttons off the shirt's sleeves

287
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:16,488
just to search for money?

288
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,888
Isn't that right,

289
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:19,988
Inspector Megure?

290
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:21,688
Kudo!

291
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,688
Don't mention my name.

292
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:27,088
What, again?

293
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:29,688
But why are you here?

294
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,088
Ran and I were having dinner here.

295
00:15:32,088 --> 00:15:36,488
Good grief, high school kids having dinner in a place like this.

296
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:40,088
Actually, I had a special reason for choosing this place.

297
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:44,088
Papa...

298
00:15:44,088 --> 00:15:45,288
Mr. Tatsumi.

299
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:48,288
No! Who would do this to papa?

300
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:50,788
When we said goodnight to him here just a while ago,

301
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:52,688
he was just fine.

302
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:56,588
So, you people were the last to see Mr. Tatsumi alive?

303
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:00,788
The three of us saw him off in this elevator.

304
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:03,388
Ms. Sakurako arrived shortly after and...

305
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:08,088
She and I went over tonight's speech, then we went to the party.

306
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:11,588
Did anyone get into this elevator during that time?

307
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:13,288
No, no one.

308
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,188
Do you know what time it was?

309
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:16,488
Let's see...

310
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:17,788
It was 8:30!

311
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:19,888
The woppers were going off as the party started

312
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:23,488
and that's the time I saw showing, so I'm sure of it!

313
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:26,688
But you're not wearing a wristwatch.

314
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:29,188
I saw the time on Mr. Ooba's wristwatch!

315
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,088
It was when he touched my earring.

316
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:34,088
He touched your earring?

317
00:16:34,088 --> 00:16:37,088
When we were here, he gave me a gift.

318
00:16:37,088 --> 00:16:38,488
He said it's a pink pearl necklace

319
00:16:38,488 --> 00:16:41,788
mtaching with the earrings I'm wearing tonight.

320
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:44,888
I was so happy, but...

321
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:46,288
Ms. Sakurako.

322
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:49,388
We'll have to return to the party

323
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:51,488
and tell the others what happened.

324
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:56,288
Ms. Sakurako, we should go too.

325
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:57,988
Officer Takagi.

326
00:16:57,988 --> 00:17:00,288
Don't you think their story's strange?

327
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:01,788
Yes.

328
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,388
Well...

329
00:17:04,388 --> 00:17:07,088
I do wonder whether she really saw the dial, though.

330
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,288
How dare you!

331
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:10,588
I certainly did see it!

332
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:12,788
I'm sure you're suspicious

333
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:15,788
because when you got here it was quite dark, wasn't it?

334
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:16,888
But as you can see,

335
00:17:16,888 --> 00:17:19,888
the hands on my watch are luminous.

336
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,588
So, you can see the time even in the dark.

337
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:24,188
Mr. Tatsumi himself asked me to dim the lights in this hall,

338
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,788
he was planning a surprise.

339
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:29,988
I still think it's strange, though.

340
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:31,288
Hey, let me in on it too.

341
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:32,888
Hey, wait a minute.

342
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:35,288
What strikes you as so strange?

343
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,588
Just watch.

344
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:39,688
When you touch her earring with that hand,

345
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:43,188
you can't see the dial, can you?

346
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,188
Stupid, aren't you? You can see it if you touch her other ear.

347
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:50,388
Why deliberately touch the ear on your right?

348
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:52,688
Can't you see by looking at her?

349
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:55,588
That's the side her earring shows.

350
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:56,788
That's why I...

351
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:58,888
What about your right hand?

352
00:17:58,888 --> 00:18:01,488
Wouldn't it have been easier to use your right hand?

353
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:04,588
Well, if your right hand was holding something,

354
00:18:04,588 --> 00:18:05,888
you would have had no other choice, though

355
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:15,188
I wonder what it is?

356
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:18,388
I wonder what he wants to tell me that is so important.

357
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,388
What could it be?

358
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:22,288
You don't think he...

359
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:23,988
Hey, have you put on some weight

360
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:26,088
since the last time I saw you?

361
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:28,188
It's possible.

362
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:31,088
My clothes do feel tight lately.

363
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:34,688
But he wouldn't invite me to dinner just to tell me that.

364
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:37,388
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

365
00:18:37,388 --> 00:18:40,488
Could you hold dessert until my friend comes back?

366
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:43,188
He ran off when he heard that scream just now.

367
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,888
But he's a detective,

368
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:48,888
I'm sure he'll solve the case and be right back.

369
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:50,288
I understand completely.

370
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:52,288
Huh? Is something wrong?

371
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:54,088
Oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:55,688
It's just that a former sommelier told me

373
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:56,988
about this legendary couple

374
00:18:56,988 --> 00:19:00,288
and you two fit the description perfectly.

375
00:19:00,288 --> 00:19:02,588
That couple sat at this very table, too.

376
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:05,888
It happened about 20 years ago,

377
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:08,688
the fellow from 20 years ago was a detective, too.

378
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:10,388
He returned to the table after solving a case

379
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:12,288
and shouted it out.

380
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:15,188
So, you'd better prepare yourself for it, too.

381
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,388
Prepare myself for what?

382
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:19,888
A proposal, he's going to propose!

383
00:19:21,288 --> 00:19:23,288
Well, good luck!

384
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:28,688
Propose?

385
00:19:28,688 --> 00:19:31,488
I don't believe it.

386
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:34,388
He wouldn't...

387
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:35,988
I don't believe it.

388
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:40,088
It's just not possible.

389
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:41,588
What are you getting at?

390
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,988
Are you implying I had a gun in my right hand?

391
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:46,088
A gun?

392
00:19:46,088 --> 00:19:48,988
I never mentioned a gun.

393
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:52,088
Did you have one?

394
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:54,788
Inspector, who is this kid?

395
00:19:54,788 --> 00:19:56,688
Well, he is...

396
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:59,788
I may not look it, but I'm a cop too, fresh out of school.

397
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:00,888
Isn't that right, Inspector?

398
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:05,688
Excuse me, you appear to suspect Mr. Ooba,

399
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:07,888
but if the three of them saw papa off here,

400
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,888
then Mr. Ooba couldn't possibly have done it.

401
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:13,188
He was with me after that.

402
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,588
Did you leave at any time?

403
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:19,588
I went to the restroom to put the necklace he gave me on.

404
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:21,688
While I was there, I retouched my lipstick,

405
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,288
it took about two or three minutes.

406
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,188
But we were talking through the walls,

407
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:26,788
so it was like being together.

408
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,688
Inspector!

409
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:32,988
We found a gun with a silencer and empty gun shells.

410
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,288
Where?

411
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,588
In the one of the building's trash dump.

412
00:20:36,588 --> 00:20:40,488
It appears the killer threw it down the dust chute.

413
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,388
Is there a dust chute on this floor?

414
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:46,388
Yes, near the restroom.

415
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:47,788
I see.

416
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,988
So you could have it gotten rid of it

417
00:20:48,988 --> 00:20:50,388
while carrying on with the conversation.

418
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:51,888
Oh, come on!

419
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:52,988
It seems you police are dead set

420
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:55,188
on making me out to be the killer.

421
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,888
So, tell me how I could have killed Mr. Tatsumi

422
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:01,188
after he left in the elevator.

423
00:21:01,188 --> 00:21:03,788
I was with her all the time.

424
00:21:03,788 --> 00:21:05,488
Besides, if I shot him,

425
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:09,188
there should be powder burns on my sleeve, right?

426
00:21:09,188 --> 00:21:11,988
Then, will you allow us to check you out?

427
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:14,388
Go right ahead.

428
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:17,288
Then, follow me.

429
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:18,688
Mr. Ooba.

430
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:21,288
Pardon me, but did you...

431
00:21:21,288 --> 00:21:24,788
and he kiss in front of the elevator?

432
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:27,288
Were you watching us?

433
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:30,088
No, it's something my mother told me.

434
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,188
She said a woman will usually re-apply Iipstick

435
00:21:32,188 --> 00:21:34,788
only after a meal or after a kiss.

436
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:37,788
So tell me, how did he hold you?

437
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:40,288
How? Well, he put his arm around me like this.

438
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:44,888
At that time, wasn't your back facing the elevator?

439
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,288
Yes. As a matter of fact, it was.

440
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:50,488
Did you two always meet secretly like this?

441
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:54,388
Yes, we had arranged to meet here tonight.

442
00:21:54,388 --> 00:21:55,988
Hey, what is this?

443
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,788
Thank you very much.

444
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:59,788
You were very helpful.

445
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:03,988
I'm sorry but I have one more question.

446
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:08,288
By chance, were those earrings also a gift from Mr. Oba?

447
00:22:08,288 --> 00:22:10,088
Unfortunately, you guessed wrong.

448
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:13,588
I bought these this afternoon on the spur of the moment.

449
00:22:13,588 --> 00:22:15,688
These weren't from him.

450
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:18,088
Is that so? Thank you.

451
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,588
I was right.

452
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:24,988
He killed Mr. Tatsumi after all.

453
00:22:24,988 --> 00:22:27,088
It was Mr. Oba, no doubt about it!

454
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:01,888
"Next Episode" -Your fingerprints were on the plastic bag.

455
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:07,188
Of course, they would be.

456
00:24:07,188 --> 00:24:12,288
I touched that plastic bag too, you know.

457
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,988
What?

458
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:15,588
Hey, Kudo...

459
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:18,288
So, fresh out of school detective, what's next?

460
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:19,588
All right, then.

461
00:24:19,588 --> 00:24:22,288
Let us open the door of truth.

462
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:24,988
Next Conan,

463
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:28,509
"Perilous Return: Place Where Vows Are Made"

464
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,106
Next Conan's Hint:

465
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:33,606
"Pink pearl necklace"

466
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:35,206
Next episode, Ran and I will have a...

467
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:38,406
-Happy ending... -Like that will ever happen.
