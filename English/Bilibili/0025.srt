1
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:05,451
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,451 --> 00:00:08,485
High school student Shinichi was
forced to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,485 --> 00:00:11,485
Although smaller, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,485 --> 00:00:14,685
Today's is a ransom case!
Money won't buy love!

5
00:00:14,685 --> 00:00:18,018
Even if the evidence is underwater,
there's always only one truth!

6
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:24,918
The first end of the century in 100 years

7
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:30,118
When told to cry, I laughed instead

8
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:43,051
The first end of the century
in a long, long time

9
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:49,118
We're leaping into a wide open world

10
00:00:49,118 --> 00:00:55,118
The things I tried to
understand as a child

11
00:00:55,118 --> 00:01:01,451
remain a mystery even as an adult

12
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:07,751
I'm neither a hotshot
nor especially great

13
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:13,851
All I understand is
the pounding of my heart

14
00:01:13,851 --> 00:01:19,485
It's neither an answer nor the truth

15
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:31,485
All I understand is
the pounding of my heart

16
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:59,085
The Fake Ransom Case.

17
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:28,851
It's almost time. Don't push it, now.

18
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,818
The hostage's safety
is the most important.

19
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,585
I can hardly believe this
is Mr. Takei's daughter...

20
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:41,851
Hello?!

21
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,585
Do you have the money?

22
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,051
I do!

23
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,085
Let Naoko go!

24
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,285
Hold on. I'll let you see her.

25
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:58,318
The kidnapper showed up
in a mini-van, Inspector!

26
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,285
It stopped nearby!

27
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:06,151
Naoko!

28
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,551
I'll bring the money now.

29
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:14,518
Wait. There are policemen hiding here.

30
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:18,185
The deal is off.

31
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:21,385
Wait!

32
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:22,985
They're running away!

33
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:25,751
Let's go!

34
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:12,151
The car never braked
and flew right into the water.

35
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:19,251
So you were classmates
with the kidnapped Takei Naoko?

36
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:20,785
Yes.

37
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,751
Takei Naoko...

38
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,418
She always looked so lonely...

39
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,218
But there's no way
she could've survived this...

40
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,451
Inspector!

41
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,518
We couldn't find her body
at the river bottom either.

42
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:51,685
The river runs fast in this area, so
she may have been taken downstream...

43
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,818
Oh no!

44
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:54,751
What do you mean, her body?!

45
00:04:55,618 --> 00:04:59,951
I left everything up to you because
I thought I could trust the police!

46
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,885
And then you screwed everything up!

47
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,885
Give her back! Give Naoko back!

48
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:13,318
If the mini-van fell front-first,
then why is only the side window broken?

49
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:17,051
A hammer!

50
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:21,051
- Conan! Not again! - Sorry!

51
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:22,651
You lousy kid!

52
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:25,585
I can no longer trust the police!

53
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,218
So I would like you to
catch the one responsible.

54
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:30,551
Understood.

55
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:34,285
My secretary Hanai-kun
will give you the details.

56
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,218
I'm Hanai Akiko.

57
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:40,818
Could you explain the circumstances
under which she was kidnapped?

58
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:44,285
Circumstances?

59
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:47,718
Naoko-chan and I were
supposed to see a movie that day,

60
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:49,751
so I went to meet her.

61
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:53,718
But hours passed
and she never showed up.

62
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:57,618
So you grew worried
and contacted the police?

63
00:05:57,618 --> 00:06:02,785
No. I realized
it was a kidnapping

64
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:04,585
when the kidnapper
called my cell phone.

65
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:09,785
The kidnapper warned you
not to tell the police, I assume?

66
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,585
I immediately told Mr. Takei...

67
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:18,518
It was all my fault; if only I hadn't
suggested seeing a movie!

68
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:20,451
Ran.

69
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,351
Do you have any ideas about
who the kidnapper may be?

70
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,951
I wouldn't have hired you if I did!

71
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,651
Then let me put it another way.

72
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:31,918
Do you know anyone who
may hold a grudge against you?

73
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:36,051
Pardon my rudeness, but you
are an infamous corporate raider.

74
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,685
Are you sure you haven't
made a lot of enemies in your time?

75
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:41,185
The old man's finally
getting better at this!

76
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:43,618
I don't remember every single thing!

77
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:46,351
Listen! Business is war!

78
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:48,118
The losers are the ones at fault!

79
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:49,918
Got that?!

80
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,851
Ugh! He backs down too easy!

81
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:56,818
Akiko-san's room
was on the 2nd floor, right?

82
00:06:56,818 --> 00:06:58,718
Well? How's Akiko-san?

83
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,651
Dad...

84
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:05,451
Naoko really thought of
Akiko-san as an older sister.

85
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,618
She said that she was also
like a mother to her,

86
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:10,351
since her real mother
had died when she was young.

87
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:13,151
Akiko-san.

88
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:15,418
Akiko-san!

89
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,818
Hey...

90
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:23,285
Oh, it's you two...

91
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,218
Are you alright? We called
out to you a couple times...

92
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:30,618
I'm sorry. I damaged my hearing a bit...

93
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,851
Huh? She's--

94
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,785
Have you given up on Naoko-chan too?

95
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:40,751
She's alive! I just know it!

96
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:50,385
But they've looked this hard
and still haven't found her...

97
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:51,318
She's probably--

98
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:01,185
That poor woman...

99
00:08:03,185 --> 00:08:04,851
That's it!

100
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,285
Ran-neechan!
Let's take a look over there!

101
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:09,785
What for?

102
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:12,451
Somebody might've seen it!

103
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:16,151
That day?

104
00:08:16,151 --> 00:08:18,818
Did anything out of
the ordinary happen?

105
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:22,985
You can say that. The police asked
us to help with their investigation.

106
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,985
All the ships in
this area helped 'em.

107
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:27,118
All of them?

108
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:32,818
Yeah. It's the sailors' code to work
together when something happens.

109
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:36,818
Not that guy with
the speedboat, though...

110
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,218
Speedboat?

111
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:43,151
Yeah, it almost ran
straight into my boat, here...

112
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:54,351
Probably some rich guy who goes
around sailing with other rich guys.

113
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:56,785
What kind of speedboat was it?!

114
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:03,385
Is this the speedboat
he was talking about?

115
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:07,418
Conan-kun!
Don't get on without permission!

116
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,318
Diving equipment?

117
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:15,785
Both the kidnapper and
Takei Naoko may still be alive!

118
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:24,351
That was no accident;
the kidnapper drove off on purpose.

119
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,151
As a means of escape!

120
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,351
The kidnapper broke
the side window with a hammer

121
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:43,418
that was placed
in the car in advance,

122
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:46,818
swam underwater
to the opposite shore,

123
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:49,618
and got into
a waiting speedboat!

124
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:55,318
The culprit then escaped

125
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:58,385
while the police were focusing
their attention on the mini-van.

126
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,551
Why would they do that?

127
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:06,151
Probably to confuse
the police into thinking

128
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:12,018
that both kidnapper
and the hostage had died.

129
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,485
There could be other reasons, too...

130
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:22,651
The only thing I don't understand
is about the hostage, Takei Naoko.

131
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:24,251
Her body hasn't turned up.

132
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:27,618
We only found enough scuba
diving equipment for one person.

133
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:31,351
How did the kidnapper
get her out of the sunken car?

134
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:35,985
Or was she never in it at all?

135
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,118
No, she was seen inside it!

136
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:43,318
Conan-kun!

137
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,985
Ran-neechan!
Did you find anything out?

138
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,451
According to the manager here,

139
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:53,585
the boat's owner simply abandoned
it and it hasn't been used since.

140
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:57,185
Maybe that man
mistook it for another boat...

141
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,551
That can't be!

142
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:02,351
But how do I prove this!

143
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:04,851
The investigation is cancelled?!

144
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:07,685
What for? What's going on?!

145
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:11,218
Don't look at me. He was
the one who decided to cancel it!

146
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,251
I'd like to know why, myself!

147
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,851
Rich people are stingy, after all.

148
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:21,185
He probably regrets wasting
money on his dead daughter now.

149
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:23,518
No! She's not dead at all!

150
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:27,218
And how do you know that?

151
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:28,351
Um, well...

152
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:30,418
I think so too!

153
00:11:30,418 --> 00:11:34,218
I don't want to believe
that Naoko's dead!

154
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:38,218
Ugh. Kids can be
so pampered sometimes.

155
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:43,685
Listen. It's obvious once you
think about it with a cool head.

156
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,285
Given the circumstances,

157
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:49,518
neither the hostage nor the
kidnapper can possibly be alive.

158
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,151
But!

159
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:52,451
But you know,

160
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:55,851
by doing this, he's basically insulting
your reputation as a great detective.

161
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:58,918
You have a point there!

162
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,818
Alright, then!

163
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:04,685
Leave!

164
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:08,185
My daughter-- Naoko-- is dead!

165
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:12,118
There's no bringing her back now!

166
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,451
But!

167
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:20,985
This is what you want, isn't it?!
Your cancellation fee.

168
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:24,651
Take it and get out!

169
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:28,985
I don't want your lousy money!
You can keep it!

170
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:30,685
Ran! Let's go!

171
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:40,185
Damn it! That old fogy really
knows how to piss me off!

172
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:42,951
Oh, I just remembered...

173
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:43,518
What?

174
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:46,985
I promised to meet my friends...

175
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:47,718
See ya!

176
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:50,985
Bah. That spoiled
little kid has it easy.

177
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,851
His attitude changed too quickly!

178
00:12:58,585 --> 00:12:59,451
Leave!

179
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:06,085
There's no mistake about it!
The kidnapper must've contacted him!

180
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:25,217
Are you just going
to let Naoko-chan die?!

181
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:29,084
Mr. Takei!

182
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,417
If you don't really gather
all the money this time,

183
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:35,584
she might be killed!

184
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:38,717
But we don't even
know if she's alive or not--

185
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,017
Mr. Takei! Have a look for yourself!

186
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,384
Even in the picture
the kidnapper sent us,

187
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:48,417
the newspaper has yesterday's date!

188
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,050
I thought so.

189
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,217
Naoko-chan believes with
all her heart that you'll save her!

190
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,084
Mr. Takei!

191
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:07,517
If I gather the 500 million now and
then lose it in another stupid mistake,

192
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:11,850
my latest business
deal will go up in smoke!

193
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,350
Don't you see?!

194
00:14:15,317 --> 00:14:18,884
Money or Naoko-chan?
Which is more important?!

195
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:20,917
Naoko, of course!

196
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:24,984
But if this deal falls through,
my company will go--

197
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:28,850
--bankrupt. There's no question about that.

198
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,584
Who cares about the company?

199
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,817
It won't replace Naoko-chan's life!

200
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:38,750
But I built this company
with my own two hands!

201
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,217
Yeah, by sucking the
lifeblood out of other people!

202
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:42,084
Shut up!

203
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:46,250
Corporate raiding is a
perfectly legitimate business!

204
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,984
Weak people lose! And the losers
have no one to blame but themselves!

205
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:54,950
That damn old man!

206
00:14:58,917 --> 00:14:59,584
Who's there?!

207
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:02,684
Why, you little!

208
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:03,784
Conan-kun!

209
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,450
I was looking for the bathroom--

210
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,917
This is private property, boy!

211
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:13,950
Please don't tell anyone
about this, Conan-kun.

212
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,884
If the police found out, Naoko-chan
would be killed for sure this time!

213
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,850
Okay.

214
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:24,817
We can't afford to let him
leave here for a while!

215
00:15:24,817 --> 00:15:27,250
Lock him in your room or something!

216
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:34,717
Sorry about this, Conan-kun.

217
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,050
Try to endure it for a short while.

218
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,184
Once the deal is over,
I promise we'll let you out.

219
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:43,117
Say, what did the
kidnapper tell you guys?

220
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:44,150
The same as before.

221
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,550
"Prepare 500 million yen by tomorrow."

222
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,584
Are you going to pay?

223
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,084
You saw what kind
of person Mr. Takei is...

224
00:15:52,717 --> 00:15:56,050
He'll get the money if Naoko-san
is important to him, right?

225
00:15:56,884 --> 00:16:00,017
Money is the only
thing important to him!

226
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:06,317
What's wrong?

227
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:10,484
I had a younger brother named Masahito.

228
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:11,717
"Had"?

229
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:14,917
Yes. He died, four years ago.

230
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:18,284
No, he was murdered.

231
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,750
He was still about your age.

232
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,184
I'm sorry. Let me hold you for a while.

233
00:16:38,384 --> 00:16:41,017
I'll bring some dinner later.

234
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,117
Do you think you
can fool the kidnapper

235
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:04,217
with these wads of cash
made out of newspaper?

236
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,150
Quiet. This is the only choice left!

237
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,417
Conan-kun!

238
00:17:20,417 --> 00:17:22,750
What are you doing?! Let's go!

239
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:48,250
Now that I think about it,

240
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,750
nobody's actually
seen Takei Naoko's face!

241
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,750
Her mouth was taped
and she had a blindfold on.

242
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,550
There was no way
to see her face clearly!

243
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,050
The kidnapper was the only
person ever inside the mini-van!

244
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,984
Yes! One person played the role of two!

245
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,384
Nobody once doubted that it was Naoko.

246
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,850
It's not unreasonable;
she was far away,

247
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,417
and everyone just assumed it was her.

248
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,484
Wait. There are policemen hiding here.

249
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:22,950
The deal is off.

250
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:26,817
The kidnapper was completely
aware of what the police were up to!

251
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:27,850
It's only natural!

252
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:31,050
The kidnapper was always
right by Takei-san, after all!

253
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,350
The diving watch mark on her arm...

254
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,550
Her tan line from wearing a wetsuit...

255
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,217
And then what she did that one time!

256
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,350
An ear-unplugging technique
that every diver knows about!

257
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:55,217
She must've injured her ears
when she suddenly entered the water!

258
00:18:56,484 --> 00:19:00,384
What's going on?!
It's long past our agreed time!

259
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,784
The kidnapper is here.
Has been for a while.

260
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:09,084
What are you doing, you idiot?!

261
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,184
You made me sprain my ankle!

262
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,384
That's nothing.

263
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:16,150
Compared to the pain
you gave my family, anyway.

264
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,284
Come again?!

265
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:21,050
You don't remember this place?

266
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:26,017
These are the remains of a company
that you took hostile control over.

267
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:28,684
What?! You don't mean that you're--

268
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:29,484
That's right!

269
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:34,150
I'm the daughter of the
former company director here.

270
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:39,784
My father killed himself,
and he took his wife and son with him...

271
00:19:40,184 --> 00:19:41,684
Leaving only me behind...

272
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,917
I was a college student at the time.

273
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,284
I was taken in by some
relatives, changed my last name,

274
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,017
and then joined your company.

275
00:19:52,084 --> 00:19:54,184
To wait for a chance
to get revenge, of course.

276
00:19:56,417 --> 00:20:00,284
If you had loved Naoko-chan
enough to simply get the money ready,

277
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:01,917
I had intended to let you live!

278
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:08,617
What are you planning to do?!

279
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:10,817
Have you die.

280
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,617
Gasoline?!

281
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:20,950
This is bad!

282
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,784
Wait, I apologize!
I'll pay as much as you want!

283
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:28,584
Just don't do it!

284
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:32,584
Take your money with you to Hell.

285
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,184
Farewell.

286
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:36,350
Don't do it!

287
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,084
Conan-kun!

288
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,517
There's no value in killing that man!

289
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:45,684
There's no value in letting him live!

290
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:46,984
It's my duty to rid the world of him!

291
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:50,450
Do you want Naoko-san to
think the same way about you?!

292
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,984
That man is her only family!

293
00:21:00,117 --> 00:21:02,417
You should know more than anyone else

294
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,717
the pain of having
your entire family die!

295
00:21:08,084 --> 00:21:12,150
Even if you did get revenge, I don't
think your brother would be happy.

296
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,184
Conan-kun...

297
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,550
Masahito...

298
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,917
Just my imagination

299
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:14,517
Playing with threads around my finger
while drinking lukewarm tea

300
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:23,950
Let's walk lightly
to the bossa nova rhythm

301
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,050
The puzzle pieces are in my hands

302
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:35,350
That's right...

303
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:45,584
I was in the same place last week
but with different clothes

304
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:52,117
Step by step,
there's no reason to be anxious

305
00:22:53,617 --> 00:22:58,984
Case by case,
I don't care if you laugh

306
00:23:00,884 --> 00:23:09,784
Beyond the countless days,
she's waiting for me

307
00:23:09,784 --> 00:23:11,850
I gotta go my own way

308
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:24,517
Takei Naoko was being held
in the basement of the old factory.

309
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:26,650
She was rescued safely.

310
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,750
Apparently, she was
somewhat aware of the situation

311
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,417
when she was first confined.

312
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:36,084
Naoko! You're safe!

313
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,484
Akiko-san!

314
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,317
Akiko-san!

315
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,884
I'm so sorry I got you
involved, Naoko-chan.

316
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,084
Thank you!

317
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,384
We still can't say anything for sure.

318
00:24:22,384 --> 00:24:24,550
If he really attacked for no reason

319
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,617
as she says,

320
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,450
then he'll probably
have to be put to sleep.

321
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:33,117
Please come back, Shinichi...

322
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:36,450
You're the only one who can save John!

323
00:24:38,017 --> 00:24:39,650
On the next Conan--

324
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,250
John the Dog's Murder Case.

325
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:01,450
Next Conan's Hint:

326
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,450
Reflex action to a situation.
