1
00:00:04,146 --> 00:00:05,480
My name's Conan Edogawa!

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,517
High school student Shinichi was
forced to take a drug that shrunk him!

3
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:11,486
Although smaller, my mind
remains that of a sharp detective!

4
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:14,689
Today's is a ransom case!
Money won't buy love!

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:18,026
Even if the evidence is underwater,
there's always only one truth!

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,933
The first end of the century in 100 years

7
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:30,138
When told to cry, I laughed instead

8
00:00:37,212 --> 00:00:43,051
The first end of the century
in a long, long time

9
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:49,124
We're leaping into a wide open world

10
00:00:49,124 --> 00:00:55,130
The things I tried to
understand as a child

11
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,470
remain a mystery even as an adult

12
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,776
I'm neither a hotshot
nor especially great

13
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:13,882
All I understand is
the pounding of my heart

14
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:19,488
It's neither an answer nor the truth

15
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:31,500
All I understand is
the pounding of my heart

16
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:59,111
The Fake Ransom Case.

17
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:28,874
It's almost time. Don't push it, now.

18
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,844
The hostage's safety
is the most important.

19
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,615
I can hardly believe this
is Mr. Takei's daughter...

20
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,854
Hello?!

21
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:43,589
Do you have the money?

22
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:45,057
I do!

23
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:47,092
Let Naoko go!

24
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:49,295
Hold on. I'll let you see her.

25
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,337
The kidnapper showed up
in a mini-van, Inspector!

26
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:00,306
It stopped nearby!

27
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:06,178
Naoko!

28
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,581
I'll bring the money now.

29
00:03:11,684 --> 00:03:14,520
Wait. There are policemen hiding here.

30
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:18,190
The deal is off.

31
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,393
Wait!

32
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,995
They're running away!

33
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:25,764
Let's go!

34
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:12,611
The car never braked
and flew right into the water.

35
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:19,685
So you were classmates
with the kidnapped Takei Naoko?

36
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:21,220
Yes.

37
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,191
Takei Naoko...

38
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,862
She always looked so lonely...

39
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,665
But there's no way
she could've survived this...

40
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:44,910
Inspector!

41
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,980
We couldn't find her body
at the river bottom either.

42
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,151
The river runs fast in this area, so
she may have been taken downstream...

43
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,252
Oh no!

44
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,187
What do you mean, her body?!

45
00:04:56,054 --> 00:05:00,392
I left everything up to you because
I thought I could trust the police!

46
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:02,327
And then you screwed everything up!

47
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:05,330
Give her back! Give Naoko back!

48
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:13,772
If the mini-van fell front-first,
then why is only the side window broken?

49
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,509
A hammer!

50
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,513
- Conan! Not again! - Sorry!

51
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:23,115
You lousy kid!

52
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:26,051
I can no longer trust the police!

53
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,655
So I would like you to
catch the one responsible.

54
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:30,989
Understood.

55
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:34,726
My secretary Hanai-kun
will give you the details.

56
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,662
I'm Hanai Akiko.

57
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:41,266
Could you explain the circumstances
under which she was kidnapped?

58
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,736
Circumstances?

59
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:48,173
Naoko-chan and I were
supposed to see a movie that day,

60
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,209
so I went to meet her.

61
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:54,179
But hours passed
and she never showed up.

62
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,083
So you grew worried
and contacted the police?

63
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:03,222
No. I realized
it was a kidnapping

64
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:05,023
when the kidnapper
called my cell phone.

65
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:10,229
The kidnapper warned you
not to tell the police, I assume?

66
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:13,031
I immediately told Mr. Takei...

67
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:18,971
It was all my fault; if only I hadn't
suggested seeing a movie!

68
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:20,906
Ran.

69
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,809
Do you have any ideas about
who the kidnapper may be?

70
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:26,411
I wouldn't have hired you if I did!

71
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:29,114
Then let me put it another way.

72
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:32,384
Do you know anyone who
may hold a grudge against you?

73
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:36,488
Pardon my rudeness, but you
are an infamous corporate raider.

74
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:39,124
Are you sure you haven't
made a lot of enemies in your time?

75
00:06:39,124 --> 00:06:41,627
The old man's finally
getting better at this!

76
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,062
I don't remember every single thing!

77
00:06:44,062 --> 00:06:46,798
Listen! Business is war!

78
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,567
The losers are the ones at fault!

79
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:50,369
Got that?!

80
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,305
Ugh! He backs down too easy!

81
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:57,276
Akiko-san's room
was on the 2nd floor, right?

82
00:06:57,276 --> 00:06:59,177
Well? How's Akiko-san?

83
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,112
Dad...

84
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:05,918
Naoko really thought of
Akiko-san as an older sister.

85
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,053
She said that she was also
like a mother to her,

86
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,789
since her real mother
had died when she was young.

87
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,592
Akiko-san.

88
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:15,861
Akiko-san!

89
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:20,265
Hey...

90
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,735
Oh, it's you two...

91
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:27,673
Are you alright? We called
out to you a couple times...

92
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:31,076
I'm sorry. I damaged my hearing a bit...

93
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,313
Huh? She's--

94
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,249
Have you given up on Naoko-chan too?

95
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:41,186
She's alive! I just know it!

96
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,829
But they've looked this hard
and still haven't found her...

97
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:51,763
She's probably--

98
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,640
That poor woman...

99
00:08:03,642 --> 00:08:05,310
That's it!

100
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,747
Ran-neechan!
Let's take a look over there!

101
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:10,248
What for?

102
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,884
Somebody might've seen it!

103
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:16,888
That day?

104
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:19,558
Did anything out of
the ordinary happen?

105
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:23,729
You can say that. The police asked
us to help with their investigation.

106
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,732
All the ships in
this area helped 'em.

107
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:27,866
All of them?

108
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:33,572
Yeah. It's the sailors' code to work
together when something happens.

109
00:08:33,572 --> 00:08:37,576
Not that guy with
the speedboat, though...

110
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:38,977
Speedboat?

111
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:43,915
Yeah, it almost ran
straight into my boat, here...

112
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:55,093
Probably some rich guy who goes
around sailing with other rich guys.

113
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:57,529
What kind of speedboat was it?!

114
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:04,136
Is this the speedboat
he was talking about?

115
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:08,173
Conan-kun!
Don't get on without permission!

116
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:11,076
Diving equipment?

117
00:09:12,077 --> 00:09:16,548
Both the kidnapper and
Takei Naoko may still be alive!

118
00:09:19,985 --> 00:09:25,090
That was no accident;
the kidnapper drove off on purpose.

119
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,892
As a means of escape!

120
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:42,107
The kidnapper broke
the side window with a hammer

121
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,176
that was placed
in the car in advance,

122
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:47,579
swam underwater
to the opposite shore,

123
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,382
and got into
a waiting speedboat!

124
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:56,054
The culprit then escaped

125
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:59,124
while the police were focusing
their attention on the mini-van.

126
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,295
Why would they do that?

127
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,898
Probably to confuse
the police into thinking

128
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:12,771
that both kidnapper
and the hostage had died.

129
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:14,239
There could be other reasons, too...

130
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:23,415
The only thing I don't understand
is about the hostage, Takei Naoko.

131
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,016
Her body hasn't turned up.

132
00:10:25,517 --> 00:10:28,353
We only found enough scuba
diving equipment for one person.

133
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:32,090
How did the kidnapper
get her out of the sunken car?

134
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:36,728
Or was she never in it at all?

135
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:42,868
No, she was seen inside it!

136
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,069
Conan-kun!

137
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,739
Ran-neechan!
Did you find anything out?

138
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,208
According to the manager here,

139
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:54,346
the boat's owner simply abandoned
it and it hasn't been used since.

140
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,949
Maybe that man
mistook it for another boat...

141
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,285
That can't be!

142
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,088
But how do I prove this!

143
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,590
The investigation is cancelled?!

144
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:08,426
What for? What's going on?!

145
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:11,963
Don't look at me. He was
the one who decided to cancel it!

146
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,999
I'd like to know why, myself!

147
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,602
Rich people are stingy, after all.

148
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:21,940
He probably regrets wasting
money on his dead daughter now.

149
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,276
No! She's not dead at all!

150
00:11:25,177 --> 00:11:27,979
And how do you know that?

151
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,114
Um, well...

152
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,183
I think so too!

153
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:34,953
I don't want to believe
that Naoko's dead!

154
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,957
Ugh. Kids can be
so pampered sometimes.

155
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:44,429
Listen. It's obvious once you
think about it with a cool head.

156
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:46,031
Given the circumstances,

157
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:50,268
neither the hostage nor the
kidnapper can possibly be alive.

158
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:51,903
But!

159
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:53,205
But you know,

160
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:56,608
by doing this, he's basically insulting
your reputation as a great detective.

161
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,678
You have a point there!

162
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:01,580
Alright, then!

163
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,450
Leave!

164
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:08,920
My daughter-- Naoko-- is dead!

165
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,858
There's no bringing her back now!

166
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,192
But!

167
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,733
This is what you want, isn't it?!
Your cancellation fee.

168
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:25,403
Take it and get out!

169
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:29,741
I don't want your lousy money!
You can keep it!

170
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,443
Ran! Let's go!

171
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:40,919
Damn it! That old fogy really
knows how to piss me off!

172
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,688
Oh, I just remembered...

173
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:44,256
What?

174
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:47,726
I promised to meet my friends...

175
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,460
See ya!

176
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,730
Bah. That spoiled
little kid has it easy.

177
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,603
His attitude changed too quickly!

178
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:00,205
Leave!

179
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:06,845
There's no mistake about it!
The kidnapper must've contacted him!

180
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:26,647
Are you just going
to let Naoko-chan die?!

181
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,518
Mr. Takei!

182
00:13:30,918 --> 00:13:33,821
If you don't really gather
all the money this time,

183
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:36,991
she might be killed!

184
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:40,128
But we don't even
know if she's alive or not--

185
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:42,430
Mr. Takei! Have a look for yourself!

186
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,801
Even in the picture
the kidnapper sent us,

187
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:49,837
the newspaper has yesterday's date!

188
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,474
I thought so.

189
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,651
Naoko-chan believes with
all her heart that you'll save her!

190
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:05,486
Mr. Takei!

191
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:08,923
If I gather the 500 million now and
then lose it in another stupid mistake,

192
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:13,261
my latest business
deal will go up in smoke!

193
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:14,762
Don't you see?!

194
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,301
Money or Naoko-chan?
Which is more important?!

195
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,336
Naoko, of course!

196
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:26,407
But if this deal falls through,
my company will go--

197
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,278
--bankrupt. There's no question about that.

198
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:33,014
Who cares about the company?

199
00:14:33,014 --> 00:14:35,249
It won't replace Naoko-chan's life!

200
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:40,154
But I built this company
with my own two hands!

201
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:42,623
Yeah, by sucking the
lifeblood out of other people!

202
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,491
Shut up!

203
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:47,662
Corporate raiding is a
perfectly legitimate business!

204
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:52,400
Weak people lose! And the losers
have no one to blame but themselves!

205
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:56,370
That damn old man!

206
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:01,008
Who's there?!

207
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,111
Why, you little!

208
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,213
Conan-kun!

209
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,883
I was looking for the bathroom--

210
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,319
This is private property, boy!

211
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:15,356
Please don't tell anyone
about this, Conan-kun.

212
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:19,293
If the police found out, Naoko-chan
would be killed for sure this time!

213
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,263
Okay.

214
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,234
We can't afford to let him
leave here for a while!

215
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,669
Lock him in your room or something!

216
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:35,810
Sorry about this, Conan-kun.

217
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,312
Try to endure it for a short while.

218
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,616
Once the deal is over,
I promise we'll let you out.

219
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:44,519
Say, what did the
kidnapper tell you guys?

220
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,553
The same as before.

221
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:48,956
"Prepare 500 million yen by tomorrow."

222
00:15:48,956 --> 00:15:49,991
Are you going to pay?

223
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,494
You saw what kind
of person Mr. Takei is...

224
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:57,465
He'll get the money if Naoko-san
is important to him, right?

225
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,435
Money is the only
thing important to him!

226
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,742
What's wrong?

227
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,913
I had a younger brother named Masahito.

228
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:13,147
"Had"?

229
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:16,350
Yes. He died, four years ago.

230
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,687
No, he was murdered.

231
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:23,157
He was still about your age.

232
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,596
I'm sorry. Let me hold you for a while.

233
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:42,443
I'll bring some dinner later.

234
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:03,531
Do you think you
can fool the kidnapper

235
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:05,633
with these wads of cash
made out of newspaper?

236
00:17:06,467 --> 00:17:09,570
Quiet. This is the only choice left!

237
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:21,849
Conan-kun!

238
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,151
What are you doing?! Let's go!

239
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,677
Now that I think about it,

240
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:53,180
nobody's actually
seen Takei Naoko's face!

241
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,182
Her mouth was taped
and she had a blindfold on.

242
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,952
There was no way
to see her face clearly!

243
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:01,455
The kidnapper was the only
person ever inside the mini-van!

244
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,392
Yes! One person played the role of two!

245
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:08,529
Nobody once doubted that it was Naoko.

246
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:11,365
It's not unreasonable;
she was far away,

247
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,934
and everyone just assumed it was her.

248
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,810
Wait. There are policemen hiding here.

249
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,278
The deal is off.

250
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:28,149
The kidnapper was completely
aware of what the police were up to!

251
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,183
It's only natural!

252
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:32,353
The kidnapper was always
right by Takei-san, after all!

253
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:41,662
The diving watch mark on her arm...

254
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,865
Her tan line from wearing a wetsuit...

255
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:47,535
And then what she did that one time!

256
00:18:48,402 --> 00:18:50,671
An ear-unplugging technique
that every diver knows about!

257
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:56,544
She must've injured her ears
when she suddenly entered the water!

258
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:01,716
What's going on?!
It's long past our agreed time!

259
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:04,118
The kidnapper is here.
Has been for a while.

260
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:10,391
What are you doing, you idiot?!

261
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,493
You made me sprain my ankle!

262
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:14,695
That's nothing.

263
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,465
Compared to the pain
you gave my family, anyway.

264
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,600
Come again?!

265
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:22,369
You don't remember this place?

266
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:27,341
These are the remains of a company
that you took hostile control over.

267
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,010
What?! You don't mean that you're--

268
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,811
That's right!

269
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:35,483
I'm the daughter of the
former company director here.

270
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,088
My father killed himself,
and he took his wife and son with him...

271
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:42,990
Leaving only me behind...

272
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,227
I was a college student at the time.

273
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,597
I was taken in by some
relatives, changed my last name,

274
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,333
and then joined your company.

275
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,503
To wait for a chance
to get revenge, of course.

276
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,609
If you had loved Naoko-chan
enough to simply get the money ready,

277
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:03,244
I had intended to let you live!

278
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:09,950
What are you planning to do?!

279
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,119
Have you die.

280
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:20,928
Gasoline?!

281
00:20:21,662 --> 00:20:22,263
This is bad!

282
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,103
Wait, I apologize!
I'll pay as much as you want!

283
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:29,904
Just don't do it!

284
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:33,908
Take your money with you to Hell.

285
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:36,510
Farewell.

286
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,678
Don't do it!

287
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,616
Conan-kun!

288
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,019
There's no value in killing that man!

289
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:47,388
There's no value in letting him live!

290
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:48,689
It's my duty to rid the world of him!

291
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:52,159
Do you want Naoko-san to
think the same way about you?!

292
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:57,698
That man is her only family!

293
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,871
You should know more than anyone else

294
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,173
the pain of having
your entire family die!

295
00:21:09,543 --> 00:21:13,614
Even if you did get revenge, I don't
think your brother would be happy.

296
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:29,663
Conan-kun...

297
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,035
Masahito...

298
00:22:03,998 --> 00:22:06,367
Just my imagination

299
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:15,976
Playing with threads around my finger
while drinking lukewarm tea

300
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:25,386
Let's walk lightly
to the bossa nova rhythm

301
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:30,491
The puzzle pieces are in my hands

302
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,797
That's right...

303
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:47,041
I was in the same place last week
but with different clothes

304
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:53,580
Step by step,
there's no reason to be anxious

305
00:22:55,082 --> 00:23:00,421
Case by case,
I don't care if you laugh

306
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:11,231
Beyond the countless days,
she's waiting for me

307
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:13,300
I gotta go my own way

308
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:25,980
Takei Naoko was being held
in the basement of the old factory.

309
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,115
She was rescued safely.

310
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,185
Apparently, she was
somewhat aware of the situation

311
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:33,854
when she was first confined.

312
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,524
Naoko! You're safe!

313
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:39,927
Akiko-san!

314
00:23:41,662 --> 00:23:42,763
Akiko-san!

315
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,337
I'm so sorry I got you
involved, Naoko-chan.

316
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,541
Thank you!

317
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:24,171
We still can't say anything for sure.

318
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,340
If he really attacked for no reason

319
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,409
as she says,

320
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,244
then he'll probably
have to be put to sleep.

321
00:24:30,744 --> 00:24:34,581
Please come back, Shinichi...

322
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,452
You're the only one who can save John!

323
00:24:40,054 --> 00:24:41,688
On the next Conan--

324
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,291
John the Dog's Murder Case.

325
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:03,243
Next Conan's Hint:

326
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:05,245
Reflex action.

situation.
