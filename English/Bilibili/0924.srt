1
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.070
There are so many tangerines.

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.970
Take as many as you'd like today.

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.770
"Naoya Terauchi (30), Tetsuji's Son" -You're our only customers today.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.370
There's no need for restraint.

5
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.870
No!

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.870
Dad!

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.170
"Tetsuji Terauchi (62)" -If you harvest them so carelessly,

8
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.670
"Terauchi Tangerine Fields Manager" -you'll damage the tangerines.

9
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.970
We're sorry.

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.470
This is how you do it.

11
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.570
Got it?

12
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.670
-Yes. -Yes.

13
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.270
Dad, you don't have to say it like that.

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.070
These tangerines are my precious children.

15
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.070
I won't let anyone treat them so carelessly!

16
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.170
That attitude is the reason

17
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.770
people stopped coming to pick tangerines.

18
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.970
So this is what he meant when he said we were his only visitors.

19
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.270
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.070
My father can get nasty when it comes to tangerines.

21
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.770
"Nobuko Terauchi (58), Tetsuji's Wife" -Don't let it bother you.

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.070
He's just an awkward man.

23
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.970
-Okay. -Mom.

24
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.470
I'm heading back down.

25
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.570
When you get there, could you send it up?

26
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.170
Sure thing.

27
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.470
Pick lots of fruit.

28
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.270
I'll cook up something tasty for you later.

29
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.370
Okay.

30
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.470
Is something wrong?

31
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.770
No.

32
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.370
I just haven't seen my mom in such a good mood in a long time.

33
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.270
Really?

34
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.970
Lately she's been arguing with my dad a lot.

35
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.370
She's been on edge.

36
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.470
Hey, don't tell them that.

37
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.870
Sorry.

38
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.370
Time is the y-axis, and I'm the x-axis!

39
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.570
Inscribing love and cases with deductive reasoning!

40
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.170
The aroma of citrus fruit drifts through tangerine fields

41
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.170
in perfect picnic weather.

42
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.770
He sees through the one and only truth.

43
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.670
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

44
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.070
His name is Detective Conan!

45
00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:17.866
"The Sun Sets Over Tangerine Fields"

46
00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:26.966
We ended up picking a lot.

47
00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.266
There's got to be a month's worth here.

48
00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:31.766
Let's stop harvesting and head back.

49
00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:37.266
Do we have to hike down the mountain carrying these?

50
00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:40.866
Don't worry.

51
00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:42.966
We've got a convenient tool for that.

52
00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:45.766
Hey, it's coming right now.

53
00:04:54.266 --> 00:04:55.666
What's that?

54
00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:59.866
An agricultural monorail for transporting crops.

55
00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.466
There's no one riding it. Is that okay?

56
00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:05.766
Yeah. It automatically goes up and down the mountain

57
00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:08.366
when you activate the lever.

58
00:05:08.366 --> 00:05:09.566
Automatically?

59
00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:12.566
Once it reaches the work shed at the peak,

60
00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:16.466
it automatically switches into reverse and returns to the shed

61
00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:18.766
at the foot of the mountain.

62
00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.766
Of course, it can be operated manually as well.

63
00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:25.266
"Reverse, Forward"

64
00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:27.466
That's really convenient.

65
00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:31.666
Thanks to this thing, transporting crops has become much easier.

66
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:34.866
Let's load the containers onto the bed.

67
00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:36.266
-Okay! -Okay!

68
00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:45.066
We're finally finished.

69
00:05:45.066 --> 00:05:46.866
Good work.

70
00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:48.866
Kid, want to ride the monorail?

71
00:05:48.866 --> 00:05:49.966
Me?

72
00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.266
Since you have the opportunity, why not?

73
00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:53.266
Okay.

74
00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:57.366
I want to ride, too.

75
00:05:57.366 --> 00:06:00.166
Unfortunately, it's overloaded.

76
00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.266
Sonoko, let's go.

77
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:04.766
See you at the bottom.

78
00:06:09.966 --> 00:06:12.666
It shakes a lot.

79
00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:15.266
Hold on tight so you don't fall off.

80
00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:31.566
These look delicious.

81
00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:34.566
I've never seen a bunch of these dishes.

82
00:06:34.566 --> 00:06:36.466
Try some.

83
00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:38.266
Thanks for the food...

84
00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:42.766
It's so good.

85
00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:44.266
I know.

86
00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:46.766
Tangerines go with everything.

87
00:06:48.066 --> 00:06:49.066
Yeah.

88
00:06:50.066 --> 00:06:51.566
Of course they do.

89
00:06:51.566 --> 00:06:54.566
My tangerines are the best in Japan.

90
00:06:54.566 --> 00:06:57.466
I think you must be right. Right?

91
00:06:57.466 --> 00:06:58.466
Yeah.

92
00:06:58.466 --> 00:07:00.166
Oh, really?

93
00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:04.566
In that case, have some more of this and that.

94
00:07:04.566 --> 00:07:07.566
He's acting really different.

95
00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:10.366
He's happy because you complimented his tangerines.

96
00:07:10.366 --> 00:07:11.566
He's a simple man, right?

97
00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:17.166
Hey, you'd better not be saying things you shouldn't again.

98
00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:19.666
I was just complimenting you, Dad.

99
00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:23.166
Don't be shy. Eat as much as you'd like.

100
00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:24.766
Okay...

101
00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:31.666
I'm stuffed.

102
00:07:33.066 --> 00:07:34.566
Dad!

103
00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:38.466
You found a buyer for the farm?

104
00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:42.666
-Yeah. -Why didn't you consult me?

105
00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:45.666
Don't worry. It's someone we can trust.

106
00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:47.866
That's not the problem.

107
00:07:47.866 --> 00:07:51.366
I was making my own arrangements.

108
00:07:51.366 --> 00:07:54.766
Don't tell Nobuko about this.

109
00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.166
Got it?

110
00:07:56.166 --> 00:07:57.866
Why not?

111
00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:00.666
Because she always takes your side.

112
00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:03.066
She'd obviously be against it.

113
00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:07.166
Then all the more reason for us to discuss this as a family.

114
00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:08.666
I'm the head of this family.

115
00:08:10.566 --> 00:08:12.466
I have the right to decide.

116
00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:23.666
That's when we first started the tangerine farm together.

117
00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:28.366
That's the first time Naoya harvested a tangerine by himself.

118
00:08:28.366 --> 00:08:29.966
-How cute. -How cute.

119
00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:32.266
"Terauchi Tangerine Farm" -This is when Naoya told me

120
00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:34.966
he'd work on the tangerine farm.

121
00:08:34.966 --> 00:08:37.766
I'm surprised you remember all that.

122
00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:41.466
It's like your family's history. It's truly wonderful.

123
00:08:41.466 --> 00:08:44.466
Things were really great back then.

124
00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:53.266
Did something happen?

125
00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:58.266
A lot happens to a family over a few decades.

126
00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:03.966
Want to see more?

127
00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:05.466
Yes, please.

128
00:09:05.466 --> 00:09:06.466
It hurts.

129
00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:09.766
It hurts...

130
00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:12.566
Are you all right?

131
00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:16.066
Yeah. It's nothing serious.

132
00:09:16.066 --> 00:09:19.266
Maybe it's a frozen shoulder.

133
00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:21.066
Sonoko...

134
00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:24.066
It's fine. You can't overcome age.

135
00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:25.966
I'll get it.

136
00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:28.966
Get the third one from the right.

137
00:09:30.566 --> 00:09:33.066
-Here. -Thank you.

138
00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:35.766
That's me.

139
00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:38.766
Well? Pretty handsome, right?

140
00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:40.066
Uh, yeah.

141
00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:41.866
Yeah, I guess.

142
00:09:45.566 --> 00:09:47.866
How pretty.

143
00:09:48.566 --> 00:09:51.366
I can't believe this view.

144
00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:54.266
I'm glad Ms. Nobuko told us to come.

145
00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:55.366
Yeah.

146
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:03.066
It's dark.

147
00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:04.066
Yeah.

148
00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:08.366
This sound...

149
00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:11.466
Someone must've come to pick us up.

150
00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:16.266
-Hey! -Hey!

151
00:10:16.266 --> 00:10:18.066
Over here!

152
00:10:22.366 --> 00:10:23.966
He noticed us.

153
00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:33.366
He just fell, didn't he?

154
00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.366
No way!

155
00:10:42.966 --> 00:10:44.566
Conan.

156
00:10:44.566 --> 00:10:48.566
I was watching from below, and it looked like my dad fell.

157
00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:49.566
Dad.

158
00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:51.566
Conan?

159
00:10:55.466 --> 00:10:56.866
No...

160
00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:58.966
Honey!

161
00:11:14.075 --> 00:11:18.475
The deceased is Tetsuji Terauchi, the manager of this tangerine farm.

162
00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:22.375
The cause of death was a skull fracture.

163
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:26.575
Most likely, he hit his head on a rock when he fell.

164
00:11:29.075 --> 00:11:33.975
And you saw Mr. Tetsuji fall?

165
00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:35.175
-Yes. -Yes.

166
00:11:35.175 --> 00:11:39.875
Come to think of it, how did you notice Mr. Tetsuji fell?

167
00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:46.275
I was making repairs near the sprinkler control panel.

168
00:11:46.275 --> 00:11:48.175
Where is that?

169
00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:51.475
It's near the base of the mountain southeast of here.

170
00:11:52.175 --> 00:11:53.675
And?

171
00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:58.375
I turned to look when I heard the girls' shouts,

172
00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:00.975
and just happened to witness my father

173
00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:02.875
falling from the monorail.

174
00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:05.375
I see.

175
00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:07.475
I was looking for ingredients for dinner

176
00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:10.075
in the fields at the base of the mountain.

177
00:12:10.075 --> 00:12:14.275
Like Naoya, I heard the girls' shouts.

178
00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:15.875
I see.

179
00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:17.875
Thank you.

180
00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:23.375
Would it be natural to think Mr. Tetsuji lost his balance

181
00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:28.475
when he let go of the monorail to wave to Ran and her friends?

182
00:12:30.275 --> 00:12:34.975
But why was Mr. Tetsuji heading towards the peak?

183
00:12:34.975 --> 00:12:37.475
I asked him to.

184
00:12:37.475 --> 00:12:38.975
What do you mean?

185
00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:42.875
I told Ran and her friends to go watch the sunset.

186
00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:45.175
Since it'd be dark by the time they returned,

187
00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:46.875
I asked him to go get them.

188
00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:50.175
I see.

189
00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:55.175
Hey, it seems like there's blood on the inside of his hat,

190
00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:57.775
but there's nothing on the outside.

191
00:12:57.775 --> 00:12:59.475
What about it?

192
00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:01.575
Don't you think that's strange?

193
00:13:02.575 --> 00:13:06.375
Mr. Tetsuji died when he hit his head on a rock, right?

194
00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:09.175
Then normally wouldn't the rock

195
00:13:09.175 --> 00:13:11.675
have left a mark on the outside of the hat?

196
00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:14.275
You're right.

197
00:13:14.275 --> 00:13:16.575
Maybe Mr. Tetsuji lost his hat

198
00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:20.175
before he hit his head on the rock.

199
00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:21.175
Huh?

200
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:25.175
Then when did the blood get on the inside of the hat?

201
00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:27.875
That doesn't matter.

202
00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:32.375
We saw the moment he fell.

203
00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:33.975
Right?

204
00:13:33.975 --> 00:13:34.975
Yeah.

205
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:40.775
So where is the monorail your husband was riding?

206
00:13:40.775 --> 00:13:43.075
It should be at the shed at the foot of the mountain.

207
00:13:43.075 --> 00:13:44.675
I see.

208
00:13:44.675 --> 00:13:46.475
Then let's have the others hold things down here

209
00:13:46.475 --> 00:13:48.675
while we go check that out.

210
00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:49.675
Yes, sir.

211
00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:08.075
Huh? Where did they go?

212
00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:12.575
Mom. It's okay, Mom.

213
00:14:12.575 --> 00:14:13.775
But...

214
00:14:13.775 --> 00:14:15.375
You've got me.

215
00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:33.975
There's nothing unusual about it.

216
00:14:33.975 --> 00:14:35.775
It seems that way.

217
00:14:41.475 --> 00:14:43.375
The number of containers doesn't add up.

218
00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:49.875
Don't these containers...

219
00:14:50.975 --> 00:14:53.975
There's nothing particularly suspicious about the incident,

220
00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:57.175
so it's safe to assume it was an accident.

221
00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:58.875
Indeed.

222
00:14:58.875 --> 00:15:02.775
It's our fault for calling out to him and waving.

223
00:15:02.775 --> 00:15:03.875
No.

224
00:15:03.875 --> 00:15:08.775
He shouldn't have let go of the railing while riding the monorail.

225
00:15:08.775 --> 00:15:11.675
It's my dad's fault for not following the rules.

226
00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:13.575
You're right.

227
00:15:13.575 --> 00:15:16.575
He should've sounded the monorail's horn.

228
00:15:17.275 --> 00:15:19.275
It's because he waved with his right hand.

229
00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:24.475
That's it. I've figured it out.

230
00:15:24.975 --> 00:15:29.975
It's safe to assume this incident was an unfortunate accident.

231
00:15:29.975 --> 00:15:32.275
We should get going.

232
00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:38.775
Sonoko?

233
00:15:41.475 --> 00:15:47.075
You're always such a tedious man, Inspector Megure.

234
00:15:47.075 --> 00:15:48.475
How?

235
00:15:48.475 --> 00:15:50.575
Sonoko, could it be...

236
00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:53.875
There's something that I just don't understand.

237
00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:55.475
What don't you understand?

238
00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:57.275
Ran, do you remember

239
00:15:57.275 --> 00:16:01.075
what Mr. Tetsuji did

240
00:16:01.075 --> 00:16:02.775
when we waved to him?

241
00:16:02.775 --> 00:16:04.475
What he did?

242
00:16:04.475 --> 00:16:07.475
I think he raised his hand high into the air

243
00:16:07.475 --> 00:16:09.975
and waved back at us.

244
00:16:09.975 --> 00:16:11.275
That's it.

245
00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:13.775
Mr. Tetsuji had a frozen shoulder.

246
00:16:13.775 --> 00:16:16.575
Someone like that couldn't raise their hand high up.

247
00:16:17.575 --> 00:16:19.175
Don't you agree?

248
00:16:19.175 --> 00:16:20.475
You're right.

249
00:16:20.475 --> 00:16:23.675
Is it true that your husband had a frozen shoulder?

250
00:16:25.775 --> 00:16:26.875
Yes.

251
00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:28.675
Mr. Tetsuji was probably

252
00:16:28.675 --> 00:16:33.075
forced to wave his hand

253
00:16:33.075 --> 00:16:35.875
by someone behind him.

254
00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:41.675
But only Mr. Tetsuji was riding the monorail.

255
00:16:41.675 --> 00:16:43.575
That person was probably hiding

256
00:16:43.575 --> 00:16:46.275
in the bed of the monorail.

257
00:16:46.275 --> 00:16:47.775
Wait a minute.

258
00:16:47.775 --> 00:16:51.675
There's no space for anyone to hide.

259
00:16:51.675 --> 00:16:53.475
Not now.

260
00:16:54.475 --> 00:16:56.275
What does that mean?

261
00:16:56.275 --> 00:16:57.475
Officer Takagi,

262
00:16:57.475 --> 00:17:01.075
there are footprints on the front of the monorail bed, correct?

263
00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:03.175
Yes, I see them.

264
00:17:03.175 --> 00:17:06.875
Judging by the footprints, they belonged to Mr. Tetsuji.

265
00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:10.675
Could you place your feet in them and try sitting on the bed?

266
00:17:11.475 --> 00:17:13.175
Here?

267
00:17:14.475 --> 00:17:15.675
Huh?

268
00:17:15.675 --> 00:17:20.775
How was he able to sit with his feet in this position?

269
00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:21.775
That's right.

270
00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:26.275
Perhaps there was an additional row of containers there

271
00:17:26.275 --> 00:17:29.575
so the culprit could hide.

272
00:17:29.575 --> 00:17:30.775
-What? -What?

273
00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:32.675
Even so,

274
00:17:32.675 --> 00:17:37.175
I don't think an adult could hide inside these containers.

275
00:17:37.175 --> 00:17:38.575
Are you sure?

276
00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:45.675
It's impossible.

277
00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:47.675
Sonoko, do you still insist

278
00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:51.475
the culprit hid inside a container?

279
00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:54.375
Hey, look at what I found.

280
00:17:56.075 --> 00:17:58.875
It seems to be a folded container.

281
00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:02.375
What about it?

282
00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:06.775
The bottoms and sides of those containers can be adjusted.

283
00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:08.575
If you fold the bottoms,

284
00:18:08.575 --> 00:18:11.175
three containers can be merged into one,

285
00:18:11.175 --> 00:18:15.375
creating a space large enough for a person to hide inside.

286
00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:18.675
Furthermore, if you leave the right side

287
00:18:18.675 --> 00:18:21.975
that we couldn't see open,

288
00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:24.375
it's even possible to make Mr. Tetsuji wave

289
00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:27.475
from inside the container without anyone noticing.

290
00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:30.175
I see.

291
00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:34.875
Several similar containers were scattered around the tangerine fields.

292
00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:36.275
In other words, the culprit

293
00:18:36.275 --> 00:18:40.275
hid inside the folded containers and pushed Mr. Tetsuji,

294
00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:44.975
then used the monorail's automatic return system

295
00:18:44.975 --> 00:18:46.975
to pass before us

296
00:18:46.975 --> 00:18:49.475
and return to the foot of the mountain.

297
00:18:49.475 --> 00:18:52.075
Later, they exited the monorail,

298
00:18:52.075 --> 00:18:54.675
and pretended they saw Mr. Tetsuji fall

299
00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.375
when they ran to the crime scene.

300
00:18:57.375 --> 00:18:59.275
I see.

301
00:18:59.275 --> 00:19:02.075
So, who did it?

302
00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:03.075
I did it!

303
00:19:04.575 --> 00:19:06.475
Naoya, you...

304
00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:10.875
I killed my father, put him on that monorail,

305
00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:12.575
and pushed him so it would look like an accident.

306
00:19:12.575 --> 00:19:14.275
I see.

307
00:19:14.275 --> 00:19:16.275
You can tell us more at...

308
00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:19.775
Wait! I'm the one who killed my husband!

309
00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:21.975
-What? -Mom!

310
00:19:21.975 --> 00:19:23.775
I hid the hammer I used

311
00:19:23.775 --> 00:19:26.275
to strike my husband under the workbench.

312
00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:28.175
If you examine the fingerprints on the hammer,

313
00:19:28.175 --> 00:19:31.375
it should prove that I'm the culprit.

314
00:19:33.975 --> 00:19:35.775
I found it!

315
00:19:35.775 --> 00:19:36.975
Why?

316
00:19:36.975 --> 00:19:39.175
I could ask you the same question.

317
00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:42.475
Why did you try to take the fall for me?

318
00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:45.175
Because it's my fault.

319
00:19:45.175 --> 00:19:47.275
It's not your fault at all!

320
00:19:47.275 --> 00:19:50.475
I'm the one who decided to kill him!

321
00:19:51.275 --> 00:19:55.175
What happened between you?

322
00:19:55.175 --> 00:19:59.675
I overheard them talking about selling the farm.

323
00:19:59.675 --> 00:20:01.875
I thought he was doing it to repay the debt

324
00:20:01.875 --> 00:20:05.475
he accrued fooling around with other women.

325
00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:08.075
But that's not true.

326
00:20:08.075 --> 00:20:11.475
I'm the one who suggested he sell it.

327
00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:12.875
What?

328
00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:17.175
We wouldn't survive operating this farm as one single family.

329
00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:20.275
I recommended selling the farm

330
00:20:20.275 --> 00:20:24.575
so it could be revitalized using new techniques.

331
00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:25.975
Not realizing that,

332
00:20:25.975 --> 00:20:29.475
I was desperate to leave this farm to Naoya,

333
00:20:30.475 --> 00:20:32.075
so I...

334
00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:36.475
If you'd properly discussed selling the farm as a family,

335
00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:38.175
then this wouldn't have happened.

336
00:20:38.175 --> 00:20:40.575
My father told me not to say anything.

337
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:43.775
He said my mother would never allow it.

338
00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:46.375
He didn't trust me.

339
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:48.175
When I told my mother

340
00:20:48.175 --> 00:20:50.575
about the plan to sell the farm on the way to the shed,

341
00:20:50.575 --> 00:20:52.975
she suddenly started crying.

342
00:20:52.975 --> 00:20:54.375
When I asked her about it,

343
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:58.375
she confessed that she'd killed my father.

344
00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:01.575
If only it'd been written off as an accident.

345
00:21:01.575 --> 00:21:05.375
But if my mom was a suspect...

346
00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:06.675
I know it was a misunderstanding,

347
00:21:06.675 --> 00:21:09.275
but she killed my father to help me.

348
00:21:09.275 --> 00:21:13.375
That's why I decided to take the fall.

349
00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:17.775
I shouldn't have told you no matter what you said.

350
00:21:19.175 --> 00:21:20.575
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:21.975 --> 00:21:25.575
I'm sorry for using you as witnesses.

352
00:21:26.575 --> 00:21:27.975
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:52.475
These are so good.

354
00:22:52.475 --> 00:22:56.275
They taste better since we picked them ourselves.

355
00:22:56.975 --> 00:22:58.875
Ran?

356
00:22:58.875 --> 00:23:00.375
Don't worry.

357
00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:03.875
Naoya said he'd protect the tangerines.

358
00:23:03.875 --> 00:23:05.275
Let's eat.

359
00:23:06.175 --> 00:23:07.175
Okay.

360
00:23:07.175 --> 00:23:10.075
Maybe you shouldn't eat so many at once.

361
00:23:10.075 --> 00:23:11.175
It's fine.

362
00:23:11.175 --> 00:23:12.875
Tangerines are low in calories

363
00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:15.175
so I won't get fat no matter how many I eat.

364
00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:16.975
Haven't you heard the expression,

365
00:23:16.975 --> 00:23:20.475
"Fruit is gold in the morning, silver at noon, and lead at night?"

366
00:23:20.475 --> 00:23:22.375
What's that?

367
00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:26.475
Your liver turns excess sugar into fat.

368
00:23:26.975 --> 00:23:30.975
That's why they say not too eat to much fruit.

369
00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:34.275
People tend not to exercise at night.

370
00:23:34.275 --> 00:23:38.675
Hey, you should've mentioned something that important sooner!

371
00:23:39.675 --> 00:23:43.375
My stomach feels squishier than usual.

372
00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:44.875
Ran.

373
00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:49.075
It won't turn into fat that quickly.

374
00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:54.375
"Next Episode" -You want to use the APTX 4869 antidote

375
00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:57.375
to restore your body so you can participate, right?

376
00:23:57.375 --> 00:23:59.175
I knew you'd understand, Haibara.

377
00:23:59.175 --> 00:24:00.575
No.

378
00:24:00.575 --> 00:24:01.775
What?

379
00:24:01.775 --> 00:24:03.275
Wait, wait.

380
00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:07.175
BIG might've won if Higo were in the game.

381
00:24:08.775 --> 00:24:10.475
Chiyari City?

382
00:24:10.475 --> 00:24:12.375
It's recording.

383
00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:17.375
Next Conan,

384
00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:21.375
"The Heartfelt Strap (Part 1)"

385
00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.760
Next Conan's hint:

386
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.360
"Window Glass"

387
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.960
Did you hear from Shinichi about the school trip?

388
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.460
Not yet.

389
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.960
I need to do something fast.
