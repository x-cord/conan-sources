1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,770
Oh, right.

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,270
Did you see that "God of Ramen Championship" on TV last night?

3
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,570
I saw it.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,570
I sure want to eat that miso ramen that made it to the finals.

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,370
I want salted ramen!

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,970
No. I tell you the shoyu ramen that won the championship is the best!

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,070
Which ramen did you like, Conan?

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,770
Who, me?

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,670
Tonkotsu ramen, I think.

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,070
Tonkotsu, huh?

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,670
Come to think of it, the tonkotsu ramen looked good, too.

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,670
Yeah.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,570
I mean, how come you girls are so stuck on that ramen special program.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,770
I like the way the noodles are all curly.

15
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,070
The tonkotsu soup looked rich, too.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,970
The Char-sui was so soft.

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,270
Oh, no. Talking about ramen is making me want to eat some.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,470
Right.

19
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,970
Then, would you like to go?

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,370
To the ramen shop that I frequently go to!

21
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,570
Huh?

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,270
What?

23
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,970
But maybe not.

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,370
You won't be able to eat dinner.

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,670
Come to think of it,

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,870
Dad was saying he's going out drinking with the neighbors tonight.

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,770
Shall we have ramen for dinner, Conan?

28
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,870
Yep.

29
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,270
Hello. It's me!

30
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,070
I'll be eating dinner with Ran and the others and go home after that.

31
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:44,170
So, will you cancel my French dinner for tonight?

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,370
-Ramen over French cuisine. -Bye!

33
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,270
It's been my dream

34
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,670
to eat ramen with my friends after school, you see.

35
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,870
Really?

36
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,570
What a small dream, Ms. Richie.

37
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,070
Well, I'll guarantee the taste!

38
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,170
It's known to be ramen so good to die for!

39
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,370
Huh?

40
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,870
That's...

41
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,570
A canvas stained black with crime.

42
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,870
Vivid brilliant deduction skills changes its color!

43
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,970
The three girls go to Ramen Ogura.

44
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,370
Good Enough to Die For that leads to an incident?

45
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,970
He sees through the one and only truth.

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,870
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

47
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,270
His name is Detective Conan!

48
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:13,828
"Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 1)"

49
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:16,728
"Ogura Ramen, Good Enough to Die For"

50
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:19,328
I thought so.

51
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:20,828
Hello!

52
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,628
Hi!

53
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:26,228
Boss! I brought some friends with me today!

54
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:27,728
Hello.

55
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:30,528
Yeah! Thanks, Mari!

56
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:34,328
Like I keep telling you, I'm Masumi, not Mari.

57
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:35,728
Is that so?

58
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:38,228
Hi, Conan. Long time no see!

59
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:39,628
Are you alone today?

60
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:43,428
Nope. I'm with the girls.

61
00:04:43,428 --> 00:04:45,928
You've been here before?

62
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:49,228
Yep! To the shop before they moved here!

63
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:51,328
Back then, there was this incident, you see.

64
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,528
Yeah. I'm sure the perp still has it.

65
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:03,128
Mr. Saizu's belongings laced with poison!

66
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:07,528
We weren't hypnotized or anything.

67
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,828
We would never make anyone touch them carefreely.

68
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,428
I'm sure he'll touch it!

69
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:16,428
When you go inside a warm shop like a ramen shop...

70
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:20,228
Your glasses will turn this way.

71
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:25,028
I see. You solved a murder by poison case?

72
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:26,928
You really can handle, can't you, Conan?

73
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:30,728
Well, I didn't solve it, Pops did!

74
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:34,728
But you helped out a lot too, Conan and were fantastic.

75
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:39,028
Here you go, King Yama ramen.

76
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:41,928
Thank you for waiting.

77
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:43,828
-Looks good! -Looks good!

78
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:59,528
What's this? This is seriously fantastically good!

79
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,928
-Really! -I told you so.

80
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,728
And, what would you like to do?

81
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:08,928
Are you ordering one serving of fried rice and pot sticks to go, Mari?

82
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:12,928
I said, my name's Masumi.

83
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:15,828
-Okay, I'll take that! -Okay.

84
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:18,128
Don't tell me you're going to eat fried rice

85
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,628
and pot sticks for a midnight snack?

86
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,128
You're going to get fat.

87
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,828
No, no! It's for breakfast!

88
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:26,928
Because the food here is good even after it gets cold!

89
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,228
Maybe it could be for the someone

90
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:33,528
you're sheltering at the hotel.

91
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,028
Right.

92
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,728
It's for my boyfriend that I'm secretly living together with.

93
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:41,228
What?

94
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,928
It's a joke, only joking.

95
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,828
Excuse me.

96
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:48,928
"Yuna Shono (34), Hostess" -Will you pass the vinegar that's by you?

97
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:51,428
The one over here's all gone.

98
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:55,128
Then, will you take that shoyu bottle over there for me?

99
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:58,528
"Sosuke Mizushina (29), Freelancer" -There's just a little left.

100
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:02,928
You ask for it after you use it all up!

101
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:05,828
But it's going to get empty right away, anyway.

102
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:07,028
Oops.

103
00:07:07,028 --> 00:07:08,928
"Osamu Nakanishi (48), Company Employee"

104
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,728
The pepper bottle is completely empty.

105
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:14,328
Boss! Could I have another bottle of pepper?

106
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:15,628
Okay.

107
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:25,128
You guys put in too much.

108
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,828
Thank you very much!

109
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:34,828
The three who just left, are they together?

110
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:38,228
No. All three of them are regulars,

111
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:41,528
but they just happened to come at the same time today.

112
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,828
What?

113
00:07:42,828 --> 00:07:46,328
Do you think that those three are suspicious after all?

114
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:47,928
Suspicious?

115
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:51,628
The other day, just about the time those three customers were here,

116
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:53,328
there was an incident,

117
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:56,628
and a lot of police officers came in here.

118
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,528
An incident?

119
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,328
It seems that a lady who lives in the neighborhood

120
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:03,328
was killed by a robber.

121
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:07,128
Oh, right. The one that the perp hasn't been arrested yet.

122
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:10,428
So, are the three that just came suspects?

123
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:14,028
Yeah. The police officer said something of that sort.

124
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:18,528
It seems that those three were taken to the police station, too.

125
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:19,828
Really?

126
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:24,128
But if they've come here to eat ramen again, doesn't that mean...

127
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:27,228
That they're innocent, right?

128
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:30,428
But it seems that the police are still suspicious of them.

129
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:34,628
A droopy eyed and slanted eye lady cop come here every day.

130
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:36,028
A droopy eyed and...

131
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:37,428
Slanted eye...

132
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:38,928
Lady cop...

133
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:40,228
Don't tell me that...

134
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:45,228
So? Anything on the three?

135
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:46,928
Well...

136
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:49,228
Were they using more money than usual?

137
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,428
Or were they wearing expensive looking clothes,

138
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:51,928
had any bags or accessories on them?

139
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:54,428
That's what I'm asking you.

140
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:57,928
As to spending a lot of money, since this is a ramen shop,

141
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,828
even if they went from ordering one ramen to two,

142
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:02,328
it wouldn't make much difference.

143
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:03,828
How about the way they were dressed?

144
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:07,528
I don't think there were any changes.

145
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:09,328
Yumi and Naeko.

146
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:11,528
What? Ran.

147
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,328
Conan, you're here, too.

148
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:20,228
You chased the robber murderer into this shop?

149
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:21,828
Just the two of you?

150
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:22,928
Yes.

151
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:27,528
A week ago when we were patrolling this area,

152
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,828
we saw a suspicious character in front of that house.

153
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:34,128
Hey, you over there!

154
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:35,928
What're you doing?

155
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,728
Hold it!

156
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,528
I'll run after him,

157
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:44,128
so bring the car around to the other side of the street!

158
00:09:44,128 --> 00:09:45,628
And we'll flank them!

159
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:46,728
Yes, madam!

160
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:51,428
So, I quickly went around with the car and waited.

161
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:53,528
But only Yumi showed up.

162
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,528
It seems that they had a get together of all the shops that day

163
00:09:57,528 --> 00:10:01,228
that almost all the lights of the shops were out, with no passersby.

164
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:03,728
And the only place open was

165
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,628
this "Ogura Ramen Good Enough to Die For"!

166
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,528
And? The customers who were in the shop back then

167
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,728
were those three, right?

168
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:15,928
Yes.

169
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:19,428
Afterwards, we made those three stay in the shop.

170
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:21,828
Then we had Miwako and Takagi investigate the house

171
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,428
where we saw the suspicious character.

172
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:27,628
The lady resident of that house

173
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,228
was found bleeding from her head,

174
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,928
lying in the front entrance, dead.

175
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:34,228
Moreover, the glass window was cracked

176
00:10:34,228 --> 00:10:36,728
and the house was messed up.

177
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:38,928
That lady was a hostess.

178
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,628
Judging from the fact that

179
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:45,028
she was killed when she went to get what she forgot at home.

180
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:49,528
The victim must've run into the burglar at the front door

181
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,428
and got into a struggle and was murdered.

182
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:52,628
We've figured out this much!

183
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:59,928
Then, isn't the last person who came rushing in here the perp?

184
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,228
The thing is

185
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:05,028
the three came at about the same time like they did today.

186
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:08,728
From the time the three came in, to the time you two came in,

187
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,328
quite some time had gone by.

188
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:13,628
What? Didn't you run after the perp, Yumi?

189
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:18,428
Well, Yumi seems to have fell while she was chasing the perp.

190
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:23,628
You can be a scatterbrain sometimes.

191
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,828
All I did was mistake sauce for shoyu, right?

192
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:29,728
When you get angry, your cute droopy eyes lose their attractiveness.

193
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:31,028
Excuse me.

194
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:32,528
Do you two...

195
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:34,628
-Know each other? -Yeah.

196
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:37,828
She used to come to the shop before we moved here,

197
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:41,328
with her boyfriend with the round glasses.

198
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,428
It's Haneda Meijin.

199
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:46,628
He's my ex-boyfriend, my ex.

200
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:49,628
Is that so? You guys made a good pair.

201
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:52,028
Didn't you make up with him?

202
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,928
You guys were good together.

203
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:58,628
I could care less about him!

204
00:11:58,628 --> 00:12:02,028
He always refuses my invitations saying that he's busy.

205
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:03,728
Well, having a 7 Crown title,

206
00:12:03,728 --> 00:12:07,328
I'm sure he's busy with being interviewed by the media, magazines and such.

207
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:09,228
But it's a mystery, don't you think?

208
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,028
Why do men with round glasses seem to love ramen?

209
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,928
My big brother wears round glasses and loves ramen, too.

210
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,028
See?

211
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,528
On top of that with stubble, it's 100 percent!

212
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,328
My big brother has stubble, too!

213
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:25,128
He's pretty good looking

214
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:27,128
so if he cleans himself up and wears proper clothes,

215
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,828
I'm sure he'd be popular.

216
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,128
He usually only wears untidy jersey.

217
00:12:31,128 --> 00:12:32,128
That's right.

218
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,828
It's as if he's still studying trying to get into university or something.

219
00:12:34,828 --> 00:12:36,728
He's smart though!

220
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:39,628
He has fantastic memory, too.

221
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,528
He remembers phone numbers in an instant.

222
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,728
He has a habit of saying,

223
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,728
"I'm number one in Japan for remembering things like this."

224
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:49,728
"No, I'm the best in the world."

225
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,428
What?

226
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:54,028
Never mind stupid talk.

227
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:57,128
I fell because of the hose!

228
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,328
Hose?

229
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:02,728
The perp threw it at me while I was chasing him!

230
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:05,328
A hose about 2 meters!

231
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:08,028
Besides, I just tripped and fell.

232
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,028
It's not that I was a scatterbrain, you know.

233
00:13:11,028 --> 00:13:14,128
What kind of hose was it?

234
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,428
A pretty fat hose about 3 centimeters in diameter!

235
00:13:17,428 --> 00:13:20,828
Maybe the victim used it to water her garden?

236
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:22,628
Because it was gone.

237
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:25,528
We thought it was the murder weapon at first.

238
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:27,728
What made you think it was the murder weapon?

239
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:31,928
The lady was bleeding from her head and died, right?

240
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,628
When we first saw the perp,

241
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:37,628
he was spinning the hose around

242
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:40,628
in front of the front door of the victim's house with all his might!

243
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,128
There was a trace of masking tape

244
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:44,228
that was stuck to the tip of the hose.

245
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:47,728
We thought that he stuck something on and struck her to death.

246
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:51,328
But there were no blood stains anywhere.

247
00:13:51,328 --> 00:13:53,628
Spinning the hose...

248
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:55,528
With all his might?

249
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:08,295
The perp was spinning the hose around?

250
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:12,295
Was he really doing it in front of the house of the lady who was killed?

251
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,995
Yes, that's right.

252
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:16,995
In the dark, he was spinning it with all his might

253
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:19,595
to the point where you could hear a buzzing sound.

254
00:14:19,595 --> 00:14:22,095
As if it were...

255
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,795
some kind of ritual!

256
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,695
Ritual?

257
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:27,895
How scary.

258
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:29,795
What else could it be?

259
00:14:29,795 --> 00:14:32,595
Because that hose wasn't the murder weapon.

260
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:35,295
Doing something like that near the corpse,

261
00:14:35,295 --> 00:14:36,695
what else could it be?

262
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:40,495
Then, why did that lady die?

263
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,195
She was knocked down,

264
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,495
when she ran into the burglar at the front door

265
00:14:44,495 --> 00:14:46,095
and got into a struggle with him.

266
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:49,395
And when she fell, it seems she probably hit the back of her head

267
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:53,195
against the corner of the stairs. That's what the coroner said.

268
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,595
But there was a trace of masking tape

269
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,795
being stuck on the tip of the hose, right?

270
00:14:58,795 --> 00:15:02,295
If so, maybe the perp has something stuck to the tip of the hose

271
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:04,295
and spun it around threateningly...

272
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:07,695
Maybe the victim tried to avoid it and fell?

273
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:09,495
No way.

274
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:12,895
That lady had her shoes on.

275
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,295
It's obvious that she ran into the burglar

276
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:18,095
before she entered her house.

277
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:21,595
He wouldn't have had time to make such a weapon!

278
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,695
Which means that

279
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:27,395
the perp had something stuck to the hose after the murder.

280
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:31,295
In other words, the perp rather than leave the spot,

281
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:35,895
prioritized putting something on the tip of the hose and spin it around.

282
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,695
Yes, I guess so.

283
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:42,795
A signal!

284
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:46,295
Maybe he was signaling the other burglars nearby by making a sound?

285
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,095
Telling them to get out of there!

286
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:49,595
What?

287
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:54,395
If he were going to put something on the hose to make a sound,

288
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:57,595
it would be faster to call on the cell phone!

289
00:15:57,595 --> 00:16:01,295
If they had decided on such a signal,

290
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,895
they would've had something that would make a sound beforehand.

291
00:16:04,895 --> 00:16:08,095
I don't think they would've used the hose of that house!

292
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,695
-Right. -Yeah.

293
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:14,995
But, how did you know that it was the hose of that house?

294
00:16:14,995 --> 00:16:18,095
The faucet of the house

295
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:21,295
and the shape that was left on the hose matched!

296
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:26,395
If so, the perp was probably forced into

297
00:16:26,395 --> 00:16:29,495
having to use the hose of that house.

298
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:33,695
But what would be more important than fleeing?

299
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:38,195
And? When you chased the perp into this ramen shop,

300
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:41,095
you checked the belongings of the three

301
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:43,595
who were here as customers, didn't you?

302
00:16:43,595 --> 00:16:46,395
It seems that they were taken to the police, too.

303
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:47,495
Yes.

304
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,895
With Miwako, voluntarily.

305
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:52,695
If so, wasn't there anyone who had masking tape on them

306
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:55,695
among the three?

307
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:58,295
No. As to the masking tape,

308
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:02,195
the perp through it at me along with the hose.

309
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:06,695
Gosh. Why didn't you say so?

310
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:11,495
And? Do you know what the three had on them at that time?

311
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,195
What? Yes.

312
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:16,395
I heard of it from Officer Takagi and I took notes of it.

313
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:20,095
The things that the hostess Ms. Yuna Shono had in her handbag are

314
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,995
a wallet, cigarettes, a lighter, a cell phone,

315
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:27,495
chewing gum, a handkerchief, tissue and her house key.

316
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,895
The freelancer Mr. Sosuke Mizushina...

317
00:17:29,895 --> 00:17:32,595
A coin purse, a cell phone, a mask,

318
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:36,295
his house key and a glasses case, which he had in his chest pocket.

319
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,295
Company employee, Mr. Nakanishi...

320
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:42,295
A wallet, his house key, a cell phone, company documents

321
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:46,895
and a hand towel, which was in the pocket of his clothes and briefcase.

322
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:50,495
Nobody had anything valuable.

323
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:53,295
You checked inside this shop too, didn't you?

324
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,395
Yes, once through.

325
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:57,595
But we found nothing.

326
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:59,195
How about gloves?

327
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,895
If one of them among those three are burglars,

328
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:05,195
he should've had gloves or something?

329
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:06,595
As to that,

330
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:12,895
the forensics found a pair of gloves in the sewer along the road,

331
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:17,995
but they were too contaminated to figure out who wore them.

332
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,895
And so it turned out that

333
00:18:19,895 --> 00:18:23,095
they think that Miike and I let the perp get away.

334
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:26,095
So the three suspects were also sent home.

335
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:27,595
We're vexed,

336
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:30,695
that's why we're still investigating those three!

337
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:31,895
Does it bug you?

338
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:33,795
-Not at all. -Not at all.

339
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:36,995
But if the lady cops who are involved in this case

340
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:39,695
come here every day,

341
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:43,895
I wonder if the perp will go out of his way to come and eat ramen here?

342
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:47,395
If I'm the perp, I'd be too scared to come.

343
00:18:47,395 --> 00:18:50,795
Then, are you saying that we were both just careless?

344
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:52,695
-No. -No.

345
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:55,695
We'd never say that. Right?

346
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:56,995
True.

347
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,795
Right.

348
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:02,895
I think that the hostess Ms. Shono is the one.

349
00:19:02,895 --> 00:19:03,895
What?

350
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:07,995
Because the person who was killed was a hostess, wasn't she?

351
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,295
Maybe there some kind of a connection.

352
00:19:10,295 --> 00:19:12,495
Hey, Akiyo.

353
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:14,695
We've already checked on that!

354
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,695
The victim Ms. Atsuko Tonda and Ms. Shono

355
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:21,895
used to previously work for the shop as hostesses.

356
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,495
But after Ms. Shono changed shops last year,

357
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:26,695
it seems they haven't been having contact.

358
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:29,495
So, it seems there was not much of a connection.

359
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:32,695
But if they were working at the same club,

360
00:19:32,695 --> 00:19:35,295
she would've known the commuting time, too.

361
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,595
It would be easy to burglarize the house, no?

362
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,795
That goes for Mr. Nakanishi, too!

363
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:45,195
Mr. Nakanishi was a regular at Ms. Tonda's club.

364
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:48,195
And used to call for her a lot,

365
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,195
so I think he's heard a lot of things from her.

366
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:54,395
And as to the time that Ms. Tonda leaves for work,

367
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,995
I think Mr. Mizushina would know about it, too.

368
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,395
The convenience store that he part-timed for

369
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,395
was right in front of Ms. Tonda's home, it seems.

370
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:06,595
Well, but that convenience store went out of business a few days

371
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:08,995
before the incident occurred, though.

372
00:20:08,995 --> 00:20:10,695
And? Are you sure

373
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:13,895
nothing about the three have changed after the incident?

374
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:15,395
I wonder.

375
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:17,695
Ms. Shono started using a lot of vinegar

376
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:20,395
saying that it was to maintain her beauty.

377
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:24,995
Mr. Mizushina started ordering only Tenshin.

378
00:20:24,995 --> 00:20:30,295
Mr. Nakanishi started ordering two bowls of ramen instead of one.

379
00:20:31,695 --> 00:20:34,195
They all seem irrelevant to the incident.

380
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:39,195
And, what did the burglar steal from Ms. Tonda?

381
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,895
We're not sure.

382
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:45,095
Although there were traces of the safe being forced open,

383
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:48,795
a load of cash was left inside it.

384
00:20:48,795 --> 00:20:51,795
The drawer of the chest that the accessories were inside

385
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:53,995
were really messed up,

386
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:58,295
but a large number of accessories were still left behind.

387
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:00,595
Maybe it's pierced earrings?

388
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:02,295
Pierced earrings?

389
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:08,395
Ms. Tonda used to come here sometimes as a customer, too.

390
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:09,495
I don't remember when,

391
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:13,695
but she came here super drunk and boasted in a loud voice.

392
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:16,895
Look, boss! My pierced earrings!

393
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:19,295
Those are amazing.

394
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:21,895
Is it a gift from your regular?

395
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,495
Yes, that's right!

396
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:26,195
Two ears together they total several million yen!

397
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:28,895
I always have them put away in the drawer.

398
00:21:28,895 --> 00:21:32,995
But since today's my birthday, I decided to wear them!

399
00:21:32,995 --> 00:21:35,295
Well, happy birthday then!

400
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,995
Well, for a hostess who isn't popular or who is disappointing,

401
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:42,095
or a guy who just comes to drink and gives no presents,

402
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:44,395
in other words, a good-for-nothing office worker

403
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:47,395
or for a creepy part-timer who works at a convenience store

404
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:49,795
watching me through the window,

405
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:52,095
no matter how hard they try,

406
00:21:52,095 --> 00:21:54,395
they would never get a hold of this kind of treasure though!

407
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:57,995
That is what she said.

408
00:21:57,995 --> 00:21:59,595
-That's it. -That's it.

409
00:21:59,595 --> 00:22:03,495
Why didn't you tell that to the police, boss?

410
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:06,495
Because I just remembered!

411
00:22:06,495 --> 00:22:09,095
Talk about remembering...

412
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,895
On the day and time of the incident that day,

413
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:14,895
there was another person.

414
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:15,895
Another person...

415
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:17,495
Was here?

416
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:18,595
Huh?

417
00:22:18,595 --> 00:22:20,395
What?

418
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:24,195
Shono, Mizushina, Nakanishi...

419
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:28,195
Who on earth his the other customer that was there besides the three?

420
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:29,495
Who on earth...

421
00:23:54,495 --> 00:23:56,495
"Next Episode" -I mentioned a while ago too, didn't I?

422
00:23:56,495 --> 00:24:00,495
Back then, Yumi and I flanked the perp that fled

423
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:03,095
along the street in front of this shop!

424
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:05,595
We cornered him into this shop!

425
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:06,995
Actually...

426
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:10,195
Not click-click, but click click...

427
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:11,995
Each time he ran?

428
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:13,095
I see.

429
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:15,295
-Masumi? -Conan?

430
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:16,895
Hey.

431
00:24:18,895 --> 00:24:24,295
Next Conan, "Ramen Good Enough to Die For: 2 (Part 2)"

432
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,838
Next Conan's Hint:

433
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:29,338
"Vinegar, Soy Sauce and Pepper"

434
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:30,838
Go ahead with your romantic monologues.

435
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,138
-Chukichi. -Kazunobu.

436
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,838
-Shuni. -What? Those are...
