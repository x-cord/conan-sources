00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.740
Mori Detective Agency

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm so bored.

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.930
When detectives are bored, doesn't
that mean the world is at peace?

4
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.090
Well, yeah.

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.090
Yes?

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.410
Come in.

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.640
Is this the Mori Detective Agency?

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.300
Yes.

9
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.640
She's beautiful!

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.640
Here you go.

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.060
Thank you.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.900
So, what did you want to discuss?

13
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.230
Well...

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.120
I hadn't introduced myself yet.

15
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.320
My name is Muto Masako.

16
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.910
Muto Masako (36)
Housewife
My name is Muto Masako.

17
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.830
Masako-san. That's a beautiful name.

18
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.620
Anyway, I'd like you to find someone for me.

19
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
My husband Muto Issei.

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.610
You want me to find your husband?

21
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.930
Your husband, huh?

22
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.820
Find the question that solves the mystery!

23
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.920
Apply miraculous detective skills
to the secrets of the heart!

24
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.010
An odd request from a beautiful wife,

25
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.390
and the suspicious behavior
of her beloved husband!

26
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.140
Always determining the one truth

27
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.880
with the body of a child
and the mind of an adult,

28
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.160
his name is Detective Conan!

29
00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:14.387
The Two Faces

30
00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:16.997
"The Two Faces, Part One!"
The Two Faces
(Part One)

31
00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:19.927
The Two Faces
(Part One)

32
00:03:22.027 --> 00:03:25.437
I don't know what to do.

33
00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:27.437
I see.

34
00:03:30.997 --> 00:03:33.887
Mister, talk to her.

35
00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:35.197
Uh, right.

36
00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:39.567
Could you describe the events leading
up to your husband's disappearance?

37
00:03:39.977 --> 00:03:41.697
In as much detail as possible, please.

38
00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:42.807
All right.

39
00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:45.247
My husband Muto Issei runs a trading company
that imports and sells goods from overseas.

40
00:03:45.247 --> 00:03:48.667
Muto Issei (45)
Self-employed
My husband Muto Issei runs a trading company
that imports and sells goods from overseas.

41
00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:49.587
My husband Muto Issei runs a trading company
that imports and sells goods from overseas.

42
00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:54.047
We got married six months ago.

43
00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:59.117
I believed our relationship
was nothing short of perfect.

44
00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.717
Until that happened...

45
00:04:05.757 --> 00:04:07.227
What happened?

46
00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:14.107
Last week, I went to a restaurant
to have lunch with some friends.

47
00:04:14.407 --> 00:04:18.557
As I was heading home after finishing
lunch and parting ways with my friends,

48
00:04:19.357 --> 00:04:21.367
I spotted my husband.

49
00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:25.977
I thought he was there for a meeting
and tried to call out to him...

50
00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:32.957
But I saw him speaking intimately
with a woman I didn't recognize.

51
00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:37.667
I was curious about what their
relationship was and followed them.

52
00:04:46.157 --> 00:04:47.477
Happens all the time.

53
00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:56.107
But they parted ways without
doing anything in particular,

54
00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:59.277
so I decided to say hello to him.

55
00:05:00.357 --> 00:05:01.327
Issei-san!

56
00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:02.157
Huh?

57
00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:05.287
Issei-san, what are you doing here?

58
00:05:06.787 --> 00:05:08.467
He ran?

59
00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:09.287
Yes.

60
00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:11.787
At full speed.

61
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:18.547
I did my best to chase
after my fleeing husband.

62
00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:24.507
But by the time I reached the river,

63
00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:26.857
I had lost sight of him.

64
00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:30.397
I wasn't sure if I should,

65
00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:33.127
but I ended up calling the police.

66
00:05:33.977 --> 00:05:38.277
But I doubt they understood
even half of what I had to say.

67
00:05:39.397 --> 00:05:42.287
I waited at home for a
while to hear from them,

68
00:05:42.287 --> 00:05:45.027
but it seemed like they
weren't making any progress,

69
00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:49.287
so I decided to visit you.

70
00:05:49.287 --> 00:05:50.737
I see.

71
00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:53.037
A wise decision.

72
00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:58.377
Please. I can't sleep at night like this.

73
00:05:58.377 --> 00:06:02.047
Could you please find my husband?

74
00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:03.977
You can count on me.

75
00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:09.427
I swear on my good name that
I will find your husband.

76
00:06:10.027 --> 00:06:11.557
Thank you.

77
00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:17.317
By the way, do you have any idea why
your husband might have disappeared?

78
00:06:17.547 --> 00:06:19.147
No, I have no idea.

79
00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:24.817
Like I said before, I didn't think
we had any problems until now.

80
00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:26.567
I see.

81
00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:34.867
Did you notice anything odd when
you lost track of your husband?

82
00:06:35.537 --> 00:06:37.497
Stop sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong!

83
00:06:37.707 --> 00:06:41.507
Come to think of it, I don't know
if it's related to the case,

84
00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:47.257
but I think a vehicle drove
away just as I arrived.

85
00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:55.737
First, I'd like to investigate
your husband's office.

86
00:06:55.737 --> 00:06:56.987
Very well.

87
00:06:58.157 --> 00:07:01.357
What are you doing here?

88
00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:05.487
Ran-neechan told me to go with you
since she's worried about you.

89
00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:07.997
Jeez.

90
00:07:12.927 --> 00:07:14.147
This is it.

91
00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:39.367
Why do I feel like something's not right?

92
00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:40.397
Boy.

93
00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:42.357
This way.

94
00:07:42.647 --> 00:07:43.787
Okay!

95
00:07:46.617 --> 00:07:48.907
This is my husband's office.

96
00:07:56.567 --> 00:07:59.387
Is it all right if I investigate the room?

97
00:07:59.387 --> 00:08:00.747
Yes, of course.

98
00:08:01.897 --> 00:08:03.357
Thank you.

99
00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:20.517
What the heck is going on?

100
00:08:20.887 --> 00:08:24.027
There's nothing suspicious among
the documents in his desk.

101
00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:27.267
There's nothing odd inside his closet either.

102
00:08:27.267 --> 00:08:30.137
This room doesn't feel lived in.

103
00:08:30.137 --> 00:08:30.907
Yeah.

104
00:08:31.517 --> 00:08:34.137
There's hardly anything personal in here.

105
00:08:34.137 --> 00:08:37.127
I have no idea where we're supposed to begin.

106
00:08:37.127 --> 00:08:38.487
Then how about this?

107
00:08:38.487 --> 00:08:40.037
What's this?

108
00:08:40.307 --> 00:08:41.667
A starting point.

109
00:08:48.887 --> 00:08:50.767
Let's see...

110
00:08:52.817 --> 00:08:54.547
This is it.

111
00:08:54.547 --> 00:08:57.497
No matter how you look at it, this
is clearly a first-rate corporation.

112
00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:04.167
Muto Trading Company, Muto Trading Company...

113
00:09:04.697 --> 00:09:06.397
It's not here.

114
00:09:06.397 --> 00:09:08.437
What's going on here?

115
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:12.697
Excuse me. I'm Mori Kogoro, a detective.

116
00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:16.487
I'd like to meet with Muto-san
of the Muto Trading Company.

117
00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:20.217
Very well. Do you have an appointment?

118
00:09:20.217 --> 00:09:21.157
No.

119
00:09:21.157 --> 00:09:23.457
One moment, please.

120
00:09:24.237 --> 00:09:29.307
Hello? There's a detective here
at reception named Mori Kogoro.

121
00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:31.357
He says he'd like to speak with Muto-san.

122
00:09:32.187 --> 00:09:32.957
Yes.

123
00:09:33.627 --> 00:09:34.907
No, he doesn't.

124
00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:36.217
Yes.

125
00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:37.797
Yes.

126
00:09:38.457 --> 00:09:39.697
Understood.

127
00:09:41.187 --> 00:09:45.807
I'm sorry. Muto is currently
out of the office.

128
00:09:45.807 --> 00:09:48.477
I'd be happy to meet with another employee.

129
00:09:48.627 --> 00:09:50.657
But without an appointmentâ€”

130
00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:52.767
Mister, over here.

131
00:09:54.577 --> 00:09:57.607
I don't think we'll find any employees here.

132
00:09:57.607 --> 00:09:59.997
After all, this place is a virtual office.

133
00:10:00.157 --> 00:10:01.527
A what?

134
00:10:01.527 --> 00:10:08.747
A virtual office is an imaginary office
young companies use to reduce costs.

135
00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:14.037
It allows them to acquire a prestigious
address like this one for cheap.

136
00:10:14.037 --> 00:10:20.517
It may be imaginary, but there must be
someone receiving phone calls and mail.

137
00:10:20.697 --> 00:10:23.517
Those are set up to be forwarded, too.

138
00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:27.887
What's going on here?

139
00:10:27.887 --> 00:10:34.037
Why was the husband renting
an imaginary office here?

140
00:10:36.777 --> 00:10:40.537
So this is where Masako-san
lost sight of her husband.

141
00:10:40.887 --> 00:10:46.537
The question is what happened here?

142
00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:50.767
If he fled the moment he
saw Masako-san's face,

143
00:10:50.767 --> 00:10:53.997
we can assume he chose to disappear.

144
00:10:54.707 --> 00:10:57.967
But why did he flee when he saw his wife?

145
00:10:57.967 --> 00:11:01.057
Why did he flee to this river?

146
00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:04.687
There must be some reason he came here.

147
00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:06.347
That means...

148
00:11:06.617 --> 00:11:11.357
Was he attacked by someone,
or did he fall into the river?

149
00:11:11.527 --> 00:11:15.857
Was it an accident, or was there foul play?

150
00:11:16.567 --> 00:11:21.707
There should be some evidence around
here backing up Masako-san's story.

151
00:11:22.537 --> 00:11:26.127
Why won't her husband contact her?

152
00:11:26.127 --> 00:11:28.327
Mister, over here!

153
00:11:30.077 --> 00:11:31.507
Did you find something?

154
00:11:31.507 --> 00:11:32.617
Look at this.

155
00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:35.967
Those are tire tracks.

156
00:11:36.227 --> 00:11:40.597
These might be from the vehicle
Masako-san said she saw driving away.

157
00:11:40.957 --> 00:11:44.847
Judging by the width of the
tracks, it might be a microcar.

158
00:11:45.257 --> 00:11:49.107
You're saying the president of a
trading company ran off in a microcar?

159
00:11:49.107 --> 00:11:51.267
I don't know that, but...

160
00:11:53.947 --> 00:11:54.957
Hello?

161
00:11:55.767 --> 00:11:57.867
Ah, Masako-san.

162
00:11:57.867 --> 00:11:58.677
Yes.

163
00:11:59.527 --> 00:12:00.547
Yes.

164
00:12:00.547 --> 00:12:01.367
What?

165
00:12:01.757 --> 00:12:04.027
Understood. I'll head there immediately.

166
00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:05.537
Beika Police Station

167
00:12:05.537 --> 00:12:07.867
Mori-san, thank you for coming.
Beika Police Station

168
00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:11.187
What's this about a wallet they found?

169
00:12:11.187 --> 00:12:12.377
This is it.

170
00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:18.267
It was discovered about 400 meters away from
the river where I lost sight of my husband.

171
00:12:19.297 --> 00:12:21.997
All the cash was taken,

172
00:12:21.997 --> 00:12:25.267
but his cards were still
here, so they contacted me.

173
00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:26.307
Any fingerprints?

174
00:12:26.307 --> 00:12:28.887
No. They were wiped clean.

175
00:12:29.467 --> 00:12:31.257
May I take a look?

176
00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:32.797
Yes, go ahead.

177
00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:39.657
Credit cards, membership cards, and...

178
00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:42.157
There's a few receipts in here.

179
00:12:42.477 --> 00:12:44.157
Let me see those.

180
00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:52.417
They're all receipts for convenience
stores and restaurants.

181
00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:57.627
I see how it is.

182
00:13:05.934 --> 00:13:08.014
Mori Detective Agency

183
00:13:08.014 --> 00:13:09.564
Jeez.
Mori Detective Agency

184
00:13:09.564 --> 00:13:09.894
Mori Detective Agency

185
00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:12.474
Where did he go?

186
00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:15.854
Hey, mister.

187
00:13:16.924 --> 00:13:22.404
You think these receipts are the
key to finding Issei-san, right?

188
00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:23.724
Huh?

189
00:13:23.724 --> 00:13:26.014
How are those receipts
supposed to help us find him?

190
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:27.574
Thanks for waiting, Dad.

191
00:13:28.104 --> 00:13:30.794
I brought a detailed map of Haido City.

192
00:13:31.174 --> 00:13:33.014
A map of Haido City?

193
00:13:33.014 --> 00:13:34.604
I didn't ask for that.

194
00:13:34.604 --> 00:13:35.604
What?

195
00:13:35.604 --> 00:13:37.174
But Conan-kun said...

196
00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:39.174
I know!

197
00:13:39.414 --> 00:13:43.914
Mister, you're going to use this map
to find the missing husband, right?

198
00:13:43.914 --> 00:13:44.454
What?

199
00:13:44.454 --> 00:13:47.584
Ran-neechan, could you lay
that map out over there?

200
00:13:47.584 --> 00:13:50.244
I'll read out the names of
the stores on these receipts,

201
00:13:50.244 --> 00:13:52.104
so could you mark them on the map?

202
00:13:52.104 --> 00:13:52.774
Okay.

203
00:13:52.774 --> 00:13:54.604
That's what you wanted, right, mister?

204
00:13:55.014 --> 00:13:56.864
Uh, yeah...

205
00:14:00.554 --> 00:14:01.784
I'm ready, Conan-kun.

206
00:14:02.324 --> 00:14:06.374
First is SunDay Mart on second street.

207
00:14:06.884 --> 00:14:10.824
SunDay Mart on second street...

208
00:14:10.824 --> 00:14:12.024
Found it.

209
00:14:13.134 --> 00:14:16.234
Next is Danny's in Haido City.

210
00:14:17.684 --> 00:14:19.704
Family restaurant Haidoya.

211
00:14:19.704 --> 00:14:21.114
Haidoya...

212
00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:22.434
Found it.

213
00:14:23.014 --> 00:14:25.854
Daily TMS on second street.

214
00:14:25.854 --> 00:14:28.024
Daily TMS...

215
00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:30.214
Here it is.

216
00:14:30.214 --> 00:14:33.274
Finally, SunDay Mart on second street.

217
00:14:38.004 --> 00:14:38.904
I see.

218
00:14:39.604 --> 00:14:42.674
His life is focused around this area.

219
00:14:43.304 --> 00:14:49.744
But this is nowhere near Muto-san's
house or the virtual office.

220
00:14:51.634 --> 00:14:52.544
That's it!

221
00:14:52.774 --> 00:14:59.044
The husband is secretly doing something in this
area other than running a trading company.

222
00:14:59.044 --> 00:15:02.064
Then if you question people in this area...

223
00:15:02.064 --> 00:15:06.224
We can know more or less where
he is without doing that.

224
00:15:06.224 --> 00:15:07.434
Right, Mister?

225
00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:10.604
What? Uh, yeah...

226
00:15:11.054 --> 00:15:13.064
We can use this.

227
00:15:13.514 --> 00:15:14.604
A compass?

228
00:15:16.354 --> 00:15:20.794
Unless you're buying a product that's
only available at certain stores,

229
00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.504
people generally go to the
closest convenience store.

230
00:15:23.504 --> 00:15:24.314
Yeah.

231
00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:29.434
So if we draw a few circles

232
00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:32.834
around the stores we marked
a bunch of times...

233
00:15:35.264 --> 00:15:36.284
And done.

234
00:15:37.634 --> 00:15:39.374
What's this?

235
00:15:39.374 --> 00:15:44.104
It means the missing husband is
somewhere inside these circles.

236
00:15:44.104 --> 00:15:49.554
Furthermore, it's likely that he's
here where the three circles overlap.

237
00:16:04.664 --> 00:16:09.654
Mister, haven't you felt like something
is off since we visited Muto-san's house?

238
00:16:09.654 --> 00:16:10.324
Something feels off?

239
00:16:10.674 --> 00:16:14.494
Even though he runs an
import trading company,

240
00:16:14.494 --> 00:16:18.104
there weren't any foreign
imports at his house.

241
00:16:18.104 --> 00:16:19.754
I-I guess not.

242
00:16:19.954 --> 00:16:22.514
All the appliances around the
house were outdated, too.

243
00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:27.514
They had nothing in common and were all
totally different styles and brands.

244
00:16:27.974 --> 00:16:31.264
I did get that sense, too.

245
00:16:31.264 --> 00:16:35.174
Then there's the microcar
tire tracks at the river.

246
00:16:35.174 --> 00:16:35.764
Yeah.

247
00:16:36.264 --> 00:16:39.274
Those must have been left by that mini truck.

248
00:16:39.674 --> 00:16:42.004
All right. Let's go check it out.

249
00:16:42.004 --> 00:16:42.904
Yeah.

250
00:16:50.274 --> 00:16:51.244
Huh?

251
00:16:59.224 --> 00:17:00.964
Excuse me.

252
00:17:01.214 --> 00:17:03.204
What is it?

253
00:17:03.204 --> 00:17:05.214
Have you seen this man?

254
00:17:07.464 --> 00:17:09.154
The president?

255
00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.954
He's right over there.

256
00:17:10.954 --> 00:17:11.974
President?

257
00:17:12.444 --> 00:17:14.634
Muto-san is the president here?

258
00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:16.104
Yeah.

259
00:17:16.364 --> 00:17:20.234
H-He's supposed to be the president of a
trading company renting a virtual office,

260
00:17:20.234 --> 00:17:22.604
but he's the president of a second-hand shop?

261
00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:24.434
What's going on here?

262
00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:27.154
There he is!

263
00:17:27.424 --> 00:17:28.694
That's him!

264
00:17:29.334 --> 00:17:30.244
Muto-san!

265
00:17:37.164 --> 00:17:38.244
I see.

266
00:17:38.894 --> 00:17:40.864
That's what Masako said?

267
00:17:40.864 --> 00:17:41.754
Yes.

268
00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:45.694
After conducting an investigation
at your wife's request,

269
00:17:45.694 --> 00:17:47.844
I ended up here.

270
00:17:47.844 --> 00:17:50.354
You truly are a great detective.

271
00:17:50.354 --> 00:17:53.864
I never thought I'd be found this quickly.

272
00:17:54.434 --> 00:18:02.364
More importantly, Muto-san, I have
honestly no idea why you left your wife.

273
00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:05.484
Could you explain the situation?

274
00:18:07.974 --> 00:18:13.744
I lied to my wife on our first date.

275
00:18:14.304 --> 00:18:20.494
In order to make myself look better, I
said I ran an import trading company.

276
00:18:20.904 --> 00:18:27.074
I ended up marrying Masako before
I could tell her the truth.

277
00:18:28.254 --> 00:18:37.014
I began to think maintaining the lie would
hurt Masako less than telling her the truth.

278
00:18:37.254 --> 00:18:42.134
So you went as far as renting a
virtual office to maintain the lie.

279
00:18:42.134 --> 00:18:43.104
Yes.

280
00:18:43.974 --> 00:18:48.024
I didn't want to destroy her dreams.

281
00:18:49.104 --> 00:18:51.284
Her dreams, huh?

282
00:18:53.554 --> 00:18:56.614
But now I'm being punished.

283
00:18:57.154 --> 00:19:00.344
I didn't think Masako would find me there.

284
00:19:01.064 --> 00:19:03.934
But why did you run?

285
00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:08.294
Your wife simply saw you
speaking with a woman.

286
00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:11.424
I thought she'd overheard our conversation!

287
00:19:12.014 --> 00:19:16.594
The woman I was with is a client.

288
00:19:16.594 --> 00:19:20.434
I thought I couldn't talk my
way out of it and panicked.

289
00:19:24.674 --> 00:19:25.934
And?

290
00:19:26.364 --> 00:19:28.864
What are you going to do now?

291
00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:32.944
Muto-san.

292
00:19:33.914 --> 00:19:37.264
What should I do?

293
00:19:39.124 --> 00:19:43.454
I don't know what to do, so I
haven't been able to do anything.

294
00:19:47.914 --> 00:19:49.794
If you think...

295
00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:56.174
If you think it's not too late,
then shouldn't you go back to her?

296
00:19:56.554 --> 00:19:57.354
What?

297
00:19:58.264 --> 00:20:01.684
You don't seem like a bad person.

298
00:20:01.884 --> 00:20:06.694
Can't you and your wife get
along even after all this happened?

299
00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:12.534
Besides, I believe that's what she wants.

300
00:20:13.794 --> 00:20:17.324
However, I don't think
you should lie anymore.

301
00:20:17.324 --> 00:20:20.454
Women have keen instincts.

302
00:20:22.064 --> 00:20:24.954
Very well. I'll do that.

303
00:20:34.174 --> 00:20:37.464
Mori Detective Agency

304
00:20:38.094 --> 00:20:40.564
Hello, Mori Detective Agency.

305
00:20:41.494 --> 00:20:43.474
Ah, Masako-san.

306
00:20:44.824 --> 00:20:47.614
My husband just returned.

307
00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:49.034
I see.

308
00:20:49.034 --> 00:20:52.944
Thank you so much for everything.

309
00:20:52.944 --> 00:20:56.234
So, how did your conversation go?

310
00:20:56.694 --> 00:21:04.654
We do have quite a few problems, but
we've decided to start over together.

311
00:21:04.654 --> 00:21:07.494
I see. That's good.

312
00:21:09.504 --> 00:21:13.844
Unbelievable. If he'd just told
me the truth from the start,

313
00:21:13.844 --> 00:21:16.434
this wouldn't have happened.

314
00:21:16.434 --> 00:21:18.324
Absolutely.

315
00:21:18.324 --> 00:21:23.884
But all men want to show
off every now and then.

316
00:21:26.094 --> 00:21:31.014
I really have no idea how to thank you.

317
00:21:32.084 --> 00:21:34.794
Yes, thank you.

318
00:21:34.794 --> 00:21:36.714
Goodbye.

319
00:21:48.014 --> 00:21:50.414
The case is closed, Mister.

320
00:21:50.674 --> 00:21:51.574
Yeah.

321
00:21:51.574 --> 00:21:57.134
Missing person and infidelity
cases rarely end well,

322
00:21:57.134 --> 00:22:00.424
but maybe it really is settled this time.
