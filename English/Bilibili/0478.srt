1
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:04,191
The light of summer is the glory of yesterday.

2
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:05,991
After the tears come live broadcasting.

3
00:00:05,991 --> 00:00:07,591
No anime has been this unique.

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:08,991
The incidents run in real time.

5
00:00:08,991 --> 00:00:10,291
Keep an eye on the case.

6
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,691
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:13,291
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,291
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:01,946
Hi and howdy.

10
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:03,546
Here we are tonight again.

11
00:02:03,546 --> 00:02:06,746
Every Monday at 7.30pm,

12
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:10,946
"Search and catch the girls, the Runaway Special"!

13
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:14,646
Tonight we are broadcasting live from down town Nengyoucho.

14
00:02:14,646 --> 00:02:18,646
The Runaway Girls will run into the Nengyoucho...

15
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:22,846
Hanehacho and Kabutomicho.

16
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:25,046
If the three challengers can catch all three Runaway Girls

17
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:28,946
within 30 minutes of live broadcasting,

18
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:31,046
a prize of one million yen will be awarded.

19
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,946
Are you ready, girls?

20
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,746
Three, two, one, go!

21
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:41,946
"26 minutes left until one million yen"

22
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:48,946
Now, let's start searching and looking for them, guys.

23
00:02:52,846 --> 00:02:54,746
There aren't many shoppers around.

24
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:57,046
Do they make money here?

25
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:58,846
That's why they need some of those things

26
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,046
to attract customers.

27
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:04,446
Look at that gigantic hourglass they put up there.

28
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:07,146
They want people come and meet in front of it.

29
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:11,946
Hum. A 30 minute hourglass. Fantastic.

30
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:14,446
How stupid of me. I should have made reservations.

31
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:16,446
They say it's full.

32
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,246
Okay, let's go somewhere else.

33
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:21,046
Oh, well. What shall I say, it's a...

34
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:24,746
I made an 8pm reservation already.

35
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,946
Hey. We have to wait 30 minutes then.

36
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:31,046
They say it's delicious there.

37
00:03:31,046 --> 00:03:33,646
I expected a casual Italian dish,

38
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:35,546
not an extravagant cuisine.

39
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:38,046
Anyway, guys, we'll meet here a little before 8pm.

40
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:41,046
Until then, let's go our own way.

41
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,546
Let's break it up, guys.

42
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:43,646
Dad?

43
00:03:47,646 --> 00:03:50,046
Sigh... I knew it.

44
00:03:50,046 --> 00:03:51,546
What would you do, Conan?

45
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:55,046
They have a bookstore for mysteries upstairs.

46
00:03:56,846 --> 00:03:58,746
I'll be looking for dresses.

47
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,846
Well, a little before 8pm, then.

48
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:02,146
Gotcha!

49
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:10,246
"Remodeling. Wet paint"

50
00:04:10,246 --> 00:04:14,146
Sorry, the stairs are closed all day today!

51
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:17,046
Use the stairs over there, boy.

52
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:20,546
Sweet Chinese chestnuts! They are so delicious!

53
00:04:20,546 --> 00:04:23,346
They are all natural Chestnuts. Yes, they are!

54
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,246
"Mystery Books"

55
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:44,046
"Real 30 Minutes"

56
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,446
That's right.

57
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:57,246
A man was stabbed on the second floor of the Yonehana Broad Mall.

58
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:59,746
Please come quickly.

59
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:03,746
He is still breathing.

60
00:05:07,546 --> 00:05:10,146
He was stabbed from behind on the left side

61
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:12,446
and fell down forward.

62
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:15,446
So his face hit the floor hard.

63
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:17,446
If he was stabbed only a moment ago,

64
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:21,146
then chances are the culprit is still in this building.

65
00:05:23,046 --> 00:05:25,546
Ha... Haibara?

66
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:28,146
You seem to be in love with criminal cases

67
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:31,346
or is it that the cases are calling you, Conan.

68
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:33,146
So, you're here too.

69
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:36,446
Over there, I was in that medical bookstore.

70
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:37,946
Then I heard a scream.

71
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:41,246
Did you see anyone suspicious?

72
00:05:41,246 --> 00:05:43,146
Nope.

73
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:45,546
His fat wallet is intact,

74
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,446
so it's not a robbery.

75
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,246
What are you doing, guys?

76
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:51,546
Don't mess around. Go away.

77
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,346
And people, please step back.

78
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:54,646
The police is coming.

79
00:05:58,646 --> 00:06:01,146
This way, officers! Beyond, on the second floor!

80
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,346
Dad!

81
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:15,846
Huh? Who's calling me, Dad?

82
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:17,046
What a...

83
00:06:22,546 --> 00:06:25,246
"23 minutes left until one million yen" -Bingo! Piyo-chan's got caught!

84
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:28,446
You still have four more to go. Keep it up, guys!

85
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:32,246
We are the police.

86
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:35,746
Everybody, step back, please.

87
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:38,246
Inspector Megure has arrived in no time at all.

88
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:39,846
Yeah.

89
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,946
The victim's Yukio Nishiyama.

90
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,846
An ambulance will arrive soon, sir.

91
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:47,046
Okay.

92
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:49,546
She is Shiori Yamaguchi, she found the victim first.

93
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:51,146
She says she works a that shop over there.

94
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:52,446
"Movies"

95
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:56,046
And that is Mr. Koide, the manager of the cosmetics shop.

96
00:06:56,046 --> 00:07:00,346
The police got the first call at 7.30pm.

97
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:02,146
Did you make the call?

98
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:05,746
What? Oh. Was it that time of day?

99
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:08,246
7.30pm?

100
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:09,546
I see.

101
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:13,446
Did either of you notice something, anything?

102
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:17,246
Well, let me tell you, Nishiyama and Miss Yamazaki

103
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,646
have not been getting along very well.

104
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:20,746
Nishiyama...

105
00:07:20,746 --> 00:07:23,546
Did you know the victim?

106
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:27,046
Everybody in this Broad Mall knows him and hates him.

107
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,646
He kept annoying us by messing up things on display

108
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:31,446
and never tidies them up.

109
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:33,746
He breaks a lot in here as well and troubles them.

110
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:36,846
Every shop here have been harassed.

111
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:39,546
He is a real pain to us.

112
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,546
However...

113
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:47,046
Shiori here... I mean Miss Yamaguchi is an exception.

114
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,246
He hasn't done anything to her.

115
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:51,146
He calls her by her first name?

116
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:53,046
I guess they're quite intimate.

117
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,546
Why don't you give it to me straight?

118
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,846
You want to say I stabbed him, don't you?

119
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:58,146
I didn't say that.

120
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:00,946
Just what do you mean, Miss?

121
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:04,646
He holds a grudge against me because I dumped him.

122
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:07,546
And he keeps annoying me all the time.

123
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,646
What nonsense!

124
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:13,046
Everybody knew Nishiyama liked you.

125
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:17,146
That's why he didn't do any bad things at your shop.

126
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:21,046
You and Nishiyama were arguing just two days ago.

127
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,446
They say you two were talking so loud

128
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:23,846
that everybody in the Mall could hear you.

129
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:25,046
I heard you, too.

130
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,646
Why don't you talk about yourself?

131
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:27,846
Do you think I don't know?

132
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:33,046
Mr. Koide has been threatened by Nishiyama to pay money.

133
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,346
What?

134
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,346
It's not actually a threat...

135
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:41,746
It happened sometime ago. Mr. Koide hit Nishiyama.

136
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:45,446
In other words, you had to pay for compensation.

137
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:47,946
Stop talking about unnecessary things!

138
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:48,946
But...

139
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:52,446
Excuse me, please let me through.

140
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:55,046
I'm the famous detective Kogoro Mouri!

141
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,346
Now everybody need not worry about anything.

142
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,246
Conan.

143
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:04,046
Oh, Ran.

144
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:05,346
Hum...

145
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,746
Mr. Mouri, don't touch anything.

146
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,146
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

147
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:12,246
What's that bag he is carrying?

148
00:09:12,246 --> 00:09:15,446
He got it at a pachinko parlor.

149
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:20,546
You shouldn't be wasting your luck on things like that, Pops.

150
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:23,646
And where were you at that time?

151
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,046
Hum...

152
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:27,446
Oh, no, dad...

153
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:34,146
"20 minutes left until one million yen" -Now, another girl's been caught.

154
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:37,346
"19 minutes left until one million yen" -Three more girls to go.

155
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:40,446
But the time limit is getting closer and closer.

156
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,946
Run, Girls. Run!

157
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:44,246
I heard the scream from the second floor.

158
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,446
And I came up quickly.

159
00:09:48,446 --> 00:09:50,046
From the scene of the crime,

160
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,946
I can tell that not much time has passed

161
00:09:51,946 --> 00:09:54,346
after Mr. Nishiyama was stabbed.

162
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:57,346
The other stairway was blocked.

163
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,246
That means the culprit...

164
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:01,446
had to go down these steps.

165
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:04,546
"Chinese Chestnuts" -Sweet chestnuts for you!

166
00:10:04,546 --> 00:10:05,746
Hello, sir.

167
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:08,846
Oh, young man. You save if you buy a bag.

168
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:11,146
Sorry, I'm not a customer.

169
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,046
Oh, just as I thought.

170
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,546
You were here all this time, weren't you?

171
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:18,546
Right. I can't leave this stand,

172
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:20,246
so I can't go upstairs.

173
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,746
They say a man got stabbed?

174
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:26,146
Before you heard the scream,

175
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:28,646
did anyone come down the stairs?

176
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:29,846
Nobody.

177
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,346
And after that?

178
00:10:31,346 --> 00:10:33,046
You're the first.

179
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:35,746
A few went upstairs, though.

180
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:37,746
Okay.

181
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:41,746
Alright, everybody. Get out quickly, please.

182
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:43,246
This place will be blocked off to the public.

183
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:45,846
No! Send everyone back upstairs!

184
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,546
What's the matter, Conan?

185
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,746
Nobody came down these stairs after the scream!

186
00:10:50,746 --> 00:10:54,246
So the culprit may be still hiding upstairs!

187
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,546
I see. That's possible.

188
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,846
Hey, stop!

189
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:06,246
That's right! The culprit is inside this building!

190
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:10,046
I'm gonna catch him and I'm gonna make my day!

191
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,546
Cool down, Pops.

192
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:23,154
Let go of me, jerk!

193
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:24,554
Why did you run?

194
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:26,554
Why did you nab me?

195
00:11:26,554 --> 00:11:28,354
This is an assault case,

196
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,154
so we have to keep you for a while.

197
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:31,154
Humph...

198
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:33,454
Make sure nobody enters into this building

199
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:34,854
and nobody goes out.

200
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:35,854
Yes, sir.

201
00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:41,254
Huh?

202
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:48,854
This is a...

203
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,154
Why can't I go in?

204
00:11:57,154 --> 00:11:59,754
We're investigating on an assault case.

205
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:01,954
-Shut up and move out of my way! -It's off limits until we complete...

206
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,154
That's enough. Lay off!

207
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:08,754
Shut up! Sensei can fire you if he wishes.

208
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:12,454
Wow. His sensei is such a big shot that he can fire a policeman.

209
00:12:12,454 --> 00:12:16,054
Anyway, we are entering like always!

210
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:18,454
No! No one can enters!

211
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:23,954
This is Hasegawa, sir.

212
00:12:23,954 --> 00:12:25,854
We are here to pick you up,

213
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:28,254
but the police won't let us in.

214
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:30,354
When you're finished, give us a call.

215
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,654
We'll be waiting outside for you.

216
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:41,154
Now three Runaway Girls' have been caught.

217
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:44,454
But the challengers are tired, too.

218
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:48,654
The only two remaining are Hinako and Lulu.

219
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:50,654
Run... run away.

220
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:53,054
Well, dining seems to be the last thing we can do for now.

221
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:54,154
Yeah, you're right.

222
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:07,354
So, this is Mr. Koide's shop.

223
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:10,454
I've got it.

224
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:12,254
Hey, you over there!

225
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:14,354
You've been shoplifting again at my place?

226
00:13:14,354 --> 00:13:16,054
Don't start picking on me, man.

227
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,054
When did I ever do something like that?

228
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:21,754
Heck! You do it all the time. I know it.

229
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,554
Well, why don't you search my bag, then?

230
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,554
Go ahead!

231
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,254
Mr. Koide, may I have a minute with you?

232
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,654
Sure, sir.

233
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:29,954
What's with him...

234
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:33,054
Shoplifting is a crime, you know?

235
00:13:34,154 --> 00:13:35,854
This will be my last time.

236
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:40,654
Catch one more and you get a million yen.

237
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,554
Can they make it in time?

238
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,654
What the heck.

239
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:50,054
You have seen the culprit, haven't you, Miss?

240
00:13:52,454 --> 00:13:54,654
In that shop, they place lipsticks

241
00:13:54,654 --> 00:13:56,954
in front of the glass case beside the aisle.

242
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:59,354
See, you an see them from here too.

243
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:01,754
If you shoplift a lipstick over there,

244
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:04,454
you can see the scene of the crime on the other side too.

245
00:14:04,454 --> 00:14:07,054
Why... why are you saying something like that?

246
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,754
Because you have been acting strange all this time.

247
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:14,654
It's natural to leave right away after shoplifting, right?

248
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:17,454
But you stayed here, why?

249
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:20,254
Because you were afraid.

250
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,654
You feared that you could meet up

251
00:14:24,654 --> 00:14:28,154
with the culprit outside the building.

252
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:30,454
That's what you thought.

253
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:34,454
So, you attempted to flee among the commotion, didn't you?

254
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,554
Sigh, you're a wonder.

255
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:40,454
I give up. How could you see through it all?

256
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:43,054
I am a detective.

257
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:45,354
Wow, you are great, indeed.

258
00:14:45,354 --> 00:14:47,654
Well, what kind of a guy was the culprit?

259
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:52,254
Well, it happened so fast, I didn't have time to look at his face.

260
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:54,654
He turned back and looked towards me.

261
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:57,354
I was too scared to look.

262
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,454
The culprit is a man and left handed?

263
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:02,654
Yes. I'm sure the knife was in his left hand.

264
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:04,654
What else? Anything special about him?

265
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,054
Oh, yes. He was wearing a coat.

266
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:09,154
A coat?

267
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:11,554
A thin, long, black one.

268
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:14,854
Hmm... by the way, Miss...

269
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,554
About this...

270
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:20,954
Oh, I feel I'm freed.

271
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,954
I won't shoplift anymore,

272
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:24,954
so don't worry, my dear Mr. Detective.

273
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,954
Haibara! What's the matter?

274
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:42,054
I went to look upstairs.

275
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:44,554
The police are investigating, aren't they?

276
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:47,354
Yes. They were after the whereabouts of the murder weapon knife

277
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,954
and any suspicious person.

278
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:51,854
Upstairs there are only several offices...

279
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:54,454
And a dental clinic.

280
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,454
Then it was easy to check.

281
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:57,454
You can say so.

282
00:15:57,454 --> 00:16:00,054
Any disposed black coat there?

283
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:02,554
-A coat? -The culprit was seen wearing one.

284
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:04,154
I didn't see any.

285
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,854
But I didn't look in men's room.

286
00:16:06,854 --> 00:16:09,054
The police won't overlook it, I suppose.

287
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,254
I agree.

288
00:16:10,254 --> 00:16:13,354
There seems to be no place for him to hide.

289
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,554
Why did the culprit stab that man?

290
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:17,154
That's the key point.

291
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:20,154
Unless one of the shop clerks or managers is the culprit,

292
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:21,954
it can't have been because of a grudge.

293
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:25,154
The wallet was intact, so it was not robbery, either.

294
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:27,554
If the culprit and the victim were fighting or struggling,

295
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,154
someone should have heard them.

296
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,454
But it doesn't look that way.

297
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:33,854
That means...

298
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:37,154
The purpose of the culprit was in stabbing itself.

299
00:16:37,154 --> 00:16:40,554
You mean, not out of the grudge against the victim?

300
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:43,554
There were two people who called the police.

301
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:45,054
Two?

302
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:47,154
One is Mr. Koide.

303
00:16:47,154 --> 00:16:51,354
The other one called the police before Mr. Koide did.

304
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:54,354
He was probably the man in the black coat.

305
00:16:54,354 --> 00:16:58,154
The police got the first call at 7.30pm.

306
00:16:58,154 --> 00:17:00,154
Did you make the call?

307
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:03,754
Yes. He made the call before he stabbed Mr. Nishiyama.

308
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:08,154
The culprit wanted the police to arrive here quickly.

309
00:17:08,154 --> 00:17:09,154
But why?

310
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:16,454
That explains it.

311
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:17,854
What is it?

312
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,254
The two over there.

313
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:21,754
They're scary.

314
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:25,754
Suppose the culprit wanted to keep those two outside?

315
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,954
He wanted to make trouble and call the police

316
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:31,854
and have the police designate this place off limits,

317
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:35,354
so he called the police beforehand.

318
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,554
He had no other choice but to achieve a certain purpose.

319
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:40,154
What purpose?

320
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:43,354
That guy standing outside, when refused entry by the police officer

321
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,254
was talking to someone in this building.

322
00:17:47,254 --> 00:17:49,254
When you're done, call me, sir.

323
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:51,054
We will be waiting outside.

324
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:53,954
Apparently he was leaving a message

325
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:55,954
on the answer phone of the person he called.

326
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:59,154
You mean, a person who is in this building but can't answer,

327
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:00,854
so has his phone on answer phone?

328
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:03,654
They came here to pick up that person.

329
00:18:03,654 --> 00:18:05,854
The initial purpose of the culprit

330
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:08,654
was to prevent the two bodyguards from entering the building?

331
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,954
The real purpose of the culprit

332
00:18:11,954 --> 00:18:14,154
was to assault the person who was to meet those two.

333
00:18:14,154 --> 00:18:16,454
That person was probably...

334
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:20,054
undergoing dental treatment

335
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:22,154
and had his cell turned off.

336
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:23,454
Right.

337
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:26,654
So long as the culprit knew what time the appointment was,

338
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:28,854
he could manage to be there

339
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:31,054
and make the police off limit the area.

340
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:40,054
Good evening, do you have appointment?

341
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,354
Yes...

342
00:18:44,654 --> 00:18:46,254
Haibara! Call the Inspector.

343
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:47,254
Okay.

344
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:48,254
What's the matter?

345
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:50,454
If you're an emergency patient, you'll have to wait your turn.

346
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:55,154
Huh... is there anyone else waiting his turn?

347
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:58,654
Yes, there's one person.

348
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:00,554
Hey... can you tell me which person?

349
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:01,554
Huh?

350
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:04,854
The person is among the three over there, right?

351
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:06,054
Yes...

352
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:08,554
The one in the middle.

353
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:20,054
Gosh!

354
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,354
Next person, please.

355
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,154
Who the heck are you?

356
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:53,954
I've come to avenge the death of my wife!

357
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:56,554
-What... -Drop death!

358
00:19:59,754 --> 00:20:01,154
Go...

359
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:09,554
Is the culprit there?

360
00:20:09,554 --> 00:20:10,754
It's that man!

361
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,754
Well done, all of you.

362
00:20:16,754 --> 00:20:19,654
I'm Taizo Masuda, a congressman.

363
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:22,554
I was almost killed by that guy.

364
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:27,954
You're the one who hit and run and killed my wife!

365
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:28,954
What?

366
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:36,954
Despite doing what he did,

367
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:39,654
a scapegoat was sent to the police pleading guilty to the crime...

368
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,254
Just what nonsense you are talking about?

369
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:43,454
I've looked into it!

370
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:45,954
It took me three months to find a witness!

371
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,754
Why didn't you tell the police about it?

372
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:53,354
He's a politician and big shot, you can't win.

373
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:56,454
So I decided to do it myself!

374
00:20:56,454 --> 00:21:00,154
That doesn't give you the right to commit a crime.

375
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:01,154
Cut it out!

376
00:21:01,154 --> 00:21:03,754
That's right, you dirty criminal.

377
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:07,054
We'll hear you out as to the hit-and-run incident

378
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:08,554
at the Metropolitan Police!

379
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,954
That's the story.

380
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:15,654
Stop committing further crime.

381
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:16,954
Throw away your knife.

382
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:03,254
Two, one, zero!

383
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:06,754
Too bad, there was only one more person left to go, but it's time out.

384
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:10,654
Oh yeah! No million yen win this week.

385
00:23:10,654 --> 00:23:13,454
Next week we will be broadcasting live from Beika-cho.

386
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:14,854
Bye now folks.

387
00:23:14,854 --> 00:23:17,954
Dad will treat us to an Italian dish.

388
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:20,754
So come with us, Ai-chan.

389
00:23:20,754 --> 00:23:22,054
Don't hesitate.

390
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:25,954
It may be once in a lifetime that Pops will treat us.

391
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,654
Oh, what's the matter, Dad?

392
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:28,754
No...

393
00:23:28,754 --> 00:23:31,054
That restaurant was so crowded

394
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:33,354
that only the counter seats were open...

395
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:34,654
You don't say...

396
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:36,554
You couldn't make reservations...

397
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:38,954
I made the reservation, sure, but...

398
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:40,354
But what?

399
00:23:40,354 --> 00:23:41,854
It was just for me alone.

400
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:42,854
What do you mean by that?

401
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,754
The lady at the reception desk was a real beauty

402
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:48,454
that I just couldn't decline...

403
00:23:48,454 --> 00:23:50,254
Sorry, guys. But that's what happened.

404
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:53,954
And this if for you, Ran, dear.

405
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:55,654
You're not getting away with this trash of yours!

406
00:23:55,654 --> 00:23:58,054
So sorry...

407
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:03,054
He does it a lot, huh?

408
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:05,354
This is the worst time ever.

409
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,854
"Next Episode" -With Hattori and others?

410
00:24:08,854 --> 00:24:10,754
Flower viewing?

411
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:12,454
What? Disappeared?

412
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:14,754
A young monk tells of an incident. A body disappears.

413
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,954
What's the truth behind it?

414
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:20,654
What was Hattori's real reason for coming all the way from Osaka?

415
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:21,754
From east and west, north and south,

416
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:25,454
four high school detectives get together on an uninhabited island.

417
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:26,754
A mystery on an isolated island.

418
00:24:26,754 --> 00:24:29,054
Perfectly sealed room trick.

419
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:31,654
Hey, Hattori, what the heck are you talking about?

420
00:24:31,654 --> 00:24:33,354
Next Conan's Special!

421
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:37,154
"Three days with Heiji Hattori"

422
00:24:52,954 --> 00:24:54,754
Next Conan's Hint:

423
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,354
Tatami and Window.

424
00:24:57,354 --> 00:24:58,954
Tatami and window?

425
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:00,354
Are you afraid of Tatami?

426
00:25:00,354 --> 00:25:01,454
Great.
