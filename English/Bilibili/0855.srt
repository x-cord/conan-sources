1
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.470
That's it!

2
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.270
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

3
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.570
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

4
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.270
Before tackling the Scarlet Case,

5
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.670
we head to a karate dojo with Sonoko.

6
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.470
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.470
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.670
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:19.828
"Mystery of the Missing Black Belt"

10
00:02:25.328 --> 00:02:27.728
Just as expected of you.

11
00:02:27.728 --> 00:02:30.528
Makoto, you're awesome!

12
00:02:30.528 --> 00:02:32.228
Yes, yes.

13
00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:34.828
What's with that attitude of yours?

14
00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:37.528
I went out of my way to get us to come see this, you know.

15
00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:40.228
So can't you try looking a bit happier?

16
00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:43.828
You forced me to come with you.

17
00:02:43.828 --> 00:02:48.328
I actually wanted to USJ with everybody else, you know.

18
00:02:48.328 --> 00:02:51.228
We came all the way to Osaka and yet...

19
00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:54.328
If you wanted to watch karate, you should've come with Ran.

20
00:02:54.328 --> 00:02:58.028
Ran has to look after the children.

21
00:02:58.028 --> 00:03:00.328
And besides, if Ran comes,

22
00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:04.328
Makoto and her will get carried away talking about karate, right?

23
00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:07.028
I didn't want to come alone,

24
00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:10.028
so there was nobody else I could ask but you.

25
00:03:12.028 --> 00:03:13.028
Hi there!

26
00:03:13.028 --> 00:03:16.228
Hi...

27
00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.128
Hiroki, that karate outfit...

28
00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:21.228
Mine was worn out so I got a new one.

29
00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:24.028
The youth club practice is going to be starting.

30
00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:26.328
Makoto's a guest.

31
00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:29.428
Who's that old man over there?

32
00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:33.428
He nobody else but Tatsuhito Takami Sensei

33
00:03:33.428 --> 00:03:35.728
of the Tenshin Style Karate 8th generation.

34
00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:39.728
Really? What's the relationship between Sensei and Makoto?

35
00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:45.528
Well, I guess you could say they're old time acquaintances.

36
00:03:45.528 --> 00:03:47.728
When I was in elementary school,

37
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.828
there was a time when I hit a wall and got stuck playing Karate.

38
00:03:50.828 --> 00:03:53.428
I just happened to come to Osaka on a family trip,

39
00:03:53.428 --> 00:03:55.328
and met Takami Sensei.

40
00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:02.628
He let me practice with him just once.

41
00:04:06.728 --> 00:04:08.828
At that practice, I...

42
00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:36.528
Win without fighting.

43
00:04:39.828 --> 00:04:43.028
Think about the meaning of this phrase.

44
00:04:46.428 --> 00:04:50.828
Thanks to that teaching, I am here now.

45
00:04:50.828 --> 00:04:52.928
Win without fighting?

46
00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:54.128
What does it mean?

47
00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:57.228
I think it means you shouldn't pick a fight

48
00:04:57.228 --> 00:04:59.928
or get offensive from your side?

49
00:05:01.628 --> 00:05:05.328
As to the interpretation of words, to each is his own.

50
00:05:05.328 --> 00:05:07.928
There is no one correct answer.

51
00:05:07.928 --> 00:05:10.728
The youth club practice is starting soon,

52
00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:13.128
so enjoy yourself watching it.

53
00:05:13.128 --> 00:05:14.428
Yes, sir.

54
00:05:25.528 --> 00:05:27.228
Are you okay, Sonoko?

55
00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:28.428
I'm fine.

56
00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:31.028
I had a cold but I'm over it.

57
00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:35.028
By the way, your karate a while ago was awesome.

58
00:05:36.428 --> 00:05:38.628
Thank you very much!

59
00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:41.228
Okay, let's start practice.

60
00:05:41.228 --> 00:05:42.928
Yes...

61
00:05:42.928 --> 00:05:46.628
I'm always surprised of how fast children grow.

62
00:05:46.628 --> 00:05:49.428
That boy over there called Hiroki Kadota,

63
00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:50.928
used to have an inflexible body

64
00:05:50.928 --> 00:05:53.328
and wasn't good at flexing his body.

65
00:05:53.328 --> 00:05:55.828
But now, he's changed.

66
00:05:55.828 --> 00:05:59.628
Recently, he acts as a leader for the club.

67
00:05:59.628 --> 00:06:02.228
I'm really proud of him.

68
00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:04.428
The one next to him, Katsuto Kawaguchi

69
00:06:04.428 --> 00:06:06.228
also has a bright future to look forward to.

70
00:06:06.228 --> 00:06:08.728
He's big built but is timid

71
00:06:08.728 --> 00:06:11.428
and couldn't give his all during the real matches.

72
00:06:11.428 --> 00:06:16.228
But now, he passed the test and got a black belt.

73
00:06:16.228 --> 00:06:19.928
Oh, yes. There's another one, Norio Obashi.

74
00:06:19.928 --> 00:06:23.628
He wasn't good at running and always was pooped part way,

75
00:06:23.628 --> 00:06:26.728
but now, he finishes the entire course with ease.

76
00:06:26.728 --> 00:06:30.528
Is that because your training is good, Sensei?

77
00:06:30.528 --> 00:06:34.528
I wonder about that.

78
00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.028
Thank you so much for coming today.

79
00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:41.428
You're indeed a hero to all the children, Kyogoku.

80
00:06:41.428 --> 00:06:44.028
This will become a good memory for them.

81
00:06:45.828 --> 00:06:50.228
Sensei, I have a stomach ache,

82
00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:52.928
so can I take off from practice today?

83
00:06:52.928 --> 00:06:55.028
Of course, you may.

84
00:06:55.028 --> 00:06:57.028
But are you okay?

85
00:06:57.028 --> 00:06:59.028
Do you want me to take you home?

86
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.328
No, I can go home alone.

87
00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:06.828
I'm sure I'll get better if I rest a while.

88
00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:09.428
Basic practice. Start!

89
00:07:19.728 --> 00:07:23.928
Sensei, what is that?

90
00:07:23.928 --> 00:07:25.828
That's an exhibition of the trophies

91
00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:28.528
and medals that were won at tournaments.

92
00:07:28.528 --> 00:07:32.628
I said not to, but my students insisted.

93
00:07:32.628 --> 00:07:35.728
What's that one at the very top?

94
00:07:35.728 --> 00:07:37.328
That's the belt that has been handed down

95
00:07:37.328 --> 00:07:39.428
to the heads of this dojo for generations.

96
00:07:39.428 --> 00:07:42.128
It is a crystallization of the blood and sweat of all those before us.

97
00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:43.928
I've devoted myself to practicing all this time

98
00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:46.928
so as not to disgrace this belt.

99
00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:49.728
Then, what about the belt that you're using now?

100
00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:52.428
It's just a regular belt that you can find anywhere.

101
00:07:52.428 --> 00:07:55.328
But you're the head of the Dojo, aren't you, Sensei?

102
00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:57.728
Why aren't you wearing that belt?

103
00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:00.928
I'm sorry,

104
00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:03.628
but I've got to go now.

105
00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:05.428
I wonder what happened?

106
00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:08.528
I hear that after Takami Sensei became the head of the Dojo,

107
00:08:08.528 --> 00:08:12.128
his practice was so severe that a lot of people quit.

108
00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:15.928
And besides, it seems he doesn't charge children for practicing.

109
00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:18.728
What? You mean he teaches for free?

110
00:08:18.728 --> 00:08:20.828
Let's go running then!

111
00:08:20.828 --> 00:08:22.728
Okay...

112
00:08:22.728 --> 00:08:26.228
Kyogoku, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

113
00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:27.228
Yes, sir.

114
00:08:28.328 --> 00:08:30.528
Mr. Takami.

115
00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:33.428
Mr. Kajiyoshi.

116
00:08:33.428 --> 00:08:37.328
Please sign the papers today, okay?

117
00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:41.628
I'm sorry, but could you give me a little more time?

118
00:08:41.628 --> 00:08:43.528
Just what do you mean by that?

119
00:08:43.528 --> 00:08:45.828
I'm here because you said

120
00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:47.828
you wanted to sell this place as soon as possible.

121
00:08:47.828 --> 00:08:51.428
I'm willing to pay you a good price for it, too.

122
00:08:51.428 --> 00:08:53.928
I have a guest now, you see.

123
00:08:54.928 --> 00:08:57.828
Okay, I guess I'll come back.

124
00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.728
What's with those three?

125
00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:01.828
I think they're debt collectors for black-market financing.

126
00:09:01.828 --> 00:09:02.928
What?

127
00:09:02.928 --> 00:09:04.828
They're planning to take this away from him

128
00:09:04.828 --> 00:09:08.428
if he isn't able to pay back the money.

129
00:09:08.428 --> 00:09:11.728
If they sell the land, they can make loads of cash on it.

130
00:09:13.228 --> 00:09:17.228
Sensei, is it true that you're selling this place?

131
00:09:17.228 --> 00:09:19.228
I'm old already.

132
00:09:19.228 --> 00:09:23.428
It's about time I return that black belt and retire.

133
00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:24.928
No way.

134
00:09:25.928 --> 00:09:27.528
Unfortunately,

135
00:09:27.528 --> 00:09:32.328
there isn't anyone fit to succeed the Tenshin Style Dojo yet.

136
00:09:32.328 --> 00:09:36.728
So, I decided to close it.

137
00:09:36.728 --> 00:09:40.028
But the way I see it, Sensei, you're still...

138
00:09:40.028 --> 00:09:43.728
I don't have the energy that I used to have anymore.

139
00:09:43.728 --> 00:09:47.128
The vigor to wear that black belt, that is.

140
00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:52.328
Excuse me for a moment.

141
00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:56.428
Takami Sensei. If you close this place,

142
00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:59.328
what will become of those children?

143
00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:03.328
I will ask if other Dojo's will be willing to accept them.

144
00:10:03.328 --> 00:10:07.428
Those children came here because they adored you, right?

145
00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:09.128
That's too irresponsible!

146
00:10:18.528 --> 00:10:20.928
Kyogoku, what did you do?

147
00:10:23.828 --> 00:10:25.528
The belt's gone!

148
00:10:26.428 --> 00:10:29.428
Kyogoku, don't tell me that...

149
00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:32.828
If it were me...

150
00:10:32.828 --> 00:10:34.628
What would you do?

151
00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:45.495
Makoto, is it true?

152
00:10:45.495 --> 00:10:48.395
Will you explain?

153
00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:52.095
I want you to take back your statement of closing the Dojo.

154
00:10:52.095 --> 00:10:53.395
What?

155
00:10:55.595 --> 00:10:58.895
I'm sorry. I've already made up my mind.

156
00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:02.695
Then, I challenge you to a match, Sensei.

157
00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:05.495
If I win, you will continue operating the Dojo.

158
00:11:05.495 --> 00:11:07.295
If you win, Sensei,

159
00:11:07.295 --> 00:11:09.195
I will return the belt to you.

160
00:11:10.695 --> 00:11:13.895
You don't want to compromise, do you?

161
00:11:13.895 --> 00:11:15.495
No.

162
00:11:17.995 --> 00:11:19.595
All right.

163
00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:20.695
Will do.

164
00:11:20.695 --> 00:11:24.395
-Sensei! -Makoto, don't do that!

165
00:11:24.395 --> 00:11:25.895
Please!

166
00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:53.295
What shall we do? I can't believe this is happening.

167
00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:55.195
Hey.

168
00:11:55.195 --> 00:11:57.295
Makoto, please don't!

169
00:11:57.295 --> 00:11:59.695
You're scaring the children, too!

170
00:11:59.695 --> 00:12:00.895
Makoto!

171
00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.995
Shoots!

172
00:12:13.995 --> 00:12:15.395
Sonoko!

173
00:12:15.395 --> 00:12:18.795
Makoto is not the perp.

174
00:12:18.795 --> 00:12:21.295
He's just protecting the real perp.

175
00:12:21.295 --> 00:12:22.595
What?

176
00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:25.395
The one who has the key to the exhibition room is...

177
00:12:25.395 --> 00:12:26.695
Only me.

178
00:12:26.695 --> 00:12:29.595
There is one more place you can enter from.

179
00:12:29.595 --> 00:12:31.095
It's the little window on the wall.

180
00:12:31.095 --> 00:12:34.795
Even children can't go through a window of that size.

181
00:12:34.795 --> 00:12:36.395
The down pipe can be used.

182
00:12:36.395 --> 00:12:39.995
Using that, you can climb up to the small window.

183
00:12:39.995 --> 00:12:43.095
The down pipe is corroded and worn out.

184
00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.795
It's useless.

185
00:12:44.795 --> 00:12:48.795
Only Kyogoku could've taken the belt after all.

186
00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:51.795
If you so insist, why not check him?

187
00:12:56.295 --> 00:12:57.595
It's not here.

188
00:12:57.595 --> 00:12:59.795
Maybe he hid it somewhere.

189
00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:03.495
We were surprised at the sound of Makoto breaking the lock of the Dojo

190
00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:05.395
and came running in here.

191
00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:08.895
So, Makoto had no time to hide the belt.

192
00:13:08.895 --> 00:13:10.295
Sensei.

193
00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:12.595
She's right.

194
00:13:12.595 --> 00:13:15.795
Do you know where the belt is?

195
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.595
Yes.

196
00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:19.095
Where is it?

197
00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:22.595
Hiroki Kadota, Katsuto Kawaguchi,

198
00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:26.795
and although he's not here, Norio Obashi,

199
00:13:26.795 --> 00:13:29.295
those three know where the belt is.

200
00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:31.295
What?

201
00:13:32.495 --> 00:13:35.495
You've been planning it for a while, haven't you?

202
00:13:35.495 --> 00:13:39.895
About taking away Takami Sensei's belt.

203
00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:43.695
Is it true that you guys took it?

204
00:13:43.695 --> 00:13:44.695
Why?

205
00:13:44.695 --> 00:13:46.795
But that's strange.

206
00:13:46.795 --> 00:13:49.995
We were out running with the children.

207
00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:53.695
They were both with everyone right through.

208
00:13:53.695 --> 00:13:56.495
Was the running course the same as usual?

209
00:13:56.495 --> 00:14:00.695
Yeah. There's a park about 5 minutes from here.

210
00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:02.895
We call out the names of the children once there.

211
00:14:02.895 --> 00:14:05.495
And from there, we run alongside the river.

212
00:14:05.495 --> 00:14:08.895
We cross the third bridge, then run on the opposite side,

213
00:14:08.895 --> 00:14:11.395
return to the park, and roll call once more.

214
00:14:11.395 --> 00:14:13.395
Then finally come back here to the Dojo.

215
00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.295
How would you explain this?

216
00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:17.295
Even if you heard the voices,

217
00:14:17.295 --> 00:14:21.195
you didn't check all their faces, did you?

218
00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:22.895
How about it?

219
00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:25.395
No. It's true we didn't check their faces.

220
00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:29.795
The children switched during the first roll call at the park.

221
00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:33.795
That is, Hiroki and Norio Obashi who went home before everyone else.

222
00:14:33.795 --> 00:14:38.695
Norio pretended to be Hiroki and ran with everyone.

223
00:14:38.695 --> 00:14:39.895
What the...

224
00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:42.595
Hiroki who fled alone from the park

225
00:14:42.595 --> 00:14:44.895
came back to the Dojo.

226
00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:48.395
He went quietly in back so we wouldn't see him,

227
00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:49.595
climbed the wall

228
00:14:49.595 --> 00:14:53.095
and took the belt from the exhibition corner through the small window

229
00:14:53.095 --> 00:14:54.695
and went out again.

230
00:14:54.695 --> 00:14:55.795
That's ridiculous!

231
00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:59.895
A child couldn't possibly climb that wall alone without even using a rope.

232
00:14:59.895 --> 00:15:03.695
He can climb.

233
00:15:03.695 --> 00:15:06.395
But it's all worn out already.

234
00:15:06.395 --> 00:15:09.195
What if it's a child who is small and flexible?

235
00:15:09.195 --> 00:15:12.495
Hiroki, is it true?

236
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:14.495
Did you take the belt?

237
00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:21.495
If he puts his body through the small window

238
00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:22.495
and stretches his hand over,

239
00:15:22.495 --> 00:15:25.495
he could somehow manage to reach the belt.

240
00:15:25.495 --> 00:15:27.095
But at that time,

241
00:15:27.095 --> 00:15:29.995
his collar got hooked onto the rim of the window.

242
00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:35.295
As proof of that, on the karate outfit that seems to be Hiroki's...

243
00:15:35.295 --> 00:15:37.295
There is fray.

244
00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:40.695
Hiroki carried his karate outfit to the park

245
00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:43.495
and waited for everyone to come back after running.

246
00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:46.795
But, what about the belt that he took?

247
00:15:46.795 --> 00:15:48.795
There's no place to hide it.

248
00:15:48.795 --> 00:15:51.295
Katsuto Kawaguchi.

249
00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:53.795
Will you take off your belt?

250
00:16:00.495 --> 00:16:02.095
This is...

251
00:16:02.095 --> 00:16:07.595
The switch at the park after running was not only people.

252
00:16:07.595 --> 00:16:10.395
The belts were also switched.

253
00:16:10.395 --> 00:16:15.195
Since Katsuto just got his black belt, he could wear it.

254
00:16:16.395 --> 00:16:17.395
Norio!

255
00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:23.795
Why? Why did you do something like this?

256
00:16:23.795 --> 00:16:27.395
We wanted you to continue running this Dojo, Sensei.

257
00:16:28.695 --> 00:16:32.895
We heard you talking on the phone, Sensei.

258
00:16:32.895 --> 00:16:35.195
You said that you were quitting

259
00:16:35.195 --> 00:16:37.595
because you lost your enthusiasm for karate.

260
00:16:37.595 --> 00:16:41.095
We wanted to continue practicing here more.

261
00:16:41.095 --> 00:16:45.095
We wanted you to teach us more about Karate, Sensei.

262
00:16:45.095 --> 00:16:47.595
Sensei, you were saying on the phone

263
00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:50.195
that you got a hold of that belt that you worked for

264
00:16:50.195 --> 00:16:52.495
and so you have no regrets.

265
00:16:52.495 --> 00:16:54.695
That's why we thought that if the belt went missing,

266
00:16:54.695 --> 00:16:57.795
you would want to do karate again.

267
00:16:57.795 --> 00:17:00.295
You guys...

268
00:17:00.295 --> 00:17:02.395
Don't quit, Sensei!

269
00:17:03.595 --> 00:17:05.795
Please continue the Dojo. Please!

270
00:17:05.795 --> 00:17:07.895
Please...

271
00:17:11.695 --> 00:17:15.795
You understood how the children felt, didn't you, Makoto?

272
00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:17.695
That's why you returned to the Dojo,

273
00:17:17.695 --> 00:17:19.495
realized that the belt was missing

274
00:17:19.495 --> 00:17:22.395
and figured out immediately who did it, too.

275
00:17:22.395 --> 00:17:26.995
Hiroki and the others executed this plan

276
00:17:26.995 --> 00:17:30.195
all because they didn't want Takami Sensei to quit.

277
00:17:30.195 --> 00:17:32.395
They'd been planning this over a long period of time.

278
00:17:32.395 --> 00:17:34.295
Long period of time?

279
00:17:36.195 --> 00:17:37.495
Yes.

280
00:17:37.495 --> 00:17:40.095
In order to climb the wall and get to the small window,

281
00:17:40.095 --> 00:17:44.695
Hiroki needed to flex his stiff body.

282
00:17:44.695 --> 00:17:46.695
That's because Hiroki was the only one

283
00:17:46.695 --> 00:17:48.495
who could climb the half broken drain pipe

284
00:17:48.495 --> 00:17:51.995
and go in through the small window.

285
00:17:53.195 --> 00:17:55.495
Katsuto tried his best to pass the test for 1st dan

286
00:17:55.495 --> 00:17:57.895
so that he could wear the black belt,

287
00:17:57.895 --> 00:17:59.895
because the only one who could wear an adult black belt

288
00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:03.795
was Katsuto who had big built.

289
00:18:03.795 --> 00:18:08.195
And Norio tried his best at running that he wasn't good at

290
00:18:08.195 --> 00:18:10.195
because he had to run in place of Hiroki

291
00:18:10.195 --> 00:18:13.795
and make sure that he wouldn't lag behind.

292
00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:19.795
You guys...

293
00:18:21.495 --> 00:18:25.295
My, my. Are you busy?

294
00:18:25.295 --> 00:18:28.895
Just as I promised, I'd like to have your signature.

295
00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:32.195
Take off your shoes.

296
00:18:32.195 --> 00:18:33.595
What?

297
00:18:33.595 --> 00:18:36.095
This is a sacred Dojo.

298
00:18:36.095 --> 00:18:38.195
Wearing shoes here is prohibited.

299
00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:39.995
Who are you?

300
00:18:39.995 --> 00:18:42.895
It's none of your business. Stay out of this.

301
00:18:44.695 --> 00:18:46.695
Mr. Kajiyoshi.

302
00:18:46.695 --> 00:18:49.095
I'm sorry,

303
00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:52.195
but will you forget about the thing about selling this place?

304
00:18:53.495 --> 00:18:56.795
I seem to have been mistaken.

305
00:18:56.795 --> 00:18:59.995
I thought I had finished doing all I had to do,

306
00:18:59.995 --> 00:19:02.695
but I still have a lot to learn.

307
00:19:02.695 --> 00:19:05.495
I need more training.

308
00:19:05.495 --> 00:19:08.695
These children taught me that.

309
00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:10.595
So for them

310
00:19:10.595 --> 00:19:13.995
as well as for me...

311
00:19:13.995 --> 00:19:16.995
I still need this dojo.

312
00:19:18.095 --> 00:19:19.595
Hooray...

313
00:19:19.595 --> 00:19:21.295
Cut out the joke!

314
00:19:21.295 --> 00:19:24.495
What makes you think I'll say "oh, is that right"

315
00:19:24.495 --> 00:19:26.395
and back down at this point?

316
00:19:28.495 --> 00:19:31.295
You either repay all the money you borrowed right this minute,

317
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.995
or let go of this land.

318
00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:36.195
You've only got one of two options.

319
00:19:50.295 --> 00:19:52.195
What? You wanna fight?

320
00:19:52.195 --> 00:19:54.295
Never mind. Go get him!

321
00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:02.795
Don't get ahead of yourself!

322
00:20:10.995 --> 00:20:15.295
Will you please leave for today?

323
00:20:19.295 --> 00:20:21.495
Win without fighting.

324
00:20:23.295 --> 00:20:25.495
I've still got a long way to go.

325
00:20:26.395 --> 00:20:29.395
Come, let's start practice.

326
00:21:50.695 --> 00:21:55.395
But it sure was great that he got to discuss it over with a lawyer.

327
00:21:55.395 --> 00:21:57.495
The company that Kajiyoshi worked for

328
00:21:57.495 --> 00:21:59.495
was pitch black when investigated.

329
00:21:59.495 --> 00:22:01.295
They were loan sharks.

330
00:22:01.295 --> 00:22:03.195
Police investigation is going to start

331
00:22:03.195 --> 00:22:05.995
so I'm sure he'll be able to work out his debts, too.

332
00:22:06.895 --> 00:22:10.095
Sonoko, thank you very much.

333
00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.595
Thanks to you, we may be able to keep the dojo open.

334
00:22:12.595 --> 00:22:14.495
Not at all.

335
00:22:14.495 --> 00:22:17.195
You were as awesome as ever, Makoto,

336
00:22:17.195 --> 00:22:19.495
that I'm glad I came to watch you.

337
00:22:20.995 --> 00:22:23.395
Sonoko, are you okay?

338
00:22:23.395 --> 00:22:26.295
You seem to have a slight fever.

339
00:22:26.295 --> 00:22:27.495
I'm sorry!

340
00:22:27.495 --> 00:22:29.495
No big deal.

341
00:22:29.495 --> 00:22:31.895
You may have caught a cold again.

342
00:22:31.895 --> 00:22:33.195
Take this.

343
00:22:33.195 --> 00:22:36.395
Thank you, Makoto.

344
00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:44.095
Are you all right? Your face is red.

345
00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:45.995
I'm fine.

346
00:22:45.995 --> 00:22:47.695
I'm perfectly fine.

347
00:22:47.695 --> 00:22:51.195
I'm going to have a load of fun with Makoto from now, you see.

348
00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:52.495
What's the matter?

349
00:22:57.095 --> 00:22:59.195
Hey, don't tell me...

350
00:22:59.195 --> 00:23:00.295
Please, my lady.

351
00:23:00.295 --> 00:23:02.995
Hey, what's this?

352
00:23:02.995 --> 00:23:04.895
Don't tell me it was you?

353
00:23:04.895 --> 00:23:07.795
I'm sorry. I called them.

354
00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:10.795
You shouldn't take colds lightly.

355
00:23:10.795 --> 00:23:12.895
A cold leads to all kinds of illnesses.

356
00:23:12.895 --> 00:23:15.895
So, you've got stay in bed until you're completely well.

357
00:23:17.895 --> 00:23:19.495
Hey, let me go!

358
00:23:19.495 --> 00:23:23.295
I'm going to go with Makoto to USJ from now!

359
00:23:27.995 --> 00:23:29.195
They left.

360
00:23:29.195 --> 00:23:30.995
No, let me down!

361
00:23:30.995 --> 00:23:34.995
I'm going to USJ!

362
00:23:37.495 --> 00:23:39.095
After this, I'm sure that Sonoko will

363
00:23:39.095 --> 00:23:42.195
end up appreciating what Kyogoku did.

364
00:23:42.195 --> 00:23:45.695
Because after this, there was to be a gigantic case

365
00:23:45.695 --> 00:23:47.495
that would even get the TV stations involved

366
00:23:47.495 --> 00:23:49.795
that we would be encountering.

367
00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:55.995
"Next Episode"

368
00:23:57.295 --> 00:23:58.895
It came from downstairs!

369
00:24:02.095 --> 00:24:03.895
This is...

370
00:24:03.895 --> 00:24:05.895
There's blood on it too,

371
00:24:05.895 --> 00:24:09.095
so I guess it's safe to say that it was used to commit the crime.

372
00:24:09.095 --> 00:24:12.495
Officer Chiba, where did you find this?

373
00:24:12.495 --> 00:24:15.695
Well, it was in the trash bin of the condo.

374
00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:16.895
What?

375
00:24:19.095 --> 00:24:24.295
Next Conan, "The Socialite Couple's Secret"

376
00:24:24.938 --> 00:24:27.438
Next Conan's Hint:

377
00:24:27.438 --> 00:24:29.338
"Closet"

378
00:24:29.338 --> 00:24:30.838
Let me down!

379
00:24:30.838 --> 00:24:32.338
You don't like being with me?

380
00:24:32.338 --> 00:24:34.138
Yes, I do.
