1
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.540
Wimbledon in the rain.

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.440
The roof has closed over the Center Court.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.540
The game will resume.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.940
The score is 6-6 and it is a tie-break.

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.540
Serve begins with Baur that has won the 1st set.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.740
The queen appears again.

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.340
Struggle with all your might

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.340
in order to keep your mother alive as long as possible.

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.340
If I lose this tie-break,

10
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.140
mother will...

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.240
Come on, Minerva!

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.240
Don't give up the fight!

13
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.740
Even though she has a championship point!

14
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.440
Hang in there, win the match!

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.440
Hang in?

16
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.640
Grass Court Queen.

17
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.340
Can you do it?

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.840
Okay!

19
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.740
The moment you decide what you want to do in life.

20
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.940
You must be true to yourself.

21
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.140
An exchange rally, of life at stake.

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.440
The unexpected two and the two whose excitement heightens.

23
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.040
He sees through the one and only truth.

24
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

25
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140
His name is Detective Conan!

26
00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:04.807
An eerie coded note was what was waiting for us in London.

27
00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:07.307
It was the forewarning of a killing by Hades Sabara,

28
00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:11.407
a vicious criminal on the run.

29
00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:13.707
We deciphered the code and figured out

30
00:03:13.707 --> 00:03:16.907
that Hades was after the life of contestant Minerva Grass,

31
00:03:16.907 --> 00:03:19.107
who was competing in the Ladies' Singles Finals

32
00:03:19.107 --> 00:03:21.407
at the Wimbledon Center.

33
00:03:23.107 --> 00:03:26.007
But thanks to the Braille messages

34
00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:27.107
that Minerva sent by landing the balls

35
00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:28.907
that she served at certain points on the court,

36
00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:31.907
we further found out that Hades was not after Minerva,

37
00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:34.007
but rather after her mother Juno

38
00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:36.307
who was in the stands cheering for her.

39
00:03:38.507 --> 00:03:40.507
Hades will push the switch to set off the bomb

40
00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:43.407
as soon as the game ends.

41
00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:45.907
We've got to find him before he does so!

42
00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:56.307
"Sherlock Holmes' Revelation (0 is Start)"

43
00:03:56.807 --> 00:03:58.107
Play!

44
00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:04.207
Just as would be expected of an apprentice of Holmes.

45
00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:06.407
You've thought it out, haven't you?

46
00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:09.707
But it sure is a high risk demand.

47
00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:13.907
After all my opponent's a powerful server

48
00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:16.207
who ranks number 2 in the world

49
00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:19.207
that possesses serves that exceed 120 MPH...

50
00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:21.007
Demeter Baur!

51
00:04:26.807 --> 00:04:28.307
Yes!

52
00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:33.307
1-0, Ms. Bauer!

53
00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:38.507
But, if that's going to help nab the culprit...

54
00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:41.307
If I can save mother...

55
00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:43.207
I'll show you

56
00:04:43.207 --> 00:04:46.507
what this Grass Court Queen Minerva Grass...

57
00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:49.207
can really do!

58
00:04:51.907 --> 00:04:53.407
1 all!

59
00:04:54.007 --> 00:04:57.207
Amazing! She returned a service Ace.

60
00:04:57.207 --> 00:05:01.607
But how do you settle a tie-break, anyway?

61
00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:06.207
The one scores 7 points first will win this set.

62
00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:08.107
But, if the score is 6-6,

63
00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:11.807
the game continues until there is a difference of 2 points.

64
00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:15.807
So, if the Grass Court Queen is lead by two points...

65
00:05:15.807 --> 00:05:18.407
My sister who lost the 1st set will lose,

66
00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:20.407
and the game ends.

67
00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:24.107
If that happens, the guy called Hades

68
00:05:24.107 --> 00:05:28.107
will set off the bomb that mother is carrying, right?

69
00:05:34.707 --> 00:05:36.507
Out!

70
00:05:36.507 --> 00:05:38.707
7-6, Ms. Bauer!

71
00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:42.007
Hey, she's being lead by a score of 7-6, which means...

72
00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:44.807
The opponent has the championship point!

73
00:05:44.807 --> 00:05:48.507
If the opponent scores next, Minerva will lose.

74
00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:49.807
Sis...

75
00:05:53.607 --> 00:05:57.807
So, you're at the end of your rope, Grass Court Queen.

76
00:05:57.807 --> 00:05:59.807
As soon as the game ends,

77
00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:04.407
I'm pushing the switch and blowing your mother up.

78
00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:08.007
And, as I wrote in the memo that was inserted into your wristband,

79
00:06:08.007 --> 00:06:11.307
I'll give you the image of that moment

80
00:06:11.307 --> 00:06:14.807
when your mother blows up to pieces.

81
00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:21.407
You, who lost miserably at last year's All French Open

82
00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:24.807
leaving my mother to die...

83
00:06:24.807 --> 00:06:27.707
Then, a month after that, on the funeral day of mother,

84
00:06:27.707 --> 00:06:29.507
you won an overwhelming victory,

85
00:06:29.507 --> 00:06:32.807
and raised the trophy high and proud in the air.

86
00:06:32.807 --> 00:06:34.907
In order to make you taste

87
00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:37.207
the anger and sadness I felt back then too!

88
00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:41.107
So, little apprentice of Holmes.

89
00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:43.407
I've given the championship point

90
00:06:43.407 --> 00:06:45.107
to the opponent just as you wanted me, too.

91
00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.407
I found mother with the high lob ball I just shot.

92
00:06:56.007 --> 00:07:01.107
So, now you do your part and find him, all right? The culprit.

93
00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:03.007
And live up to your name as the apprentice of Holmes!

94
00:07:08.007 --> 00:07:10.507
First the center, slightly weakly...

95
00:07:10.507 --> 00:07:12.107
She'll shoot back with forehand.

96
00:07:12.107 --> 00:07:14.607
She'll return the ball to my back side.

97
00:07:14.607 --> 00:07:17.807
I'll slice return with a strong backhand slice.

98
00:07:17.807 --> 00:07:19.907
At the caliber you're playing today, you can easily...

99
00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:21.607
return the ball, can't you?

100
00:07:28.007 --> 00:07:29.807
What a fantastic rally.

101
00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:31.907
It's been going on for over 10 minutes already!

102
00:07:31.907 --> 00:07:33.607
Hang in there, Minerva!

103
00:07:35.207 --> 00:07:36.407
Frame shot!

104
00:07:36.407 --> 00:07:39.007
It's big! Out!

105
00:07:39.007 --> 00:07:41.707
I'll volley then, before it outs!

106
00:07:43.507 --> 00:07:45.307
Shoots, it's shallow!

107
00:07:45.307 --> 00:07:47.107
It'll come out at the net!

108
00:07:52.607 --> 00:07:54.607
It's a chance ball for the opponent!

109
00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.007
Finish!

110
00:07:59.207 --> 00:08:01.007
Back court left side.

111
00:08:01.007 --> 00:08:02.507
Just on line!

112
00:08:04.407 --> 00:08:05.807
It's in!

113
00:08:08.207 --> 00:08:10.807
Okay. Now, we're starting over!

114
00:08:10.807 --> 00:08:14.207
But what a long rally.

115
00:08:14.207 --> 00:08:16.707
I think they've been at it over 30 times already?

116
00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:18.207
Don't tell me that Minerva

117
00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:20.707
is deliberately continuing to rally?

118
00:08:20.707 --> 00:08:23.907
She returned the ball that was about to out with a volley, too.

119
00:08:23.907 --> 00:08:27.607
But, what is she continuing for?

120
00:08:30.307 --> 00:08:33.207
So, Hades, where are you?

121
00:08:33.207 --> 00:08:34.907
Where are you?

122
00:08:41.707 --> 00:08:44.707
Show yourself, Hades!

123
00:08:48.907 --> 00:08:50.707
Cord ball!

124
00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.007
Reach!

125
00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:56.407
Please!

126
00:09:05.807 --> 00:09:06.907
No!

127
00:09:06.907 --> 00:09:08.707
She couldn't reach it.

128
00:09:08.707 --> 00:09:11.207
Then, don't tell me that...

129
00:09:11.207 --> 00:09:13.807
Sis lost...

130
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:19.207
Game set, and match won by...

131
00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:21.007
Challenge!

132
00:09:23.407 --> 00:09:25.707
What's that? Challenge?

133
00:09:25.707 --> 00:09:27.707
The challenge system.

134
00:09:27.707 --> 00:09:30.507
If discontented with the referee's judgment of where the ball dropped,

135
00:09:30.507 --> 00:09:32.007
you can reconfirm the place

136
00:09:32.007 --> 00:09:35.307
where the ball fell, 3 times to a set!

137
00:09:35.307 --> 00:09:37.807
This done by using Hawk Eye, that is,

138
00:09:37.807 --> 00:09:41.207
10 devices that replay the recorded data by CG images!

139
00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:44.707
So, I'm sure that Minerva's going

140
00:09:44.707 --> 00:09:47.607
to insist that the ball just now was out!

141
00:09:48.207 --> 00:09:51.507
A poor loser queen.

142
00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:54.807
Begging for life before the guillotine?

143
00:09:54.807 --> 00:09:57.307
But the judgment's not going to turn over.

144
00:09:57.307 --> 00:09:59.407
And right after the cheers of joy,

145
00:09:59.407 --> 00:10:03.007
the silent interval during the sound of the blast and screams

146
00:10:03.007 --> 00:10:06.807
will be a requiem in tribute to your mother.

147
00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:18.607
It's out!

148
00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:20.607
Her challenge succeeded!

149
00:10:20.607 --> 00:10:23.507
Which means it's a tie of 7-7!

150
00:10:26.607 --> 00:10:28.707
I somehow managed to get by.

151
00:10:28.707 --> 00:10:30.707
But I can't go on rallying anymore.

152
00:10:31.807 --> 00:10:33.307
But...

153
00:10:38.407 --> 00:10:42.107
It seems from the look on your face, that you found him.

154
00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.654
She did it!

155
00:10:56.654 --> 00:10:57.954
She caught up!

156
00:10:57.954 --> 00:11:00.554
Next, it's the final set.

157
00:11:00.554 --> 00:11:02.654
No matter which side wins, if the game ends,

158
00:11:02.654 --> 00:11:04.454
Hades will set the bomb off.

159
00:11:04.454 --> 00:11:07.154
No need to worry! I just got mail from Holmes' apprentice

160
00:11:07.154 --> 00:11:09.954
that he found the culprit.

161
00:11:09.954 --> 00:11:12.254
So, I'm sure he's off to nab the culprit already.

162
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.054
-Huh? -Huh?

163
00:11:14.054 --> 00:11:16.654
Please let me in!

164
00:11:16.654 --> 00:11:18.754
Like I've been telling you,

165
00:11:18.754 --> 00:11:21.654
this is the wrong place for your ticket.

166
00:11:21.654 --> 00:11:24.754
I must see someone before the game's over!

167
00:11:24.754 --> 00:11:27.754
I will come back right away! Please!

168
00:11:27.754 --> 00:11:30.254
You might need this.

169
00:11:30.254 --> 00:11:33.354
When this boy ran into me,

170
00:11:33.354 --> 00:11:36.754
we happened to exchange our tickets.

171
00:11:36.754 --> 00:11:39.454
Well, you can enter here, then.

172
00:11:41.454 --> 00:11:44.554
I'm happy for you, sonny.

173
00:11:44.554 --> 00:11:47.854
Hey, come on, hurry on and go!

174
00:11:47.854 --> 00:11:49.454
The dialect of Tosa?

175
00:11:49.454 --> 00:11:52.154
After all, you finally found the culprit.

176
00:11:52.154 --> 00:11:53.754
Hurry on

177
00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:55.954
and nab him!

178
00:11:55.954 --> 00:11:57.854
Shin-chan.

179
00:11:57.854 --> 00:11:59.554
Mom?

180
00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:02.254
Okay, I got you!

181
00:12:03.654 --> 00:12:08.154
But I wonder how Shin-chan found the culprit?

182
00:12:08.154 --> 00:12:10.554
By the movement of the faces of the spectators!

183
00:12:10.554 --> 00:12:12.854
The people who are here to watch the match move,

184
00:12:12.854 --> 00:12:15.854
their heads to the right and left watching the ball.

185
00:12:15.854 --> 00:12:18.354
If the ball goes to the left, they move this way.

186
00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:21.454
If it's struck back to the right, then this way.

187
00:12:21.454 --> 00:12:22.854
If you're sitting in a seat

188
00:12:22.854 --> 00:12:25.054
where you're watching the players from the side, it's for sure.

189
00:12:25.054 --> 00:12:28.654
But, if there's a spectator whose not moving at all,

190
00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:30.654
he would stand out, wouldn't he?

191
00:12:30.654 --> 00:12:33.754
If it's during the championship point, the more so.

192
00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:36.554
In other words, that person would be the culprit

193
00:12:36.554 --> 00:12:39.154
who is planning to blow up the mother of the Grass Court Queen,

194
00:12:39.154 --> 00:12:44.554
in addition to recording the moment onto a video camera!

195
00:12:44.554 --> 00:12:47.854
He's got to have his target locked inside the frame of his camera

196
00:12:47.854 --> 00:12:49.154
before the end of the game,

197
00:12:49.154 --> 00:12:52.154
otherwise his view would be blocked

198
00:12:52.154 --> 00:12:54.654
by the people who stand up in excitement.

199
00:12:54.654 --> 00:12:58.754
I see! That's why Shin-chan was telling her

200
00:12:58.754 --> 00:13:02.254
to hang in there, even if her opponent scored the championship point!

201
00:13:02.254 --> 00:13:03.954
He wanted to buy time

202
00:13:03.954 --> 00:13:06.554
while they continued the rally to look for the culprit.

203
00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:09.054
The Grass Court Queen sure is amazing, though!

204
00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:11.954
To do as she was told without asking questions.

205
00:13:11.954 --> 00:13:16.254
Rather, it was a method that she used to use a lot,

206
00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:19.054
so she probably understood right on the bat.

207
00:13:19.054 --> 00:13:23.854
The lob ball that she displays during her matches

208
00:13:23.854 --> 00:13:27.154
is what she does to find her mother.

209
00:13:27.154 --> 00:13:29.254
Because if she knows that the ball is going to out,

210
00:13:29.254 --> 00:13:32.054
she can take her eyes off the ball.

211
00:13:32.054 --> 00:13:33.354
From among the spectators

212
00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.654
that move their heads up and down following the ball,

213
00:13:35.654 --> 00:13:39.254
she searches for her visually disabled mother that doesn't do so.

214
00:13:39.254 --> 00:13:41.854
The question is whether Shin-chan

215
00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:44.654
will be able to nab the culprit that he found.

216
00:13:44.654 --> 00:13:46.954
No problem.

217
00:13:46.954 --> 00:13:50.054
He's probably going to sneak up behind the culprit

218
00:13:50.054 --> 00:13:51.654
and shoot him with the wristwatch

219
00:13:51.654 --> 00:13:54.154
tranquilizer gun that he usually uses.

220
00:13:54.154 --> 00:13:56.954
Okay, I got you!

221
00:13:56.954 --> 00:13:59.254
You're Holmes' apprentice!

222
00:13:59.254 --> 00:14:01.554
You made Minerva rise!

223
00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:02.954
What?

224
00:14:02.954 --> 00:14:06.254
But, you know, that was against manners.

225
00:14:06.254 --> 00:14:07.654
Never do it!

226
00:14:07.654 --> 00:14:10.354
Don't tell me he figured out where I am?

227
00:14:13.354 --> 00:14:16.654
That's Holmes' apprentice!

228
00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:19.754
Then, the guy who looks flustered is...

229
00:14:19.754 --> 00:14:22.154
I've got no choice then.

230
00:14:22.154 --> 00:14:24.654
I'll set the bomb off

231
00:14:24.654 --> 00:14:28.654
and flee out of here amidst the commotion.

232
00:14:36.154 --> 00:14:38.654
Ridiculous! From that distance?

233
00:14:38.654 --> 00:14:41.954
Just as expected of the Grass Court Queen.

234
00:14:41.954 --> 00:14:44.354
Nice centering to in front of the goal!

235
00:14:55.154 --> 00:14:56.654
Security guards?

236
00:14:56.654 --> 00:14:59.254
The ball just happened to come...

237
00:15:08.354 --> 00:15:09.654
Thank you.

238
00:15:17.054 --> 00:15:18.554
I see.

239
00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:22.254
You called the police, and had them waiting.

240
00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:26.854
Yeah. I asked a friend at Scotland Yard to help me

241
00:15:26.854 --> 00:15:28.454
since I deciphered the code

242
00:15:28.454 --> 00:15:31.354
and found out where the culprit's target was.

243
00:15:31.354 --> 00:15:33.254
We really had a hard time backing you up

244
00:15:33.254 --> 00:15:37.654
in all kinds of ways to make solving the code easier for you.

245
00:15:37.654 --> 00:15:40.254
Which means that the lady in sunglasses

246
00:15:40.254 --> 00:15:43.854
that was coming around Ran and the others was you, Mom?

247
00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:47.454
I thought it was the bomb lady, Hades friend.

248
00:15:47.454 --> 00:15:49.454
As for her, they seemed to have found out

249
00:15:49.454 --> 00:15:52.354
that she really died when she blew herself up the other day!

250
00:15:52.354 --> 00:15:54.854
They confirmed the DNA at the site!

251
00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:57.354
So, that bomb inserted stuffed animal

252
00:15:57.354 --> 00:15:59.454
is what she left behind!

253
00:15:59.454 --> 00:16:01.354
If you knew as much as you did,

254
00:16:01.354 --> 00:16:03.754
why didn't go out and nab him yourself?

255
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.954
The fact is, I'm the one that solved

256
00:16:06.954 --> 00:16:09.054
the 2nd bombing of the hospital.

257
00:16:09.054 --> 00:16:10.954
I couldn't get near the culprit

258
00:16:10.954 --> 00:16:13.054
because he was on the alert for me.

259
00:16:13.054 --> 00:16:15.054
Well, don't get so angry.

260
00:16:15.054 --> 00:16:18.354
Your way of looking for the culprit was just perfect.

261
00:16:18.354 --> 00:16:19.854
Besides, we got tickets

262
00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:21.754
that would enable you to go in all directions

263
00:16:21.754 --> 00:16:25.254
no matter where the culprit was.

264
00:16:25.254 --> 00:16:28.554
But, if you were following the case,

265
00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:29.854
you could've at least contacted me.

266
00:16:29.854 --> 00:16:34.154
No. We only came to London because she asked us to.

267
00:16:35.754 --> 00:16:37.354
She?

268
00:16:38.254 --> 00:16:41.654
Game set and match won by...

269
00:16:41.654 --> 00:16:43.354
Miss Grass!

270
00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.054
All right!

271
00:16:47.054 --> 00:16:49.554
Well? This feeling...

272
00:16:49.554 --> 00:16:51.554
Is it about time you recalled something?

273
00:16:51.554 --> 00:16:55.554
Minerva asked you to quit being a coach,

274
00:16:55.554 --> 00:16:57.854
not only because she wanted you to quit tennis

275
00:16:57.854 --> 00:17:01.554
and become her husband.

276
00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:05.054
She wanted you to remember how it felt to feel like this again.

277
00:17:05.054 --> 00:17:08.954
Although you quit being a tennis player for her,

278
00:17:08.954 --> 00:17:11.254
you should be true to your feelings, Ales.

279
00:17:11.254 --> 00:17:13.954
You feel a rush inside you too, don't you?

280
00:17:16.154 --> 00:17:19.254
She won! Minerva won!

281
00:17:19.254 --> 00:17:22.154
And since there was no explosion...

282
00:17:22.154 --> 00:17:24.354
They caught the culprit!

283
00:17:24.354 --> 00:17:28.954
Yep! I just got a text mail from Holmes' apprentice!

284
00:17:28.954 --> 00:17:30.854
Apollo!

285
00:17:30.854 --> 00:17:32.954
Are you going to be seeing your sister afterwards?

286
00:17:32.954 --> 00:17:36.454
I've got something that I've got to tell her.

287
00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:40.754
But she may be busy with press conferences and the like...

288
00:17:40.754 --> 00:17:41.954
Why don't you mail her?

289
00:17:41.954 --> 00:17:43.754
I'll give you her mail address!

290
00:17:43.754 --> 00:17:45.854
Yep! Thank you!

291
00:17:45.854 --> 00:17:49.354
Hey. Hold it, there!

292
00:17:49.354 --> 00:17:51.654
Isn't that the lady called Diana?

293
00:17:51.654 --> 00:17:55.154
No way! That's the royal box?

294
00:17:55.154 --> 00:17:57.654
Don't tell me she's a member of the royal family?

295
00:17:57.654 --> 00:18:00.854
Or she could be a noble or a friend of a noble.

296
00:18:00.854 --> 00:18:02.354
Then, don't tell me that

297
00:18:02.354 --> 00:18:05.354
the man I threw over my shoulder at the restaurant

298
00:18:05.354 --> 00:18:07.454
could've been a prince or something.

299
00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:11.154
Should I call and ask her?

300
00:18:11.154 --> 00:18:14.754
No, don't. Because I don't want to know.

301
00:18:16.854 --> 00:18:18.854
What was the key to your victory?

302
00:18:18.854 --> 00:18:21.654
What lead to my victory?

303
00:18:21.654 --> 00:18:25.654
Well, I suppose I owe it to Holmes' apprentice?

304
00:18:27.354 --> 00:18:30.754
But I'm smiling the way I am

305
00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:32.554
thanks to the girl from Japan

306
00:18:32.554 --> 00:18:34.754
who sent me a text mail a while ago.

307
00:18:38.354 --> 00:18:42.754
"Heathrow Airport"

308
00:18:43.354 --> 00:18:44.954
It was really a surprise

309
00:18:44.954 --> 00:18:47.954
that you came all the way to see us off.

310
00:18:47.954 --> 00:18:49.754
Is it really alright?

311
00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.754
I'm sure that you're really busy today, and yet...

312
00:18:51.754 --> 00:18:54.354
Yes. I did have a lot of things to do,

313
00:18:54.354 --> 00:18:56.354
but I dropped them all.

314
00:18:56.354 --> 00:19:00.954
I wanted to thank you for that mail you sent me, no matter what.

315
00:19:00.954 --> 00:19:03.454
What's this about a mail?

316
00:19:03.454 --> 00:19:06.254
Your words really echoed through my heart.

317
00:19:07.854 --> 00:19:11.854
It may be true that in tennis love is 0,

318
00:19:11.854 --> 00:19:13.354
but 0 is...

319
00:19:15.454 --> 00:19:18.954
Don't say it! Not here!

320
00:19:18.954 --> 00:19:20.754
Because those words

321
00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:23.254
are what originally came from him.

322
00:19:23.254 --> 00:19:24.754
Him?

323
00:19:24.754 --> 00:19:26.154
You mean the "him" that caused you mental anguish

324
00:19:26.154 --> 00:19:29.654
in front of the statue of Holmes?

325
00:19:29.654 --> 00:19:31.954
Yes. Well, sort of...

326
00:19:33.154 --> 00:19:35.454
So stupid.

327
00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:37.054
How stupid of me.

328
00:19:37.054 --> 00:19:39.754
Getting carried away all by myself.

329
00:19:40.754 --> 00:19:43.254
It's just like she said.

330
00:19:43.254 --> 00:19:45.054
Love is 0.

331
00:19:45.054 --> 00:19:46.454
No matter how many zeros you accumulate,

332
00:19:46.454 --> 00:19:48.554
the result is miserable defeat.

333
00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.954
Just what're you talking about?

334
00:19:50.954 --> 00:19:52.854
Don't you get it?

335
00:19:52.854 --> 00:19:55.254
You're a detective, aren't you?

336
00:19:55.254 --> 00:19:56.354
If you're a detective,

337
00:19:56.354 --> 00:19:58.854
why don't you deduce how I'm feeling inside?

338
00:19:58.854 --> 00:20:01.654
Idiot!

339
00:20:01.654 --> 00:20:03.154
Hey, hold it!

340
00:20:03.154 --> 00:20:04.254
Ran!

341
00:20:05.854 --> 00:20:07.254
I'm telling you, wait!

342
00:20:10.654 --> 00:20:12.154
Ran!

343
00:20:16.154 --> 00:20:17.354
Hey!

344
00:20:17.354 --> 00:20:19.654
No, let me go!

345
00:20:19.654 --> 00:20:22.254
You're such a nuisance!

346
00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:23.554
What?

347
00:20:23.554 --> 00:20:26.754
You're a nuisance of a case!

348
00:20:26.754 --> 00:20:29.354
And even if I were Holmes,

349
00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.054
I would probably not be able to solve

350
00:20:31.054 --> 00:20:33.254
what's going on in your heart!

351
00:20:33.254 --> 00:20:35.854
It's impossible to solve what's going on

352
00:20:35.854 --> 00:20:38.754
in the heart of a girl you like!

353
00:20:52.654 --> 00:20:56.054
Love is 0? What a laugh!

354
00:20:56.054 --> 00:20:58.254
You go tell that grass queen

355
00:20:58.254 --> 00:21:00.454
that 0 is start of everything!

356
00:21:00.454 --> 00:21:03.354
If you don't start from 0, nothing will start

357
00:21:03.354 --> 00:21:05.854
and you can't achieve anything.

358
00:21:05.854 --> 00:21:07.454
Make sure you tell her that!

359
00:21:08.854 --> 00:21:10.354
I see.

360
00:21:10.354 --> 00:21:12.454
Your boyfriend's pretty cool.

361
00:21:12.454 --> 00:21:15.054
So, please relay these words to Ales too.

362
00:21:15.054 --> 00:21:19.154
I already mailed Ales and got an answer from him.

363
00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:20.654
He said that he can't see me for a while

364
00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:22.254
because he has to go to training.

365
00:21:22.254 --> 00:21:23.554
Huh?

366
00:21:23.554 --> 00:21:26.954
That's training for a player somewhere, right?

367
00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:29.554
After all, he said he was going to do training for some player.

368
00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:32.354
No, it's for his own training!

369
00:21:32.354 --> 00:21:36.154
I think he's planning to make his come-back as a player.

370
00:21:36.154 --> 00:21:38.054
In order to marry a Queen,

371
00:21:38.054 --> 00:21:41.154
I myself, got become a king.

372
00:21:41.154 --> 00:21:43.354
And because my body's not as sharp as it used to be,

373
00:21:43.354 --> 00:21:47.454
as you said, I've got to start from zero.

374
00:21:47.454 --> 00:21:50.954
Rather, start from love?

375
00:23:13.754 --> 00:23:17.454
But it's too bad that Holmes' apprentice is not here.

376
00:23:17.454 --> 00:23:20.454
I wanted to thank him, too.

377
00:23:20.454 --> 00:23:22.954
It seems that he had to return to Japan earlier than us

378
00:23:22.954 --> 00:23:24.854
because he had something urgent come up.

379
00:23:24.854 --> 00:23:26.554
Since he got hold of a ticket,

380
00:23:26.554 --> 00:23:29.054
he left a step ahead of us together with Doc.

381
00:23:29.054 --> 00:23:31.154
Please give him my regards then!

382
00:23:31.154 --> 00:23:32.654
I will!

383
00:23:32.654 --> 00:23:34.954
You've got to really be grateful to Ai!

384
00:23:34.954 --> 00:23:36.354
Yeah.

385
00:23:36.354 --> 00:23:38.654
But...

386
00:23:38.654 --> 00:23:42.654
That girl named Ai Haibara asked me

387
00:23:42.654 --> 00:23:44.654
to bring you over a spare drug

388
00:23:44.654 --> 00:23:46.754
because she was sure that you would drink up

389
00:23:46.754 --> 00:23:49.054
the two that you brought along with you for Ran.

390
00:23:50.154 --> 00:23:53.354
She should give me about a hundred of them while she's at it!

391
00:23:53.354 --> 00:23:55.454
You never learn.

392
00:23:58.254 --> 00:23:59.254
"Next Episode"

393
00:23:59.254 --> 00:24:02.254
Okay, let's hide!

394
00:24:02.254 --> 00:24:05.154
Oh boy. I end up being IT after all.

395
00:24:05.154 --> 00:24:08.054
There's somebody in this building!

396
00:24:08.054 --> 00:24:10.854
252! There's somebody in need of rescue!

397
00:24:10.854 --> 00:24:12.654
We're tearing down the building,

398
00:24:12.654 --> 00:24:15.654
so we're pounding on the wall and checking how strong it is!

399
00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:16.854
I guess they're people disguised as workers

400
00:24:16.854 --> 00:24:19.854
who'll be tearing down the building, that have someone confined here...

401
00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:22.654
In other words, the two are villains.

402
00:24:22.654 --> 00:24:28.254
Next Conan, "Emergency 252 (Part 1)"

403
00:24:29.023 --> 00:24:31.523
Next Conan's Hint:

404
00:24:31.523 --> 00:24:33.423
"Convenience store box lunch"

405
00:24:33.423 --> 00:24:36.023
We had two emergencies to attend to in London.

406
00:24:36.023 --> 00:24:38.123
-Likewise, with the next episode. -Really?
