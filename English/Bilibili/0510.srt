1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,540
Waiting won't do.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,740
Take a step towards the future.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,440
And start the countdown to deduction and love.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,940
Today's episode is made up of two parts.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,740
You need to deduce twice as much as usual.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,240
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,840
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,040
No case is left unsolved with Detective Conan.

9
00:01:56,926 --> 00:02:00,226
A new member of the Black Organization has made his move.

10
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:02,526
His code name is Bourbon.

11
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:05,326
Is he after Ai?

12
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,926
The members of the Youth Detective Squad

13
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,726
are asked by Kaito Sugiura

14
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:11,926
to check on one of the residents of the apartment

15
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:15,526
who acts suspiciously every night.

16
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:18,226
But when we got there, we found that the apartment has gone to ashes.

17
00:02:19,426 --> 00:02:21,426
In Kaito's burnt diary, the three residents of the apartment

18
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:22,926
are referred to as their nicknames,

19
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:27,226
Red Person, White Person and Yellow Person.

20
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:28,926
It says that the Yellow Person

21
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,226
is the one who was acting suspicious.

22
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:32,826
The person who set fire to the apartment

23
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:35,026
is most likely the Yellow Person as well.

24
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:41,326
I, Kuroshiro,

25
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:45,326
will now reveal the truth as clear as black and white.

26
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:47,726
As well as which one among them

27
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:51,226
is the yellow arsonist.

28
00:02:53,826 --> 00:02:57,326
"Conan VS Double Code Mystery"

29
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:01,926
Just what is this Yellow Arsonist all about?

30
00:03:01,926 --> 00:03:05,226
I heard you saying something about a diary too.

31
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:09,026
Well. It's the diary of Kaito, the son of the landlord of this apartment

32
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:11,026
that was burned down by fire.

33
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:13,526
It is written in the diary

34
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,826
that the Yellow Person suddenly came back in the middle of night

35
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:19,226
and had an argument with his father.

36
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:22,126
"Ryuhei Hosoi (25), Carpenter" -All three of you were out

37
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:23,226
"Subaru Okiya (27), Postgraduate Student" -on the night of the fire,

38
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,426
and came back in the morning.

39
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,026
"Ginya Makabe (29), Freelancer" -Right?

40
00:03:26,026 --> 00:03:29,126
That means someone's lying!

41
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,926
That liar, the Yellow Guy,

42
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:34,426
is the one who set fire to the apartment!

43
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:37,826
It's true that I know the landlord's son.

44
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:41,226
Was anyone of us called the Yellow Person by him?

45
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:42,526
I wonder, too.

46
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:46,126
It's just words from a child, so don't worry about it.

47
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:52,326
You shouldn't tell anyone about the Yellow Person.

48
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:54,326
What? Why not?

49
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:56,726
If they find out that the Yellow Person is the arsonist,

50
00:03:56,726 --> 00:04:01,126
they might all claim that they're not the one, right?

51
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:03,926
-I get it now. -I see.

52
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:06,826
No. That's nothing to worry about.

53
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:11,326
Because I already know which one among the three

54
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:13,326
is the yellow arsonist.

55
00:04:13,326 --> 00:04:14,426
What?

56
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:16,626
Hey, kid. Are you serious?

57
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:17,726
Yes.

58
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:19,826
Ayumi, can you lend me that diary?

59
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,826
Okay.

60
00:04:20,826 --> 00:04:22,626
Red Person and White Person

61
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:25,326
are mentioned in Kaito's diary too.

62
00:04:25,326 --> 00:04:28,526
So if we figure out who the Red and White Person are,

63
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:31,526
we'll be able to find out who the Yellow Person is.

64
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:34,226
So there's a Red Person and a White Person too?

65
00:04:34,226 --> 00:04:37,626
Yes. It's written in the diary.

66
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:40,026
"The weather's been bad since this morning.

67
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,026
I've got to go to school soon,

68
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,526
but I'm sure the Red Person can sleep in today."

69
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:49,226
This hints that the Red Person does something every morning,

70
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:51,126
but since it was raining that morning,

71
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,626
he didn't have to do it, right?

72
00:04:54,626 --> 00:04:56,626
What do you think that is?

73
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:58,526
He didn't have to hang the laundry.

74
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:01,226
Field day is cancelled if it rains!

75
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:03,626
Adults don't have field days.

76
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,326
It's sprinkling water.

77
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,226
Watering the flowers.

78
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:08,626
Oh, I see!

79
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:09,926
Yeah!

80
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,526
That's why the Red Person is the one

81
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:14,926
who said that he waters the plants of the apartment every day.

82
00:05:15,926 --> 00:05:17,926
Mr. Okiya.

83
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:22,226
But kid, why did he call the man the Red Person?

84
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:26,726
Well, you found a lot of toy cars in Kaito's room, didn't you?

85
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,026
I'm sure that Kaito loves cars.

86
00:05:30,026 --> 00:05:31,726
When you think of a red car,

87
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:34,126
the first thing that comes to mind is...

88
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,426
A fire engine...

89
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:41,826
I see. Kaito saw the man watering the plants with a hose,

90
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,826
then connected him to a fire engine,

91
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,826
and named him the Red Person.

92
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:50,626
So is the White Person named in connection with a white car?

93
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:53,926
But there are so many white cars around.

94
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:55,326
It's an ambulance.

95
00:05:55,326 --> 00:05:57,726
In Japan, the colour of the vehicle

96
00:05:57,726 --> 00:06:00,326
is determined by the Road Trucking Vehicle Law.

97
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,726
I see...

98
00:06:01,726 --> 00:06:05,026
But which one of them is the ambulance?

99
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:07,526
What does an ambulance do?

100
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:09,626
Carry wounded people from place to place.

101
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:12,326
The paramedics give treatment in the car too.

102
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,526
Oh, I get it!

103
00:06:14,526 --> 00:06:16,626
Band aid!

104
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,126
The White Person frequently gets hurt,

105
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:22,026
so he always carries band aids around.

106
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:24,126
So, it's Mr. Hosoi.

107
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:25,926
Come to think of it, he had also written in the diary

108
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:28,426
that when he came back from school and fell at the front door,

109
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:31,626
he was glad that the White Person happened to be going out.

110
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,726
Yeah. I gave the kid a band aid

111
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:37,626
because his knee was bleeding.

112
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:40,726
Things like that happened several times before,

113
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:43,426
but who'd ever think that he'd call a black guy like me the White Person.

114
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:46,126
Now, for the remaining Yellow Person.

115
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:48,126
A taxi's yellow.

116
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:51,126
But there are white and green taxis too.

117
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:54,026
It's the vehicle used for construction.

118
00:06:54,026 --> 00:06:55,726
Yes. In other words,

119
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:58,826
the man who has soil in his fingernails.

120
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:03,026
Mr. Makabe, you're the Yellow Person.

121
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:05,026
Just what are you talking about?

122
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:06,626
There's soil in my fingernails

123
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,626
because I ran around the mountains when I did the survival game.

124
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,326
If I remember correctly, you said that the colour of the paint bullet

125
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:16,626
wouldn't come off, so your clothes were ruined?

126
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:17,626
Yeah.

127
00:07:17,626 --> 00:07:21,226
In the survival games carried out in Japan,

128
00:07:21,226 --> 00:07:24,126
air soft guns that fire BB bullets are used.

129
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,526
The game that uses paint bullets

130
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:29,526
is a different game called paintball.

131
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:31,826
They... they're not that different.

132
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,726
But paint bullets contain water-based ink,

133
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:37,426
so the paint washes off easily.

134
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,126
Well...

135
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,726
Besides, you said you like the colour navy green

136
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,226
that's found on camouflage outfits,

137
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:48,726
but the type of green colour that's usually used on those outfits

138
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:50,726
is called olive drab.

139
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:53,526
Hey. Have you really ever played

140
00:07:53,526 --> 00:07:55,426
whatever the game that you mentioned just now?

141
00:07:55,426 --> 00:07:58,026
To tell the truth, I'm still a beginner.

142
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,226
I guess you can check the place

143
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,626
-where the yard of the apartment was. -What?

144
00:08:02,626 --> 00:08:05,926
Putting together Kaito's words that the Yellow Person

145
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:07,926
was acting suspiciously every night,

146
00:08:07,926 --> 00:08:09,926
and the fact that Mr. Makabe is going as far

147
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:14,026
as to lie about the soil between his fingernails.

148
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,426
It seems that Mr. Makabe was digging something out

149
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:18,726
night after night in secret.

150
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:20,726
So I'm sure that it's buried.

151
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:25,426
Something very important that he doesn't want anybody to see.

152
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:27,926
Perhaps it's the money

153
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:32,026
that you made from day-trading, am I right?

154
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:33,526
What is it exactly?

155
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:40,926
There are two briefcases.

156
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,626
The money I made by day-trading.

157
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:46,026
I think it was about 2 billion yen.

158
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,726
That's a lot of cash!

159
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:50,426
Why did you bury it in the yard?

160
00:08:50,426 --> 00:08:53,226
I didn't want to get taxed on it.

161
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:55,226
But last night,

162
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:57,126
when I came back from the movies,

163
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:59,826
the landlord constantly asked me about it.

164
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,026
I was annoyed, so I pushed him away.

165
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:04,726
He fell down the stairs

166
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:08,626
and he didn't move at all, so I got scared.

167
00:09:08,626 --> 00:09:11,126
I decided that if I burned everything down,

168
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:13,326
I could reset and start over.

169
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,026
Reset, you said?

170
00:09:15,026 --> 00:09:16,226
Do you understand what you did?

171
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:17,826
It's not like you can just

172
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:21,426
turn off the switch of a game because you lost!

173
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:25,026
An apartment that existed for years and all the memories that surrounded it

174
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:27,726
were burnt to ashes in just one night.

175
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:30,626
It's not something you can reset.

176
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:34,726
Your game of life still has a long way to go!

177
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:38,026
I'll see that you pay for what you did, so ready yourself for it!

178
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:39,726
-That includes making amends to Kaito... -Yes, all right.

179
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:41,626
and his father who got affected in the case.

180
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:45,126
Inspector! It's the hospital!

181
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,426
The landlord's surgery is successful,

182
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:50,126
and Kaito seems to have regained consciousness too.

183
00:09:50,126 --> 00:09:51,926
Oh, I see.

184
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:53,626
Thank god...

185
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:59,726
Well, I guess you're going to rebuild the apartment with the money you made

186
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:02,126
from playing money game.

187
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:03,126
Yes, sir.

188
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,526
Let's go.

189
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,526
But there's still one mystery left.

190
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:12,726
Yeah. Why is Conan's nickname Black and White?

191
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:15,126
What kind of car is black and white?

192
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:18,726
I'm sure that he referred to us, the police.

193
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,826
The police car.

194
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:23,426
It's just the perfect nickname for a boy

195
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:25,226
who puts the police to shame.

196
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:26,926
See you, kid.

197
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,026
Sure.

198
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:33,526
Shall we all go visit Kaito at the hospital now, then?

199
00:10:33,526 --> 00:10:34,626
Okay!

200
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:38,326
Let's have Doc take us there because it's some distance away.

201
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:39,626
Doc?

202
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:43,526
You mean you have a doctor you're acquainted with?

203
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,026
Yes, we do!

204
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:48,526
All he does is make useless games every time though.

205
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,426
Oh. I'd sure like to meet him.

206
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:53,426
Okay, we'll take you there!

207
00:10:53,426 --> 00:10:55,126
Thanks.

208
00:10:57,626 --> 00:10:59,926
A post-graduate in the engineering department.

209
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,826
So, you eventually plan on getting a Ph.D

210
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:03,926
and become my business rival?

211
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:05,526
No. Of course not.

212
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:08,326
You sure live in a big house.

213
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,226
Are you living here with her, just the two of you?

214
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:12,026
-Yeah. -Then,

215
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,326
it wouldn't be a problem for you

216
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:15,126
having another person live here, would it?

217
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,026
Huh?

218
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:20,126
Well, the apartment I used to live in got burned down.

219
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,226
So if it's okay with you, would you let me stay here

220
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:25,726
until I find a new place to stay?

221
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,126
Of course, I'll help you with your research

222
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:30,826
or assist you in anything during my spare time.

223
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:33,426
Yeah. I don't mind

224
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,826
as long as she agrees.

225
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:39,826
Would you like to stay in Shinichi's house then?

226
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,726
Shinichi's house?

227
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:44,626
Yes. No one's living there now.

228
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,826
Look. It's the house next door.

229
00:11:47,826 --> 00:11:50,226
I've got the key to the house.

230
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:53,626
I see. It sure is a fine house, but is it really okay?

231
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:56,026
-Yes! -Wait a minute.

232
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,726
What's on your mind?

233
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:00,526
You don't even know him that well.

234
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:03,226
What are you going to do if he finds out about our secret?

235
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:04,826
Don't worry.

236
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,126
There are no bad people who are fans of Holmes.

237
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,326
What?

238
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:14,326
Here, this is the house key.

239
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:15,826
Are you sure you don't have to

240
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:18,626
ask for permission from the person called Shinichi?

241
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:21,326
Yes! I'll e-mail him later.

242
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:24,026
Thank you. You've been a great help.

243
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:27,826
But make sure you watch the house nicely.

244
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:30,026
Yes. Of course.

245
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:50,979
Gosh. Arsons, abductions, and hit and runs.

246
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:55,079
It's amazing how many different incidents happen one after the other every day.

247
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,279
-How can you be so easygoing? -Huh?

248
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,479
That man that's free-loading at your house.

249
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,579
Is it really okay to trust him so easily?

250
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:06,879
You mean the man called Subaru Okiya?

251
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,779
Don't worry about him!

252
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:10,379
I sure hope so.

253
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:12,179
I assure you.

254
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,979
-Conan! -Huh?

255
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,779
Look out!

256
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,179
Sorry, sorry.

257
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:20,679
Oh, boy.

258
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,179
A paper plane?

259
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,379
What's with its design?

260
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,779
Is it the Japanese flag?

261
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,879
Oh, don't you know?

262
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,479
There's an airplane guy that everyone in town is talking about.

263
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,979
During the last two days,

264
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:41,579
a total of almost 100 paper planes were found all over the city.

265
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:45,779
It seems that the same pattern was drawn on those airplanes too.

266
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,679
Come to think of it, I saw it on my cell phone news just a while ago too.

267
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,879
Well, I guess it's just some sort of prank,

268
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,979
because they seem to be flown only during the night.

269
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:58,379
It could be the doings of an adult who's stressed out at work.

270
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,779
Talking about stress, there's going to be a re-run

271
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,879
of a programme called "Stress Induced Murder".

272
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,079
Oh. You mean the Detective Saimonji Series by Kaori Shinmei.

273
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
I wish I could watch it again.

274
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,979
But we won't be able to make it.

275
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:16,179
The re-run is on today?

276
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,179
I couldn't watch the program when it was aired

277
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:21,779
because Pops was watching Yoko Okino on TV.

278
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,479
Wait a second.

279
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,179
It's exam day today,

280
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:28,479
so Ran will only have class in the morning.

281
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,779
I guess I'll ask her to record the program for me.

282
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,079
"Mouri Detective Agency" -Huh?

283
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,379
Ran's not home yet.

284
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,079
She said she'd be late today.

285
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,579
Huh, how come?

286
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,779
She said that she was going to go clean up the detective kid's house.

287
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,279
That busybody is doing unnecessary stuff again.

288
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,579
I wonder if I could ask you to do me a favour, Pops?

289
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,179
What? I'm not giving you allowance.

290
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:55,979
No, it's nothing like that.

291
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,479
Wait a second.

292
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:00,479
Oh, no! Over there right now...

293
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,779
If it's not that, what is it?

294
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,279
-Hey, Conan! -It's been reported...

295
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,879
-Really. What's with him? -That the kidnapper jumped off the roof

296
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,679
of that building while on the run.

297
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,979
The whereabout of the president who has been abducted remains unknown.

298
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,279
But how surprising.

299
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:20,579
The klutz is going to study in the States.

300
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:24,579
I mean, he came back to school and all. It was so sudden.

301
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,379
I wonder how Eisuke's doing.

302
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:30,379
-Speaking of which... -Huh?

303
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,779
How's Shinichi doing?

304
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,279
Is he not coming back yet?

305
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,079
No.

306
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,679
Waiting for Shinichi who's still not coming back,

307
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,279
Ran skitters off to go and clean his place again today.

308
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,679
I'm not skittering off anywhere.

309
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,179
But it seems like it's become a custom to come

310
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,479
and clean Shinichi's place once a month, don't you think?

311
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,079
Well, not really.

312
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,479
I told you about the delicious sandwich shop, didn't I?

313
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:02,279
That was really good, but...

314
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,979
I don't see why you have to go out of your way to take care

315
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:06,979
of that deduction freak who rarely even contacts you.

316
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:10,779
Come on. He seems to be going through a lot too.

317
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,779
Wait.

318
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,079
What's the matter?

319
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:20,479
Hey, isn't it kind of cool in here?

320
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,579
Like the air conditioner's on or something.

321
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,679
Now that you mentioned it, I think it is.

322
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,879
Shinichi?

323
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,879
Shinichi's back.

324
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,979
Shinichi!

325
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,479
Where are you, Shinichi?

326
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:41,179
You're here, aren't you? Answer me!

327
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:43,079
Shinichi!

328
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,579
There he is. In the restroom.

329
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:52,379
I tell you. If you were coming home,

330
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,379
why didn't you tell me?

331
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,579
Who are you?

332
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:04,179
Well...

333
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:06,579
Don't tell me that he's a thief?

334
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,779
Sonoko, stand back.

335
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,179
I mean...

336
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:19,179
Serves you right!

337
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,779
Ran, hurry and call the police.

338
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,779
Ran?

339
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,779
He didn't resist.

340
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,079
Who is he?

341
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,379
What? A university student who's been staying here from last week?

342
00:17:35,379 --> 00:17:37,179
Is that true, Conan?

343
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:40,079
Yes. Didn't I tell you about it the other day?

344
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,879
The apartment that my friend's father owned

345
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,779
was burned down in a fire.

346
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:45,479
He used to be one of the residents there.

347
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:47,579
His name is Mr. Subaru Okiya.

348
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:49,879
Does Shinichi know about it?

349
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:53,679
Yes. I sent him an e-mail about it and he wrote back to me.

350
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,579
He said he doesn't mind letting him stay,

351
00:17:55,579 --> 00:18:00,479
but he doesn't want you to talk too much about Shinichi in front of him.

352
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,079
Huh? Why not?

353
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,579
Because he doesn't want the man to become too interested

354
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:06,979
and start snooping around the house.

355
00:18:06,979 --> 00:18:08,579
I see.

356
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:11,379
-Okay, everyone. Take your seats. -The teacher's here.

357
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,479
Bye.

358
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,379
Wait.

359
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,979
So that's the story.

360
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:21,379
-We're very sorry! -We're very sorry!

361
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,479
I'm sorry to have struck a kick at you without asking you for details first.

362
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,979
That's right, Ran.

363
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,879
Someone this handsome could never be a thief.

364
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,079
What?

365
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,479
You even said, "Serves you right" just now.

366
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:39,779
Well. I'm also at fault for not explaining things right away.

367
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,279
By the way, Mr. Okiya,

368
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,479
which university do you go to?

369
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:46,279
I belong to the department of engineering at Toto University.

370
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,379
He's not only handsome, but is an elite as well.

371
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:51,279
May I take a picture of you with my cell phone?

372
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,379
And I'd like to know your email address too.

373
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,879
Sure.

374
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,979
I'm going to tell Mr. Kyogyoku about it.

375
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:00,279
I'll just take a picture then.

376
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,379
Before that, may I go and buy something?

377
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:06,379
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

378
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:09,379
Then I'll go get you something as a token of my apology.

379
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:11,779
Okay, then.

380
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,579
Could you get me what you were eating a while ago?

381
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:16,679
At Welcome Burger.

382
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,379
Did we mention stopping over at Welcome Burger?

383
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:22,979
No. It's something really simple.

384
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,579
You, the girl with brown hair caught my attention.

385
00:19:25,579 --> 00:19:28,379
When you thought I was a thief,

386
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:31,279
you blew your top at me and called me names.

387
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,479
But once you found out that I'm not a thief,

388
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,379
you pulled away from me

389
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:38,879
and hid behind this girl with long hair.

390
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,779
Normally, it should be the other way around.

391
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:46,379
I take it that you took a liking to me as the opposite sex,

392
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:50,479
and didn't want me to smell your bad breath.

393
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,979
In other words, it made me think that you might have eaten

394
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:57,679
the garlic sandwich that newly came out.

395
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,679
Wow!

396
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,379
But there are other food with garlic too.

397
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:05,379
I could tell from the way she held her cell phone just now.

398
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:06,379
-Huh? -Huh?

399
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,679
She deliberately used her ring finger when operating the cell phone.

400
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,479
There's probably some oil

401
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:15,079
left on her thumb, index finger and middle finger

402
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:17,179
after she ate the French fries.

403
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,079
Besides, there's a little bit of salt left

404
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,779
around your mouth too, long-haired girl.

405
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:24,779
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,779
Excuse us while we go to the restroom.

407
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,779
Who is he? He seems really smart.

408
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:35,079
Yes,

409
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:39,179
but maybe I've met him somewhere before.

410
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,379
He sort of looks familiar.

411
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:46,379
He must have reminded you of your hubby, Shinichi.

412
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,179
I mean, Subaru is just like a detective too.

413
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,479
No, they don't resemble each other.

414
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,579
Besides, Shinichi's not my hubby.

415
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:55,579
Well, as I see it,

416
00:20:55,579 --> 00:21:00,079
Subaru is a cut above Shinichi when it comes to being a detective.

417
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,479
Do you think so?

418
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:05,779
But it's not that Shinichi's not good either.

419
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,579
Would you like to see them have a match then?

420
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:09,679
Subaru against Shinichi.

421
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,579
We're going to study the names of flowers today!

422
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,379
A mail? It's from Ran.

423
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,479
"You'll be able to solve the case

424
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,579
that's being talked about right now, won't you, Shinichi?"

425
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:26,979
I've got images of the actual thing I'm talking about,

426
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,979
so I'll send them to you.

427
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,779
What's this?

428
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:35,179
Isn't it the paper plane that Genta was flying this morning?

429
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:38,879
But the pattern's a bit different from Genta's.

430
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,679
There's another image.

431
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,379
Hey. Could this be...

432
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:51,579
So this was found in the yard of your house.

433
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,879
That's why I want to know

434
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:58,279
who the prankster is and why he flew paper planes like this.

435
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:01,579
I see.

436
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,679
This is an interesting code.

437
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,779
Don't tell me you've already figured it out?

438
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:10,179
It's here.

439
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,779
The mail from Shinichi. That was fast.

440
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,679
It's most likely that this paper plane is an SOS signal.

441
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,779
What? SOS signal?

442
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,479
Are you saying that someone's asking for help?

443
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,579
Right.

444
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:28,579
Moreover, the situation requires immediate action.

445
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,079
If you have an image of another paper plane...

446
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,879
The image of another paper plane...

447
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,479
I would like you to show it to me right now.

448
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,279
"Next Episode" -Oh, don't you know?

449
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,979
A high school detective by the name of Shin...

450
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:11,979
Kinichi.

451
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,179
I couldn't help but stop myself.

452
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,679
I got the feeling that I shouldn't talk about Shinichi to him.

453
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,079
I felt this certain uneasiness.

454
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,679
Someone's life may be in danger!

455
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,679
If it were you, you would never wait at times like this, would you, Shinichi?

456
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:29,779
Tell me what you would do at times like this, Shinichi!

457
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:30,979
Ran!

458
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,379
Next Conan,

459
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:36,679
"Deduction Match! Shinichi vs. Subaru Okiya"

460
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:54,679
Next Conan's Hint:

461
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:56,679
"Squid"

462
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,579
Pudding is better than octopus.

463
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:01,479
-Why? -I can't tell you.
