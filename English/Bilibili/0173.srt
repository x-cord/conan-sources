1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,540
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,340
and the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,340
Deductions take all shapes and styles in every case to be solved.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,940
A very strange message.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,840
The trick is solved and the killer is determined.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,340
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,140
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

8
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,440
His name is Detective Conan!

9
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:57,299
Like always, keeping Sonoko company in her search for men,

10
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,399
we all come to the skating rink at Tropical Land.

11
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,599
And we meet five members of the Clay shooting club and get acquainted.

12
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,199
While we're all waiting for the fireworks to go up,

13
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,399
Sonoko's scream is heard from the toilet.

14
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,499
I run over to there, what awaited me was...

15
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,999
the dead body of Chizu Itami,

16
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:27,499
who is shot to death in the chest.

17
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:31,399
Since the letter "S" written in blood is left near the corpse,

18
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,499
Pops deduces that the killer is Izumi Sano

19
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:36,699
who has the letter "S" stands for her last name, but...

20
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,499
I don't think so!

21
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:40,899
Why?

22
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,699
I think you can tell just by looking,

23
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,699
the victim has been shot in the chest

24
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,499
and has died on the spot.

25
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:51,599
Therefore, it's impossible for her to write a message on the wall

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,899
after she was shot.

27
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,899
Moreover, the letters "KIX" were registered

28
00:02:57,899 --> 00:03:00,899
in the cellular phone of the victim.

29
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,599
KIX?

30
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,099
Wait a second.

31
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,499
I have seen this from somewhere before.

32
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,299
"Dying Message Revives (Part 2)"

33
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,499
KIX?

34
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,299
I'm sure I have seen it somewhere.

35
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,799
Officer! May I at least change shoes?

36
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,699
We came straight from the rink.

37
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,599
If you let an officer escort you, that would be no problem.

38
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,699
But please make sure you come right back.

39
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:46,899
Hey, Officer Chiba, will you please escort them?

40
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:47,899
Yes, sir!

41
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,599
Come on, don't cry, Yoriko.

42
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,199
"Yoriko Komatsu (30), Izumi Sano (28)" -But Chizu...

43
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,999
"Kunitomo Orita (29), Yasuharu Misawa (29)"

44
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,699
You know, Yoriko?

45
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,899
I'm sure the officers will find the killer!

46
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,199
Stupid.

47
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,899
What?

48
00:04:14,899 --> 00:04:17,399
That cellular phone that you have

49
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,399
is the same as the one the lady that was killed had!

50
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,799
Don't tell me this kid...

51
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,599
You're suspecting me, right?

52
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,799
-What? -No!

53
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,699
I just want to have a look at your cellular phone.

54
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:33,699
May I?

55
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,099
Here.

56
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,599
Come on, Conan.

57
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,099
You shouldn't be fooling around with it!

58
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,399
The sound of the fireworks you heard,

59
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,499
was it really the sound of fireworks?

60
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:47,299
Yes, of course!

61
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:52,299
A whistle, and then an explosion.

62
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:58,499
What? Did you change your cellular phone, Sonoko?

63
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,799
Yes, well sort of...

64
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,799
"Locker Room"

65
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:06,599
I've more or less figured out the trick,

66
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:11,999
but anybody could've committed the murder.

67
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,999
In order to figure out who did it...

68
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,499
Yoriko, pull yourself together.

69
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,899
I just happened to remember that incident.

70
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,699
Yoriko.

71
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,499
I envy you, Izumi.

72
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:31,699
You weren't at Clay shooting when that accident happened.

73
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,199
I was sick in bed on that day, remember?

74
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,599
I wish you wouldn't call that lucky.

75
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,899
I'm quitting Clay shooting as of today.

76
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:43,699
I can't help feeling that there is a curse.

77
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:45,699
Besides, I don't want to die because of the gun accidentally going off,

78
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,799
like what happened to Narita.

79
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,899
Hey, enough of all the small talk.

80
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,899
Let's start back.

81
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:56,399
Yes.

82
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,399
I get it, so that's what it was!

83
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:02,799
That's why he was always left out!

84
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:07,199
But, I've still got no proof.

85
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,499
I couldn't possibly corner the killer with that message alone.

86
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,999
Two black dots...

87
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,499
Don't tell me that...

88
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,099
What's wrong?

89
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,299
Hey...

90
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,099
Conan?

91
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:35,599
It can't be.

92
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,599
Don't tell me that...

93
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:43,199
Don't tell me that...

94
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,599
Hey!

95
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,099
There it is!

96
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,099
This is it!

97
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,999
I've found it! I've found conclusive evidence!

98
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:05,399
With this, I can corner the killer!

99
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,599
Just what are you doing here?

100
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,899
Gosh! Forever using the scene of the crime as a playground.

101
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,699
Inspector Megure!

102
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,699
This coat thought to be that of the killer was found in the trash can

103
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,999
that is located between the skating rink and the toilet.

104
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:34,599
Okay, verify it with Sonoko who witnessed the killer!

105
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,599
Yes, sir! Okay!

106
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,499
Excuse me!

107
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,399
Everyone, wait!

108
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,499
Where are you all going?

109
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,899
We're going to return the skates.

110
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,799
You can question us after that, can't you?

111
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,999
We've all got alibis that we were watching the fireworks

112
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:54,099
at the time of the crime.

113
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,499
Yes, the alibis of everyone

114
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,799
except Orita who's not interested in fireworks.

115
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:03,699
I'm sure glad I watched the fireworks.

116
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:05,499
If I didn't watch it as usual,

117
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,499
I would've been suspected too.

118
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,299
Izumi!

119
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,999
It's true, isn't it?

120
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:16,999
Okay, I'll put Pops to sleep with the anesthesia gun first.

121
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:20,499
Let's not play games anymore.

122
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,499
Let's get things straight,

123
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,199
since the answer is already obvious.

124
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:29,599
No way, Pops...

125
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,799
Have you figured out who the killer is?

126
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:35,599
Yes, this time for sure.

127
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
The one who waited for Mr. Chizu in the toilet

128
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,399
and killed her with the shotgun is...

129
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,899
It's...

130
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,599
Mr. Kunitomo Orita!

131
00:08:48,499 --> 00:08:51,099
It's you!

132
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:53,099
What? No way!

133
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:58,699
Hey... Hold it! I...

134
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,299
You ran into the wrong guy.

135
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:04,299
You may have tried to leaving a dying message

136
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,299
written in blood near the victim,

137
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:10,199
but you couldn't fool me!

138
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,599
You were completely deceived, weren't you?

139
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:17,799
That letter was written by you after you killed her!

140
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,399
A person who was shot in the chest and died on the spot

141
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,899
couldn't possibly have written it.

142
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:27,199
And, the comment that Ms. Izumi Sano made just now,

143
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:30,099
brought everything to light.

144
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:32,999
That the killer had calculated on framing Ms. Sano up as the killer

145
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:36,799
by committing the crime when the fireworks go up

146
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,299
so that Ms. Sano, who usually does not watch the performance

147
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:43,599
ends up without an alibi.

148
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,899
The letter "S" from her name was used

149
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,699
as well as her gun for this reason!

150
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:55,499
However, she unfortunately decides to watch the fireworks.

151
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:57,899
So, you end up being the one without an alibi.

152
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,799
Your scheme collapsed, all in vain...

153
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,899
As a result,

154
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,899
the killer lead us to believe that Mr. Orita was the killer

155
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,299
and successfully was removed from the the list of suspects.

156
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,399
This indeed was what the killer was after.

157
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,099
Then, who on earth is the killer?

158
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:30,199
The one who killed Mr. Chizu Itami is,

159
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,999
leaving Mr. Orita aside,

160
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,899
one of the members of the Clay shooting club

161
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,899
is you!

162
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:46,088
The killer is, leaving Mr. Orita aside,

163
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:48,488
one of the members of the Clay shooting club

164
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:50,088
is you!

165
00:10:50,088 --> 00:10:52,188
Izumi Sano!

166
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,788
Izumi?

167
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:03,188
Yes, you used your own gun

168
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:08,388
and left that letter written with blood in order to mislead us.

169
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:10,988
A killer would never leave his own shotgun

170
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:14,388
or an initial pointing to him at the scene of the crime.

171
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:18,488
You took advantage of this psychology and set a trap!

172
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:21,988
You moved the mouth of the gun from her mouth down to her chest

173
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:26,088
because you wanted the letter written in blood to look real.

174
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:28,088
A person who is shot in the head

175
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,588
would never be able to write on the wall.

176
00:11:31,588 --> 00:11:33,888
What are you talking about?

177
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:37,688
I was watching the fireworks with Ran from the very beginning.

178
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:40,688
If the murder was committed when the fireworks went up,

179
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:42,788
I would've been impossible for me to carry it out!

180
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:45,188
That is, if the murder was really committed

181
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:48,788
when the fireworks went up.

182
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,688
Will you cut it out?

183
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,688
Don't you remember what Sonoko said?

184
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:54,188
That when the fireworks went up,

185
00:11:54,188 --> 00:11:56,488
the killer was still in the toilet!

186
00:11:56,488 --> 00:12:01,488
No! The sound that Sonoko heard was not the sound of the fireworks,

187
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,188
but rather the sound of a shotgun being fired!

188
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:06,288
Don't be ridiculous! There's no way

189
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:09,288
a person can mistake the sound of a shotgun for a fireworks...

190
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:19,788
What do you think? Did that sound like fireworks?

191
00:12:19,788 --> 00:12:23,788
Yes. But how did you do it?

192
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:26,488
This, with this!

193
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,988
A five yen coin?

194
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:33,488
She puts it between her lips and whistles.

195
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:35,888
The sound gets loud and hoarse,

196
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:40,088
and sounds like that of fireworks!

197
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:46,588
It did kind of sound something like that.

198
00:12:46,588 --> 00:12:49,288
Right, Pops?

199
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:53,088
If only the shotgun were used, it wouldn't sound like fireworks.

200
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:55,088
But, if one is expecting the sound of fireworks,

201
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:59,388
and the time of the show beginning was approaching,

202
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:01,988
it would be deceived under the circumstances back then.

203
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:03,688
As proof,

204
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:09,488
Sonoko mentioned that only one burst of fireworks went up then.

205
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,188
However, the fireworks actually started

206
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:15,188
with three successive shots of red, blue and yellow.

207
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:18,988
That's right, isn't it, Sonoko?

208
00:13:21,288 --> 00:13:23,188
It was lucky that Sonoko coincidentally

209
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:25,488
happened to be in front of the toilet.

210
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:29,088
But it seems there were two or three other people there too.

211
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:33,588
This is the only toilet you can use wearing skates.

212
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:37,888
It is predictable that with the cleaning sign hung on the door,

213
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:39,788
one or two people will wait.

214
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:44,788
In other words, Ms. Sano promised to meet Ms. Chizu in the toilet.

215
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:47,788
She drives people away by hanging the cleaning sign at the entrance,

216
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:50,388
then she locks the entrance door.

217
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:53,688
She holds the shotgun that she had taken out of the locker,

218
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:56,988
and head for the toilet where Ms. Chizu was waiting.

219
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:58,888
Then, you pointed the gun at her

220
00:13:58,888 --> 00:14:02,488
and wait until a minute before the fireworks were about to be set off,

221
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:06,588
made the sound with the five yen coin, and fired the gun.

222
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:09,688
After that, you wrote the letter "S" with

223
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:14,388
and rushed back to the rink before the real fireworks went up

224
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:19,388
in order to frame Mr. Orita who wouldn't have an alibi

225
00:14:19,388 --> 00:14:21,988
because he was not interested in fireworks.

226
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:24,588
Hey, is that true, Izumi?

227
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,188
Izumi?

228
00:14:28,188 --> 00:14:29,488
I guess so.

229
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:32,488
If I do so, it's true I could've committed the murder.

230
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,688
But, how can you say it was me?

231
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:38,488
The other three could've used the same trick too!

232
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,788
Izumi!

233
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:42,188
I don't know who on earth you are,

234
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:45,088
but will you cut out all your stupid nonsense?

235
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:48,788
KIX.

236
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:49,988
What?

237
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:53,488
Do you know what this means?

238
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:57,788
Yes, the letters that Chizu randomly input in her cellular phone.

239
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,288
No, she didn't input them randomly.

240
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:05,388
She probably input these letters in her cellular phone

241
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:09,088
while you were blocking her mouth with the gun.

242
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:11,688
Then she kept pressing the arrow button

243
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:14,088
to send out her message!

244
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:17,788
She hoped that we would eventually press the re-dial button

245
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:21,188
and find out what she did.

246
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,488
I see!

247
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:28,488
That's why the row for phone numbers were filled with "#" symbol!

248
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:32,188
Pressing on the arrow button displays the "#" symbol.

249
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:36,588
Hey, which means that the letters on the display of the cellular phone

250
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:41,288
are the real dying message?

251
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,088
So what?

252
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:46,488
Is KIX supposed to be my name or something?

253
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,788
I heard that Ms. Chizu said that

254
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:55,688
Mr. Orita is always left out of your group.

255
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,688
What are you trying to get at?

256
00:15:57,688 --> 00:16:00,088
The name of the victim is Ms. Itami.

257
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:03,288
The two who are behind are Mr. Komatsu and Ms. Misawa.

258
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:06,688
Your name is Izumi Sano.

259
00:16:06,688 --> 00:16:09,188
You still don't get it?

260
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:11,688
Would putting it this way help you then?

261
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:16,788
The name of your friend who died of an accident 6 months ago

262
00:16:16,788 --> 00:16:19,988
was Mr. Narita?

263
00:16:19,988 --> 00:16:20,988
Wait a second.

264
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,688
I get it! Airport!

265
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:28,788
All your names are names of where airports are located!

266
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,788
Is there an airport in Sano City, though?

267
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:37,788
True. Besides, I can't see how it is connected to KIX.

268
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:44,588
Yes, KIX is the three-letter-code

269
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:47,988
for the Kansai International Airport!

270
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:50,088
It refers to the airport

271
00:16:50,088 --> 00:16:53,388
that is located in Izumi Sano City in Osaka.

272
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,888
Do you understand now, Ms. Izumi?

273
00:16:56,888 --> 00:17:02,288
But that could be a message that the killer used to frame me!

274
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,488
If I show you this,

275
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:07,488
it may convince you.

276
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:10,888
A strange blood stain the was on the floor

277
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,488
near the victim's left toe.

278
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:14,488
What?

279
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:15,488
Blood stain?

280
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:23,788
This is...

281
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:28,288
That is the trace of the blade of the skates

282
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:31,188
that was left behind that Ms. Sano touched.

283
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:32,888
After she finished writing the letter in blood,

284
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:37,188
she still hasn't realised that the same blood stain

285
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:40,088
was left on the corridor that she fled along.

286
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:45,488
Ms. Chizu's blood is still left on the blade of her own skates.

287
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:00,488
Izumi.

288
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:05,888
I see, the name of the location of an airport.

289
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:09,188
Just as would be expected of a Ms. Richie Rich

290
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,888
who is still living off her parents and traveling around.

291
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:15,188
Then you did kill Chizu after all, Izumi.

292
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:18,488
But... but why?

293
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,888
Narita.

294
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:22,088
What? Narita?

295
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:25,488
Yes, I avenged Narita's death by killing Chizu

296
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:26,788
who lead him to commit suicide.

297
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:28,388
Suicide?

298
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:32,788
But wasn't that supposed be an accident?

299
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:37,788
Narita was brushed off by Chizu that day.

300
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:42,188
And he pulled the trigger himself.

301
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,088
And, it was mistakenly concluded that he accidentally died

302
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,988
while he was checking his gun.

303
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:51,488
I told him repeatedly to forget her, and yet...

304
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:55,088
But why kill Chizu because of something like that?

305
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,088
If he just committed suicide because he was brushed off,

306
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:59,288
I wouldn't have done this!

307
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,088
I went over board

308
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:04,688
because I found out that somebody was two-timing!

309
00:19:06,088 --> 00:19:07,788
Two-timing?

310
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:11,788
Yes. That day, I was sick in bed.

311
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:14,488
I got a call from Narita.

312
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,988
He said he's finished. That his best friend had betrayed him.

313
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:20,088
That Orita was going out with Chizu.

314
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:22,488
He sounded like he was choking in tears.

315
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:26,388
What? But wasn't Orita going out with you, Izumi, back then?

316
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:30,188
Right! This guy knew how Narita felt about Chizu,

317
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:34,388
and yet he had the nerve to two-timing Chizu and me, snickering at us.

318
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:36,288
That's not true.

319
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:40,388
It's a lie that she always uses to get herself out of hot water!

320
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,688
Then, why didn't you tell Narita that over the phone that day?

321
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:46,788
He said he asked you,

322
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:49,788
but you were aloof and didn't lend him an ear.

323
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,088
Yes, I know it sounds wretched,

324
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:55,788
but his words didn't reach me.

325
00:19:55,788 --> 00:20:00,488
Because I was concerned about you being sick in bed that day.

326
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:05,488
Maybe it would've been better for me

327
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:08,788
to have been shot by you.

328
00:20:13,488 --> 00:20:16,488
We'll hear the rest of your story at the station.

329
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:23,088
Hey.

330
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,088
Can I trust in you?

331
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,288
No matter how long it takes

332
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,788
and how far apart we are.

333
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:32,188
Yes, don't worry.

334
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:36,388
I'm very vengeful and persistent.

335
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:38,388
Thank you.

336
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,288
Hey.

337
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,388
Can I trust you?

338
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,388
No matter how long it takes

339
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:26,388
and how far apart we are.

340
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:31,388
What is this?

341
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:34,188
A young girl acting like an old lady.

342
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,688
Will you be quiet? You don't have the slightest idea how I feel!

343
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,188
Oh, your phone is ringing.

344
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:43,188
Yes, hello?

345
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:46,488
"Seattle International Karate Championship" -I won! I won, Sonoko!

346
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:49,488
I've won the championship of the Winter Karate Tournament!

347
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:52,488
There sure are unimaginably strong fighters in the world...

348
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:53,688
You idiot!

349
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,288
Idiot...

350
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:57,588
Why didn't you call me sooner?

351
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:59,788
I sent you my phone number two months ago!

352
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:01,388
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:01,388 --> 00:23:04,088
I didn't want to call you and have nothing to say.

354
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:05,088
You...

355
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:08,488
Sonoko, I hear that the cold is going around in Japan,

356
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:12,388
so please don't go out wearing short skirts, okay?

357
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:16,388
I'm not! I'm wearing something really long today too.

358
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:17,788
Just as I thought!

359
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:21,688
Sonoko seems to have bought another cellular phone just for Mr. Kyogoku.

360
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:22,988
I guess so.

361
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:25,688
A cellular phone just for two.

362
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:28,188
How nice...

363
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:32,188
"Mouri Detective Agency" -A few days later...

364
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:34,488
"Receiver: Ran Mouri, Sender: Shinichi Kudo"

365
00:23:34,488 --> 00:23:36,488
I sent Ran a cellular phone

366
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:39,788
as a token of my appreciation for the sweater.

367
00:23:39,788 --> 00:23:42,488
At first, she seemed to be puzzled.

368
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:48,788
But she seemed happy at the same time,

369
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:50,288
so I guess I did the right thing.

370
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:02,488
"Next Episode"

371
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:14,188
Three people turned themselves in saying they committed the murder.

372
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:16,388
Accomplices?

373
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,788
There is only one victim

374
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:20,488
and yet there are three people saying they killed him!

375
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:23,088
Very Interesting!

376
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,588
Next Conan,

377
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,509
"The Man Who Was Killed Four Times"

378
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:31,306
Next Conan's Hint:

379
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,306
"Hard headed"
