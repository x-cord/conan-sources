1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.310
We came to a rehearsal for a live of Rokumichi Hado,

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.210
who was going to release a song called "ASACA",

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.010
that he made 17 years ago as a new song.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.110
But...

5
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.310
Even heaven is watching the labyrinths of the world.

6
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.710
Full throttle reasoning skills penetrate all mysteries.

7
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.510
In the shadow of the case happening on stage

8
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.710
lurk Amuro, Okiya and Vermouth!

9
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.510
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.810
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.110
His name is Detective Conan!

12
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:54.751
"The Traitor's Stage (Part 2)"

13
00:02:55.151 --> 00:02:56.551
What?

14
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.251
The words written on the paper were written by the victim?

15
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.551
Yes, sir.

16
00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:03.351
According to forensics,

17
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:07.751
the paper was from a note pad that the victim used to write lyrics.

18
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.251
The handwriting matched that of the other songs

19
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.151
that were written on that memo pad.

20
00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:16.151
So he felt indebted to someone,

21
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.951
and it is very likely that it became the reason why he was murdered.

22
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:21.751
Do you have any idea what it could be?

23
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.651
I don't know if he felt indebted,

24
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.051
but if it was about feeling inferior.

25
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:27.651
He used to grieve saying that he didn't look very approachable

26
00:03:27.651 --> 00:03:29.351
so he had trouble closing the gap

27
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.551
between himself and the other good looking musicians.

28
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:34.651
I see.

29
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:38.251
Well, I used to tell him not to worry about it, though.

30
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:42.551
That his unfriendly looks was one of his attractive points, too.

31
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:46.051
Come to think of it, Mr. Hado's image changed recently, right?

32
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:49.251
Yeah, he seems softer than before.

33
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:51.351
Changed like how?

34
00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:53.351
His impression, sort of.

35
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:54.951
His face, maybe?

36
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:56.251
Come to think of it,

37
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:59.351
there were rumors going around that Hado had plastic surgery.

38
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:03.951
But that was back when Hado graduated from high school, I think?

39
00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:07.251
Like I told you before, that's all baloney.

40
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:09.551
Because back then, both he and I had no money

41
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:13.551
and we were desperately part-timing at a courier company to raise money

42
00:04:13.551 --> 00:04:17.051
so that he could continue his musical career!

43
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:20.551
But Hado had the nerve to dump you who went through hard times with him

44
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.651
and marry another woman.

45
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.351
If I remember correctly, he got married 16 years ago.

46
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:30.551
And the song, "ASACA" that was supposed to be released this time

47
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.951
was made17 years ago.

48
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:35.651
Isn't there a reason why he left that song as is

49
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:37.851
without even writing the lyrics for it for 17 years?

50
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:40.951
Right, Ms. Beautiful?

51
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:43.851
Hey, you! Cut it out already!

52
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:47.151
President, you know something too, don't you?

53
00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:51.451
At the previous live, I heard that you and Hado really had it out.

54
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:52.551
You bawled him out saying

55
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:54.951
why he didn't say anything about the song for 17 years.

56
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:58.251
Then after that fight, Hado suddenly announced

57
00:04:58.251 --> 00:05:01.051
that he would be releasing the new song "ASACA".

58
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.651
I just know there's got to be something behind this.

59
00:05:04.651 --> 00:05:06.751
Is that true?

60
00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:12.951
No. He joined out record company 17 years ago.

61
00:05:12.951 --> 00:05:16.251
I told him jokingly that the real reason I helped him debut

62
00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:23.551
was because I fell in love at first sight with Ms. Enjo.

63
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:26.551
He said if that's true, he was going to resign.

64
00:05:26.551 --> 00:05:27.851
I see.

65
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:30.551
But that doesn't sound enoug to be a motive

66
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:32.251
for killing Mr. Hado, does it?

67
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:35.351
I guess I'll get already then.

68
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:36.451
Wait!

69
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.751
This is an impossible crime

70
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:41.551
that no one can commit in the first place, isn't it?

71
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:44.351
Can't do. It's impossible.

72
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:49.651
You're finished.

73
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:50.951
Scotch.

74
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:11.051
Back then, his right hand was smeared with blood

75
00:06:11.051 --> 00:06:12.651
and yet, there was no blood on the tip of his thumb

76
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.551
and on the back of his hand.

77
00:06:14.551 --> 00:06:19.251
Which means that he put his own thumb onto the trigger

78
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:21.951
and shot himself.

79
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:24.651
He gave his own gun to him.

80
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.951
The one who made him do so was...

81
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:31.451
Shuichi Akai.

82
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:34.751
Being who he is,

83
00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:36.951
he would've been able to make Scotch choose a lot of other ways

84
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:38.951
other than having to kill himself.

85
00:06:42.751 --> 00:06:44.551
Hey.

86
00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:48.351
That guy's been glaring this way for some time, do you know why?

87
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.351
No.

88
00:06:49.351 --> 00:06:50.951
Before anything else,

89
00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.051
can you please hurry and do something about this?

90
00:06:53.051 --> 00:06:56.651
Because it's dangerous to stay here in disguise for a long time.

91
00:06:56.651 --> 00:06:57.751
I know.

92
00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.751
Hey! Let me go!

93
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:03.651
I've got to go back quickly and write an article about this case!

94
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:07.251
Before that, let me confirm the contents of your bag.

95
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:08.451
You sure are persistent.

96
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:10.651
Let me go, I said!

97
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:16.951
Ouch...

98
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.151
The evidence!

99
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:22.251
I'll help you pick it up.

100
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:24.051
Thank you.

101
00:07:28.651 --> 00:07:31.051
This is Mr. Hado's driver license.

102
00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:33.951
It's true that he's emitting an unfriendly aura.

103
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:45.351
Looking at the pictures that were inside the camera in your bag,

104
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:48.451
you were secretly taking pictures of Mr. Hado who went into the hall,

105
00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:52.451
but he found you and almost took your camera away from you.

106
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:54.451
Is that what happened?

107
00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:55.551
Yeah.

108
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:57.751
What did he say back then?

109
00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:00.251
He just told me not to take pictures without permission.

110
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:03.051
And besides that, Inspector,

111
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:07.951
a back band member who was supposed to perform with Mr. Hado

112
00:08:07.951 --> 00:08:10.651
in tomorrow's live was just picked up by the narcs.

113
00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:11.751
What?

114
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:14.951
He was arrested red-handed for possession of illegal drugs.

115
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:18.051
Wait, forensics officer.

116
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:19.351
What is it, sonny?

117
00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:20.851
You know what...

118
00:08:21.951 --> 00:08:23.551
Did you find... on the ground?

119
00:08:23.551 --> 00:08:27.451
It seems that Azusa dropped only one side.

120
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:29.851
Only one side...

121
00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:31.451
Dropped?

122
00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:42.451
No, nothing like that was found on stage.

123
00:08:42.451 --> 00:08:44.251
Then, was anything missing?

124
00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:46.751
Like wire or work gloves.

125
00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:51.151
Yeah. It seems that those two things were missing from the tool box

126
00:08:51.151 --> 00:08:53.451
that the staff put on the sleeve of the stage.

127
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:56.251
Then, did the staff also bring the folding pipe chair

128
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.151
that was beside the tool box and put it there?

129
00:08:59.151 --> 00:09:02.651
It seems to have been way inside, but...

130
00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:05.351
Hey, they said to leave the equipment as is

131
00:09:05.351 --> 00:09:07.251
because the live is canceled.

132
00:09:07.251 --> 00:09:08.551
Seriously?

133
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:10.951
I opened everything and now I have to put everything back again.

134
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.351
You checked that folding pipe chair too, didn't you?

135
00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:16.351
No, not yet for fingerprints.

136
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.351
We were going to take it back with us and check it.

137
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:21.251
The other forensic officer is taking it along together with the mic stand.

138
00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:22.351
Excuse me,

139
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.951
but could I have a look at the underside of the seat?

140
00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:27.151
What? Okay, please be quick about it.

141
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.051
Thank you.

142
00:09:32.451 --> 00:09:33.651
Just as I thought.

143
00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:35.951
So, that's the story.

144
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:40.851
Things look pretty bad.

145
00:09:40.851 --> 00:09:42.251
Yes.

146
00:09:42.251 --> 00:09:43.951
Excuse me, I'm coming through.

147
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:46.451
Excuse me. Please let me through.

148
00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:49.551
Excuse me. Please let me through.

149
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:52.651
Excuse me. Please let me through.

150
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.551
That's right. I remember back then,

151
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.951
a mysterious lady tried to kidnap Conan and Ai...

152
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:04.351
Come on and move away from that brunette.

153
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:06.451
If you don't want to die, quickly!

154
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.351
Come on, quickly!

155
00:10:08.351 --> 00:10:10.351
Move it, Angel!

156
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:14.351
She called me that.

157
00:10:14.351 --> 00:10:19.951
But why did Azusa call me the same way that lady did?

158
00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:31.017
You figured it out?

159
00:10:31.017 --> 00:10:34.117
The trick that the perp used to hang Mr. Hado up?

160
00:10:34.117 --> 00:10:35.417
Are you serious?

161
00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:37.217
Yes, I think so.

162
00:10:37.217 --> 00:10:41.317
So, we passed the rope through the spotlight bar,

163
00:10:41.317 --> 00:10:43.317
then tied one side of the rope

164
00:10:43.317 --> 00:10:47.017
onto Officer Takagi who is sitting in the chair.

165
00:10:47.017 --> 00:10:48.517
But, are you sure that it will take just one person

166
00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:50.217
to suspend him in mid air?

167
00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:51.817
Of course.

168
00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.717
First, you create a loop with the rope

169
00:10:53.717 --> 00:10:55.617
hanging from the bar on the stage

170
00:10:55.617 --> 00:10:58.217
and make a knot like this.

171
00:10:58.217 --> 00:10:59.717
Then pass the rope below from the foreground under the rope at the top

172
00:10:59.717 --> 00:11:02.917
and wrap the bottom loop around the top loop two times.

173
00:11:02.917 --> 00:11:06.217
Twist the loop on the bottom as you pull it through the loop.

174
00:11:06.217 --> 00:11:10.917
Pass the section hanging down through the loop.

175
00:11:10.917 --> 00:11:12.717
Hook the resulting large loop

176
00:11:12.717 --> 00:11:16.617
onto the armrest of the seat about two meter below.

177
00:11:16.617 --> 00:11:18.417
Like this.

178
00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:21.017
Next, pass the end of the rope

179
00:11:21.017 --> 00:11:23.717
without the loops under the armrest.

180
00:11:23.717 --> 00:11:26.017
Create the same loops as before and pass the rope through.

181
00:11:26.017 --> 00:11:28.617
Now, hook the large loop and rope

182
00:11:28.617 --> 00:11:31.917
on the armrest of a chair about four meters away.

183
00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:35.717
Create the third look and pass the rope through,

184
00:11:35.717 --> 00:11:40.817
and this time, hook the large loop onto a chair

185
00:11:40.817 --> 00:11:42.817
about eight meters away.

186
00:11:42.817 --> 00:11:44.217
Now, all you have to do is

187
00:11:44.217 --> 00:11:49.717
return to the third set of small loops you created

188
00:11:49.717 --> 00:11:52.117
and pull on the leftover rope.

189
00:11:52.117 --> 00:11:54.217
Sonoko, since you look to be the weakest,

190
00:11:54.217 --> 00:11:55.717
will you pull the rope, please?

191
00:11:55.717 --> 00:11:59.217
Who, me?

192
00:11:59.217 --> 00:12:01.017
Okay.

193
00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:05.317
I don't think I'll be able to lift him up, though.

194
00:12:10.317 --> 00:12:11.717
What the?

195
00:12:11.717 --> 00:12:13.617
What's going on?

196
00:12:13.617 --> 00:12:16.617
Principle of the pulley. Correct?

197
00:12:16.617 --> 00:12:18.017
Yes.

198
00:12:18.017 --> 00:12:19.117
The small loop that was made partway

199
00:12:19.117 --> 00:12:22.317
through the rope functioned as a pulley.

200
00:12:22.317 --> 00:12:23.817
Each loop makes it possible for the rope

201
00:12:23.817 --> 00:12:28.417
to be pulled at two times, four times, or eight times the power.

202
00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:31.417
It's actually not a pulley but the loop of a rope,

203
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:34.117
so due to friction 8 times is not possible,

204
00:12:34.117 --> 00:12:36.317
but if a light and slippery rope is used,

205
00:12:36.317 --> 00:12:39.717
even Sonoko can lift Officer Takagi up.

206
00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:43.017
This means that not many,

207
00:12:43.017 --> 00:12:46.517
but just one person lifted Mr. Hado up.

208
00:12:46.517 --> 00:12:51.417
This is the way that couriers tie their rope

209
00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:53.917
and fix their loads on securely.

210
00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:56.817
In other words, the one most suspicious of being the perp

211
00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:59.317
that lifted Mr. Hado up is

212
00:12:59.317 --> 00:13:02.717
the one who used to work at a courier company in her younger days...

213
00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:04.917
Mr. Hado's manager.

214
00:13:06.017 --> 00:13:10.517
You, Ms. Kanae Enjo.

215
00:13:10.517 --> 00:13:12.317
Okay, maybe she lifted him up,

216
00:13:12.317 --> 00:13:15.117
but how did she tie the rope onto the seats?

217
00:13:15.117 --> 00:13:17.917
That's easy.

218
00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:20.317
After lifting him up,

219
00:13:20.317 --> 00:13:22.017
she ties the tip of the rope to a seat nearby temporarily

220
00:13:22.017 --> 00:13:24.017
and sets it in place.

221
00:13:24.017 --> 00:13:26.417
She twists a wire into this part of the rope

222
00:13:26.417 --> 00:13:29.417
that's hanging from above.

223
00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:30.517
If she fixes the rope

224
00:13:30.517 --> 00:13:33.117
that is hanging from the ceiling in place with the wire,

225
00:13:33.117 --> 00:13:35.117
next all she has to do is untie the extra rope

226
00:13:35.117 --> 00:13:38.617
and tie it on again to the seat, then remove the wire.

227
00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.817
The good thing about this courier tying method is

228
00:13:40.817 --> 00:13:44.517
no knot is tied anywhere so it's easy to untie.

229
00:13:44.517 --> 00:13:46.117
But if a new rope were used,

230
00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:49.017
marks would be left behind on the rope.

231
00:13:49.017 --> 00:13:52.517
That's why after she retied the rope to the seat,

232
00:13:52.517 --> 00:13:54.517
she cut off the extra rope with a cutter

233
00:13:54.517 --> 00:13:55.917
that was in the tool box and coiled the rope.

234
00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:57.817
She then put it next to the tool box

235
00:13:57.817 --> 00:14:01.817
that was at the sleeve of the stage, correct?

236
00:14:01.817 --> 00:14:03.817
Ms. Enjo?

237
00:14:03.817 --> 00:14:07.817
Hey, hey. Just because she part-timed at a courier before,

238
00:14:07.817 --> 00:14:11.317
to accuse her of being the perp just because of that is...

239
00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:13.817
It's the size of her feet.

240
00:14:13.817 --> 00:14:18.217
-Feet? -Couriers coil the rope around like this

241
00:14:18.217 --> 00:14:21.817
and bundle the rope.

242
00:14:21.817 --> 00:14:24.017
The inside loop of the rope that is coiled

243
00:14:24.017 --> 00:14:25.417
is approximately the same size

244
00:14:25.417 --> 00:14:27.317
as the feet of the person who coiled the rope!

245
00:14:27.317 --> 00:14:29.317
The length from the elbow to the wrist

246
00:14:29.317 --> 00:14:31.817
is the size of that person's feet.

247
00:14:31.817 --> 00:14:33.317
The loop of the rope at the scene

248
00:14:33.317 --> 00:14:37.217
was coiled in just about the size of Ran's feet

249
00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:39.317
so I just thought that the rope might have been

250
00:14:39.317 --> 00:14:42.617
tied by the manager who is of small built.

251
00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:44.317
I see.

252
00:14:44.317 --> 00:14:47.317
The feelings that the Ms. Beauty felt for Hado

253
00:14:47.317 --> 00:14:51.017
turned into a grudge over a span of 17 years.

254
00:14:51.017 --> 00:14:53.517
Hey! Stop making rude remarks!

255
00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:56.017
We don't know if she's the one who did it.

256
00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:58.817
Contact lenses.

257
00:14:58.817 --> 00:15:01.417
I'm sure you must've noticed because you're his manager,

258
00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:03.517
that Mr. Hado was wearing circle contact lens

259
00:15:03.517 --> 00:15:05.417
to make his iris look bigger.

260
00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:06.717
Yes.

261
00:15:06.717 --> 00:15:08.917
When I compared Mr. Hado's driver's license picture

262
00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:12.117
to the picture that the magazine reporter took of Mr. Hado today,

263
00:15:12.117 --> 00:15:14.217
even I could tell.

264
00:15:15.317 --> 00:15:17.717
One of the lens

265
00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:20.217
is stuck to your back, Manager.

266
00:15:20.217 --> 00:15:21.617
What?

267
00:15:25.317 --> 00:15:27.117
This is...

268
00:15:27.117 --> 00:15:28.817
May I?

269
00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:30.617
Yes.

270
00:15:30.617 --> 00:15:32.217
I see.

271
00:15:32.217 --> 00:15:34.917
When you lifted him up,

272
00:15:34.917 --> 00:15:37.717
it unfortunately probably dropped onto your clothes.

273
00:15:37.717 --> 00:15:39.717
We've got enough evidence.

274
00:15:39.717 --> 00:15:41.317
We'll hear the rest out at the station.

275
00:15:41.317 --> 00:15:43.817
Wait. Did you really do it?

276
00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:48.217
Why did you have to kill the man that you supported for 17 years?

277
00:15:48.217 --> 00:15:50.517
Please answer me.

278
00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:51.917
She wouldn't be able to answer that question

279
00:15:51.917 --> 00:15:53.817
no matter how much you ask.

280
00:15:53.817 --> 00:15:57.617
Because she didn't kill him.

281
00:15:58.517 --> 00:15:59.617
What?

282
00:15:59.617 --> 00:16:01.517
Just what are you talking about?

283
00:16:01.517 --> 00:16:06.117
Where do you think the other circle lens was?

284
00:16:06.117 --> 00:16:08.517
It was stuck on the back of the seat of the folding pipe chair

285
00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:10.917
that was left at the sleeve of the stage.

286
00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:13.117
In other words, the chair was on the floor

287
00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:16.117
right below where he was hung at his feet.

288
00:16:16.117 --> 00:16:20.817
Furthermore, the baseball with the kite string tied onto it.

289
00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:25.317
The other tip of the kite string was tied onto the tip of the rope.

290
00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:27.217
Then the ball was thrown to pass the kite string

291
00:16:27.217 --> 00:16:28.517
through the bar on the ceiling,

292
00:16:28.517 --> 00:16:30.217
so that by pulling the kite string,

293
00:16:30.217 --> 00:16:33.517
the rope would be passed over the bar.

294
00:16:33.517 --> 00:16:34.617
No offense,

295
00:16:34.617 --> 00:16:39.517
but I don't think Ms. Enjo can throw the ball high enough over the bar.

296
00:16:39.517 --> 00:16:41.517
If it were Mr. Hado, who played baseball during his high school days

297
00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:43.717
and had a powerful shoulder, it's a different story, though.

298
00:16:43.717 --> 00:16:46.317
"I'm sorry" -And the memo that was found

299
00:16:46.317 --> 00:16:49.117
in Mr. Hado's chest pocket written in his own handwriting.

300
00:16:49.117 --> 00:16:51.117
You know what I'm getting at, don't you?

301
00:16:51.117 --> 00:16:53.417
Don't tell me that he took...

302
00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:56.617
Right. He hung himself.

303
00:16:56.617 --> 00:16:58.217
She found him

304
00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.917
and tried to make it look as if he was murdered.

305
00:17:00.917 --> 00:17:03.317
Hey, why did you hide the suicide?

306
00:17:03.317 --> 00:17:06.617
So, something did happen 17 years ago, right?

307
00:17:06.617 --> 00:17:09.117
Don't tell me that he got all chewed up

308
00:17:09.117 --> 00:17:10.917
about what I told him the other day?

309
00:17:10.917 --> 00:17:12.417
What did you tell him?

310
00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:14.917
Actually, 17 years ago,

311
00:17:14.917 --> 00:17:17.217
she was pregnant with Hado's child.

312
00:17:17.217 --> 00:17:18.917
Mr. Fuse!

313
00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:21.517
Saying that it was for the sake of his child who was going to be born,

314
00:17:21.517 --> 00:17:23.717
Hado, who just debuted confined himself in the studio

315
00:17:23.717 --> 00:17:26.217
and continued composing songs,

316
00:17:26.217 --> 00:17:27.417
to the point where it looked as if he would die

317
00:17:27.417 --> 00:17:29.817
from consecutively staying up all night.

318
00:17:29.817 --> 00:17:31.317
So, she went to ask him to stop,

319
00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:35.417
but collapsed on the floor in front of the studio and miscarried.

320
00:17:35.417 --> 00:17:38.517
Then, at the hospital,

321
00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:41.817
she told me not to tell Hado what happened.

322
00:17:41.817 --> 00:17:44.717
I see. The title of the song back then

323
00:17:44.717 --> 00:17:47.517
that he made for the unborn child was "ASACA",

324
00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:48.817
but no lyrics were made for that song

325
00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:51.617
and it was shelved for 17 years.

326
00:17:51.617 --> 00:17:54.317
After finding out what happened, he felt responsible for what happened,

327
00:17:54.317 --> 00:17:57.717
decides to write lyrics for it and release the song.

328
00:17:57.717 --> 00:18:00.117
However, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't write,

329
00:18:00.117 --> 00:18:04.717
so he wrote a message "I'm sorry" and chose to die.

330
00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:09.117
But, why did you need to make it look like a murder?

331
00:18:09.117 --> 00:18:13.017
I didn't want his family to find out that he committed suicide

332
00:18:13.017 --> 00:18:16.517
because of his ex-girl's unborn child.

333
00:18:16.517 --> 00:18:21.017
That's why I took his cell phone that was in his pocket

334
00:18:21.017 --> 00:18:24.617
that had the call history of his mail that said, "Bye".

335
00:18:24.617 --> 00:18:28.417
I wanted him to soar high to the heavens.

336
00:18:32.917 --> 00:18:36.417
He's dead and yet he makes women cry. What an idiot.

337
00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:41.317
Please don't write an article on this!

338
00:18:41.317 --> 00:18:44.417
I pursued Hado for so many years, you know.

339
00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:48.217
Day after day, I crawled over the ground looking for an article.

340
00:18:48.217 --> 00:18:50.417
And the great scoop that I finally get hold of

341
00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:52.517
turns out to be Hado's greatest scandal of his life.

342
00:18:52.517 --> 00:18:55.417
Please don't! Please!

343
00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:59.217
I think I know Hado better than anyone else.

344
00:18:59.217 --> 00:19:01.417
I wouldn't write about him even if you asked me to.

345
00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:06.917
Sentimental stories don't jive with rock and rollers.

346
00:19:09.517 --> 00:19:12.417
But everything's still a mystery.

347
00:19:12.417 --> 00:19:15.817
I wonder why the "CA" of "ASACA" was written with "C" instead of a "K"?

348
00:19:15.817 --> 00:19:18.817
I've asked Hado about it before.

349
00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:20.417
He heard about the pregnancy

350
00:19:20.417 --> 00:19:22.017
at a morning cafe after he stayed up all night,

351
00:19:22.017 --> 00:19:24.017
so he said if it's a girl, it'd be written "Asaca" in Chinese characters

352
00:19:24.017 --> 00:19:26.917
or if in alphabet, it would be spelled "ASACA"

353
00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:28.717
after the word morning cafe.

354
00:19:28.717 --> 00:19:30.917
I see! I'm convinced!

355
00:19:30.917 --> 00:19:33.217
But despite you being a super close friend to him,

356
00:19:33.217 --> 00:19:34.917
so close that he would tell you all this,

357
00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:38.617
how is it that you turn your back on him and push him into resigning?

358
00:19:38.617 --> 00:19:41.317
Maybe you knew about the guy in his back band

359
00:19:41.317 --> 00:19:44.317
that was nabbed by the narcs a while ago?

360
00:19:44.317 --> 00:19:48.317
I... I don't know anything about that.

361
00:19:48.317 --> 00:19:51.217
My, you sure have quick ears.

362
00:19:51.217 --> 00:19:55.217
No, no. The news is already on the internet.

363
00:19:55.217 --> 00:19:58.217
He's really something.

364
00:19:58.217 --> 00:20:00.617
You're really something, Scotch.

365
00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.717
To pretend that you were knocked down by me

366
00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:05.017
and during that time you pulled my gun out.

367
00:20:05.017 --> 00:20:07.617
I don't mean to ask you to spare me,

368
00:20:07.617 --> 00:20:11.117
but won't you hear me out before you shoot me?

369
00:20:11.117 --> 00:20:15.117
I didn't take your gun to shoot you.

370
00:20:15.117 --> 00:20:16.517
I see.

371
00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:24.917
But to do this!

372
00:20:24.917 --> 00:20:26.117
Impossible.

373
00:20:28.717 --> 00:20:33.017
It's humanly impossible to pull the trigger

374
00:20:33.017 --> 00:20:37.017
when you're holding the cylinder of the revolver.

375
00:20:37.017 --> 00:20:39.717
Forget about killing yourself.

376
00:20:39.717 --> 00:20:42.217
You're not meant to die here.

377
00:20:42.217 --> 00:20:43.517
What?

378
00:20:43.517 --> 00:20:47.317
I'm Shuichi Akai who have infiltrated here from the FBI.

379
00:20:47.317 --> 00:20:51.517
I'm a dog just like you who wants to sink my teeth into them.

380
00:20:51.517 --> 00:20:56.317
So now that you know, let go of the gun and hear me out.

381
00:20:56.317 --> 00:21:00.717
It's no problem letting you get away.

382
00:21:00.717 --> 00:21:02.217
Okay.

383
00:21:15.117 --> 00:21:16.717
I see.

384
00:21:16.717 --> 00:21:20.817
He fired the gun to break this.

385
00:21:20.817 --> 00:21:25.817
This cell phone that would have had the data of his family and friends.

386
00:21:31.317 --> 00:21:36.217
Traitor's shall be punished.

387
00:21:36.217 --> 00:21:37.917
Right?

388
00:21:40.617 --> 00:21:42.417
That high neck of yours.

389
00:21:42.417 --> 00:21:46.517
I'm overtaken by the impulse of wanting to pull it down right here.

390
00:21:46.517 --> 00:21:49.817
But I guess I won't do it now.

391
00:21:49.817 --> 00:21:51.417
One day...

392
00:21:53.517 --> 00:21:55.217
I will.

393
00:23:21.017 --> 00:23:23.517
Azusa!

394
00:23:23.517 --> 00:23:25.117
What?

395
00:23:25.117 --> 00:23:29.817
Rather, you aren't Azusa, are you?

396
00:23:29.817 --> 00:23:31.817
Most probably I'm sure...

397
00:23:31.817 --> 00:23:35.017
you're the one who called me angel.

398
00:23:35.017 --> 00:23:37.017
I've told you before, Ran.

399
00:23:37.017 --> 00:23:40.117
Don't get any closer than you are now.

400
00:23:41.317 --> 00:23:45.317
Because you are my treasure.

401
00:23:46.717 --> 00:23:48.317
Right,

402
00:23:48.317 --> 00:23:53.917
the only two treasures I have in this world.

403
00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:55.617
"Next Episode"

404
00:23:55.617 --> 00:23:59.017
-Awesome! -It's really spectacular!

405
00:23:59.017 --> 00:24:01.417
Where are you going to put all these books?

406
00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:05.417
This shop is bursting with books that won't sell!

407
00:24:05.417 --> 00:24:08.417
Meeting an antique book is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you know.

408
00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:09.717
I'm sure that they will someday

409
00:24:09.717 --> 00:24:13.617
fall into the hands of people that are looking for them.

410
00:24:13.617 --> 00:24:15.217
This is...

411
00:24:19.117 --> 00:24:24.417
Next Conan, "The Whistling Used Book Shop"

412
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.960
Next Conan's Hint:

413
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.760
"Group photograph"

414
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.760
A silver bullet for an angel.

415
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.760
Those two are cause for concern.
