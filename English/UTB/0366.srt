The stageafor today's episode is fishing.

2
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:24,525
A breakwater out at sea in clear view

3
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:26,460
But, a murder is committed
without anyone noticing

5
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,629
He sees through the one and only truth

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,631

Wow::the wind. feels so good:

15
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:15,569
Listen all of you! We're'going
fishing out by the breakwater!

17
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,874
V Be careful not to get too carried
away and fall into the'ocean: all right?!!

19
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:20,908
Yes: sir!

20
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:27,581
How unusual to go
wut fishing to the sea...

22
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:29,549
Oh. yeah

24
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,918
What's the problem! Every time
we decide to go some place,

27
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,155
(All Tr
it's let's go camping to
the mountains. so I'm sure that

30
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:35,990
Doc wanted us to
experience something new!

32
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:38,659
W-Wel=.sort of... Aha<=ha...

33
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:41,328
I'm not complaining or anything...
I already have a hunch

35
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,531
that since I've been avoiding going out
to distant places with you guys...

37
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:45,566
going out to distant
places with you guys...

40
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,436
you figured instead of taking me to the
mountains where there are blind spots

42
00:02:48,437 --> 00:02:50,537
it would be better to take
me out to see where the view

44
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,706
IS Nice and clear, thanks to
somebody's great idea. right...?

47
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:54,208
Darn you...

48
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:56,577
she hit the bull's eye

49
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,680
I guess it's not a bad
idea for a change of scene

51
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,382
scene to come and feel
the sea breeze of this vast ocean.

53
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:04,285
The mother of all creation .

54
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:05,886
Well, but from my point of view,

55
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:08,355
he should've just
minded his own business...

57
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,958
What a super snob!!

I wonder about that.

72
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:21,569
And, like she says,
the ocean is the source of life.

74
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,938
The source of life...

75
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,174
It's a great place to relax. besides...

76
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:30,878
Huh, come to think of it, today is...

fish we can catch by then

84

How many fish we can catch?

Ida?

108
00:04:18,193 --> 00:04:22,096
He:s the one who's navigating this ship,

you won't be able to fish anything.

You won't be able to fish anything

117
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,675
Because you're (bozu)

The word "bBozu means
no catch in. fishing terminology...

127
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,790
It's a pun, a play on words

128
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:52,326
No need to trouble yourself over it,

129
00:04:52,327 --> 00:04:54,128
it's just an old man's joke...

130
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:56,397
Darn guy.

131
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,567
Okay! Let's ask the fisherman I
all kinds of questions

133
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:02,536
and fish up a lot
of yellow tails and tunas!!

135
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:03,871
Okay!!

136
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:06,774

Huh? What's the matter?
Why are you doing that...?

151
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:36,971
Because. Right?!

152
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:37,771
Yes!

153
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:41,475
We went to ask him about fishing then he

154
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:46,280
Treated us too much like
Wile kids that we really got angry! I!

156
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,616
And. what did he say?!

158
00:05:48,617 --> 00:05:53,554
He said don't make
Ioud noises with your friends...

160
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,222
Fuh, fuh. fun.

161
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:58,659
wm That's right=ilgs exactly
as the fisherman says...

164
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:58,959
That's right<it's exactly
as the fisherman-says

170
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:01,295
Why Is he, fight

171
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,398
If loud noises are made,
the sound of footsteps and

173
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,734
such travel along the breakwater...

175
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:10,471
into the watersurnprising
the fish and make them flee...

177
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:13,407
So, that fisherman was
probably trying to tell you that

179
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:17,244
If you make too much noise your
footsteps will keep the fish away...

181
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:23,016
Right. exactly. I tell you!

182
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,985
Did he say anything else...?

183
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:26,220
Well

184
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:28,055
Oops. there. okay.

185
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,624
There!"Oops!

186
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:33,994
Dangerous...

187
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:37,031
doing something like that.
What if the children copy him

189
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:40,367
( as)
The place where the
tetra pods are over there is...

193
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:43,370
Mr. Ejiri's usual fishing spot!
WHe 's' not contented

195
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,306
unless he gets to fish there. that man...

196
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:52,446
Ally
But. it's strange that the tetra pod looks
to.be above the surface of the water...

199
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:54,782
Although it's so out off shore like this,
it's pretty shallow, isn't it?

201
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:55,949
VBooo

202
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:59,319
The rocks here a patterned
In complex fashion so...

204
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,122
That area over there
IS very deep, you see...

206
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,524
well. but-thanks to that

207
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:06,026
this place is hard to enter for fishing€

208
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:08,896
thatinot too many
people know of this place.

210
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:11,865
So. this is an extremely
fantastic hidden fishing spot

212
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,267
I thanks to Mr. Ida's navigating skill.

213
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:18,205
See that's why there
aren't other fishers around.

215
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:19,339
Fuh, fun, fun...

216
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,941
Let's give it our best shot.

217
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,509
After all, our lunch is"at stake too...

218
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,410
Fuhs fun. fun...

219
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:24,745
» Aha ak!

220
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:29,950
But, are you sure we can
catch;fish in a place like this?

222
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:30,818
Yeah...

223
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,254
For fish, the breakwater
is like an artificially

225
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,724
made hotel with a restaurant.

226
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,125
There'll be loads of fish!!

232
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:41,628
There re lots of theme

233
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,831
But-that's during the period of time
when there are a lot fish that is...

235
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:44,565
Oh no!
But that's during the period of time
when-there are a lot fish that is...

239
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:45,032
Oh no!
IWeimay catch a bit too much mm

241
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,583
Oh no!
We may catch a bit too much...

244
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,736
This. cooler box is so small! mam.

246
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:51,905
We didn'tsfigure things out too well. /

248
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:54,108
- - What if we can't fit all the fish in. /

251
00:07:54,109 --> 00:07:58,011
Don't worry. I'll eat them all up

252
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:01,915
What a thing to say, Genta, come off it!

254
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:05,052
Ig! -aim:for the record of
youngest big. catcher then

256
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,054
Oh, just great.

257
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:09,890
I'll open. up a fish shop then!
4m wet»

259
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:12,126
Yep. yep. good idea.

260
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:15,963
You're not listening at all, you guys...

261
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:31,512
YAWN

262
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:35,082
No fish at all...I wonder
if the fish are asleep...

264
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,351
Yeah. it's not even budging.

265
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,187
And it's such a clear day...

266
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:42,289
4 she fish donrtibite
because it's a clear day.

268
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,224
Huh, what do you mean?

269
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,058
It's not good if it's a fine day?

270
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,664
No. because the water us only this deep

271
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,466
on a fine daywhen
the water is transparent...

273
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,168
fish get suspicious and are on guard. -

274
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:59,273
So its actually better if
It were cloudy or drizzling a little!

277
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,909
But this is a good place. neverthelé&ss:

278
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,510
so if we stick it out .
The fish will eventually, start biting...

281
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,747
Well I'd advise youffiot
to get your hopes up too high.

284
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:07,915
What?!

285
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,585
What it all. boils down to is,
only patient people are suited for fishing...

287
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:12,986
That's not true!

288
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:16,456
There ane quick tempered.
People among fishing experts...

290
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:19,359
Exactly impatient people are
said to be suited for fishingsbecause...

292
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,312
They're constantly. concerned
whether the -bait's not-too good.

294
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,630
Whether where they
are fishing is not good.

296
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,034
Whether their tools
aren't good enough. So,

298
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:30,003
they read up on fishing
books. exchange information

302
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,973
check out the tides Pp
of the day.and so forth

304
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:35,509
They do a lot of research as well as
try each and every kind of thing

307
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,978
sO impatient people are said

311
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,682
Well. to become a good
anglers experience is what counts!

315
00:09:41,683 --> 00:09:44,017
The more effort youlp
put in, thesamore reward

317
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:44,218
The more effort you
put in, the more reward

319
00:09:44,219 --> 00:09:47,888
you get to receive from the sea.
That 1s, you get to catch better fish too.

321
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,757
Well, as for me. I haven't received

322
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,093
such a great gifts rom
the ocean yet though.

324
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55,162
7 ony

325
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:59,499
Hey Conan, you said there are/,
many differentikinds of fish here, right?

327
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Yeah...

329
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:02,635
Then. can we catch sea bream here 1007?

331
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:03,737
No.l\Impossible
I'M:

333
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:06,840
Why not? Why us it impossible?!

334
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:10,444
There are no sea breams
unless you go to a place that's

336
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:13,180
more out to the sea with
a 'depth;of 30 to 70 meters.

338
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:16,416
But, since the sea is
connected. a sea bream

340
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:19,419
may(go astray and come along. right?!

341
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,456
Remember! There was
a sea otter that did that too, right?

343
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:23,991
Aha, ha .

344
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:27,327
2° Yeah, all we have to do is oo
atch fish that come swimming astray.

347
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:31,431
H Hey ..7?!

348
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:31,731
H.Hey...?!

352
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:34,668
Hee. hee, hee . I guess
we can't fish for whales though... &

354
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,972
Well, we've got lots of time, so I guess
we'll just have to stick it out, right, Conan
JEW aA

357
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,375
O Oh, yeah, let's do our best...

358
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:43,043
Agh.

359
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:44,645
Huh? Didl'you catch something?!

361
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:48,615
Oh, no...my bobber drifted awa 1.

362
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:52,052
Really. it's because you didn't
push it in nicely into the bobber rubber...

365
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:53,086
But .

367
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:55,389
What is it now?

368
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,058
I.Look, Air's bobber is moving!

369
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,192
What?!

371
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:00,394
Ca...

372
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:01,762
Caught a fish!!

373
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:03,430
Keep your cool. Ar!

374
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:04,665
Pull! Pull!

376
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:06,933
Hang in there!!

377
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,870
Don-t rush! That's right,
you-re doing good!!!

379
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:18,245
She did it!!

380
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,883
Huh

381
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,087
It sure is tiny. though.

383
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,389
A tiny girella?

384
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,525
Well, I guess it's better
than not fishing anything at all...

386
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,427
Aaagh...?!

387
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,428
What do yourthink you're doing?

388
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,632
It's fishing manners to
return trash fish: into the sea. isn't it?

390
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:39,866
I. guess'you re right...

391
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,468
What a waste.

392
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:43,303
But the next time you
put the fish back into the sea.

394
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,639
It's better to cool*your
hands with the water

396
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,074
in the bucket before throwing in the fish...

397
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:47,941
Huh?

398
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,245
Because-the body temperature
of humans is too warm

400
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,815
for the fish and it would get burned!

401
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:56,850
You sure like to pick on people. don't you!

402
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:57,718
Huh 2!

403
00:11:57,719 --> 00:12:02,222
1.1 just said that it
would be better to do so!!

405
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:06,226
But. now we know that
we can fish here too!

407
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:09,830
I'm going to change places
and go fish over on that-side...

409
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:10,364
H.Hey!

410
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,165
A Ad al + Sum
I want to fish for sea bream!

412
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,332
Don't run!

413
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,769
Oh, right. Sea bream, sea bream...

414
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,039
I tell you, no way...Aha. ha...

415
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,654
Talk about not being
able to fish anything

417
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,009
You can say that again.
Who was it that was saying {_

419
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,762
Iet's fish for yellowtail and tunad_

420
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:46,400
Talk about not-even budging

421
00:12:46,401 --> 00:12:51,204
Wellwto become a good angler,
experience is what counts!

424
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:54,741
Okay. experience is
what it takes, experience...

427
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:59,312
I'm going to go over to everyone
else and see how they're doing...

431
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,714
Please don't run

432
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:02,716
how. I know

433
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:07,120
Ha, hatha.
Their fishing manners have improved.

435
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,654
Fantastic, amazing

436
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,167
Thank you

437
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:22,135
Good luck!

438
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:23,470
Fuh. fur, fun fun...

439
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,806
I wonder\if she'll become a
professional angler when she grows up.

441
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:26,440
Ha. ha, ha...

442
00:13:27,775 --> 00:13:30,444
Ayumi, did*yousleann anything?

443
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:35,582
Uh, he taught me how to hook
the bait on and a lot of other things...

446
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,486
Maybe I'll have him teach me too...

447
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,755
There seems to be a lot
of fish below and I wonder

449
00:13:41,756 --> 00:13:44,057
why I still can't seem 10 catch anything?

450
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:48,161
He told me that the flow of
the current is not good right now...

452
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:51,965
I see {the flow of the current. huh...

453
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:55,001
I'm going to catch a fish today,
no matter what it takes

455
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,938
If I cant fish anything
today. when else can I?

457
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:04,644
No fish...

458
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,046
You can say that again.

459
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:09,249
Well-but the veterans over there
haven't caught any either so

461
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,384
I guess it can't be helped...

462
00:14:11,385 --> 00:14:14,421
I'd like to at least catch one fish...

463
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:19,059
True, if we don't catch any,
the man will really make fun of us...

465
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,329
Aaaah... I'm getting sleepy again.

467
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:24,030
It's come!

469
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:25,732
Huh?! Really!

472
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,135
N.No "doubt about it. I've caught:one!

473
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:30,170
Hang in there, Mitsuhiko!

474
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:38,945
I-did it! I"finally caught one. Finally.

476
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:42,182
You did it! Mitsuhiko! You did it!

477
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:46,419
Oh~. You did it. Mitsuhiko!
It's a nicely; shapedrmackerel! 4

479
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,990
Genta. I caught one! See!

480
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:53,460
Huh? You:caught-one? I Really

481
00:14:53,461 --> 00:14:56,463
See. look. look. it's this bug.

483
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:58,231
Mitsuhiko caught it.

484
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,135
1.I'm happy for you!

485
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,871
I mean. it's so small... As for me...

486
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,474
I'm going for the big one-A sea bream!

487
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:09,876
You did it, didn't you. Mitsuhiko!

489
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,444
1Y- 2

490
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:15,715
You did it. I've lost the bet.

491
00:15:15,716 --> 00:15:17,817
Is this your bobber...?

494
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,787
Oh. my bobber?

496
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,990
Thank you. It drifted away...

497
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,759
Why do you have it?

498
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,262
Fuh. fun. fun gmake sure
you keepin on tight next time

500
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,664
Okay!

501
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:35,368
The crab cream croquette
she gave us.sure Is good...isn't it?

503
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,639
Eating in a place like this makes
Iunch taste even better-doesn't it? =

505
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,041
Yep! It's delicious!

506
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:41,274
Yep! It's delicious!

507
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,644
Nothing yet...

508
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:49,516
I guess Conan was right
about no sea breams being here...

510
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:53,053
This is the worst time of day for fishing.

511
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:55,555
Morning or sundown is way 'better.

512
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:58,124
It seems everyonegjs
having a hard time too...

514
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,127
No bite what so ever.

515
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,330
Maybe I'll try changing the-bait.

516
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:06,266
How about you? Anything?

517
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:08,735
No. Nothing at all!

518
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:08,969
No. Nothing at all!

520
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:11,638
wr on
I wonder If the bait is on all right?

522
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:12,572
Huh?

524
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,809
Huh? What's this.
I feel something pulling.

528
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,743
T.it's big...

529
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:17,110
It. It's big!

531
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,445
C.Conan,.

532
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:20,547
1.7 whale. I can't ft it up!!

533
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,718
It smnegakar:...

534
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,486
Negakari?

535
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,722
Is there a fish called negakar?

536
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,257
T's not a fish. Your line got caught

537
00:16:30,258 --> 00:16:31,992
and stuck to seaweed
or a rock or something.

539
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:35,996
Huh? It's not a fish? Then what do I do?

540
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:40,233
Don't pull too hard,
but rather, loosen and pull.

543
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,801
I.Like this?!

545
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,937
Right. good...repeat the process...

549
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,806
It. It's come off!

550
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:50,760
/hat's this...

551
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,129
You sure fished a big one.

552
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,048
Sigh...Aha, ha...

553
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,084
Shoots. bait gone again.

554
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:00,770
Fuh. fun, fun...

555
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,956
Even the expert angler
Ejiri is having a bad day today

557
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:07,961
They seem not to have luck either,
maybe the current is bad

559
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:14,934
Genta. aren't you going to eat luiChr/

560
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:17,937
Yeah. I'll eat in a little while!

561
00:17:17,938 --> 00:17:22,909
I can't believe that
Genta us still not eating...

563
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,613
Yep I wonder if he wants
to fish sea bream that badly

565
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:30,150
Sea bream...is-Genta"s dream.
Please let:zhim fish a sea bream

567
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:31,184
Ha. ha, ha. ha...

568
