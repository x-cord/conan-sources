I wonder if he was on his way back after
taking the ransom money...)

51
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,982

But why...

105
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,927
We were told that if we report this
to the police father would be killed!

107
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:36,515
The situation has changed

108
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,683
Why does the police have this?

109
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:41,052
After we left it
where we were told to leave it.

111
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:45,107

a traffic accident while on his motorbike

where your father is being confined from
the hints we may get from them...

119
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,754
To think that this did not reach father...

120
00:06:00,156 --> 00:06:01,923
It says every 6 hours,

121
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:04,993

The time limit is 17:00...

135

in what way your father was kidnapped.

I injected father at 9:00 in the morning,
and went to visit a friend of mine...

158
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:23,838
I had promised to go see her
from sometime before so.

160
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:27,442

00:10:56,852 --> 00:11:00,755
Even Akinari will worry about him
and hope that/he is safe.

269
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,859
Aha, that's why he gathered
the ransom with all his might.

272
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,467
I guess so. This has nothing to do with
the kidnapping: .1 guess

274
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:17,372
It's me.

275
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,074
According to a friend
who goes around with Takeshi Hirano,

277
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:20,642
he says that Hirano suddenly
seemed to have a lot of money

279
00:11:20,676 --> 00:11:22,343
he says that Hirano suddenly
seemed to have a lot of money

281
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:23,378
on him since a week ago.

282
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:27,515
Which means that
Hirano was hired and paid by someone!

284
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:30,784
Probably.

285
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:31,553
But; I haven't got info on
who hired him yet...

287
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:32,954
But, I hiwven't got info on
who hired him yet

289
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:33,321
But, I hiwven't got info on
who hired him yet...

291
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:33,688
But. I haven't got info on
who hired him yet...

293
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:36,157
So. you don't Know who it is yet.

294
00:11:36,158 --> 00:11:38,226
Continue asking around his friends
and acquaintances!

296
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:40,061
If only we can find who it is.

297
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,896
We may get a hint
on where Mr. Domoto is being confined.

299
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:44,566
There's another master-mind behind this...

300
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:46,468
Oh but if so something Is odd

301
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:48,336
Something-s strange. isn't it. Inspector?

302
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:48,635
What Is?

303
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:49,571
What is?

304
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:50,672
The master-mind.

305
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:54,742
The guy who went to get
the ransom hasn't come back for a while.

307
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,778
Therefore, wouldn't'he normally
call to demand

309
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:57,812
what happened to the money.saying.

310
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,415
What happened.to the money,
are going to leave the hostage to die"

312
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,483
Or something to thateffect...

313
00:12:01,817 --> 00:12:03,318
I soo. Now that you montionod it

314
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,786
Exactly.

315
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:07,689
Why does the master-mind seem quite
indifferent to the money

317
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,557
after having demanded it?

318
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:14,529
Oh. Father!

319
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,597
Mitsuko...

320
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:19,100
Maybe the real purpose of
this kidnapping is...

324
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:23,438
< NF BY
TN ee ET

328
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:25,907
"see.

329
00:12:25,908 --> 00:12:27,976
If SO

330
00:12:28,377 --> 00:12:30,311
Oh, my... What is it now, sonny?

331
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,183
Mr. Akinari Domot@ was: in his study
all morning today: right?

333
00:12:35,184 --> 00:12:36,568
Yes. he-had work to do

334
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,354
Did he.say something to'you back then?

335
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:40,421
Something?

336
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:41,890
WW, Uy

337
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:45,793
Masayo, I'm going lo concentrate on
work for a while

339
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:47,862
SO you don't have to bring me
tea or anything

341
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:49,564
Just as I thought...

342
00:12:50,266 --> 00:12:51,316
If 80

343
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:09,150
Machine oil.

344
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:20,895
No doubt about it~

345
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:22,847
I figured out who the real culprit of
this kidnapping case is...

347
00:13:23,232 --> 00:13:24,799
But, I know
that the person will play dumb

349
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,967
even If a press for-a:confession

350
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:28,436
nd. the time limit will eventually come.

351
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:33,474
That's the real purpose behind all this
not the ransom

353
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,361
It's 16:00, only 30 minutessmore to go.

354
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:40,915
Where is the place
the hostage is confined!

356
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:48,890
Heygkid
what'resyou doing: staring at a map?

358
00:13:49,825 --> 00:13:53,226
I was just wondering .
Where the motorbike was headed.:for.

360
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:56,630
Whoro cols but tho hide out
wherc the hostage is:confined.

362
00:13:56,631 --> 00:13:59,400
That's why from the place
he picked up the ransom in Beika Park,

364
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:02,437
to the scene of the accident,
over here. if you draw.a line

366
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:03,504
beyond itlis...

367
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,275
Most likely. but Conan

368
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:12,213
) But, you canatstell if
its 10 or 100 kilometers away «#

370
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:15,116
Huh? there-swa place
with the same name as this house.

372
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,217
Huh?

373
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,219
Domoto... Metal Processing.

374
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:20,188
Oh. that's our factory

375
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:21,089
Oh, that's our factory.

376
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:25,259
But since we moved and built 1 inew one in
East Belka 6 months. ago.

378
00:14:25,628 --> 00:14:27,095
It's closed down now

379
00:14:27,096 --> 00:14:29,030
Which means it's no in use. anymore.

380
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:32,734
On. so nobody 1s there
or will come there anymore.

382
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:33,868
Inspector!

383
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:35,603
It's the idea place for confining someone.

384
00:14:35,604 --> 00:14:37,271
Very probable.

385
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:38,940
Conan. give me he map...!

386
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:40,274
Yes: sir~I

387
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:42,844
T.Then Father is'in that factory?

388
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,545
There's.a possibility he is)!

389
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,882
Y! B  *
Oh, there's only15 more minutes left.

391
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,553
Mrs. Doemoto,

393
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:53,921
Pops great phrase

394
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,625
Please hold up
another 15 minutes somehow.

396
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:08,736
Stop time stop .

00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:10,905

Give it to me. I'll open it...

399

Eathor

401
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:31,526
Mr Domoto

403
00:15:38,534 --> 00:15:39,600
Father!

404
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:40,635
F.Father...

405
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,372
Aghl!

Father. Father!

407
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:55,216
He's still breathing!

408
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:59,020
Oh, this is Takagi!
Please send an ambulance over.

410
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,288
The location is

411
00:16:08,497 --> 00:16:10,398
Mr. Domoto. get a hold of yourself!

412
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:19,874
Your wife will head for tho hospital

413
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:22,143

Agh. heh--7?

416
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:28,649
Please wait Mr. Domoto.

417
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:30,251
Huh. why.

418
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:30,752
Huh why .

419
00:16:30,753 --> 00:16:31,786
Aaagh!

420
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,588
He's transformed into the Sleeping Kogoro!

421
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:34,922
Mr. Mouri?!

422
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:40,561
I believe that Mr. Domoto will be all right.

423
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:45,850
regardless of whether you hope
otherwise. Akinari...

425
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:49,487
Hope otherwise...

426
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:51,439
Just what do you mean?

427
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:53,074
The minute I found out that

428
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:57,912
this kidnapping was not
after ransom! realized.

430
00:16:57,913 --> 00:17:02,283
According to what Conan
heard from Masayo. the housekeeper...

433
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:05,653
You and Mitsuko really got along.
And got married loving each other.

435
00:17:05,654 --> 00:17:10,558
But, after you entered the Domoto family
as her wedded husband

437
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:15,195
tough days of being criticized by
Mr. Domoto for not being ambitious

439
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:18,766
OF ROR Olax) RR Or HOH)
an heir continued everyday.

441
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,136
You most naturally hated Mr Domote
and thought.

443
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:22,403
You d like to erase him from this world

444
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:25,439
you'd like to erase him from this world .

446
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,945
But you didn't have the courage to do so .

447
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:34,081
Therefore. you thought up this scheme.

448
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,683
Scheme...?

449
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,019
On't be ridiculous
Just what're you talking about?

451
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,053
I know nothing of it!

452
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:42,890
Noll The culprit is Akinari,
Inspector Megure.

454
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:43,991
Whaaat?!

455
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:45,960
It.It can't be

456
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:48,762
OX OORO Wk LAoKne ope

458
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:50,865
At that tum) Akmnra was...

459
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,434
Domg work in my study!

460
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:55,803
I wonder If that's true?

461
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,606
When going into the study you...

462
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:01,342
Masayo~I'm going to concentrate on work,

463
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,644
SO you don't have to bring me
8021 OF oR y

465
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:04,846
so you don't have to bring me
tea or an thing

467
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:08,516
And. after saying so. to Masayo

468
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,318
you wore the shoes

469
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,185
that you prepared beforehand...

470
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,695
.- ve
You 'caught up with Mr. Domoto
who was taking a walk

474
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:22,195
and got him to gel in the gr.

475
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,450
We av ay
What on earth do you
ant to talk to me about

478
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:28,152
bringing me to a place like this

479
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:30,637
I tell you. what kind of man are you...

480
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:33,241
If you have something you want to say,
get to the point

482
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,743
Uuugh...

483
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:38,045
Oh no. Akinari. take me home quickly

484
00:18:38,614 --> 00:18:40,414
I...don't have my medicine with me.

485
00:18:46,188 --> 00:18:48,422
Heave. heave

486
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,666
Aklnarl. it's-for you

487
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,241
What, kidnap ?!

488
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:11,345
And... you acted out the role of the victim.

489
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:12,762
Hmm...

490
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:15,349
Of course there Is evidence too

491
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,852
The same kind of machine oil

492
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,687
that is smeared over
the floor of this factory.

494
00:19:19,688 --> 00:19:21,289
Should be found on the frame of
the window frame of your study.

496
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,723
Should be found on the frame of
the window frame of your study.

498
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:25,893
Showing that you went out and
GOEL) DOG IR AU OW ow

500
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:28,896
Iyn sure that the tissue paper
that you used to wipe it off

502
00:19:28,897 --> 00:19:30,932
can also be found
somewhere in the room...

504
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
And. above all your footprints

505
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:36,037
when you went in and out of your study
are left on the ground.

507
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:40,841
From the Domoto residence to here,
it takes an hour to « 0 and come back...

510
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,411
It was possible for you to commit the crime

511
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:47,848
between 10:00 to 11:00, the time
you were confined to your study

513
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:49,717
Hmm. It is possible

514
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:50,217
Hmm. it is possible

515
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:52,219
but he didn't have to do it himself

516
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:56,173
He could've made the guy Hirano
that he hired do it, couldn't he?

518
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:58,291
That man was probably not told

519
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:01,762
that ho was londing a hand to kidnapping...

520
00:20:02,664 --> 00:20:03,764

527
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,934
Akin 1skod Hirano to do just two things.

528
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:10,304
Call T1818? 11110033110. and 14:00.

529
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:14,508
Thon pick up 1 trunk at Boika Park

532
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:17,979
It s for your bancofit not to know
what's inside the trunk or who I am.

534
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:22,016
Because if he tells of his scheme,
Hirano would hold his weak point

536
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:27,355
And, aware that his wife was going out,
he decided tocarr out his scheme toda

539
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:29,757
What? Kidnapped father?!

540
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:31,993
Ransom...

541
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:33,427
Boika Park...

542
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:36,130
In other words...
he was acting the conversation out alone!

546
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:50,411
Yes. only If Hirano didn't
get into an accident...

548
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:52,512
Tho monoy could bo rotriovod lator,

549
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:55,649
and the scheme would've worked out fine,

550
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:58,519
with neither the police
or the detective showing up...

552
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:04,558
All he had to do was preten
to be worried about Shosaburo and wait.

554
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:07,895
Exactly

555
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:11,432
But. the motive is not correct. Mr. Mourl

556
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:17,137
It's true that I hated him
I did want him to disappear

558
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,640
but, that's not all.

559
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,476
I wanted to show my wife

560
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:24,779
how hard I tried to get
the money together.

562
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:27,448
I thought that if she saw that.

563
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:31,018
Her love for me would
return once again...

taking his Angor out
on you: too from now on.

616

In order to make you a fine heir,

618
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:28,335
Father deliberately took on the hated role
and act U it out.

620
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:31,839
Because father actually likes you.
He always says.
