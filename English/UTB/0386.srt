The musical tone of the: famed musical
instrument brinc s about murder

00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,259
The disaster that befalls a family
of musicians takes an unexpected turn!

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,660
He sees through the one and only truth

10
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,050
We were summoned by Ms. Hasuki Shitara

11
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,752
and wentito visit Choichiro Shitara's
residence. Pops. Ran and I

13
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:03,422
Hasuki had called us

14
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,756
because incomprehensible
accidents revolving

16
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,625
around the famed musical
instrument Stradivarius

18
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,660
have been occurring consecutively
from the year before last.

20
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,429
Her request was for us
to investigate these accidents

22
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,900
However, as soon as we got the «,
the annex went up In flames!

24
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,704
Genzaburo whe was inside. dies

25
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,108
Um. who's cigarette butt is this?

26
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,011
It doesn't look to be Pop's.

27
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,013
That brand...

28
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,716
is what Great Uncle Genzaburo
used to smoke.

30
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,150
COO 10 lil Of IR,

00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,653

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,473
this is...

34
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:41,793
Hey sonny. where are you going!

36
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,696
Just as I thought

37
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:48,667
This Is not an accident

38
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,335
but murder

39
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,753
Morever,

40
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,572
If MM deduction is correct

41
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,541
the next target is...

47
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,850
What~"?

48
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:07,486
You mean this fire Is arson?!

49
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,289
Yep. The cause of the fire is
because he fell asleep while smoking

51
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,341
and the source of the fire is
around this ashtray

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,460
See. look at this cigarette butt

55
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:20,399
and this is the cigarette that Genzaburo
was smoking back at the main house

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,001
the brand is the same

59
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:25,103
and there's nothing odd about it .

60
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,872
Agh. there a trace of it being bitten

61
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,140
See...

62
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,025
Just like you Pops

63
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,813
People who work and talk while they smoke

64
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,915
havea habit of biting the filter of their cigarette.

65
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,918
But there is no trace of
this cigarette butt being bitten

67
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,720
Don't you think it's strange?

68
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,755
I see...

69
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,792
In order to make it look
as If he fell asleep smoking. someone...

71
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,028
What you want to say is that
the killer smoked several cigarettes

73
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,000
before setting the place on
fire. right?!

75
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,001
Before setting the place on
Ii, [nil

77
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:56,335
before setting the place on
fire. right?!

79
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,004
But, the door of this room

80
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,406
can only be locked from the inside

81
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,508
How'd the killer leave the room then?

82
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,347
You've come across an idea of the kind of
trick that may have been used. right?

84
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,415
Oh.no not et

85
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,717
You're just a kid after all

86
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,619
He could've just happened to bite
the cigarette

88
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,922
that he smoked back
at the main house. you know.

90
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,323
Besides.

91
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:22,277
Genzaburo used to hate
people cleaning up his room.

93
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:25,397
Isn't It strange that

94
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,233
there isn't even one cigarette filter
that has bite traces?

96
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,068
There's nothing strange about it

97
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:35,374
Because Genzaburo used to always
throw out the rubbish before going out.

99
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,011
But, it's amazing ho
ou dashed out of the room

101
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,046
Well, the fact is, this kid informed me

102
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,082
But if he threw out the rubbish,
it's strange after all,

104
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,485
that he would smoke several cigarettes
before falling asleep.

106
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,788
You fool~That's not unusual at all

107
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:54,459
He probably got sleepy
when he was smoking his last cigarette.

109
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,614
That could be it, but

110
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:01,033
I wonder if it's okay?

111
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,201
This could be a case of serial murder.

112
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,071
WwW. What?!

113
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,739
You shouldn't make such

If what all these.people have in common is

130
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:41,173
the birthday of thelhead of this household,
Mr. Choic iro Shitara

132
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,643
It could be as the kid says.
There's something fish going on?

Oh no! We can't leave her alone!

138
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:02,326
What! I'm the next target?

139
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,496
Oh no. no way

140
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,898
alphabetically your name is next In line...

141
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,435
Now that you mentioned it, its true that
starting with Father Danjiro's initial D

143
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:13,004
it continues E~F=G in alphabetical order

144
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,040
Ah, come on It's just a coincidence,
fun. fun.

146
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,177
I. guess so. aha. ha

147
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,079
But. we have a problem

148
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,414
What about tonight's: requiem?

149
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,415
Requiem?

150
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,717
It's been a. custom for generations I
n the Shtiara family

152
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:30,422
that when someone passes away,
someone plays the requiem.

154
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,758
Genzaburo played til last year

155
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:37,562
Besides, Mr. and Mrs. Shitara is
in No condition to play as you can see.

157
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,898
I can't possibly play either!

158
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,301
Okay. I guess I'll play it then.

159
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,903
Why don't you all join us too?

160
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,390
Alive pefférmance by. \ osuke Ega is not

161
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:49,474
something you can listen to everyday,
you know

163
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:50,975
Oh...

165
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,645
But, most of tho musical instruments
were in the annex

167
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,782
The only instruments left are
the piano and that...

169
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,152
Hey. hey. not that Stradivari

170
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,453
my hands'll shake

171
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,688
You can use my violin. then...

172
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,359
No I'll use the one I usually use
that's in my car,

174
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,228
although it'll never comc close to that
famed -musicalainstrumaoent

176
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,596
that was made 300 years ago.

177
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,800
It's the only gift that Father ever gave me

179
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,368
When it comes to tone quality
It's second to none...

181
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,287
I don't want to use that
famed musical instrument again

183
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:20,372
and have something happen.

184
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,457
Besides, if I take it out without
asking Aunt Ayane,

186
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,493
I think she'll be troubled.

187
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,313
Huh...Be troubled?

188
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,066
For Mrs. Shitara that Stradivarius is

189
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,985
her son Furuto*himself.

190
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,788
That famed musical instrument
that Furutorplayed

192
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,291
in front of Mr. Shitara"
just before hissdeath'is

194
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,596
$0. ever since then, at tho stroke of midnight

195
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,298
1 ol MN

197
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,217
Does Choichiro know about this?!

198
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,885
Yes. most likely

199
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,887
The storeroom for the Stradivari is

200
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,923
between Grandfather
and Grandmother's room

202
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,129
I'm sure that Grandmother still sees

203
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,666
my Father Furuto back then, in her heart

204
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,823
Then, I shall begin

205
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,260
Composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,
Requiem

208
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,529
Concerto in D major K-626

211
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,251
How nice!

212
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,586
Yes.

213
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:20,158
Uncle Kyosuke graduated a music university
in Germany with honors...

215
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,295
Uh. why did he open the window, Kyosuke?

216
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,898
Probably so that Grandfather and
Grandmother could listen to him play too

218
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,168
Grandmother's bedroom Is right above.

219
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:40,678
Ou mean that grandmother's room
Is connected with grandfather's room

221
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,981
with the storeroom of the Stradivari
in between?

224
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:46,784
If locked from the inside you cannot go
through from the storeroom

226
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:50,589
You can gosinside from the corridor though,
with the master: key that Ms. Tsumagari has

228
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,858
Oh, they sleep in different rooms
even if they're marrieds

230
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,194
Grandfather is a heavy smoker

231
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,663
and Grandmother hated the smoke

232
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,066
NXE) GION Y GR Windle) Gg 0 Conk
with lung cancer.

234
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:07,072
If Grandfather dies who's going to receive
that expensive violin?

236
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,841
Great Uncle Genzaburo would have

237
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,576
Maybe Grandmother?

238
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,545
I wonder what Grandfather will do.

239
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,050
I feel that it Is most appropriate

240
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:23,321
for a musical genius like
Incle + osuke to have it. though.

242
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,957
Conan, listen quietly, will you.

243
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,277
Hmm... what's that sound?

244
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,862
D.Don't tell me that was?!

246
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,182
G.Grandmother.

247
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,053
Hurry, get an ambulance!

248
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:30,221
Yes. sir!

249
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,534
Grandmother's name is "Ayane
so her Initial is...

251
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,170
What does this mean?

252
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,444
I won't give it to anybody...It's mine.

253
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,648
Where's the storeroom?

254
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,049
To the right beyond

256
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,923
The door Is locked from Inside

257
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,558
And the chair beside the window...

258
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,594
Could it be suicide after all?

259
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:19,904
Well. well

260
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,707
Mr. Mourl. another encounter with Death. eh.

261
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,744
Oh come on...It's mere coincidence.

262
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,811
Inspector, and besides

263
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,180
it's the saga of renown detectives.

264
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,416
To become involved in cases
Iike these no matter where they go

266
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,885
Then. I'd rather you stay still at home.

267
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,355
The estimated time of the incident
is around midnight.

269
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,790
The site Is that window on the 3rd floor

270
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:40,825
It seems to be her bedroom.

271
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:44,062
Hmm... Where were you at that time?

272
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,298
Yes sir, I was in the room
right below with everyone else

274
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,834
Iistening to Kyosuke playing the Requiem.

275
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,034
Requiem?

276
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,470
Yes,

277
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,105
it seems to have been a custom handed down

278
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,940
for generations at the Shitara residence.

279
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,178
Oh, Genzaburo, who burned to death
was the youngest of 3 brothers

281
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,547
The oldest Is Choichiro

282
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,549
The 2nd son Danjiro,
who dacd 30 years ago as Kyosuke's father

284
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,368
So, famed detective,
what do you think her motive for suicide was?

286
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,790
So, famed detective,
what do you think her motive for suicide was?

288
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,825
Well, as to that...l have no idea yet

289
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,395
Uh...ll think it's the violin.

290
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:21,266
Oh, she's the steward for the Shitara family...

291
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,402
Let's go to Mrs. Shitara's room.

292
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:29,174
Ooh, T...This is?!
Straduvarius.

294
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,110
Don't tell me that a robber broke in

295
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,112
and Ayane fell out the window accidentally...

296
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,948
But. this room was locked

297
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,484
There are no signs of any struggling either

298
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,287
There are-no-signs of anyone having come
in here either.

300
00:13:42,554 --> 00:13:44,923
The violin was probably already broke by someone

301
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,724
before Mrs. Shitara opened the case

302
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,326
Maybe it was from that shock.

303
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,763
But, would she do something like:ithat
just because a musical instrument broke...

305
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,130
Don't you know,

306
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:56,835
that violin is a legendary violin
that costs several billions of.yen!

308
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:02,407
Moreover Ayane was chenshimg it
as if it were the double of her son. who died

310
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,209
If someone broke it

311
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,544
I'm pretty sure thay
she'd feel like jumping out the window re

313
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,712
Wrong
What ..7?

315
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,549
I think she broke it herself.

316
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,551
Not again. this brat

317
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,154
By herself what makes you think so?

318
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,324
See. look at the new scratch on that table

319
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,827
Grandmother probably
threw this violin against it

321
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,495
Y.You idiot!

322
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,398
She's not like Inspector Megure
who knows nothing of violins you know

324
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,135
She would never do something like that!

325
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,404
Yep. I think so too.

326
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,174
But. that's only if this violin is genuine

327
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,775
WARE: 3

328
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,884
Look at the label that 1s stuck to
the inside of the violin

330
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,120
The mark says "GA"

331
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,990
If Antonio Stradivari made it

332
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,826
the label should show "A Sl

333
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,260
Hmm... Huh!

334
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,062
Hmm. Huh!

335
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,798
How come you know something like that?!

336
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,403
Oh, uh 'Shinichi told me so some time ago

337
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,939
You mean that detective kid?!

338
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,277
Come to think of it, Shinichi was
really knowledgeable when it came to violins

340
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:18,082
Maybe because Holmes used to play it?

341
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,385
[he violin maker who made that violin

342
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,855
was just being playful and put his initial
on the mark that was a replica of the real one.

344
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,791
The replica is also famous

345
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,294
and a large amount had been made
since some time ago.

347
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,297
See. underneath the label

348
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,832
It says sMade In Germany

349
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,101
It's a 100% replica.

350
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,236
He's

351
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,205
Kyosuke that I mentioned a while ago.

352
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:45,610
Oh, can you tell me who wastdlistening
to his Requiem in the room below?

354
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,345
Yes. sir, Ran and I

355
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,047
that kid over there

356
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:52,483
Hawks, and the steward, Ms. Tsumagari,
all four of us

358
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,853
And Ayane fell to her death
during this performance

360
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,992
But, why did Grandmother
have to commit suicide

362
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:06,698
after Uncle Kyosuke risked his life to save
her from the flames .

364
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,634
Save her?

365
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,837
Yes. \ osuke and Conan saved Ayane

366
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,472
who didn't make it in time out of \the fire...

367
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,609
I still don't understand.

368
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,645
Why did she break the replica?

369
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,414
Don't tell me she thought
It was genuine all this time

371
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:25,616
but realized only now that it was a replica...

372
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,418
That's isn't possible.

373
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,654
Mr. Shitara's violin has been appraised

374
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,756
and is guaranteed to be genuine

377
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,960
But this case is genuine.

378
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,333
Isn't this the one?

379
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:42,734
Ang

380
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,901
&rafd father
org 7

382
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,304
It was hidden*behind the bed

384
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,107
That Ayane, she dare treat it so carelessly.
Ang

386
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,976
It has the label of Antonio Stradivari.

387
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,412
SO this is genuine.

388
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,315
When I saw it I knew it was.

389
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,083
Would you like -me to play it?

390
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,785
No. that won't be necessary if you:say so.

391
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,221
What we see is good enough

392
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,906
If so. what onfearth Is that?

393
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:11,529
Maybe another Stradivaii was
placed here to surprise everyone

395
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,765
But, after finding out that it was a replica,
she was shocked and. /

397
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,799
Uswax

398
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,235
so before her husband finds out-that
she spent.a lot of money on trash

400
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,536
she committed suicide

401
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,172
Oh~if so everything falls into place.

402
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,390
Wrong!

403
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,909
When I came into this room-a while ago

404
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,178
When I came into this room a while ago,
I checked the bed but nothing was there!

406
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,047
I'm sure that someone...

407
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,915
came to secretly replace the replica hat was

408
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,150
once exchanged for the genuine Stradivari,

409
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,885
again with the genuine one

410
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,789
Somebody for some reason
came intO this room after I did and...

412
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,856
Conan

413
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:42,693
Oh.maybe you should check
the fingerprints that are on it.

415
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,097
Well, I'm sure you'll find fingerprints
everywhere though

417
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,700
Mine too. all over the place

418
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,070
Because I was tuning the Stradivari
In preparation for Uncle Cholchlrds birthday

420
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,739
since yesterday afternoon.

421
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,107
In this room?

424
00:17:56,108 --> 00:18:00,812
I handed it over to Hasuki after that . right?

425
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:05,416
Yes, I played it a little too,
s@ my fingerprints are-also on it...

427
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,152
Was there anyone else there back then?

428
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,956
I was alone Uncle Kyosuke left

429
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,858
taking Grandmother with him to the garden,
so that-she wouldn't bother me.

431
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:20,331
I was showing Mr. Mouri the Stradivar
when he. arrived a while later

433
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:23,000
then we saw the annex on fire

434
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:23,301
And In the meantime,
I took the-Stradivari that was left

436
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,704
And, in the meantime,
I took the Stradivari that was left

438
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,574
as is on the table, to the storeroom

439
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,594
Hmm. which means anyone of you

440
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:37,482
could've switched the violin.

441
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:41,519
But, Inspector, that doesn't matter now,
does it?

443
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,225
The genuine one is back ind that kid over
there is just saying what he wishes.)

446
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,993
But.-something's strange about this Ii éident!

447
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:52,630
What's so strange!
This room was locked.

449
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,366
And the door of that
storeroom was locked too.

451
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,070
Moreover, there is a chair by the window
No matter how you look at it, it's suicide.

453
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,073
Where's the spare key to this room?

454
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,442
Other than what Mrs. Shitara was using.

455
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,777
I have the master key.

456
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:10,381
Inspector. I found the key among
the belongings of the corpse

458
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,750
Hmm..l see.

459
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,753
Seo. this is not 1 serial murdor case.

460
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,122
Serial murder?!

461
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,158
Well. according to this kid. he says that

462
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,160
the wings started 30 years
ago with the initial of the names

464
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,528
of thggmembers of the family.

465
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,497
D-E-RG in alphabetical order.

466
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,568
But, after the letter 'G of Genzaburo
who died in the fire

468
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,435
Ayane, with the initial "A"
committed suicide.

470
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:35,906
That Is. there was no connection.

471
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:37,141
Oh.maybe

472
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,077
it's the musical scale?
What?!

476
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,512

Benio Tsumagari...

486
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:04,785
You mean the next target is 17?

487
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,471
Come to think of it:..80:years ago

488
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,758
when I first started working here,
Mr Shitara. mentioned.

490
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,044
If you belongedito our family.

491
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,247
We could go right up:the scale from C.to B"

492
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:20,268
I see, since Choichiro starts with.a C",

493
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,720
that'll make €-D-E-F-G-A-B.

494
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,971
Tho entire musical scale.

495
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,958
Phooey wonder
If I said something like that.

497
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:32,063
Well I'd like you all to wait
inside your rooms for now. then!

499
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,000
Inspector, they're her footprints!

500
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,637
From the looks of it, it seems
she jumped down without a tinge of hesitation

502
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,540
Without a tinge of hesitation...eh?

503
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,559
Inspector. I'm sure that,it's suicide after all.

505
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,712
I mean this room, was locked

507
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,548
Come to think of It,

508
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,184
the room that Genzabure burned
to death in was also locked

510
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:56,203
Before the fire, everyone was at the annex

511
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,490
so the anyone of the four
could've set fire to it But

513
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,461
this room was also locked

514
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,329
m sure there's something to it .

515
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,550
Uh. what's that?

516
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:12,637
See by the top of the window,
there's: something transparent

518
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,438
That square thing

519
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,410
Is it a scotch tape or something?

520
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,178
There is the same to the right too.

521
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:30,488
Uh. Mr. Mouri was asking

522
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:34,225
if you saw anything
strange near the corpse.

524
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:36,927
Come to think of it

525
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,267
Oh, and one more thing.

526
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,836
There was something
that looked like the tip of a chopstick...

528
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:50,675
Yeah,

529
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,411
we found something that looked
to be thesburnt remains of a case

531
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,945
Right,

532
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,981
shaped something like this,

533
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,784
and maybe two thin sticks would fit into it

534
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,520
Which means that there was nothing
In the case right?!

536
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,588
Right

537
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:08,059
if that is used, it would be possible to kill
Ayane .

539
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,928
The only thing left to solve is
the locked room mystery.

541
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,322
I see. so that's the story...

anything with solving the mystery

596

Cacophony

598
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,489
