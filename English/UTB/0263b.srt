1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:04,937
The heart contains mysteries,
stars and snow sparkle for the two.

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,841
Naniwa is the stage for
a tag team match of Conan and Heiji

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,144
He sees throligh the one and. only truth,
a child in appearance with the IQ. of an-adult

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,680
No case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan

9
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:56,148
OSAKA DOUBLE MYSTERY
THE NANIWA SWORDSMAN AND
HIDEYOSHI TOYOTOMI'S CASTLE

12
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:02,555
The question is, who the killer is and
how Mr. Tarumi was moved!

14
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,690
We know how

15
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,524
Heh?

16
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,493
One of mysmen just questioned
some of the kids

18
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,296
that were hanging around
the entrance:to.the annex

20
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,164
and it seems theyssaw the killer

21
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,899
A suspicious character came out of here

22
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,370
wearing a mask and protective gear
carrying a gear bag...

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,106
A mask, protective gear and
a gedtrbag...?

26
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:24,376
I see! The killer put
. » ~~
arumi Iinsice ye gear rag

29
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,912
and wore a mask to cover his face so no one
would recognize him when he walked out!

31
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,916
When did that-guy
wearing the mask come:out?

33
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:35,521
It seems it was after the
3 left-the<annex: after finding the body

35
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:42,128
So it: means that the person who moved
the body was not one.of the 3 who found it...

37
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:45,464
That's right...the killer was
probably hiding in the storage room

39
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,600
when the 3 came in
and found Mr. Tarumfs body.

41
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:53,339
He didn't think the body would be found
SO SOON, SO he moved it here

43
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,343
Excuse me Inspector Otaki\, r
but did Heiji come here?

45
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,147
Yes...he was here for awhile
but he rushed off for some place

47
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,924
It's no use...

48
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,528
No matter what you do,

49
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,732
you can't make it look like
Mr. Tarumi was killed in this storage room...

51
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,667
Mr. Kotegawal!

52
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,541
That's right...
this isn't where Mr. Tarumi was killed...!

54
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,943
He was killed in the
Iocker room beside the pool

56
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:36,549
After you fellows found Mr. Tarumi's body.
Mr. Omotani and Mr. Doguchi left

58
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,818
You alone came back

59
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,088
and told him to go to the locker room,
that's where you killed him...

61
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,490
Isn't that right...?

62
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,228
How stupid...it was pure coincidence that
they left the storage room!

64
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,230
If someone had stayed behind,

65
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,699
I wouldn't have been able to come back and
do what you claim I did, now would I?

67
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,301
No. it was No coincidence....!

68
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,371
All you had to do was tell Mr. Omotani to
go get the police

70
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,640
to guarantee no one would be left

71
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,709
You knew Mr. Doguchfs personality.
Whenever something happened,

73
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,178
he always reported it to
Mr Hakamata and besides,

75
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,980
he can't stand the sight of blood...

76
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,515
You knew he wouldn't touch the body,

77
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,318
that he'd immediately
go to find Mr. Hakamata...!

79
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,123
You gave Mr. Tarumi liquor
Iaced with sleep inducers

81
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,926
then you put redgpaint on him
to make him appear dead,

83
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,730
no one would think he was alive!

84
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,600
This storage room is dark so the
red paint would look like real blood!

86
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:29,668
Humph.

87
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,403
There were a lot of people in front of
the annex, if somebody covered with

89
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,407
red paint came out of here,don't you think
some one was bound to notice?

91
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,243
Yes, they did...

92
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:39,044
they saw a suspicious character
wearing a mask

94
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,447
and protective gear come out of
the annex carrying a gear bag!

96
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,715
Aw come on,

97
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,384
I hope you're not saying that
at was Tarumi...?

99
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,920
What makes you think

100
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,457
he'd dress himself up like that to go to the
Iocker room just because I told him to.

102
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,660
It wasn't just what you said...

103
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,070
If you were shown something like this
while you were groggy.

105
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,939
You could be talked into doing anything....!

106
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,875
He:said I'm going to kill you*=+?!

107
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,079
Mr. Tarumi was always saying that?

108
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,750
Yes, it seems he had a grudge
against Mr. Hakamata

110
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,350
the other team members, told me that

111
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:20,753
So that means

112
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:25,691
there's a possibility Mr. Hakamata killed
Mr. Tarumi instead!

114
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,092
Hhmm

115
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:29,895
No. that's wrong....!

116
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,566
The killer probably took advantage of
Mr Tarumws anger...

118
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,369
That's right,
when you came back here alone,

120
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,706
you put the Japanese sword in
Mr. Tarumi's hand.

122
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,376
Woke him up and showed him the doll you'd
hidden inside the vaulting horse beforehand.

124
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,378
Then you probably said this to him...!

125
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,582
What in the world have you done!!!

126
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,753
Mr. Tarumi hated Mr. Hakamata and
he was still in a groggy state of mind...

128
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,358
So he didn't notice that it was just the doll
used to teach life saving techniques

130
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,961
wearing Mr. Hakamata's uniform...!

131
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,900
That's why he thought the red paint on his
chest guard was Mr. Hakamata's blood

133
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:12,438
and that he'd killed him
hile he was drunk...!

135
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,975
That's when you probably told him that
you'd let him get away

137
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,043
before the police arrived
so he should put the mask on

139
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:23,048
and sneak into the locker room
beside the pool and hide there

141
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,453
And you also suggested he change out of
his bloody clothes, put on the protective gear

143
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,322
and put the sword into the bag
for the bamboo sword.

145
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,524
Then told him to take them with him,
didn't you!

147
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,861
You put the extra clothes and
protective gear in the gear bag

149
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,930
and had it hidden it in the storage room...!

150
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,866
That's so it would appear like
someone else besides you

152
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,403
carried the body out of the
storage room wearing a mask...!

154
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,774
Then you took a short cut to the
Iocker room

156
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,510
and waited for Mr. Tarumi to arrive

157
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,112
and then you killed him for real...

158
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,651
After-that. you washed the paint off of
his body in the shower

160
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,321
put the mask and protective gear
in the gear bag.

162
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,323
And after you hid them somewhere,

163
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,393
you went to the police box
where you'd sent Mr. Omotani!

165
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,861
That's when you did it. right?

166
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:12,064
That's when you got Mr. Tarumi's blood
on the towel you're holding now...

168
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:16,001
When you went to get the doll from
inside the vaulting horse,

170
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,137
you decided to smear his blood on it

171
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:23,008
so that it'd look like he really was
killed here, isn't that right?

173
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,549
That bloody towel in your hand proves that
you killed him!!

175
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,086
Humph...

176
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,757
If you know so much then
you probably know why I did it...

179
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,495
I called the college you go to and
checked up on you...

181
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:47,166
I found out that last year, one of the
new members of your kendo team

183
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,437
Iost consciousness during practice and
died...!

185
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:57,109
The college claimed
it was an accident but the truth is...

187
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,976
That's right,

188
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,246
we were initiating the new members,

189
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,049
Tarumi didn't know his own strength,
e overdid it...

191
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,587
Hakamata was officiator but
e was absent that day...

193
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,789
This is what Tarumi said...

194
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,324
Sure I'm the one who did it

195
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,661
but everyone present here today and
the manager is just as guilty....!

197
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,996
If anyone talks,
I'm taking everybody down with me

199
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:23,035
So you decided to shut him up
so he couldn't ruin it for all of you

201
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,304
since this is a important phase in your lives
being as you've all got jobs lined up!

203
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,906
Humph, I guess you know everything...

204
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:33,912
but seeing as you aren't armed,
you didn't know about this, did you...

206
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,516
The fast draw demonstrator had
a partner...

208
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:42,421
naturally, when I went into the demonstrator's
dressing room to steal the sword,

210
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,223
I'd already...

211
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,325
taken a few
practice swings with itl!

213
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,596
Enh?!

214
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,999
A'strange man called and told you
come to the locker room...?

216
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,367
R. really

217
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,534
Uh. yes...

218
00:08:56,535 --> 00:09:00,939
and when they all arrived. they found
Mi Tarumi had been moved here

220
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:05,377
The reason the killer called to give
Mr. Tarumi's location was.

222
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,247
He didn't want the storage room
to be searched...

224
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,650
which means, there's something
he doesn't want found still inside...

226
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,387
Hey. where is the storage room?

227
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,056
It's in the annex next to the gym, why...?

228
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:19,825
Show me!

229
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:20,058
Show me!

230
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,460
Whoa, slow down...

231
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,928
@Oonan, where are you going?

232
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:26,932
Don't be a fool!

233
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,669
You won't be able to get away with it
this time if you kill me here!

235
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,538
I'm not worried!

236
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,140
The police"ll assume it's the same Killer

237
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,544
and since they've already decided
I couldn't have moved Tarumi's body,

239
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,880
they won't even suspect me...

240
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,349
I've already figured everything out!!

241
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,157
Wha?!

242
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,496
You picked the wrong guy to fight with

243
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,097
hat the...?

244
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,433
Hattori...?!

245
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,735
I donstibelieve it.

246
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,537
You're that high school kid that
shocked everybody by beating

248
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:10,342
the entire Osaka Police" Department's team,
and they're all well trained...

250
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,345
That's right...but you realized it too late...

251
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,481
Yuranosuke

253
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,356
Yo! Good to see you!

254
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,324
He. Heiji...?!

255
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,367
Well Otakl_ lhll létfouftake MT-from here

256
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,237
You can count on me!
Best of luc «to you too Heiji!

258
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,772
I almost forgot!
The match. the.match!

260
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,841
We: can't waste our time
standing around here. .!

264
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,315
Think it's already over...

265
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,050
Oh well. it couldn't be helped...!

266
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,053
We lost the championship but
solved the case....!

268
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:55,921

00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,127

274

00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,629
You can tell he's the son of the
@€hief of Police!

He solved the case in no time!

287
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,967
Thank you

288
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:46,705
This kid solves cases purely on intuition,
he's just playing detective.

290
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,042
He doesn't even come close to being
a real detective like you Mr. Mourn

292
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,976
So what's that supposed to mean...

293
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,979
