Yeah that.ssfthe one...

39
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,363
I used to sing it a lot

00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,967
And Jd What about it?
Is it your music homework or something?

43
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,238
No! Remember the number I mentioned
the other.da 08582)

46
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,441
When I use my cell phone
and hit the buttons rhythmically

48
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,977
it sounds like the beginning part
of that song fight

50
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:35,180
0858...crow oh crow.

51
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,983
Let me sce Let me try?!

52
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,258
T True...

53
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,061
It finally came back to me...

54
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,732
That back then
when Bellmot was sendingfmail to the boss

56
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,336
I fellysomewhat sad and nostalgic.

57
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,073
But it wasn't the expression on her face,
that made me feel that way.

59
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,142
Sit was the sound of the buttons
she was pushing!

61
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,280
What?t T Then are you saying
that the mail address of their boss

63
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,949
is The Seven Baby Crows"?!

64
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,387
It canst be!

65
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,457
Why would the boss use a children's song
for his mail address?

67
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,995
What if they remembered the address
by the melody?

69
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,664
B.By the melody?

70
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:30,469
Yeah ..then they wouldn't have to register
the mail address inside their cell phone.

72
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,672
Which makes it safe?
For a variety of reasons. right

74
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:39,411
0858 may sound like "crow oh crow" but...

75
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,016
Why do you cry is not se casy...

77
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,021
Well. it's true that it's not all that accurate

78
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,624
but if wÃ©ymake do
with the slight difference in sound...

80
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,294
and put it together

81
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,897
It comes out like this...?

82
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,969
This is the mail address
of the boss of the'men in black!

84
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:04,703

85
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:04,970
WwW. I What?!

86
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,491
Whaaaa

88
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,028
