1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:02,101
Just as' flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,070
the breeze is invisible, deductions
take all shapes and styles

4
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,638
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,807
The case is solved by a person's feelings.

6
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,742
I want to find out how Ran really feels.

7
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,544
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,646
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,115
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

12
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:02,121
Pops only has 6 months to go...!"!

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,358
But it turns out to be Pops' mistake...

14
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,560
Pops was told to stay away
from alcohol for 6 months.

16
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:12,430
Dr. Araide invites us to stay fordinner
at his house. However...

18
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,500
After an instant of black out,

19
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:21,440
Dr. Araide was found
deadqin the bath tub!!

21
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,743
Fit

23
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:28,647
Fit
Blind Spot in the Darkness" Part ll

25
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,048
z= Dr

27
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,118
You're a doctor and coach
of a basketball club as well?

29
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:34,519
You can ask Ran about me.

30
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,792
I coach at Teitan High School,
the school that«she goes to.

32
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:47,132
Don't tell me that Ran's going to
that karate class everyday because...

34
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,803
she wants to see him?!

35
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,773
Co Is that right, R

36
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,977
Yes, you can verify the fact
If you contact the high school.

38
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,846
So I'm going to clinic now.

39
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,847
Ok...

40
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,452
Oh, and I want you to come
to the clinic too, Grandma.

42
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,322
You can't fool me!
I see you've been trying hide the fact

44
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,257
that something is wrong with your leg
when you walk, since some time ago.

48
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,063
Hey...

49
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,732
What happened here?!

50
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,735
When the lights went out
and I came down here,

52
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,137
I stepped on something strange!

53
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,275
May I go to help him treat everyone?

54
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,410
Sure, go ahead.

55
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,681
Inspector!! I've verified the person that

56
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,750
Yoko was talking to on the
phone when the lights went out!

58
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,085
Oh and?

59
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,321
According to the person
she was talking to,

61
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,291
the time it took since Yoko told her that
the lights went out to the time she reported

63
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:50,096
that the lights went back on,
was about a minute!

65
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:55,000
I'd like to hear from Yoko what they were
talking about, and see if they match.

67
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:56,635
Will you tell us?

68
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,106
Yes, after I finish
help him treat everyone.

70
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:05,211
H...if it's okay with yo
I can go help him instead.

72
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,147
I'm pretty good atwdoing things like this.

73
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,082
Oh, then will you?

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,017
Huh?

75
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,687
The contents of
they say they talked about match...

77
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,022
A catch phone came in, and their
conversation was interrupted

79
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,891
only for a matter of 6 to 7 seconds...

80
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:23,896
There is no doubt that Yoko was
on the phone right through the black out.

82
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,697
True...

83
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,564
Why, of course!

84
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:31,103
If you have the blueprint of this house,
I would like to take a look at it...

86
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,972
Yes, of course...

87
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,843
This is the bath tub where your
husband was electrocuted to death...

89
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:42,114
So, this is the kitchen where we are now.

90
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:42,848
Yes...

91
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:45,251
Uh, where's the breaker?4

92
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,721
Go left the corridor in front of the kitchen

93
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:53,225
then go left twice, and turn
right once... It's over here.

95
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:58,597
Hikaru left the kitchen to check the
breaker at just about the same time

97
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:04,270
that you were telling Masae
about the black out on the phone?

99
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:04,937
Yes...

100
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,474
If so, isn't one minute much too long?

101
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:12,211
It looks to me that it wouldn't take
30 seconds to get to the breaker.

103
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:16,282
Hikaru is a newcomer here and
she's still not used to this house.

105
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:21,420
But, when the young
doctor saw Hikaru's burn,

107
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,189
he said,"You're always
too tolerant from before."

109
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,963
Oh...Tomoaki was talking about his days
back when he was a medical student at

111
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:34,165
Tohto University, and Hikaru
used to be one of his patients.

113
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,336
It seems that she was tolerated pain
so much that her appendix almost burst...

115
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,607
So, that's how Hikaru
came to work for this house?

117
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,808
Yes.

118
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,044
Since Mother is aged,

119
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:48,681
and it's hard of me to keep
such a large house in order,

121
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,817
I was looking for a live-in maid...
I feel wretched, because

123
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,487
I hear Chiaki used to handle
everything by herself...

125
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,088
Chiaki?

126
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,960
Oh...You mean Tomoakiis
mother who passed away...

128
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,996
The one who passed away of a
traffic accident four years ago...

130
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,864
I hear she was drunk driving...

131
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:10,302
She wasn't a strong drinker,
and she never really drank much.

133
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,372
So, I still can't believe it
actually happened yet...

135
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,442
Uh, by the way,
where is grandma's room?

137
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,076
Oh, it's upstairs...

138
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,013
You go up the stairs
to the left of the kitchen

140
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,749
and the large room in the
foreground is her room...

142
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,085
An elderly has a room that is upstairs?

143
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:31,991
Yes, mother likes the room where she
can have an overall view of the garden...

145
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:35,326
Hikaru's room is situated right next door
so that when something happens

147
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:37,596
she run right over...

148
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,098
Hmm...

149
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,735
Inspector, the killer probably
used the catch phone.

151
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,304
While Yoko was distracted
by the catch phone,

153
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,040
the killer went by the kitchen,
went to the bathroom and

155
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,342
soaked the electric cord into the water...

156
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,112
You idiot! How's the killer
going to get back out then? Huh?!

158
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:53,912
I guess so...

159
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,448
What are you whispering
to each other about again?

161
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,183
Uh, well...

162
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:58,917
Hey!

163
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,722
Why don't you just have everybody do
they were doing when it blacked out?

165
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,124
I guess you're right .

166
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,427
Let's have them act it out while
their- memories are still fresh...

168
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,263
I'll go get everybody then!

169
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,267
Wow...

170
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,404
You're pretty good at wrapping
bandage too, aren't you?

172
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,406
Oh, yes.

173
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,876
When I was little there was this
brat who used to always get hurt.

175
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:27,913
That's why I'm so used to...
This was really long ago though.

177
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:28,747
Ouch!!!

178
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,015
Hey.

179
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,019
What a bummer. The one
who is treating the patient gets hurt...

181
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:39,425
Well, but all you need to do is wash the
wound and bandage it. Then it'll be fine...

183
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,361
Uh...

184
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:43,562
Hmm?

185
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:44,630
Uh...

186
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:46,432
Agh...

187
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,967
What's up, Conan?!

188
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,638
The Inspector told me
tell you all to come.

190
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,773
Okay, we'll go.

191
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,008
Hikaru.

192
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,242
Yes.

193
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,978
Will get a band aid from
that shelf over there for me?

195
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,579
Okay.

196
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,717
You idiot...why'd you
have to show up...

198
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,791
Uh, where's the breaker?

199
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,061
It should be around the
corner to the right...

201
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,332
There it is.

202
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,401
That must be it!!

203
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,203
Hey, Conan!

204
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,908
Look out, because this is the place
that Hikaru cracked the flower vase.

206
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:30,609
Huh?

207
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,213
I cleaned the pieces of glass
of the flower vase with Hikaru,

209
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,149
but she sure had a tough time...

210
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,553
Dr. Araide bawled her out saying,
Next time you goof, you're out!"

212
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,625
Wait a sec...maybe this is...

213
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,662
Okay, are you all ready?!
Let's get'started!

215
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,265
Yes, everything's fine by the stairs!

216
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,601
I'm in position under the breaker!!

217
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,070
Okay, Takagi lower the breaker!

218
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,538
Okay!!

219
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,008
Hikaru, please go over to the breaker...

220
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,876
Yes!

221
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:20,426
34 seconds...She didn't
take a minute after all...

223
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,561
Inspector...

224
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,196
Please take a look...

225
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:29,935
If you go across this garden, you don't
have to go pass Yoko to get to the tub...

227
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,037
Hey, hey, don't tell me that...

228
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,507
Yes...that person could've
committed the crime...

230
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,775
Hey...

231
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,777
That's enough!!

232
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:44,616
Like I already said, everyone in this house
has an alibi just before the black out!!

234
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:48,787
So, what's the use of checking
on:alibis after the black out?!

236
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,556
So that's...

237
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,390
Wait...

238
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,927
All it looks to me is that you guys are
making a big thing out of nothing and

240
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,396
amusing yourselves over
a mere accidental death!!

242
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:58,263
Uh...

243
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:58,997
Uh...

244
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,334
id I goof again...

245
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:04,702
No...

246
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,605
An alibi...

247
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,644
Who of the four among them have an alibi

248
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,714
during the time that the killing
can be carried out?

250
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,384
That person's the only one...
Among the remaining three,

252
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,153
the most suspicious person is...

253
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,858
Hmm? A piece of something?

254
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:31,697
I wonder if this red thing is blood?
And:iwhat is this thing stuck on to it?

256
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:35,601
It can't be?!

257
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,943
Just as I thought...
It was that person after all!!

259
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:51,950
Which means that there is only one.
Only that person could be the killer!!

261
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,858
It takes about 10 seconds
to make a round trip...

263
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,729
seems that she is capable of
committing the murder after all.

265
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,332
Then, the thing that
we were concerned about...

267
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,536
es... I guess it was of no use...

268
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:13,105
What the... Hum...

269
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,475
Hey, it's come to you?!

270
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:21,647
S...I've just figured
what went on...

272
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:24,917
I'll explain,
so please take me to the bath tub.

274
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,520
My legs have gone weak,
since I've figured everything out.

276
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,788
Huh?

277
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,291
What?! Take a bath?

278
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:37,195
Uh-huh, he's wet with rain,
besides, he says he wants to see

280
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:42,568
if he can really be electrocuted to
death by using a shaver in the tub!

282
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,903
Huh? Where are the Inspector
and the other officers?

284
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,873
They said they'd call it a day
and left just a while ago.

286
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,976
Oh, what a waste!

287
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,476
What a waste? «

288
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:56,915
Because Pops said that he'd
be putting on a deduction show

290
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,851
after he finishes taking a bath!!

291
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,153
What?!

292
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,956
Did Mr. Mouri really say so?

293
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,626
Yep! He says he's figured out
who the killer is!

295
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:11,196
Killer? Didn't my
husband die of an accident?

297
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,332
Beats me...l don't know about it...

298
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:17,803
He says he wants to put his thoughts
together while taking a nice bath,

300
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,371
so he wants you all to wait awhile!

301
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,810
It's already been 20 minutes
since he went in...

303
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,178
Mr. Mouri sure is late.

304
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,717
I"can't take this anymore!!
That flimsy mustache dude!

306
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,452
Come on now, mother...

307
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,525
Um...

308
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:41,627
Hmm?

309
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:41,994
Uh...

311
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:43,260
Uh...

312
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,032
Don't tell me it's another black out?

313
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,105
Hikaru... Will you please
go check the breaker?

315
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,573
Uh, yes!

316
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,710
I wonder why it blacked out again...

317
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,979
Come to think of it, that man...

318
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,216
was saying something about
experimenting in the bath tub.

320
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,585
Don't tell me that something
appened to Dad...

322
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,221
Huh?

323
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,090
How quick...the lights
went on already...

325
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,859
No. it's too soon!

326
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:15,894
A h...

328
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:16,995
Officer?

330
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,802
you were the one after all,

331
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,971
Yoko Araide...

332
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:30,108
Huh? That little boy
and Yoko's not here...

334
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:30,876
Huh?

335
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,010
A trap...!

336
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:35,981
Huh?!

337
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,517
Inspector?!

338
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,721
I'm the one?
What are you talking about?

340
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:46,258
I just came to check because
I was worried about Mr. Mouri

342
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,995
doing his experiment using
the shaver in the bath tub!

344
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:54,032
You wanted it to look that way, and kill me,
who figured out what happened,

346
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:58,770
then, pose as the first one
who had found me, isn't it so?

348
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,206
Don't be ridiculous!

349
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,377
I was on the phone all
through the black out!

351
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:11,983
You rigged a timer somewhere,
so it would short circuit and black out.

353
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:17,989
And, using that pen light, you found yourself
through the darkness to the bath tub...

355
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,160
which after you soaked the extension cord
into the tub

357
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,196
that your husband was soaking In.

358
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,299
You set it up so that
when someone lifted the breaker,

360
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,935
your husband would be electrocuted...

361
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:34,873
Like I said, I was on the phone
with my friend throughout the black out.

363
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,109
Ow could I have done it...

364
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,545
It's simple if you hide the
cordless phone of this house

366
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,949
and a cellular phone into
your pocket before hand.

368
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:49,321
You used the cordless phone...
Moreover, the main phone

370
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:55,160
has a built-in rechargeable battery that
makes it usable even during black outs...

372
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:01,633
Right after Hikaru left the kitchen, you
used the cordless in place of the receiver

374
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:06,338
that you were holding and went to
the tub. Then, you used your cellular

376
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,642
to call that house again, and
interrupted the conversation once...

378
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:15,213
You went to the bath tub,
grabbed the extension cord

380
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:20,619
that was plugged into the outlet
and put it quietly into the water...

382
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:28,226
At that time, you probably said
something like be careful and

384
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,696
Iead your husband to grab the railing...
Then, you returned to the corridor

386
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,633
before the kitchen while talking
on the phone using the cordless.

388
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,668
You switched from using the
cordless to the receiver

390
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,770
of the main phone and
waited for the light to go on.

392
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:44,276
Right after Hikaru lifted the breaker, that is
why the short circuit breaker was set off.

394
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:50,215
The lights go on, but it blacks out again.
As soon as the breaker was lifted,

396
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:54,586
an over flow of electricity ran through
the railing, and your husband died of shock!

398
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:58,890
But, Mr. Mouri, I wasn't the only one
who'd be able to do that, right...?

400
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:03,728
Ight...According to your plan
you were supposed to set up your alibi

402
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,597
by staying on the phone,

403
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,635
as well as set everyone else alibi up
by blocking the corridor.

405
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,238
But, your calculations didn't work...

406
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:19,444
Since Hikaru took 30 seconds more
to lift the breaker,

408
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,014
her alibi could not be established.

409
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:28,086
Why did she take so much time, then?

410
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,055
Do you know?

411
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,190
The steamed dish...

412
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:37,596
When it blacked out, Hikaru
cracked a dish in the kitchen.

414
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,765
She carried that dish under her arm,
and hid it in her room upstairs

416
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,336
before going over to the breaker.

417
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,972
She did so because your husband

418
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:51,843
threatened her saying that the
next time she goofed, she's out...

420
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,379
That's how she got burnt, then?

421
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:59,551
Yes...she got burn wounds and
Mitsu hurt her leg at that time.

423
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,588
Mitsu who went out in the dark,

424
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,492
stepped on the piece of glass
that Hikaru had dropped.

426
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:13,265
If Hikaru makes a round trip to her room,
it would take her 30 seconds more,

428
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,835
and Mitsu was definitely
upstairs at that time...

430
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,338
Tomoaki, who was grabbed by the arm
by Ran throughout the black out

432
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,107
is out of the question...

433
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,143
You understand now, don't you, Yoko...?

434
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,246
The only person who could've
committed the crime back then is

436
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,416
you: -Yoko!!

437
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,887
Inspector! Let me go to the bath tub!!

438
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,522
We're still investigating!

439
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,092
Setting up a trap, you call this
investigation! You've gotta be kidding!

441
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,097
What a stupid kid...

442
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:51,069
Hiding the dish won't help because all one
has to do is:icount the dishes to find out...

444
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,975
If Hikaru didn't do something like that
I wouldn't have been suspected either...

446
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:03,014
No...even if she didn't hide the dish,
I took it to be you, anyway.

448
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:03,448
What?

449
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,916
The hand that you held the receiver In.

450
00:18:05,917 --> 00:18:11,589
Before Hikaru left the kitchen, you were
holding the receiver in your left hand...

452
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,224
But, after the lights went on,

453
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,094
you were for some reason
had switched it to your right.

455
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:22,434
So, I thought you may have
walked away from the phone once.

457
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:27,172
You went to the bath tub
together with Hikaru because

459
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,774
you didn't want her to be
electrocuted by accident.

461
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:36,147
If Conan didn't stop Tomoaki who came
Iater, you were going to stop him too...

463
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,483
Yes that's right...

464
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,020
because the late Chiaki had
asked me to take care of him...

467
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,924
Yes, four years ago,
before the car accident

469
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,659
she called me and told me,

470
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,331
Protect Tomoaki for me... .so tha
he won't turn out to be like my husband.

472
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:57,935
I didn't know what she meant back then,
after I married him and found

474
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:02,874
her dairy, I understood everything.
That he was a man who made passes

476
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,312
and dated with every woman
he saw. He had no morals...

478
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,416
And that he was the very one
who made cheerful Chiaki

480
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,320
drown herself in alcohol
and drove her to death!!

482
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:21,326
If possible, I'd advise
you to turn yourself in...

484
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,995
y how kind of you

485
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,198
No, it's not for your sake.

486
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,733
But, for Hikaru's sake

487
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:31,603
Huh?

488
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:36,908
You don't understand anything.
You are the one who set the murder up,

490
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:41,445
but, Hikaru is the one who pulled the
trigger when she raised the breaker

492
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:46,117
If she ever finds out, she'll have to
carry the burden for life...

494
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:51,456
You mean the you didn't mention that the
first black out was rigged because...

496
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:56,661
Yes, because we didn't want
her to think she was responsible.

498
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,731
I'd like to make a suggestion...
Could you:please confess that

500
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,701
you soaked Mr. Araide in the water,
put him to sleep with medication then,

502
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:08,373
put a cord attached to a timer
inside the water and electrocuted him

504
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:13,578
Which after you retrieved the
timer during the black out?

506
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:18,683
In other words, say that the black out
was not the cause of the murder...

508
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,786
Of course if you were
to leak the fact that

510
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,656
asked you to confess as such
we would be put in hot water too...

512
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,260
Yes, I'll do as you say...

513
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:35,934
I'm still not ready to give up
having a heart-yet...
