1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,669
Even destiny serves as a clue to deduction

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,338
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,139
What became of the two detectives?

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,342
As the evening grows, will their love fade?

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,344
He sees through the one and only truth,

7
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,145
a child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult,

8
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,414
No case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

10
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:00,052
We learn from Yumi,
Officer Sato's colleague

12
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,388
that Officer Sato is going to be meeting
a marriage candidate

14
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,357
who she has never met before.

15
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,891
No problem!

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,828
Because it's all worked
out that she gets out of there

18
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,364
when the time is right!

19
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,433
But, who's going to do that?

20
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,136
You silly thing.
Who else but Officer Takagi?!

22
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,271
I'm going to mail him on his cellular,

23
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:23,709
Miwako's in trouble!"
Lie that a criminal case has come up

25
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,345
and take her away from where she is!

26
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,249
I'm sure that he'll go bursting in
with a face that you've never seen before!

28
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,384
You witch...

29
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,519
When we arrive really interested
and curious at Mizutozakura...

31
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,491
What?!

32
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,527
S,Shiratori... Don't tell me...

33
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,828
that he's the one
from the police department?!

37
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,798
he is meeting with Ms. Sato in there

38
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:49,135
Which means that
the man Officer Sato is meeting. is...

40
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,170
Shiratori?

41
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,371
Robber!

42
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:54,273
Somedody, get him!

43
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:59,111
At that time, officer Takagi met
a robber at a convenience store.

45
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,680
He ran after a criminal and
hunted him down at a restroom in the park.

47
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,316
However, there were three suspects.

48
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,654
Besides he hasn't been able
to-clear whichswas a criminal,

50
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,090
because everyone testified differently.

51
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,227
Oh, so just a little while longer...

53
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,199
My hands are tied just yet and...

54
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,767
Uh, it's me...

55
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,335
This is Shinichi Kudo

56
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:23,936
What?!

57
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,939
Conan asked me to give you a call...

58
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,642
WW.,What did Conan ask you to do?

59
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:33,179
Please check your cell phone mail

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,248
and take note
of the situation that you're in now.

62
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,020
But, the only mail
I got today was from Yumi...

64
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:51,397
O,Officer Sato is
meeting a marriage candidate?!

66
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,400
So, you haven't read the mail, have you?

67
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,770
But, don't worry please calm down

68
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,739
There's still a lot of time
to go till sundown,

70
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,776
and the place she's meeting him
Is in the neighboring town, Haidocho...

72
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,412
T,Till sundown?

73
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:10,683
Officer Sato agreed to the terms
that her proposed husband suggested.

75
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:16,922
If you don't solve the case
by sundown and go to get her,

77
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,725
she's going to have to accept
her partner's marriage proposal.

79
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,963
Please give me the details of the case.

80
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,765
Officer Takagi?

81
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,235
Officer Takagi, can you hear me?

82
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,270

85
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:44,717
I have the three suspects
that were in the restroom in the park

87
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:47,552
where the robber fled into with me...

88
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,123
Of the three, two are men.

89
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:51,957
One of them is Mr. Hiroshi Zama,
21 years old, a part-time worker.

He is wearing

The last one is a woman
called Ms. Eiko Koshimizu.

129
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,350
She is about 160 centimeters tall,

130
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,253
IS wearing black clothes
and wears two wristwatches.

132
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,723
When the robber broke
into the convenience store,

134
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,861
the outfit the robber had
on were a helmet, a coat, and gloves.

136
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,362
The robber stuck out a knife

137
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,032
and showed the employee a paper
with the words, Give me money.

139
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,433
The robber is still unidentified.

140
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,335
There is no doubt

141
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,802
that the robber disposed of the coat

142
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:40,105
and ran into the restroom in the park...

143
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:45,878
But, the trouble is that the testimony
of the witnesses all differ...

145
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,748
The old man who bumped into
the robber in front of the park says,

147
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,518
She was a woman wearing blue clothes.

148
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,987
The girl who was watching
through the window of a shop says,

150
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,391
The head of the robber stuck out
from among the throng of people,

152
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,261
so the robber who is about
180 centimeters tall is most likely a man.

154
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:05,564
And from under the coat,
she saw the color green

156
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,567
As for the owner of the coffee shop,

157
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,304
he said when he was outside the shop
he saw the robber who was on the run.

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,540
He says that the robber
was about 170 centimeters

161
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,477
and wearing black clothes under the coat.

162
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,912
I see.

163
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,949
All three suspects testified totally
differing characteristic %of/the robber?

165
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,285
How interesting!

166
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,854
In. Interesting, Shinichi...

167
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:34,460
First of all, I'll go to that coffee shop
and talk to Mr. Mamehara, the owner.

169
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:35,294
Huh?

170
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,663
Why do you know the owner's name...?

171
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,531
I've known him from before

172
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,638
Hey, officer, what's up?

173
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,573
Did you arrest the robber?

174
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,441
Ah... Not yet...

175
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,010
Take the owner outside.

176
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:51,277
Huh?

177
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,076
Hurry!!

178
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,213
H,Hey!

179
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,382
Where are you taking me?

180
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,516
Let's talk inside the shop.

181
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,953
1.I'm sorry, please come with me...

182
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,122
WwW, What's with you...

183
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,125
Y,Your glasses are sunglasses?!

184
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,594
I'm pretty sure,

185
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,596
that the sunglasses that the owner
IS wearing have photochromic lens

187
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,332
that change color for about 15 seconds

188
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,268
when he goes outside
and is exposed to ultraviolet rays

190
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,538
The owner as I know him,
doesn't wear glasses,

192
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,307
so I thought that it may be possible.

193
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,044
I'm wearing these glasses just for show.

194
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,579
I decided to wear them
just for fun only recently.

196
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,981
I completely forgot about them.

197
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,584
Which means
that the robber s clothes that you saw

199
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,186
may have looked darker
than the actual color

201
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,021
because of the change in the color
of the lens of your glasses?

203
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:36,622
0,Oh,

204
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,126
but about the robber being
about 170 centimeters is a fact.

206
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,428
But...

207
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:47,132
another witness says that the robber
was about 180 centimeters.

209
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,703
The shop that the girl said
she saw the robber through the window,

211
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,537
where is it?

212
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,908
About 100 meters from
this coffee shop, back store.

214
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,009
In the direction of
the convenience store.

216
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,078
Oh...over there.

217
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,847
Then, please go to where the shop is.

218
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,717
If I remember correctly,

219
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,286
she said she saw the head of
the robber above the throng of people?

221
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,821
Yeah...

222
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,489
That street...

223
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,492
Ieads from the entrance of the subway to
the bus stop, so depending on the time,

225
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,862
It becomes congested with people.

226
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,132
If a throng of people
come heading in your direction,

228
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,067
how would you try to
make it through, Officer Takagi?

230
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,436
How...

231
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,538
I would try to avoid them
as much as possible...

233
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,541
If you feel that doing so will not get you
through the crowd fast enough, so what?

235
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,117
Well, then I'drhave no choice but to...

236
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,487
give up running along the sidewalk
part way and run along the curb stone...

238
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,922
II get it!

239
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,259
The girl witnessed
the robber running along the curb stone,

241
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,162
and mistook the robber's height as
being over 180 centimeters!!

243
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,096
A puzzle...

244
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,066
AqZiQZGW puzzle, Officer Taka'g'l...

245
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,135
Although the pieces may look scattered
and mismatching...

247
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,371
if you rotate them and look at them
from a different angle,

249
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,073
they will surely fit in perfectly

250
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,209
The mismatching pieces
of testimony that the witnesses

252
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:10,582
give us are indispensable pieces
that we need to complete the puzzle

254
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,053
Conan's sure taking his time, isn't he?

255
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,356
Oh, I guess I'll go check on him, then.

256
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,332
I wonder if Conan ate something bad...

257
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,002
I made toast and sunny side ups
for breakfast today...

259
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,339
nd for lunch...

260
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,014
I'm pretty sure I've seen

261
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,650
that person once before...

262
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,019
My, so it wasn't the right person after all?

263
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,722
I've seen that person
somewhere before...

265
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,562
The only person left is the old man
who says he ran into the robber...

267
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,565
According to my deduction,

268
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,634
the testimony of
that old man is the most decisive...

270
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,702
Uh, Shinichi.

272
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:04,436
1 CO.

273
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,071
Why?

274
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,106
How is it you know so much...

276
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,009
Well, that's...

277
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,777
Conan?

278
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:13,545
Oh no! It's Ran!!

279
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,315
Conan, are you all right?

280
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:21,553
Oh, so will you please talk to
that old man once more!

282
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,089
Then, you'll be able to narrow the robber
down to just one person!

284
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,826
Huh? Hey, wait...

286
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:35,801
If I remember correctly
the old man testified

288
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:40,439
that the robber was a woman
wearing blue clothes under her coat.

290
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,575
But, Mr. Zama is the one
who is the one wearing blue clothes...

292
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,445
0,Oh, yes, it's his pierced earrings!!

293
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,147
The old man saw the earrings
and thought it was a woman...

296
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:51,817
but when they bumped into
each other the robber

298
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,485
should still have been wearing
the helmet...

300
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,387
He couldn't have seen the robber's face...

301
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,056
Then, why did he think
the robber was a woman...?

303
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:00,558
Darn.

304
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,861
Only 40 minutes to sundown...

305
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,497
I've-got to hurry,
or else Ms. Sato will have to...

307
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,332
Watch...

308
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,370
Come to think of it, that person...

309
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,605
I see!

310
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
That's what it was!!

311
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:16,909
I've got it!!

312
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,378
I've figured out who the robber is!!

313
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,755
The sun has set quite a bit.

314
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,057
Oh yes, I guess so...

315
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,192
Ms. Sato...

316
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,763
It's not that I don't trust you, but...

317
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,332
If Officer Takagi fails to make it
here in time,

319
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,502
I d like some proof of it

320
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,504
Proof?

321
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,207
As proof of it,

322
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,609
I'd like you to give me a kiss
as a pledge of your promise

324
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:51,710
Huh?!

325
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:52,978
Huh?!

326
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,249
A kiss of pledge...

327
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,685
Me and you?

328
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:02,821
Yes,

329
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,022
you don't mind, do you?

330
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,558
Because if Officer Takagi
doesn't come here by sundown,

332
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,528
we're going to get married anyway, so...

333
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,130
You promised not to go back
on your word, didn't you?

335
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,933
Y, Yes,

336
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,401
of course...

337
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,805
Come on, what's keeping you.
Officer Takagu...

339
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,274
Hurry up and arrest the robber, will you!!

340
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,579
Oh, Officer Takagqu...

341
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,115
Did you find out anything new?

342
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,850
No, not at all...

343
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,752
The testimonies of the witnesses

344
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,622
are still all different
as far as the robber is concerned...

346
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,691
A woman wearing a blue dress,

347
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,228
a man wearing green clothes
that is more than 180 centimeters tall...

349
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,064
or a person wearing black clothes
that is about 170 centimeters...

351
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
That's no help...

352
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,369
We can't possibly narrow down
the suspect to one person

354
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,270
with what we've got now...

355
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,841
I guess I'll take my time...

356
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,308
Because after all it's still before 3:00 yet

357
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,177
So, I've still got lots of time...

358
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,380
Hey, hey,
just what are you talking about?!

360
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,715
Your watch must be broken.

361
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,051
It's already 4:30...

362
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:06,985
Huh?

363
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,788
So, it was you after all, wasn't it?

364
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:10,422
Huh?

365
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,024
O,Officer Takagi...

366
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,760
The owner of the coffee shop said that
the robber was wearing black clothes

368
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:19,031
because he had glasses
with photochromic lens on!

370
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:22,534
And the girl said
the robber was more than 180 meters tall

372
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,404
because the robber in order to avoid
the crowd ran along the curbstone...

374
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:28,173
Aside from the testimonies
black clothes

376
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,409
and "more than 180 centimeters,

377
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,979
when.matching.
The testimonies of the two,

379
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,814
the robber is said to have been about
170 centimeters

381
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,616
and wearing green clothes.

382
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,784
In other words, Mr. Kamieda...

383
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,019
you're the one who did it!!

384
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,921
B,But

385
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,290
the old man who bumped into the robber

386
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,225
said the robber
was a woman wearing blue clothes.

388
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,126
Yes.

389
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,827
But, at that time,

390
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,399
it had completely slipped my mind
that the witness was an elderly man!!

392
00:13:58,136 --> 00:13:59,638
Please look, Miwako...

393
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,174
What a beautiful sunset...

394
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,315
20 more minutes
to go till the sun completely sets...

396
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,350
Officer Takagqi...

397
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,986
Officer Takagu...

398
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,589
Officer Takagi...

399
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,595
Officer TA-KA-GI I

400
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,265
1, 1 get it, the old man!!

401
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,567
Elderly men in Japan

402
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,303
sometimes say blue when
they actually mean the color green!

404
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,070
Yeah.

405
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,638
Elderly people in Japan

406
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,909
used to say blue regardless of whether
they meant indigo, light blue or green!

408
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,914
After recalling that
Mr. Kamieda was a prep school teacher,

410
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:43,915
an idea raced through my mind.

411
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,484
He mentioned

412
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,486
that he tried to devise ways of
not making the students worry

414
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:48,620
about the passage
of time during his classes...

416
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,956
So, I figured that it could be
that he had the face

418
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,390
of his wristwatch turned towards the inner
part of his wrist rather than outward,

420
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,695
where only he himself
could see what time it was...

423
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,366
(am am.
1 See,

425
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:02,634
so the old man

426
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,902
mistook the robber as being a woman

427
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,904
because the face of the robber's
wristwatch was on the inner side

429
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,372
of the wrist than the outer.

430
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:08,607
Yeah.

431
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,376
He probably always used to wear
his wristwatch in this fashion

433
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,744
because it was too much trouble

434
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,546
to keep changing the position of
his wristwatch for every class.

436
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,014
In other words,

437
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,817
the testimony of
the witnesses all point to the fact

439
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,154
that you are the one
who robbed the convenience store,

441
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,388
Mr. Kamieda!!

442
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,123
Aaaagh. .Aaagh...

443
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,493
A little less than 10 minutes to go...

444
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:32,564
I guess I've won the bet...

445
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,638
Please don't wear such a dreadful look...

446
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,073
I'm not going to force you
to marry me right away,

448
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,309
not until you're perfectly ready to accept.

449
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,378
I'm willing to wait as long as
you want me to.

451
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,179
Huh?

452
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,114
I don't to make an enemy out of you

453
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,116
I'm always on your side.

454
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,084
Inspector Shiratori...

455
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,022
The phone...

456
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,224
Oh, Officer Sato?

457
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,425
Takagi here!

458
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,995
I just arrested
the convenience store robber!

460
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,765
The place you're at
Is pretty near from here,

462
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,967
so I'll be over in about 5 minutes.

463
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:09,401
Okay,

464
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,069
hurry up and come get me then, will you!!

465
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:12,771
Really, I tell you...

466
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,272
U,Uh...

467
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,408
May I ask you a question
before I head on there?

469
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,275
What?

470
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,878
Why me?

471
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:20,445
Huh?

472
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,447
Why did you believe in a person
Iike me and...

474
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,050
agree to bet on something so important
that would affect your whole life?

476
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,787
Because I was positive
that you would come get me!

478
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:29,654
Does it bug you?

479
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,823
U,Uh well...

480
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,792
you see, that's...

481
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,027
M,Maybe...

482
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,696
you...

483
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,133
WwW ,Well, you...

484
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,368
See...

485
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,270
I thought that you like. .me...

486
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,706
The robber got away!!

487
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:48,707
Hey, freeze!!

488
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,409
Come on, Officer Takagi!

489
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,011
Oh, but...

490
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,613
I don't have time left!

491
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,249
Officer Takag:.

492
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:02,654
Which means more to you,
the convenience:store robber or me?!

494
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:03,288
Huh?

495
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,790
Go after him, Takagi!!

496
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:07,259
Y.Yes!!

497
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,203
Are you sure it's okay?

498
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,473
If he goes after the robber now,
there's no way he'll make it in time...

500
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:22,974
Well, if so,

501
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,809
I guess I'll have to resign to the fact that
it was destined to turn out this way...

503
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,846
It could be that the heavens punished me

504
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,714
for getting Officer Takagi involved in
this bet without his permission.

506
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,416
But, a bet's a bet!

507
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,486
Why don't we hurry up
nd get on with it then...

509
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,289
with that pledge or whatevers...

510
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,778
16:56 suspect arrested... Heave, heave...

511
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,982
1, I...wanted money...

512
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,319
I needed severance money

513
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,055
to give to a woman
who persistently hung around me

515
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:10,322
uuugh...

516
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:10,722
U...uuugh...

517
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,022
Ghads...

519
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,764
I've come quite a distance

520
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,166
from Minatorou...

521
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,236
I would never be able to make it
there now

523
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,275
Officer Takagi!

524
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,015
You did it, Officer Takaq:...

525
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,450
Nah...

526
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,784
I goofed and let go

527
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,954
of who I really wanted to catch

528
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,498
Hey, so what's the matter?

529
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,467
Hurry up and get on with it.

530
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,635
I'm all ready and set!

531
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,537
Ready and set...

532
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,240
But, your face says you don't want to...

533
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,810
Don't worry, Miwako.

534
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,247
Let's just stay this way for a while
and calm down a bit...

536
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,016
After all,

537
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,485
there is nothing to keep us
apart anymore anyway...

539
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,524
They're finally going to kiss.

540
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,960
L,I'll go stop them!

541
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,795
W What are you talking about?!

542
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,097
Um, Mr. Niide...

543
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:26,631
Hmm?

544
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,165
Will you please come...

545
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,173
I'll take him to the station,

546
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,941
so you go on ahead Officer Takagt!

547
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,710
You're an officer, aren't you?

548
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,211
If so,

549
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,781
than do what an officer is expected to do
and pursue your target until the last!!

551
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,281
Takagi!!

552
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:45,784
Okay.

553
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,652
The sun will completely set soon.

554
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,354
Have you calmed down?

555
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:49,887
Yes...

557
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,824
What is it, Conan?

558
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:54,559
Um...

559
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,164
never realized .

560
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,133
888...

561
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,438
come to mean so much:to me...

562
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,506
Huh?

563
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:10,708
H,Hey .

564
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,543
H. Hey...

565
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,178
Hold it!

566
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:23,621
Im really a crummy officer
realizing something like this only now...

568
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:27,025
I guess this is just
what I need to forget the whole deal

570
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,162
Bye, bye, Takagqi.

571
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,397
Assistant.Inspector Miwako Sato!

572
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,868
I'm sorry to bother you
when you're off duty,

574
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,104
but we've ot a case

576
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,637
and I hope you'll come to back us up?

577
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,574
O, Officer Takagi?

578
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,075
He's come!

579
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,276
Officer Takag:!!

580
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,145
Bad timing!

581
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:49,614
Officer Takagi!!

582
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,583
Officer Takagi?

583
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:55,353
Huh?

584
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,022
Cc. Conan?

585
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,291
Oh...Officer Takagi...

586
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,997
Officer Takagi just went running down
the corridor to the entrance...

588
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,266
Ghads, I tell you!

589
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,535

636
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,747
The sun has completely set...

637
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,751
I couldn't make it in time...

638
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:12,022
Police Sergeant Takagt!

639
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:12,724
Huh?

640
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,592
What the hell are you doing?!

641
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,460
Hurry up, get in!!

642
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,495
O, Officer Sato...

643
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,233
You've got a case on your hands,
haven't you?

645
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:24,402
Oh, yes.

646
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,114
I couldn't help wanting to help out...

647
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,752
I mean those two are so awkward
at things like this,

649
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,555
just like some other twosome
I'm really familiar with...

651
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,700
I feel real bad for having done this to
Inspector Shiratori, though...

653
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,305
Mr. Ushikubo passed away?!

654
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:01,472
What?!

655
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,208
There's blood on his fingertip...

656
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,612
Besides,
it looks like he touched something...

658
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:13,818
Hmm?

659
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,691
Why on earth did that person?
