What

146
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,208
That spider

148
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,445
has nerve venom that is several times
stronger than that of the red-back spider.

152
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,479
B.But

154
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,549
not strong enough
for a human to die instantly.

157
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,917
D.Don't touch it!!

158
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,153

166
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:03,849
Agh,

167
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,983
It's gone.

168
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,019
The serum for the Black Widow Spider
IS gone.

170
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,756
It's always left over here and) yet.

172
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,360
Hey. take a look.

173
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,263
It seems to have escaped from here.

174
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,701
He never:ever forgot
to close the lid before.

176
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,937
Were only human,
so therejare times we forget.

178
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,506
This is

179
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,921
Don't come in during investigation!

180
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,557
What's with him!

181
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,760
We're witnesses to the case too...

182
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,229
If you chase us away,
the case won't be solved!

184
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,702
The ones who have the key to this room
re Professor Shiino...

186
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,505
and Mr. Itogawa. his assistant?

187
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,439
Y.Yes, sir...

188
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,043
Mr. Urazaki, you were acquainted
ith the Professor...

191
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,779
Were the door and windows
always locked?

193
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:09,648
Yes, Sir...

194
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,151
because a varietyjof venomous spiders
are.being

196
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:13,952
Hmm,

197
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:14,686
Hmm,

198
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,456
to think that he forgot to close the lid of
the breeding box of venomous spiders...

200
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,629
Are ou bothered?

201
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,369
Oh, then go ahead
and think like that forever...

203
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,303
Huh?

204
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,440
I saw something.

206
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,842
1a ¢ IC you see.

207
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,579
There's a scratch
on the Professor's ear.

209
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,981
As if he brought the receiver
to his ear without realizing

211
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,117
that the spider was there
and was bitten...

213
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,688
It seems to be rare that someone

214
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,523
who is bitten by this spider
dies on the spot...

216
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,127
Agh,

217
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:56,827
Conan.

218
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,764
I just told you not to come inside...

219
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,382
Hmm /!

220
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,101
Oh, j.just a little bit...

221
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,171
Isn't this medicine for the heart?

222
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,445
Did the professor have a heart problem?

223
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,848
Really?

224
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,149
I didn't know.

225
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,819
If so, it was an accident after all?

226
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:24,706
You're the one who called the Professor,
Mr: Urazaki?

228
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:25,757
Yeah,

229

Oh. it.it's okay.

253
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,178

254
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,347
How:can you talk about a conference
at a time like:this?!

256
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,117
B.But,

so long as I have the documents,

259
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,654
even I can deliver the speech.

260
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,457
The truth is...

261
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,493
It's your research isn't-Wt; Mr; lltogawa?

262
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,127
What?!

263
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,196
Is.Is that true?

264
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,533
The Professor was delivering.speeches

265
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,069
on the results of Mr. Iltogawarsiresearch

266
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,338
all this time: as if it were his own.

268
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,076
so he snatchedsaway
the works of his assistant.

270
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,911
Eh... It's the usual stuff that goes around

271
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:27,812

272
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,716
That youlhad a grudge against
the Professor, eh, Dr. Itogawal!

274
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,451
Speak:for yourself. Mt. Urazak I

Come, come...Mr. Urazaki...

278
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,892

279
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,794
No: I don't.

280
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,364
If you've got something.

281
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,999
Will you show it to us?

282
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,601
No. it's nothing...

283
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,503
It's nothing. tell youl!

284
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,071
Then. please show it to us,

285
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,139
Mr. Urazaki...

286
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,306
Darn

287
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:57,876
Those are

288
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,911
all rare spiders

289
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,746
that aren't found in Japan.

290
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,382
Just what does this mean?

291
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,452
Mr. Urazaki was

292
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,387
buying the spiders from the Professor.

293
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,288
Spiders...

294
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:10,922
VE8o

295
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,592
Saying that it would be used for research,

296
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,010
he Professor was able to get
a hold of rare and valuable spiders

298
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,680
from all over the world...

299
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,731
And he's slyatoo.

300
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,801
He picks on our weaknesses

301
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,836
and raises.the price.

302
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,805
Uh, fun. fun...

303
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,108
Moreover,
you had a grudge against the P ofessor.

305
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,308
Absurd

306
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,677
this is an accident.

307
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,997
He was punished for playing (round
with my passion for spiders.

309
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,500
Pops sa s

310
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,118
Ny a-
he's figured -out who the killer 1s!

312
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,553
Onan...

313
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,188
You mean you re still here!

314
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,156
He says that this Is not an accident?

315
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:45,957
Right

316
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,827
me says that its strange

317
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,428
that only the serum
the Black Widow Spider is missing.

319
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:51,062
Hmm.

320
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:52,831
It's true that everything fits in too well.

321
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,066
If it isn't an accident...

322
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,100
Mr. Itogawa.

323
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,003
You're the only one
who has the spare key.

325
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,672
Yes...

327
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,641
Mr. Itogawa,
as well as Conan and the others

329
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,344
heard the Professor scream
it the same time...

332
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,414
Pops sa s

333
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,766
to check this telephone carefully.

334
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,384
The receiver...

335
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,385
Huh?

336
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,855
5 \ na
There's something shiny over here.

338
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,689
What?!

339
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,860
Hmm.

340
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,328
Something is definitely

341
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,897
inside the hole just
where the ear is to be placed...

343
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,268
It's a needle...

344
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,804
So. this is what was inside!

345
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,075
The tip of the needle 1s broken off

346
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,784
What's up Conan?

347
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,354
The toilet!

349
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,793
The tip~of the needle-is-broken off

350
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,897
Wiso you can't tell
from the exterior of the receiver.

352
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,681
Which means

353
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,700
thatgthe thing that poked
the Professor's ear is this needle.

355
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,635
Then.

356
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,188
Why did he shout,
I was bitten by a Black Widow Spider?

358
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:10,692
Yes...

359
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,278
Oh...Mr. Mourn!

360
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,881
I've heard about the circumstances
from Conan.

362
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,084
The killer poked a Black Widow Spider
on to the needle point

364
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,021
of the thumbtack that was rigged inside.

365
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,088
Huh...

366
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,890
Take a very close 10Ok 1
using the magnifying]glass

368
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,259
at/that dead spider over there.

369
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,827
(Hey...

370
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,896
Hey. Takagi.

371
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,419
I.] see!

372
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,471
1. TakaqQ.

373
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,075
hurry and explain it to us too...

374
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,476
Hey Mr. Moun!!!

375
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,345
Just what are you trying to get to?!

376
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,813
In other words. Inspector!

377
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,882
This is how it is...

378
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,063
The killer who rigged the needle
into the receiver...

380
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,899
pokes a spider that is killed beforehand

381
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,767
onto the tip of:theineedle

382
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:10,768
no 'lmake qtheréProfessor

383
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,939
mistakenly think that he is bitten
by a Black Widow:Spider...

385
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:16,774
Then for the serum

386
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,610
The killer steals the serum
for the Black Widow Spider...

388
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,914
After all isxdone,
the killer replaces the phone

390
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,133
andyust waits
for the Professor to pick up the phone.

392
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,935
0. that's the story...

393
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,488
Which means

394
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,023
that the Professor died because...

395
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,195
Oh, Professor, this is Urazaki.

396
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:40,999
I've been bitten!

397
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,368
I've been bitten
by a Black Widow Spider!!

399
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:46,270
Please inject yourself with the serum.

400
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,473
Professor, quick the serum!!

401
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:55,680
1. The serum is gone!!

402
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,148
Ugh!

403
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:06,406
G.Gugh, gugh...

404
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,828
All right Mr Mour:,

405
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,030
goodb e then...

406
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:13,631
Inspector

407
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,033
the Professor did not die

408
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,635
from the venom of the spider.

409
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,070
Which means?

410
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,204
Since he's a venomous spider researcher.

411
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,642
He is well aware of
the danger of spider venom.

413
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,145
He had to/linject himself immediately
withthe serum,

415
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,147
but he couldn't find it...

416
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,451
Since the Professor had a weak heart,
if cornered into such a situation...

418
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,587
I see, if the person has a weak heart,

419
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,190
the sudden stress make nduce an attack.

420
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,258
Yes. sir.

421
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,310
Which means that the killer is

422
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,595
someone who can go in and out
at will from the research lab,

424
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,149
as well as know
bout the Professor's weak heart...

426
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,435
Just what. proof
do"you have:to:say something like that!

428
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:55,640
Mr. Mouri said.

429
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,226
Look at the incoming calls record
ff the telephone...

431
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:58,726
WHY...

432
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,713
12:50 Urazaki cell phone.

433
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,798
Made the call

434
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,349
and the Professor answered...

435
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,185
Hmm?.

436
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,454
17:30 university clerk office.

437
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,557
This is yesterday's record

438
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,192
it has nothing to do with today.

439
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,426
Strange

440
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:19,097
Yasuda should've called the Professor
once before I gave him a call.

442
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,065
The time was 12:00.

443
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,368
Because the lunch break time tone
of the factory...

445
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,573
Oh, I'seemed to have called
the wrong number back then.

447
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:32,176
Will you please show me your cell phone?

448
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,184
She's definitely called
1 different number...

450
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:40,952
Huh?

451
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,486
Huh?

452
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,387
That cell phoneys /
the same as Mr. Itokawass...

454
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,223
Huh?!

455
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,458
Oh...It's Justa coincidence.

456
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,661
Pops said that

457
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,663
Mr. Itokawa is protecting you."

458
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,332
He said that you're going with each other.

459
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,333
What...

460
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,268
Although it's already an old model',

461
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,072
it's unusual that you sot; still use
the same type. but of a different color.

463
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,574
1,0] s@e...

464
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,810
If you two are going with each other

465
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,246
Ms. Yasuda would have the opportunity

466
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,147
to make a spare key from the key
that Mr. Itokawa has...

468
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,516
Oh, and besides.

469
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,416
She's knowledgeable about spiders

470
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,185
thanks to Mr. Itogawa telling her
about them.

472
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,322
It's not all that strange
that she; could've known

474
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,358
that:the: Professor had a weak heart.

475
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,076
WwW Wait

476
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,662
it'sitrue that weire going with each other.

478
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,498
that isnit:reason enough
to be suspicious of:herd

480
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,966
We've got proof...

481
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,935
The seal with the blue flower on it

482
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,204
that's in your pocket.

483
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:39,243
We saw you secretly pick it up
from the floor Mr. Itogawal!

485
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:41,279
Will you please give it to me?

486
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,923
That's the nail art seal that you're using,
isn't it?

488
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,025
N. No. see...?

490
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,531
can you show me the magazine
you showed me a while ago?

492
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:01,632
Huh? Yes, sir...

493
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,833
Huh? Yes, sir...

494
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:09,423
ts on here...

495
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:10,875
See.

496
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,445
0.Oh yeah!!

497
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,815
Didn't you drop it today In this room?

498
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,351
If so

499
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:24,622
why did Mr. Itégawa
try to hide the evidence?

501
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,992
You came here today

502
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:31,028
before the Professor came, didn't yous

503
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:33,864
Mr. Itogawa realized that you did...

504
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,300
and tried to hide the evidence.

506
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,036
Iook at the antenna of that cell phone!

507
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,871
Isn't it full of scratches?

508
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:41,706
Huh,

509
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,440
eah...

510
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,808
now that you mentioned it.

511
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,776
There were scratches on the.telephone
over there too.

513
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:46,810
Weren't there?

514
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,482
I £88...

515
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,200
She used the antenna of the cell phone

516
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:55,286
and stuck the needle into the receiver...

517
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,621
That's when the scratches were made...

518
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,423
Kyaaah-!!

519
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:00,658
Stop it!

520
00:21:15,824 --> 00:21:17,608
You killed the Professor

521
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,161
and tried to make it look as
if he died accidentally.

523
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,129
You made Mr. Urazaki call

524
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:26,684
because you didn't want suspicion to fall
upon Mr. Itogawa or yourself.

526
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:28,552
Why did you do something like this?

527
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,822
Whenever the Professor delivers
a speech at the academic conference.

529
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,592
Wt is:Mr. togawa's research results.

530
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,161
Injust couldn't.take it.-anymore.

531
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,496
I was just:hoping

532
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,865
that the Professor would be hospitalized

533
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,034
with a heart attack-or:something...

534
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,404
didn't mean for it:fo turn out this way...

535
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,405
MMiWa

536
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,612
This is a crime that
cannot be forgiven. After all.

538
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,832
You did take someone's life...

What?!

597
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,146
He probably left it here after he was
pushed off the cliff,

599
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,147
before the murderer came down here

600
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,785
