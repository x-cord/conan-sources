1
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,519
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,421
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,290
Today's case is a special one with tricks

5
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,992
It 1s a large scaled, fun-packed episode.

6
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,760
He sees through the one and only truth

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,395
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:29,729
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,731
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

13
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:53,512
The Entrance to a Labyrinth
The Fury of the Gigantic Goddess Statue

15
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,615
Officer Yokomizo,

16
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,517
we've got the results of the autopsy!

17
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,220
The cause of death
was a stab wound pierced right

19
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,755
through his chest with a dagger!

20
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,457
We believe he died instantly)

21
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,027
No fingerprints or palm prints
were found on the dagger.

23
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:13,466
The estimated time of death is right after
he disappeared from the ropeway.

25
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,135
Well, it's just as was assumed!

26
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:19,772
Okay, block off the esplanade entirely!

27
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,275
Have that elderly go down
to the foot of the mountain too!

29
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:23,843
Yes, sir

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,852
Sir, what is that shed down below therer

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,122
It's a rest"house that the construction
workers were using at the time

33
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,790
they were constructing the tunnel...

34
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,792
It's supposed to be destroyed tomorrow.

35
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:42,293
Then why is there smoke
coming out of there?

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,297
1.I'm not bothering him

38
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,568
Mr. Yasunori Dohmoto, I have something
I d like you to verify for me

40
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,671
Do you have any recollection
of this dagger?

42
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:58,010
It s one of my father's collection
of. daggers.

44
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:01,947
Which means someone stole the dagger

45
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,350
Was it under strict security?

46
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,487
0...anyone could've taken it
if he wanted to

48
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,423
- That's not what matters though,
the problem is

50
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,757
Yes?

51
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,826
It's nothing

52
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,195
Really, nothing

53
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,699
He's hiding something...what is it?

54
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,170
Thus case ls about Mr. Enzo Dohmoto

55
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:28,406
being attacked?by someone w=
and disappearing in the ropeway....!

57
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,411
The talisman that was pasted
on the window

59
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:36,015
I can't help but come to the conclusion
that the killer is among all of you here!

61
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,384
First, I would like to check
on the motive for killing

63
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,589
Who would benefit most
from the death of Mr. Dohmoto?

65
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,525
If you mean our father's estate
it would be us,

67
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,127
who are his children.

68
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:51,297
Not really Yasunori s the very one
who would benefit most,

70
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,700
now that he can assume entire power
of the Dohmoto Tours

72
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,668
Junpei!

73
00:03:56,336 --> 00:04:00,439
Yasunori,
aren't you happy now that father is dead?

75
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,242
Now, you don't have to get nagged
on the job either.

77
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,213
In terms of motive, lethink
you guys got as much motive as I do!

79
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,850
You guys =. You mean Mr. Aovagi and 1?

80
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,251
Why me?

81
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,621
You made up scandals of our company,
as well as blackmailed father

83
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,557
by writing letters and
making crank calls beforehand!

85
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,826
But, father ignored you, that's why you

86
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,195
Hold it there!!

87
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,165
Don t tell me that you were blackmailing
father about that story?!

89
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,635
Mr. Aoyagi, what does that story mean...?

90
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,538
Inkorder torgetythis=tunnel*ready in:time,

91
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,674
the construction was started
on an outrageous schedule.

93
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,810
This resulted in an accidental cave-in

94
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:44,617
One was buried alive
and consequently was left to die

96
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:50,623
Fearing a bad image falling upon
this Mt. Tenbu ropeway, Eizo Dohmoto

98
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,359
used cash to silence the family
B and the people involved,

100
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,727
to erase traces of the accident!

101
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:59,298
I was so disappointed at my father
and left the house!

103
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,168
You mean you had the nerve
to blackmail father about it?

105
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,104
You don't have to
make me sound so rotten.

107
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,840
All I did was ask
to be interviewed about it

109
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,910
But to assume that
I was trying to blackmail him,

111
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,945
he really felt guilty about something.

112
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,949
You approached me for that
purpose to begin with, didn't you?!

114
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,786
Well, you are after all, the best of all
witnesses to what happened back then.

116
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,289
What a guy!!

117
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,059
You're pretty good,
eading Rina by the nose...!

119
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,929
But, it seems you couldn't do
the same with father!

121
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,864
Not being able to get
the money you wanted,

123
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,499
you got furious and killed father, eh...?

124
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,534
I didn't kill him!!

125
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,903
Talk for yourself, Junpei.

126
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,674
Father kept refusing to give you a loan. .!

127
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,076
I'll bet you were pissed about it?

128
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,679
EÂ¢ And, what about you, then ,!

129
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,180
That's enough!!

130
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,415
How much shame of the family
do you intend to display to the public!!

132
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,018
Mr. Machida,

133
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,624
your agency Tokai Nippo had an anti
ropeway campaign underway

135
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,095
Still, why was your agency.
Of all the other agencies and the others

137
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,631
that could've been selected,
the one chosen for the first trial run?

139
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:10,736
Who knows... we've been wondering
about that too.

141
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,539
Don't you think it better
to ask the vice president about that?

143
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,442
Yasunori, would you explain?

144
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,510
Yasunori would you explain?

145
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,313
Well, the president wanted the people
who are against

147
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,149
the development of the ropeway
to be first ones to ride it,

149
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,486
so as to make them understand
how wonderful it is.

151
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,656
I wonder if that's really the reason...?

152
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,691
Could there have been
some other reason...?

154
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,227
By the way Mr Machida

155
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,530
you were all by the door of the ropeway,
weren't you?

157
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,335
Are you insinuating that we pushed
Eizo Dohmoto out the window?

159
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,204
I don't think that's possible

160
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:50,509
Because the door on Mr. Machida's side
was locked

162
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:56,849
Moreover, its a double lock and I had the
keys so it couldn't have been opened.

164
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,618
Which means that
you had free access to the door

166
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,552
and could open it If you wanted to.

167
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,290
No, she couldn't have committed
the crime either.

169
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,426
Although it was in the dark,

170
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,429
I think it would've been impossible for her
to move struggling Eizo over to the door

172
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,264
and push him out, with her strength.

173
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:16,135
I wonder?
I don't think it Is impossible though

175
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,004
I was sitting right next to the door,

176
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,607
but I didn't hear the rattling
of the door opening.

178
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,843
However,
the:window cannot be opened either...

180
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,614
And, the emergency exit doesn't seem to
have been used

182
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,548
hen how...

183
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,794
A, Anyway, will you all please walk on
down to the foot of the mountain!

185
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,762
Let's talk over the details there!

186
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,898
Oh Yasunori,

187
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,535
is it okay for us
to use the special guest room?

189
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,804
Y,Yes of course, please be my guest.

190
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,942
Yasunori sure 1s acting a bit strange.

191
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,545
Yeah I'm sure he's hiding something.

192
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,115
No he wants to say something,
but is hesitant of mentioning it...!

194
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,784
What one earth is it, he wants to say

195
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,219
Come to think of it, back then

196
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,490
Preparations are perfect.
Nobody's noticed anything

198
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,928
The conyversationsback then,
and when Eizo's corpse was found

200
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:22,267
it.It cant be...
I wasn t supposed to turn out like this

202
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,971
Maybe he was expecting
some other*result .?

204
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,442
Is there such a thing as the curse
of the statue of goddess?

206
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,512
We come to write an article
on it and we end up as suspects

208
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,414
Could this really be some
kind of a curse?

210
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,918
Don't be ridiculous!
We're luc Â«! This.is'a real scoop!

212
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,123
He other result may be...!

213
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,595
Even if we were to ask Yasunori to come
to the station with us on his own initiative,

215
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:53,165
we d still have to figure out how Eizo
who disappeared from the ropeway

217
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,267
ended up being found in the palm

218
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,101
of the statue of the goddess
in a matter of seconds 7

220
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,071
That's right.

221
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,307
Well, the biggest problem.

222
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,813
The corpse couldn't have walked all the
way. up to the goddess on its own, so

224
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,516
It couldn't be that

225
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,419
No...but if that were to be the case

226
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,488
It mustzbe that shed....!!

227
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,404
I've found it!

228
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,911
What's this? There something stuck to

229
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,079
1 hisÂ»is...*.

230
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,527
Worker's slacks... Just great!

231
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,428
Al I need now Is

232
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,632
Okay! I can use that mop...!

233
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:05,938
All set.

234
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:06,271
Hey!!

235
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,675
Just what are you doing here?!!

236
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,643
You scared the wits out of me

237
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,946
What dofyou mean I scared you!

238
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,748
You d get people worried disappearing
all of a sudden!!

240
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,650
I'm sorry

241
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,719
Oh, right, Ran!

242
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:21,920
What is it?

243
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,924
I'm a bit cold,
so won't you lend me your jacket?

246
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,427
Okay. sure.

247
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:30,329
Here you go

248
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,499
Thanks! I'll be waiting for you
at the foot of the mountain, then.

250
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,533
Oh, Conan...?!

251
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,805
What 2? You mean
, ounre leavin 1 me: here like this

255
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,928
Just as I thought...!

256
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,436
Yasunori,

257
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,407
in the ropeway you were sitting
Iong side Eizo...!

259
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,744
It's strange that
you didn't notice a thing...!

261
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,013
Just what are you hiding?

262
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,649
L,I'm not hiding anything...!

263
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,185
You re talking
Iike I'm the killer or something...!!

265
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,455
Show me the evidence, will you!!

266
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,925
No, I didn't say
you were the killer or-anything

268
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,226
Since it's such a mysterious case,

269
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,062
we're trying to catch some clues
by questioning all of you

271
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,398
Then why don't you also question
everybody else?

273
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,201
Conan...!

274
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,040
You came down before me, and yet
why are you here after me.

276
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,509
I sort of got lost

277
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,476
Won't you please let us go, already!!

278
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:57,215
I have no motive
for killing Eizo Dohmoto!!

280
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,152
So, you don't want to have anything
to do with anybody here

282
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,387
because you can't blackmail,
any longer eh...?

284
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,457
I can't stand watching the ugly dispute
over family affairs any longer!!

286
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,759
Watch your mouth!

287
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,829
Well, well, everyone, cool it, all right...!

288
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,029
It'll only be a while longer

289
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,032
Officer Yokomizo!

290
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,970
Why don { we all try
riding the ropeway again?

292
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,738
The ropeway...?

293
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,341
Hey, you stay out of this!!

294
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,576
Yes, let's ride it!!

295
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,311
They say its best to,go
to the site a hundred times!!

297
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,114
We may find something new!!

298
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,050
We're riding that stuff again!

299
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,187
No curse or anything like that
is involved in this case!!

301
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,492
I've figured out why the two journalists of
Tokai Nippo were invited on the test run!

303
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,095
And, the trick as to how Eizo disappeared!

304
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,464
Yasunori's strange remark.

305
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,366
And the wrist in the incinerator!

306
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,937
I'm going to figure the entire mystery
inside the ropeway!!

308
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,758
Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that you're...?

309
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,593
Shut up! Does it bother you?

310
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,294
Oh no!

311
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,396
I'm relieved!

312
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,033
Now that I know that the renown detective
Is just as human as we all are!

314
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,201
Hey, Ran.

315
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,541
Hat...?! Why do something hike that.

316
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,444
Pops said to do it secretly.

317
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,312
Dad said so...?

318
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:36,682
Okay

319
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,621
10 sheep, 11 sheep

320
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,323
Pops, are you trying to fall asleep
or something?

322
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,126
Don't talk to me
I'll forget what I'm counting!!

324
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,494
What number sheep was it

325
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,162
Okay

326
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,698
I'll let you sleep as much as you want.

327
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:55,933
It's come

328
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,637
What...?! Mr. Mouri, what's wrong

329
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,473
+ Sorit's finally come!!!

330
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:02,741
Dad!

331
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,278
Take a picture of him.
He's become the Sleeping Kogoro!

333
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,178
Yes, sir!!!

334
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:13,185
Yasunorl,
excuse me for all my rude remarks

336
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:18,523
But I knew from the start
that you are not the one who killed Eizo!

338
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,826
Just as expected of you, Mr. Mouri...!

339
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,864
Didn { you have plans with Eizo to do
something that would surprise everyone

341
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:30,736
at today's commencement event?

342
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:36,141
A large-scale scheme
that would get rid of the rumor

344
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,845
of the curse of the statue of goddess that
Is creating a bad image of the ropeway,

346
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:43,415
as well as something that would be a
great way to advertise the ropeway...!

348
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,220
I will now attempt to replay your plan!

349
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,758
Hat the...?

350
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,925
What on earth us going on?

351
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,230
U myo horen gekyo...

352
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,365
1,It's the same thing
that happened back then!

354
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,201
WwW. What s about to happen anyway?
Cut it out!

356
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,678
RR. Ran is gone?!

357
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,914
Just like the time father disappeared

358
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,183
How on earth...

359
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,752
I,Is something like this possible...

360
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,522
Mr. Mouri,
where did your daughter disappear to?

362
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,857
Please look at the statue co the goddess!

363
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,159
Can't be...

364
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,064
Aaagh?! Look, on top of the palm
of the statue of the goddess!!

366
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,103
Ran...?! No...

367
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,740
A dummy wearing Ran's jacket...?

368
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,211
Exactly! Its made with a mop and
some branches

370
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,946
Come out here Ran!

371
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,215
What?!

373
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,787
U,Under the seat...?!

374
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,491
You thought up this grand scaled,
yet simple plan,

376
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:03,795
Yasunori, and Enzo acted out...!

377
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,030
Isn't that right!!

378
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:11,036
Yes..l asked an acquaintance
who us a doll maker

380
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:14,940
to secretly make a rubber dummy
duplicate of my father

382
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,243
The day before
the commencement ceremony

384
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,581
After I left your party
and started off down the esplanade,

386
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,817
I stopped over at the observatory

387
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,621
to pick up the dummy of my father
that I had asked to be made beforehand,

389
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,122
and put it on the palm
of the statue of the goddess

391
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,494
The palm of the statue of the goddess
can ony be seen from inside the ropeway

393
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,463
that has come out of the tunnel

394
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,868
- . ow
aswy I n ave oworry
about being seen by anyone

397
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,403
You went on to carry out your plan

398
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:49,140
the following day
during the commencement ceremony

400
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,377
s...after we entered the tun

401
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,313
I severed the circuit cord for the lights

402
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,617
After the lights went out, I immediately,

403
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,019
took my recorder out
and played the chant

405
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,189
After father put on an act of being terrified

406
00:17:04,724 --> 00:17:07,058
he hid in the space under the seat

407
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,796
And, I stuck the talisman
onto the window glass

409
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,569
I'm the one who brushed journalist's
Nakano's camera onto the ground

411
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:20,739
Because I didn't want the trick to
be disclosed by the flash of the camera

413
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,777
The aisle under the seat is the place
to put emergency goods,

415
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,980
and weights necessary
when the wind is strong but

417
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,883
I had taken everything out beforehand

418
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,053
While everyone was headed
for the observatory,

420
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,290
my father was supposed to go back
to the tunnel using the empty ropeway,

422
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,858
then jump down

423
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,062
After arriving at the observatory,

424
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,599
he took the dummy away from the palm
of the statue of the goddess,

426
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,702
and after throwing it over the cliff,
went up in place of the dummy instead.

428
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,171
He was supposed to greet all of us
who went to check on him with a smile

430
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,339
Well?

431
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,878
Curses and evil spells...
no such things exist in this world!!

433
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,847
He was supposed to convince everyone
that there was no grounds

435
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,450
to the rumor that was going around
and get rid of it all at once.

437
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,519
So, that's why we were invited to come

438
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,387
No, that's not the only reason!

439
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,659
Eizo was planning to frame
Tokai Nippo up!

441
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,129
Just what do you mean
by he was planning to frame us up?

443
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,198
Do you have any idea

444
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:23,034
why the commencement ceremony
started in the afternoon?

446
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,770
It's probably the whim of the host

447
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,507
Mr. Machida, you sent in an article from
the top of the mountain, didn't you!

449
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,108
This Is Machida!

450
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,011
Please leave one page
of the evenin news o en!

453
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,346
There's been a curse!!

454
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,581
Enzo Dohmoto's been stabbed!

455
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,049
On top of the palm of the statue
of the goddess!!

457
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,353
If Eizo were not stabbed,

458
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,454
would you have been able to change
the article for something else?

460
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,825
The deadline for the evening news
is 13:30!

462
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,795
Right! Your agency would have put false
information in the papers!

464
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,430
In other words,

465
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,699
Eizo's purpose for scheming
this trick was to prove

467
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,868
that no such thing as a curse existed,

468
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,072
as well as to soil
the reputation of Tokai Nippo!

470
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,741
See...!

471
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,642
That's why you said
what you did back then!!

473
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,313
I wonder how long you'll be able to stay
obnoxious like that...

475
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,216
What a dirty thing to do...!!

476
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,584
By the way,

477
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:16,221
aside from curses and spells,
there is another sad tragedy hidden

479
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,724
behind the tunnel of this ropeway,
isn't there?!

481
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,394
The accidental death of the worker

482
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,129
I heard about it from Rina.

483
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,632
Can you tell us about it, Yasunon?

484
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,336
The person who passed away
was called Takahata

486
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:36,174
tHis mother was-not only sickly,
but had long years of obligatory feelings

488
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,878
towards the Dohmoto family,so father
forcibly made them agree not to publicize

490
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,913
the fact in return for cash

491
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,416
Did the late Mr. Takahata have
any other family members alive?

493
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,320
I've heard that his father
who had divorced 10 years ago,

495
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,123
took his younger sister
along to Tokyo with him.

497
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,194
It could be that his sister 1s In here

498
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,564
In the ropeway with us this minute!!

499
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,397
What?!

500
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,166
But, the only ones In this ropeway are

501
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,669
Ms. Yoshino... don't tell me that?!

502
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:09,406
Yes, the one who killed Eizo Dohmoto,
is you,

504
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,243
Ms. Ayaka Yoshino!!

505
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,314
She killed dad...?!

506
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,016
She killed dad...?!

507
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,852
Ayaka is the killer...?! Oh, no

508
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:30,662
The killer had to be someone
who could act secretly with Eizo,

510
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:34,199
and someone he would not suspect... .!

511
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,535
Ayaka, who stayed back at the ropeway
station at the top of the mountain

513
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,636
because she wasn't well

514
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,704
got on the ropeway headed downward

515
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,110
Since the station at the top
of the mountain was in chaos

517
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:48,445
because of what happened
to the president,

519
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:50,515
nobody noticed you getting onto
the ropeway headed downward....!

521
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,487
Since you were going around
with the president,

523
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:58,923
you stabbed him on top
of the palm of the statue of goddess.

525
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,059
Then, you burned his dummy
in the incinerator

527
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:04,162
After you made everything was burned,

528
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,998
you went back to the observatory
where everyone was...!

530
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:14,038
The only one who could've committed
this crime was you,

532
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,341
who was capable of knowing
the secret between Eizo and Yasunori!

534
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,545
What you just mentioned are
all mere assumptions!

536
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,980
Yasunori,

537
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,316
will you please open the package
that is right beside me?

539
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,251
Yes, Sir

540
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,654
This one, right...?

541
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,191
T, This is...?!

542
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,393
Yikes! What's that...?!

543
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,795
Could this be the the dummy,s wrist?!

544
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,632
This was found left in the incinerator!

545
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:46,237
When Ayaka burned the dummy,
she dropped something very important

547
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,274
on it's hand .!

548
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,676
What's this...?!

549
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,044
It looks like jewelry or something

550
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,480
Oh no, don't tell me...

551
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,314
Yes...!

552
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,817
The jade that belongs on the broche
that you have on your chest....!

554
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,121
If we enlarge the picture that was taken
during the commencement ceremony,

556
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:07,358
it is plain to see that
nothing was wrong with your broche

558
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,560
before you got on the ropeway!

559
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:15,300
It's exactly as Mr. Mouri says

560
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:18,269
Could you tell us why you did it?

561
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,572
Although our parents were divorced,

562
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,474
I kept in touch
with my brother all the time,

564
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,143
and we used to encourage each other.

565
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,146
Last year when my mother
fell into critical condition

567
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,948
I went to see her at the hospital.

568
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:33,685
She told me about the mortifying death
of my brother while crying.

570
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,255
As well as the hatred she felt for
Eizo Dohmoto before she died

572
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:41,125
I hid my identity
and entered Dohmoto Tours

574
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,095
So that I could avenge the death
of my brother

576
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,531
who had been driven
to his death by Eizo Dohmoto,

578
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,401
as well as to take revenge for my mother
who was made to suffer by him

Ayaka...She's so kind and nice and yet

624
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,765
The reason the story of the curse
of the statue of the goddess

626
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:32,236
were probably handed down
for generations to teach

628
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:36,507
that if people do wrong
or commit an unforgivable crime,

630
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,310
a ternfying end awaits us...

631
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,846
Just like the case this time...

632
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,985
Ugh! Oh no, I fell asleep...!

633
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,589
Hey where is everybody?!

634
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:55,526
Hi there, Sleeping Kogoro!!
