Oh, hello. Megumi? It's me. Ayumi.

35
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:02,935
Megumi, about next Saturday...

36
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:05,338
I have something to do,
but I'm supposed to be

38
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:09,809
rabbit monitor that day, so I was/wondering
If you could change places with me...

40
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,678
Oh. okay!
You're going out with Conan. right?

42
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,750
Yeah, could you....?

43
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:19,218
Okay. I'll change with you!

44
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:19,952
What?!

45
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:23,356
But promise that yousll tell me
about your trip like always!

47
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:25,624
Because every time you and
Conan go out together

49
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,493
you get mixed up in
a case of one kind or another...

51
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,795
Okay! I'll tell you everything that goes on.
See you! Thank you, Megumi!

53
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,164
Okay! I'll tell you everything that goes on.
See you! Thank you, Megumi!

55
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:34,433
All right!

56
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:38,704
I get to go camping! I get to go
camping Saturday and Sunday!!

59
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:40,773
Oh. no...

60
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,115
I wonder-why -everybodysseems to
treat Ai astif she were an adult...?

62
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,984
Everybody tends to call
her by her last name...

64
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,904
I guess it can't be helped because

65
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,906
people who transfer over from
other schools seem mature...

67
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:02,795

Haibara and Doc are late

72
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,576
I wonder what's keeping them...

73
00:03:17,744 --> 00:03:21,313
Doc's probably taking
his time getting ready again!

75
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:25,051
Okay, when she comes out,
I'm going to smile naturally and

77
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,986
say good morning to her
and call her by her first name.

79
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:30,456
I wonder if shell be offended...

80
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:37,129
Oh. but:she might:just,
greet meiintimately too...

82
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:40,199
But, insher case most times not...

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,469
Well, it doesn't matter if she
greets-me the same way or not!

85
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,670
After all, we're friends...!

86
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,073
Oh: Doc! You're late!

88
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:49,608
It's way past departure time!

89
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,810
Sorry. sorry.

90
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,345
It took a while for us to get prepared...

91
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:56,415
It's because you didn't get.~yp
everything ready before going to sleep!

93
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,617
You got me there...

94
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,786
What you took time doing,
was:not getting ready

96
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,188
but cleaning up. right?

97
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:05,257
The minute I take my eyes off you,
there are heaps of trash...

99
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:06,459
Oh, good morning...

Sort of...

105
00:04:15,001 --> 00:04:16,669
Because I'm nocturnal...

106
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:20,206
Oh bo

107
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,875
Oh well...

108
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,076
I still have a lot of time left...

109
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,023
Hey. Doc

110
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:40,092
Did you find out the
meaning of that diary?

112
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:41,494
What diary...?

113
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:46,499
The-diary of Mr. Itakura
the computer programmer,

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,302
who was asked by the Men in Black
to make some kind of system software!

117
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:54,406
The diary that had the secret dealings
of the Black Organization written

120
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:54,740
The diary that had the secret dealings

126
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:59,211
in it in invisible ink on the blank page...

127
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,333
The meaning of the mysterious
Iast word that was written inside!

129
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:08,153
Oh. you mean the words...

130
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:13,192

I have no idea what

I have no idea what
those words mean but

148
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:21,567
I've found out that
the woman hates cats!

150
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,369
She hates cats?

151
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,106
I stopped reading then,
because Al came along.

153
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:30,309
but there was a
continuation to that diary...

155
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,048
After she finished saying so, the meowing
of the cat started getting louder behind her.

157
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:39,585
The woman started to panic a bit and hung
up the phone. That's what was written...

159
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:42,388
That's like knowing nothing at all.

160
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,059
She could've hung up because
her cat frolicked with her...

162
00:05:47,226 --> 00:05:50,646
Or she may have been allergic to cats.
There are many people who are. right?

164
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:53,966
Only if you knew more
about Haibara's father,

166
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,152
Dr. Atsushi Miyano...

167
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:58,821
Atsushi Miyano

168
00:05:59,206 --> 00:06:01,707
I know Dr. Miyano

169
00:06:03,076 --> 00:06:06,111
I think I met him once or twice at;
the invention announcement site

171
00:06:06,112 --> 00:06:10,783
You mean you know the mad scientist
who was ousted from the scientific society?

173
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,718
Mad scientist?

174
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:16,438
He was a-'nice and
friendly man. Dr. Miyano

176
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:19,858
took a liking to my inventions too

177
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:25,998
His wife-was-reticent and you could
never tell what she was thinking

179
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:29,100
If I remember correctly,
her name was Elena

181
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:32,237
Elena?
You mean his wife wasn't Japanese?

183
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,924
Nope. They seem to have met
when she was here in Japan

185
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,643
as an exchange student from England...

186
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:43,314
But, I had no idea that
she was Al's mother...

188
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:48,587
I see, no wonder she
Iooks a bit non-Japanese

190
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:54,927
Come to think of it, Dr. Miyano never
mentioned what he was researching

192
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,362
H.Hey. look ahead!

193
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,638
Whatss wrong!

194
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:07,673
Thank god...

195
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:09,541
Be careful. will you. Doc...

196
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,343
It's because you talked
to me while I'm driving

198
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:15,314
What a big car!

199
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,583
That is big!

200
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,818
It looks to be a camping car.

201
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:23,889
It shouldn't be left in a
place like this, it's dangerous

203
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,358

How lucky I'm sure
camping would be a lot of fun

RE an
Hey. brats!

210
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:36,435
Quit touching my car
with those dirty hands of yours!

212
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,372
It's our best friend's
precious car, you know!

214
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,007
Right. Haruka?

215
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:49,331
But, I don't think my uncle who lent me
the car would mind them just touching it

217
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:51,884
You're kind to kids. aren't you?

218
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:56,055
You hate me when
I smoked in the car and then

220
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,024
You smoke too much, Reiji!

221
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:02,461
That's why you fell for her, right
Reiji, because she's kind?

223
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:03,295
Shut up...

224
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,165
Oh, so it was your car.

225
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm so sorry...

226
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:10,369
It was such a rare car
that I couldn't help myself

228
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,704
I'm sorry...

229
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:15,140
But our hands aren't all that dirty!

230
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,642
Okay. okay. sonny

231
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,976
I'm sorry.

232
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:22,047
Hey. Yasumi, will you come take a look?

233
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:25,617
I think the meat's just
about ready. already

235
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:29,254
Wow. it looks delicious!!

236
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,824
The meat looks really expensive!

237
00:08:31,825 --> 00:08:34,960
Would you like to join us?
Since there's some more meat left anyway

239
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:35,861
Are you serious?!

240
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:38,263
But. NETS for tonight

241
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:41,166
Come on, don't get stingy!

242
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,802
If we run low, we can always
borrow Haruka's wallet and

244
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:47,906
go get some more at the supermarket
at the foot of the mountain! Right Haruka!

246
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:48,741
Sure.

247
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:50,808
Please eat to your heart's content!

249
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:52,344
All right!

251
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:56,849
This is delicious!

253
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,284
You're members of a university circle

254
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:03,154
?7 vf
Yes. the name's The Outdoor Club!

256
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,524
We go to the mountains
and the beach.

258
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,260
We all went to Hawaii
together before too!

260
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:12,164
Well, everything is thanks
to our sponsor, Haruka. though!

262
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:13,899
Not really...

263
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,503
You're good at cooking
Yasumi and Relji's a good driver.

265
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:21,306
I don't have any
special talents like picking

267
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:23,442
edible mountain plants or
fishing like our cook here so

269
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:25,611
the most I can do is dish out cash...

270
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:31,582
I'm a helpless Ms. Richie-Rich, so
the most I can do is dish out cash

272
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,220
If only for once in my life, I'd like to
say something like that!

274
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:39,892
Honestly, you're way too
good for a womanizer like Reiji!

276
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,462
Didn't I just tell you to

277
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:49,802
A rich friend. huh...
They're just like Ran and Sonoko

279
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,206
Are you feeling sick or: something?
You don't seem to be eating much

281
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:58,210
No. VF was just thinking,
that's how things usually are

283
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,349
Okay I'm going to take it.

284
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,104
How is it?

285
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,807
Too bad. 10 seconds 31!

286
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:30,509
You couldn't make it under 10 seconds!

287
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:34,046
No joke!
And I was quite confident

289
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,347
Too bad!

290
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,649
Oh? That. belt,

291
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,420
t's the:same kind that
Yoko Okino:was wearing the other day!

293
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:42,721
That's. right!

294
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,273
She was wearing her
outfit for her new song. right?

296
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:48,494
But. I'm the one who found this first!

297
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:51,830
You've been wearing that a lot
recen y, xaven you, asumi.

300
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:53,899
Because it's the same as
something an idol IS wearing!

302
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,967
That's right!

303
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:58,637
Why don't you eat at our place for dinner
as a token of our appreciation for lunch!

305
00:10:58,638 --> 00:10:59,904
Oh: really?

306
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:06,010
Wow, that sounds great! I guess we can
take it easy till dinner time, then!

308
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:06,979
Yeah!

309
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:14,736
How is it, Conan?

310
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:15,687
Yep. I think it's good.

311
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,223
Let me taste it too!

312
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:22,694
If you taste it, half of the.curry will
be gone. so you may: not!

314
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:24,428
Oh well, so sorry

315
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:29,301
I'll go get:the other people then!
Oh. let's go together!

317
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:30,969
A A AI

318
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:36,942
Ai, Ice: I wonder if it'll make them happy
if I told them we also have ice cream

320
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:39,945
I guess so...

321
00:11:44,684 --> 00:11:47,952
Wow! This curry is delicious!

322
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:50,989
Like to make our chef taste this too!

323
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,091
Where's Yasumi?

324
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,827
Haven't seen her for quite some time...

325
00:11:56,496 --> 00:12:00,231
Her bicycle's not here so
It seems she's gone somewhere...

327
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,702
Going shopping to the foot
of the mountain is too far

329
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:08,640
Maybe she went there,
the time is just about right too

331
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:10,142
There?

332
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,080
There's a great place about
5 minutes uphill by car from here.

334
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:17,582
I guess I'll go look for her.

335
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:22,187
Yeah, you guys
want to come too? It's a nice place

337
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:23,522
Yes: I'll go!

338
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:27,726
Then, I guess we'll accompany
you all on our Beetle too!

340
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:30,862
Then. why don't you come with us?

341
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:33,565
You'd like to ride the
camping car, wouldn't you?

343
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,367
Yes! I'd like to ride it!

344
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:40,238
Wow, fantastic!"Super!
This sofa is so fluffy!

346
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,808
Wow, fantastic! Super!
This sofa is so fluffy!

348
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,643
There's a TV here too!

349
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:48,013
There's a toilet and shower too!

350
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,948
It's like a hotel.

352
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,551
This is really something!

353
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:55,454
What is that sound...

354
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:56,989
Sounds like it's started already!

355
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,190
Rep!

356
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:00,558
Can you do what we
did last year this time too!

358
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,426
Okay.

361
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,063
What is it?

362
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:06,965
Oh. the sunroof

363
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,552
I'll hold you up, so would
you like to take a look?

365
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,204
Can we see something?

366
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:13,839
You'll see!

367
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:19,244
See. look

368
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:23,481
Wow...
Fireworks! Ites fireworks!

370
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,884
Hey. I wanna see too...

371
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,986
It's covered by the mountains
and I can't see it anymore

373
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:30,555
Okay. let's go back inside...

374
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:31,473
Okay...

375
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,595
Don't worry. When we get to the top of the
mountain you'll get to see it nice and clear!

377
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,172
Look out, Reij!

378
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:49,374
What's wrong?

379
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:53,645
I. I ran over something
that was on the road...

381
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:55,747
H.Hey. what do you mean something...

382
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:58,717
D.Don't tell me that...

383
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,195
D.don't tell me that...

384
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,168
WwW. What the

385
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,338
A wooden fence,
wooden fence!

387
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,342
What the, it-scared me.out of my wits,
I thoughtlittwas Yasumi

389
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:27,345
It seems to have decayed
and fell from above...

391
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:30,148
So. let's hurry to the spot!

392
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,350
The fireworks might end soon.

393
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:33,785
Okay.

394
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,171
Wow! How pretty!

395
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:56,475
Tamaya!

396
00:15:01,914 --> 00:15:06,017
This is indeed a great place
to watchithe fireworks!

398
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:11,089
Yes, we coincidentally found this place
when we camped here four years ago.

400
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,159
It's a place that not too
many people know of yet!

402
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,561
But, since we'll graduate
start working.

404
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:19,798
I guess this will be the last
time we'll be coming here together

406
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,101
By the way. I wonder where Yasumi is?

407
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,937
There are bicycle tire marks here!

408
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:29,024
By this broken fence...

409
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:32,244
D.Don't tell me she fell
from there or something

411
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:37,682
D.Don't be silly. If so. we would've
found her on the road on our way here...

413
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:38,784
B.but...

414
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,086
I'm sure that someone who recently came

415
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,955
here bumped into the fence
with his bicycle and broke it!

417
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:45,323
I wonder...

418
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,859
Even Yasumi is not that
much of a klutz...

420
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,264
But. I wonder where

421
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:52,631
But. I wonder where

422
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:57,536
Yasumi disappeared to I was positive
that she beat us to that spot

424
00:15:58,137 --> 00:15:59,171
Yes...

425
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:02,974
Is Yasumi a person who
usually does things like that?

427
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,211
Yes, even last.year she went
there-by bicycle before us

429
00:16:06,212 --> 00:16:06,912
Yes, even last year she went
there by bicycle before us

431
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,713
and boasted being the first one there...

432
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:11,516
I'm sure she went to
get something to eat!

434
00:16:11,517 --> 00:16:13,685
She's not you. Genta...

435
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:18,790
Hey. Reiji!

436
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,058
What now?!

437
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,261
S.She, She's there

438
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:23,495
S.She, She's there

439
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:24,462
Yasumibya 4

440
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:26,798
Yasumi?!

441
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,566
W. Where?!

442
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,968
T.The road...

443
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:33,839
In the middle. of the road...

444
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:46,751
The victim is Ms. Yasumi Shirato,
age 22, a university student...

446
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,054
Judging from the wound on her head

447
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:53,258
it seems she probably hit her head hard
on something and passed away...

449
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,659
You mean she fell to her death?

450
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:56,862
I believe so...

451
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:58,630
Is something wrong?

452
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,933
She's bleeding so much and yet

453
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:04,935
there is virtually no blood
stains on the road

455
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:06,338
You're right...

456
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,441
/When is the estimated time of death?

457
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,810
Around 5:00 or 6:00 in the evening...

458
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,479
That's strange!

459
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:20,886
You guys again. what's strange?

460
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:25,323
We came up this hill by car at night but...

461
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:28,093
Nobody was lying on the
road at that time!

463
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:32,664
We found Yasumi when we came
back down by car after a while!

465
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:37,235
Just what do you mean?
Will you give me more of the details?

467
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,839
Well. brought the kids
to a camping ground nearby,

469
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:44,743
and we happened to hit it
off well with these people...

471
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:48,012
Then we decided to ride in their
camping car and come to this

473
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:50,882
scenic spot to get a view
of the fireworks!

475
00:17:51,417 --> 00:17:54,519
You're friends of the victim. Yasumi?

476
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:58,807
Yeah, when we went to see the
fireworks and first passed by here,

478
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,260
the fireworks had already
started so it was past 7.00 p.m.

480
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:07,866
Then, on our way back at about 9:00 p.m.
after the fireworks. we found her...

482
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,868
our friend Yasumi,
who belonged to the same

484
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:12,270
university circle as
us lying here on the road

486
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:16,141
Which means that when you passed here

487
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:18,677
at after 7:00 pm.
You really saw no one lying here?

489
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:22,614
Yeah, the only thing we saw was the
wooden broken part of the fence

491
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:23,481
A wooden fence?

492
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:26,217
See, there's a wooden
ence on OP 0 O Moun awn.

494
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,853
That's where we were
watching the fireworks...

496
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:32,357
A part of the fence had broken off
and fell to the road below

498
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:36,795
so I avoided it by slamming on the
brakes. I kind of hit it a bit though

500
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:38,997
Was it eally a wooden fence?

501
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:39,998
Of course.

502
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:43,601
Only when we got to the top it
Iooked more like somebody had

504
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:45,670
deliberately broken it than
as if it had naturally broken off...

506
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:52,177
I thought that maybe Yasumi had gone
through it with her bicycle and fell off

508
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,611
Bicycle?

509
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,714
A bicycle that we had in the camping car...

510
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:00,919
Since the bicycle was missing we decided
to go up the mountain to that spot to

512
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,721
watch the fireworks
and look for her at the same time.

514
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:06,691
She always liked to
beat us to places too so

516
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,262
I figured that if she did fall from the above
we would find her bicycle or something

518
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:14,833
on the road along the way,
so I didn't think much of it...

520
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:19,570
This is...

521
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,927
Let's go to the place where you all?
Say you watched the fireworks!

523
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,587
There are tire marks of a bicycle
near the broken fence

525
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:38,490
I wonder if she fell from here after all...

526
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:42,594
Didn't you notice any tire
marks when you came here?

528
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:45,497
1.1 did notice, but I didn't think
that it there was any connection

530
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,265
Inspector Megure!

531
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,367
What's up. Officer Takagi!

532
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:52,704
I found the bicycle!
It seems to have been stuck in

534
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:55,240
the bushes on the
outer side of the guard rail!

536
00:19:55,241 --> 00:20:00,678
Oh, is that right!
Let's verify it. Will you bring it here!

538
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:03,915
Y.Yeah, no mistake about it!

539
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,552
That's the bicycle we
had in the camping care

541
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:10,320
Okay, try matching
the wheel mark then!

543
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,122
Yes. sir!

544
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:17,595
They seem to match!

545
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,765
Isee. which means...

546
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:24,903
Yasumi came here by bicycle
before you all got here,

548
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:29,007
and because it was dark, she
stopped her bicycle a bit too late,

550
00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:35,012
broke through the fence and fell over hit her
head somewhere on the road then bounced

552
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:39,517
and fell together with the bicycle into the
bushes on the outer side of the guard rail

554
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:43,021
And, while you were
all watching fireworks here

556
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:47,559
Yasumi's body that was stuck somewhere
in the bushes slipped off to the road below.

558
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,530
Then, on your way back from the fireworks
you happened to find her here...

560
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:55,300
This looks to be an accident...

561
00:20:56,102 --> 00:20:58,503
Yes, then the thing
about no blood on the

563
00:20:58,504 --> 00:21:01,239
road where she was
found is understandable too

565
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,674
I wonder about that...

566
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,411
Yasumi came here last year too. rights

567
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,379
She should've known about this
open square as well as the fact

569
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,216
that there is a cliff on the other
side of the fence too, right?

571
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:14,752
If so, I wonder why
she crashed into the fence?

573
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,390
So, it was dark
and she couldn't see the fence...

575
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,493
If it was dark. wouldn't
she try to be even more careful?

577
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:25,029
She should've known it
as dangerous, right...?

579
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,164
WwW . Well...

580
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:31,669
Maybe she was happy that she was the
first one here and got carried away?

582
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,474
Right! That's why she couldn't stop
herself fast enough and fell over!

584
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:37,475
Then...

585
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,044
Oh, watch out. Conan!

586
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:44,281
If Yasumi fell from here, there
should be a place on the road below

588
00:21:44,884 --> 00:21:48,586
where the blood
stains of when she hit her are.

590
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,756
How about it, Officer Takagi?

591
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,095
Well, the shattered pieces of the
broken light cover were found, but

593
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:59,464
no blood stains were found yet...

594
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,199
What did you say!

595
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:05,203
Inspector, could it be that Yasumi
did not fall to her death but rather

597
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:11,075
Somebody deliberately left wheel tracks
and tried to make it look like an accident

599
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:12,210
In other words, a homicide.

600
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:16,047
Which means that the killer is someone

601
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:18,850
who could freely take
the bicycle from the camping car

603
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:22,887
Yeah, her friends who
belong to the same circle.

605
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:27,125
The probability of the killer
being among the three is high!

Who drives this camping car?

653
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:03,788
The one who's good at driving is Reij

654
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:05,656
who used to be in
a motorcycle gang before

656
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,194
Hey. hey, if it's moving
the car. all three of us can!

00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:11,762
What's this?

659

D.Don't tell me that!

660
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:17,135
