00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,756
The answer lies behind he message

2
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,224
But love and hate twist the path to the truth

3
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,059
Who is to win? God only knows

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,594
He seas through the one and only truth

It wi s Helji and Kazuha

16
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,758
However, finding out that both
events will be on the same day.

18
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,293
The people from Osaka
started to have a fight.

20
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,999
In order to decide which one to watch,
Kogorno comes up "with a suggestion.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,435
A.deduction battld begins!

23
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:24,476

Kazuha...

25
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,415
What's wrong, Kazuha?

26
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:34,303
I'm just eon-fused
This dying message is killing me... «

28
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,757
If we canst figure out what it means,
were gonna lose this battle.

31
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:43,495
No Takarazuka show...
Just don't wanna lose. so...

33
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:44,997
Battle...

34
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:51,937
Come on, there are no winners
or losers in deduction...

36
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,840
Because

37
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:59,545
what we. have tg do is, tom
find the 'one:and only truth...

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,713
Huh.

40
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,215
That's true .

41
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,468
Yo, Heiji...

42
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:10,805
You got it too, right? The true meaning
of the dying message. I mean...

44
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,724
Nope...Not at all.

46
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:19,298
How come we don't have the actual blocks
that have the ink spots on them?

48
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,600
If these were the actual
blocks. not thggpictures.

50
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:24,102
We could've looked at them like this.

51
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,371
Maybe there was something
hidden behind them...

53
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,741
What the...

54
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,529
Well. too bad we can't see the backside
of thetblocks because these: are pictures...

56
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:36,748
Hmm?

57
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,149
Hmm?

58
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:37,549
Hmm?

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,588
I 888.

60
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:42,854
I get it.

61
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,089
I get it

62
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:50,362
It seems that The president
was having a hark Itime

64
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,432
putting the ink on the blocks. huh?

65
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,068
His hands were tied behind his back.

66
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,471
Plus, heihad to readjthe characters
on the blocks with his fingers

68
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,241
in order to choose the right ones, right?

69
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,777
Look at those blocks. Each of them
has different characters

71
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,980
and also a picture of an animal on it

72
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,949
I would be confused and
pick the wrong block. for sure.

74
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,852
If It wasn't blocks but
pieces of Japanese chess...

77
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,787
it would be so much easier

78
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,357
cause there's only one character
on each backside of the piece!

80
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,458
Kudo .

81
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,761
OOnly one character... on the backside...?

82
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,732
What? That would be even harder. stupid...

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,369
The pieces are:not big enough to see

84
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,605
it was the. victim s dying
message or not

87
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,540
Oh, are they'...

88
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:40,145
Yeah. Maybe the President just dropped
\the pieces on the ink accidentally

90
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,215
We'll nevor knows right?

91
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,819
Maybe the dying message
Is actually on the .

93
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,958
So. you did find the motPé to kill from

94
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,961
the four workers who found the victim.

95
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,229
Ah, yes

96
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,965
Ah... First...about the
accountant. Nao Aiko...

98
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,718
She was the forme
wife of President sujiya.

100
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,504
She had an affair with another
man and got divorced...

102
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,873
They were having problems with alimony...

104
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,058
Atsushi Hasamtmmsales clerk...

106
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,978
He had been told by the
victim that he would be fired

108
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,014
if this year's revenue
goes below last-ycar'sw

110
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:20,052
The planner, Isa0 Nakagami
had been told the same thing...

112
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:23,722
Also, there had been: a lot.of conflict
between him and the victim

114
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,926
Lastly. the vice president, Hajime IWatoml

115
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,195
was not having 1 fight or
anything with the president...

117
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,331
But actually, he is supposed
to be the next pres dent

119
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,433
If anything happens to President T'sujiya.

120
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,334
Hmm...

121
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,603
So all of them have 1
decent motive for murder...

123
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,008
A.Uue.o ui...

124
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,945
There you go... You're almost there!

125
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,450
There had been a lot of conflict between
the president and the workers.

127
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,519
I'm curious what kept this
ompany going so long...

129
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,620
Yeah

130
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,124
The workers had been
drinking in-Mr. Iwatomi's house,

132
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,260
complaining about their boss and stuff...

133
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,180
On Hn) Edn WAN pao
the day of the murder,

135

the three workers went to
Mr. Iwatdmi's Rouse to drink

Oh. one more thing .

142
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:19,244
His is a sort of unrelated topic
to the murder but I'll give it 1 try...

144
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,148
Each worker has.a strange obsession...

145
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,750
Obsession?

146
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,320
Ms. Aiko gets cold-esily
so-she has 50 pairs of gloves...

I heard some money matters

It's all because of our vague alibis
We 'have no proof.as to it.

Yes...the President gets upset
if we do it because we might ruin itd

240
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:18,940
So Mr. Tsujlya always rips it off

241
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:22,811
AND keeps. it in his room like
some kind of precious treasure.

243
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,981

00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,329
Clearlyl

276
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,616
Kudo...

278
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,067
Hm!?

282
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,237
Ran.

284
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,658
I found it!'it's the June calendar.
I 7 SEN raw

287
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:47,312
There's a thin bloodstain,
but I can still see it!

289
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,847
That must be it-!

290
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,215
The murderer is...

291
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,050
I got it...

292
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,151
hat?

293
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,420
Ran. I think...

294
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,856
I got the answer',

295
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,964
Yeah? ScFiously?
You really got the answer?

297
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:10,635
You know the dying, message
t e owner left at the murder scene!

299
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,172
Yeah, the four building blocks
with the ink spots. right?

301
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:18,326
That looked like a hiddon secret code,

302
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,112
but it was simply indicating the killer!

303
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,847
The killer?

304
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,918
I don't think there's anyaperson
that looks like a buildingOblock... *!

306
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,653
No. nol it's. the mame!

307
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,821
Name?

308
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,991
I don't think 0" "mo" "¢hir "ya" have
wything to do with their name though.

310
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:37,896
Remember? Heiji was saying the victim
might have just put the blocks on the ink.

312
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,166
And not because he wanted us to read
what's WITH the ink spots...

314
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,436
In other words,
the backside of the ink spotted character

316
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,938
Is the true dying message.
Do ou get it?

318
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,942
I understand But we can't seo
what behind those characters...

320
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,646
I can ask the forensic officers
to bring them here...

322
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,049
No, you don't have to do that!
Look.

324
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,152
The blocks of 0 character

325
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,406
Wouldalook like this
if were to unfold it...

327
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,424
U. e 07

328
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:10,327
You ll know what kind of character
will be in the blank space. right?

331
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:15,533
Just in case. I checked the-blocks
over there. As I expected.

333
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:21,589
The characters are lined up
int e correct order...

335
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,707
Ms AKO... Am: right?

336
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,462
Yeah....each block contains
five characters with the same consonant

338
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:31,132
and an animal picture in the same _order.

339
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:39,891
If you know which character is
on which side it is no longer a hustle!

341
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:46,231
The backside of 0 is "I"
Aocordnm l. ., is "mi" and "chi" is "to".

344
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:51,936
Right! So the real dying message 1s
I" mi "to"...and what's the last one'...

346
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,838
Hm? Doesn't make sense.

347
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,077
According to Kazuha,
the last block "ya" is supposed to be "yu"

349
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,946
But I actually see "yo- on it.

350
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:08,686
That block 1s special
Look. You see "wo" on the right side of yo"?

353
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:14,793
That means this block consists of

355
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:21,065
If we put those characters in the same order
The animal part will be "'n That's it!

358
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,170
Acco ding to the same rule, "ya" Is "wa"...

359
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,038
0 the dying message is.

360
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,940
I "mi" "to" "wa", do you get it?

361
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,974
" "Ml" to" "wa", do you get 7?

362
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:36,798
So...that's ah...
Imiwato...lwamito...lwato...!

366
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,351
Thatswight... That's hat the president
wanted to tell us before he was killed

368
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,490
Mr Iwatemil

369
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,558
It was your name!

370
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:53,264
Il see. You wanted to kill your bess
and take over the company. didn't you?

372
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:54,599
Ah~no I"...

375
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,236
Oh my god, Ran! You actually solve
the case before Hem!

378
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,872
Yeah! We won this deduction battle!

379
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,373
So that means.

380
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:04,292
We can go to the Takarazuka show!

381
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:05,743
Ah cough!

383
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,214
sorry Kazuha...
Mr. Iwatomi is not the murderer.

385
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,315
What?

386
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,818
I had a phone call from Chiba...

387
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,288
The 29th of last month, around $5 pm,
when the murder occurred

389
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,757
Mr. Iwatomi was In fact on TV...

391
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,725
No way...

393
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,793
Why?

394
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,295
Don't ask me why.

395
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,164
You have a twin brother?

396
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,332
No I don't

397
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,400
Hmm...

398
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:34,339
Sorry to tell you this but,
Kazuha's idea was wrong...

400
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,340
Oh no...

402
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,610
She was right.

403
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,582
EH) op
Tho blocks of all "wa=*"to "mit aro
really the dying. message

406
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,585
the president Tsujiya left
before he was killed!

408
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,786
Hell.

410
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,624
But Heiji...
Mr. Iwatomi has an alibi...

412
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,559
Of course he has!

413
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,362
Because Mr. lwatomi is not
the murderer at all...

415
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:57,729
What!?

416
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,963
What!?

417
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:03,368
Sorry, you just said that
it was the real dying message. didn't you?

419
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,304
Yeah. For sure. VI did...

420
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,741
Bull didn't say the message was correct,
did 7?

422
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,160
Wow. what are you talking about?

423
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,162
He don't ou remember?

424
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,015
How did President Tsujiya leave
a message on the blocks?

426
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,549
Tr 0 remember that!

427
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:24,589
1, Well. I think he was tied down
on the floor behind the desk...

429
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,860
Heypicked the building blocks and put
them in the puddle of ink on the floor.

XY fur winx o) HS / da KC

432

You got that right

433
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,099
The problem is the ink stain
hat's on the president's back.

435
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,801
What's wrong with it?

436
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:40,905
He got that inkastain when
he was fighting the)murderer. right?

438
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,242
Yeah, that's what I thought at first

439
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:47,512
But I noticed the unnaturalness
on this desk

441
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,014
Unnaturalness pg

443
00:15:55,087 --> 00:16:00,892
\Oh- it's weird! The chair justOhit itWlightly,
but the pen stand fell

445
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,926
Huh?

446
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,729
Well, the ink bottlesfell off the desk
because people were fighting and

448
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,531
hit. ing the desk hard, right?

449
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,598
Right...

450
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,802
Then how come the pen stand
did not fall during the fight?

452
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,704
That is certainly strange...

453
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,106
This just sounds like...

454
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,943
The murderer spilledl the ink
on the floor on purpose!

456
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,480
No way!! Why would he do that!?

457
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:27,168
That's like hers giving the president
a chance to wiite something about him...

460
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:28,753
Oh...

461
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,087
RY 000
Oh...

463
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,155
It waskxon purpose...

464
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,461
That's night! The murderer dehbernately
spilled thc ink on the floor...

466
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,397
To compel the president Lo leave
a dying message about him!

468
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:43,568
But it's dangerous
The president could leave the killer's name.

470
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,038
That's only if he saw the killer's face.

471
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:51,209
Hey, why don't you lie down on the floor
Iike the president was

473
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,511
What?...
OK...

475
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,750
WED YOR oO pate
how the president felt...

477
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,285
H.How he felt...?

478
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,059
I got it! Shoes.

479
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,227
It's the shoes!

481
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,262
The murderer narrowed the
ictim:s scope with this desk.

484
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,832
and made him determine who
he was only by looking at his shoes!

486
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,033
And made him determine who
he was only*by looking at his shoes!

488
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,803
So. the murderer wore white shoes

489
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:22,573
to make him leave a fake dying message
about the murderer...

491
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:27,979
That's why tho video camera was
set up in the victim's blindespot!

493
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,482
The killer was watching
the president on the monitor

495
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,885
To make sure that the president
wrote the desired dying message,

497
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,553
And then he killed the victim!

498
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,356
But...Who did it anyway?

499
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,791
Hey. 06k .

Wake up, people! We got something

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,464
No one else, could do it!

566
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,433
Good job...

567
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,103
When the president
came back to the office.

569
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,973
You attacked him from behind
with a golf club.

571
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,343
Wearing Mr Iwatomi's white shoes and
setting up the video camera

573
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:10,515
you made sure that the president left behind
the fake messac of about the murderer

575
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,886
You probably were relieved after
killing the president.

577
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,722
And leaned against the wall.

578
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,692
That's when jou got the bloodstain
on the calendar...

580
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,496
You'.didn't notice at until the next day
That's why you didn't dump it right away.

582
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:30,501
In fact, it's easy to steal the white shoes
from Mr. Iwatomirs house...

584
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:34,137
People came and drunk
at 'Mr... Iwatomi's [house so often.

587
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,274
You had a lot of chance to steal them.

588
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,110
But the height of his shoulders
IS not enough evidence

590
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,479
to accuse him for the murder.

591
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,348
Actually...the evidence are those shoes!

592
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,451
You were wearing Mr. lwatomi's shoes
until the president left the message.

594
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:50,121
It's quite a long while...

595
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:52,323
The smell of your feet are
definitely on them!

597
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,927
The police dog will sense
your smell right away. right?

599
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:59,329
I guess you had a decent reason
AIR)
or wearing» 00.86 s mes

602
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,516

until they smelled of your toot.

604
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:05,703
You can tell us about WW ifryou want...

605
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,341
I wanted to Kill the president
yy TAMIAGg TWA OME up or WC mur er,.

608
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,644
I wanted him out of the toy production...

609
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,246
That's all.

610
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,098
WwW. why me?

611
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,400
I don't think
I ever mistreated you or anything...

613
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,935
It's not me that you mistreated me

614
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:23,387
It's the children

615
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,390
The children who are going to be
playing with the toy

617
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,293
that you and the president were
trying to sell.

619
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,095
I...don't get it

620
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,232
Here. look at this building block

621
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,067
See. we cut the pointy corners for safety.

622
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:41,539
But to cut down the cost,
they told us not to do it

624
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,075
That includes not only the blocks
but the other to. s too...

626
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,028
They: certainly] look more appealing and
could be more profitable.

628
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:49,230
But are dangerous for children.

629
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,232
I disagreed with the idea,
but we were gonna be fired

631
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,017
if we did not follow their. plan...

632
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:55,620
But you didn't have: to kill him.

633
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,788
This company was bleeding financially...

634
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,557
Bleeding financially?

635
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,495
Al...Guess what President Tsujiya sali

636
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:11,402
Iwatomi! You want money'? I got tons of it
I'm not lying. look at the safe!

638
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,435
What!?

639
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:13,504
He had money?

640
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:17,575
Yes...l have no idéa what
and how he did it though.

642
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:24,548
Doesn't matter. VI just didn't wanna see
the poorly-made toys and deceive kids...

690
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,361

What?

693
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:07,651
My mom got me a novel this morning.
The title gave me the idea of that trick.
