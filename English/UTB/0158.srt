1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:03,169
Inspiration flashes.
Piercing through to the truth.

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,604
Once he gets going. nothing can stop him

4
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,639
The stage for today's case is
the Loop Line.

6
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,674
There is no end of the line for
either the train or the case

8
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,376
The one & onl truth is brought
into the light.

10
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,278
He looks like a child but he's got the
brains of an adult.

12
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,014
His name is... Detective Conan.

13
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:55,881
THE LOOP LINE OF SILENCE

14
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,551
2nd Street station

15
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,428
We missed the train, didn't we...

16
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,296
Uh huh...

17
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,497
Hey...

18
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,933
Wait for goodness sake...

19
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,936
Good 'grief.

20
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,372
The ole guy's=aslostycause...g \

21
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:24,043
We just finished a job, at least let
me have a beer

23
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,680
Oh big deal the job was delivering
some papers the client forgot,

25
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:30,182
that's all

26
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,785
on top of that, since
it's Sunday, n one was in the office

28
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,623
ahh... that hits the spot, delicious!

29
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:41,193
The train sure is empty,
isn't it Conan

31
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,194
h huh...

32
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,430
Probably because it's a Sunday night.

33
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:48,801
This IS the business district.
'Masuretit's usualydbusy-on-workdays

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,638
hew... boy today sure wore me out...

37
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,009
Sorry, it's all my fault...

38
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,348
You really are a klutz. Kiyomi who started
a year before you was a fast learner.

40
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,053
By the way, Kiyomi sure rushed home, I
wonder what she had to do...
Seiji Kurata (26)

44
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:10,623
She probably had a date. After all,
Sunday's a day off.
Sizuka Kawai (24)

47
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:15,761
And if it weren't for someone I know, we
wouldn't have had to work today either...

49
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,531
I'm really sorry I promise to make
It up to you soon...
Yukiko-Mori (20)

52
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,834
That's what you always say...

53
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:27,073
Now now. don't be so hard on her.
Yukiko didn't do it on purpose

55
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,309
There you go again.
Spoiling the newcomer...

57
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,079
that's why I always look
Iike the meanfone...

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
You know that not true...

60
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,183
OK, calm down you two...

61
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:37,983
Huh: &«

62
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,622
The train will be pulling into track #2
momentarily,

64
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,491
please wait behind the yellow line

65
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,827
Oh... I'm going to go buy some juice

66
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,463
Come back . the train's coming

67
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,833
Don't worry. Get on without me

68
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:54,934
Good. grief...

69
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,980
Conan, come on Hurry.

70
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:08,781
Alright.

71
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,661
I wonder if Yukiko got on OK

72
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,965
That girl's so irresponsible sometimes

73
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,901
1 Let's go take a look

74
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,140
Pretend we don't know him

75
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,382
What're you doing Yukiko

76
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:48,387
Oh Seiji, I made it just in time.
I spilled some.

78
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,254
Clumsy...

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,561
You know Yukiko...

80
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,263
Isn't that? Kiyomi?!

81
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,499
IL 10...

82
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,636
She left hours ago, what's she doing here...

83
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,372
She's fast asleep.

84
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,009
You mean she's been sitting here and
rode the train for a whole lap?

86
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,378
She must've been exhausted...

87
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:17,216
Hey Kiyomi, wake up! Kiyomi!

88
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:18,417
Hey!

89
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,128
Huh?
What was that?

91
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,302
Excuse me...

92
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:41,974
There's no pulse she's dead.

93
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,878
Excuse me, are you her friends?

94
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,247
Yes, we're...

95
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,715
Who are you?

96
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,383
Who? me?

97
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:54,353
I am Kogoro Mouri, private investigator.

98
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,723
You mean Kogoro Mouri... the famous...

99
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,326
That's right, in the flesh...

100
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,160
Wow!

101
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,764
It looks like something pricked her earlobe

102
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:10,502
And her ear's a little black, .like
it's been pressed back...

104
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,838
Excuse me, sir, her ears...

105
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,507
You keep quiet!

106
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:21,747
The color of the ears... it looks
Iike a reaction to pois n

108
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,617
This may be a murder

109
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,751
A murder 7!

110
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,121
Ran, get the conductor and
call the police too!

113
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,560
What is this mark?

114
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,629
Everyone, please stand back.

115
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,501
I don't want anyone in here until the police
arrive! That means you too...

117
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,405
Kiyomi...

118
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,507
Please don't touch the body.

119
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,575
Oh I'm sorry

120
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,314
Inspector Megure...

121
00:06:56,315 --> 00:07:00,185
I took down the names and addresses of
all the passengers we let off

123
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:04,490
The estimated time of death is
approximately 6:30 PM

125
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,225
Yes, I see

126
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,396
The body was discovered past 7:30 PM.

127
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,364
It takes 1 hour and10 minutes for this
wa + scovered past 7:30 P

129
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,466
It takes 1 hour and10 minutes for this
Ioop line to complete 1 lap so...

131
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,937
So I guess there's no mistake, she
died in the train...

133
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:23,475
Which means the victim died shortly
after boarding the train.

135
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,479
The train completed 1 lap and
came back to this station...

137
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,149
MM... and the cause of deal

138
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,384
It appears she was pricked on the
earlobe with a pin

140
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,620
Iike object coated with a fast acting poison.

141
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,857
There are no other wounds or
signs of a struggle.

143
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,962
This is the victim's shoulder bag...

144
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,267
What are you doing...

145
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:49,835
Sorry...

146
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:54,707
Uh, sir. Wasn't that left open?

147
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,809
Oh just be quiet...

148
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,111
Huh? Just a second

149
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,512
what you're saying is,

150
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:04,616
there's a possibility the killer took some
thing out of victim's bag

152
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:09,088
Inspector, her wallet's here. Nothing
seems to have been taken out

154
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:14,760
we'll let her 3 friends confirm the
contents... they may notice something.

156
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:15,794
Hmm.

157
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:19,498
Detective Takagi
there's more over there.

159
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,433
Eh... you're right.

160
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,168
Thanks, Conan.

161
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:29,641
I'd like you to confirm these items
where's your other friend?

163
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,346
It seems the shock of it is
hitting her only now...

165
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,880
I don't blame her.

166
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:39,084
I'll let you two take care of the
indentification here.

169
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,520
Conan!

170
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,922
Come on, let's wait over there.

172
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,457
Neo 0

173
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,533
How are you feeling?

174
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,301
I'm fine, thank you.

175
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:00,739
I don't remember what Kiyomi
always carried with her.

177
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,342
But Seiji might know.

178
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,845
He:d been asking her for a date for the
Iongest time and he gave her a lot of presents

180
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,947
Presents?

181
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,850
Were you dating the victim?

182
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,319
No, she kept turning me down.

183
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,957
I see, that means you had a good
motive, revenge.

185
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:23,395
I'd never...! Shizuka, how could
you say such a thing?!

187
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,997
Now, now...

188
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,567
Usually we get along very well...

189
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,601
But becausegof what happened today...

190
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:42,514
So, after work, you all went for dinner but
Kiyomi alone left for home.

192
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,316
Yes, that's right.

193
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,385
Do you usually wor {on Sundays?

194
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:52,858
Our job is advertising design. But
I made a mistake yesterday

196
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,461
so we had to give up our Sunday to finish up.

197
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,698
And when's theilast time you saw hey?

198
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,502
It was at the 2nd Street station.
We all walked her tofthe station...

200
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:06,638
How did she seem at that time?

201
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,642
We parted at the ticket gate
but she was her usual self.

203
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,980
And that was around 6:30PM?

204
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:21,420
And the three of you were together
until discovering the body, correct?

206
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,120
Yes...

207
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:26,425
Did Kiyomi have any enemies?

208
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:32,297
Seiji, you just told us she kept turning you
down you are the most likely...

210
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,101
You've got to be kidding.
I'm not the only one...

212
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:40,138
Yukiko, you hated her for stealing your
boyfriend, didn't you?!

214
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,374
No, I didn't...

215
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,378
And Shizuka, didn't you tell me she
stole your design?!

217
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,646
What're you trying to say?

218
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,049
I see, so all of you had motives.

219
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,555
Don't be hasty, Mouri. The estimated time
of her death is somewhere around 6:30PM.

221
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:59,157
That's about the time we left her
at the station

223
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,159
es... right after you left

224
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,231
Were you three really together
the whole time?

226
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,967
Yes, we had dinner together.

227
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:13,205
It's a place we always go to so you
can verify it if you want

229
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:17,709
Since they all have alibis, I'm sure we can
exclude them from our list of suspects

231
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,779
I'm pretty sure it was a random
killing by a crazed person...

233
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,916
we have the names and addresses of the
passengers me let off

235
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:28,053
I just hope the killer's among them.

236
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:33,592
However, since her bag was found open, I'd
Iike to check through your possessions too.

238
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:37,729
Why did the killer kill her in the train?

239
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,766
And why stab her in the
ears of all places

241
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,336
and her ears were laid flat as if they
had been pressed...

243
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:48,606
it's too strange to be a random killing.

244
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:55,113
So you're saying you know
no reason for anyone hating her...

246
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,956
An MD player and a headphone
with a bent arm...

248
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,795
Every disc has.a label on it...

249
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,138
Index labels for the MD

250
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,808
What's this?

251
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,944
Strange...

252
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,781
None of them have a front label...

253
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,588
This color...

254
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,690
That's it!

255
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:45,197
Something was bothering me.
Now I know what it was

257
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,034
Yes, it would be possible to kill Kiyomi

258
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:53,372
and have an alibi if one were
to use that method...

260
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,108
There's no mistake,
that person's the killer!!

262
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:06,752
If my deduction is correct, that
person is the killer,

264
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,820
but I don't have enough proof...

265
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,990
Aren't you through searching
our things yet?

267
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,693
I'm sure they're almost done...

268
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,697
We have no reason to steal something
out of Kiyomi's bag

270
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,899
You people have a lot of nerve.

271
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,170
That's enough, Shizuka
They're just doing their job.

273
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,339
What's that...?

274
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:31,976
Hey!

275
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,045
Hey!

276
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:33,645
Oops!

277
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,048
What're you doing?

278
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,683
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:39,685
Conan, look what you did!

280
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,553
I'm sorry, Seij.

281
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,188
I'm really very sorry

282
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,226
No problem. I perspire a lot
so.l always carry an extra shirt.

284
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:52,831
Inspector. Would it be alright if I
got a shirt from my things?

286
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,968
I guess it's OK.
Hey! Takagi!

288
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:57,369
BB g- =

289
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,005
That was very naughty.
You have to behave!

291
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,774
I'm going to apologize to him.

292
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:09,414
Excuse me, Kiyomi and the three of you
were good friends, weren't you?

294
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:15,153
Sure, I got a little excited back there
and made it sound like we all hated her

296
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:19,591
but we weren't really on bad terms,
we were all good friends...

298
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,926
Of course, you were.

299
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,730
Take today for example, Yukiko dropped
Kiyomi's MD player

301
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,565
and it broke but that Kiyomi,

302
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:30,769
she didn't even get mad.
She forgave Yukiko.

304
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,841
Kiyomi and Yukiko were especially close,

305
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,977
I thought they'd fight after
she stole Yukiko's boyfriend but

307
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,247
you're too young to understand

308
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:47,152
Didn't Kiyomi get on at the same
Second Street station like us?

310
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:48,253
That's right

311
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:52,524
But she was sitting in the 2nd car,
wasn't she?

313
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,727
People usually get on the car
closest to the ticket gate.

315
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,831
It seems strange to deliberately walk to
another car furthur away

317
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,335
Not really, when the train stops at
Kiyomi's stop. the ticket gate is

319
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,470
right in front if you're in the 2nd car.

320
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,475
That's why whenever we take the same
train, we have to walk to the 2nd car.

322
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:17,315
Which means they knew she'd be
in the 2nd car...

324
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,353
I've got it. I'veesolved everything.

325
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:27,459
Inspector We're done looking through
all their possessions.

327
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,598
I apologize for the long wait.
You,may all leave now.

329
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:40,205
If something cames up, I'd appreciate it
if you'd give us your cooperation

331
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:52,083
We can't have you leave just yet.

332
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,787
What's the matter, Mourn...
Aha, that pose!

334
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,792
This was no random killing.
The killer is one of you three!

336
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,762
One of us?

337
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:07,098
And the murder weapon is
right there among your things.

339
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,801
But Mourn...

340
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,070
We all have alibis, remember?

341
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,005
We were having dinner!

342
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:18,443
But it was still possible to kill her

343
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:24,583
Firstly, the killer knew Kiyomi would leave
early so while seeing her off at the station,

345
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,053
the killer checked the schedule
of the train she would take,

347
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:32,190
and calculated how long it would take for it
to return carrying}Kiyomi's body,

349
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,260
After that, all the killer had to do
was go to dinner,

351
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:39,297
creating an alibi then retrieve the murder
weapon from the body when it returned...

353
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,200
Weapon? What kind of weapon?

354
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:49,307
Don't you know? Something that would
appear natural when put onto the ears.

356
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,515
Yes, I see! If you planted a poisoned
needle in the headphone.

358
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:03,021
Right, which means, the killer is
Yukiko Morn!

360
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,890
Yes you!!

361
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:12,063
You broke Kiyomi'ssMD player
and lent her yours

363
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,531
with the poisoned needle in it!

364
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:17,302
And pretending to buy some juice,

365
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,506
you boarded the front car
and retrieved the weapon

367
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:28,012
You knew Kiyomi always
sat in the 2nd car from the front...

369
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:34,819
it doesn't take long to get the weapon
since you know where she'd be

371
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,522
But the cord was caught on her shoulder.

372
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:42,594
You pulled on it too hard and the
headphone got bent.

374
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:46,464
Yes, I see, it certainly is bent.

375
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:50,969
The mark from the cord was
found on her arm.

377
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:57,976
And her ears were laid back against her
head proving she had a headphone on...

379
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:02,981
I just went to bu, some juice.
I didn't do what you just said.

381
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:06,551
Your friend's body was in front of you,
you should have been in shock,

383
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,588
but for some reason, you fixed
the collar on her dress

385
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:16,861
I'm sure it was because when the cord
got caught, it'made the collar stand...

387
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:23,168
Actually you intended to retrieve
the weapon. .and leave the body

389
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:28,573
But your friends came looking for
you from the other car

391
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:34,779
So you had to pretend you discovered the
body with the other two and play out your role

393
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,584
So the victim pricked her own
ears with the poisoned needle.

395
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,921
But why kill her in the train of all places?

396
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:47,791
There aren't too many
passengers on this line on Sundays...

398
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,929
Very few people get into the 2nd car

399
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,400
It's the perfect place when you have to
retrieve the weapon after securing an alibi

401
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,269
I:'see...

402
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,207
On top of that, an unspecified number of
people go in and out

404
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,843
so it's easier to make it appear
a random killing.

406
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:08,279
All she-had to do was-make
a mistake at work

408
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,250
so they'd all have to go in on a Sunday.

409
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,220
Proof, where's the proof?

410
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:19,190
I don't see anything that looks
Iike a needle

412
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:23,828
I believe she used that handkerchief
to pull it out

414
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,998
there was a piece of sponge stuck on it...

415
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:32,737
I was sitting here all the time.
Right here with all of you.

417
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,940
When your things were being checked,

418
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,044
you said you didn't feel well
and went off alone.

420
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,949
You mean she had to be alone so she
could take the needle out...

422
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,652
May I see your handkerchief?

423
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,787
Alright...

424
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,189
It's no use now, Inspector.

425
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,428
It's a tiny needle. She's probably
already thrown it away somewhere.

427
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,533
Mouri, are you telling me this is all
supposition and you have no proof?

429
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,702
The proof is in that MD player.

430
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,770
What?

431
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,441
If you mean fingerprints, she was a friend.
It's only 'natural-for hers to be on it.

433
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,242
I didn't lend it to her today!!

434
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,814
Then will you take the disc out of it?

435
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,717
What's wrong?

436
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:26,124
Yukiko, thank you«by Kiyomi

437
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:33,098
You: didn't lend:it«to.her...
you did say that, didn't you?

439
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:41,039
If you didn't lend it to her, how was
she able to write a message dated today...

441
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,877
and with the ballpoint pen we found
among her things!

443
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,412
You're right.

444
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:52,450
The color of these letters matches the
color of the pen-found in her bag!

446
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:58,022
That's right, Kiyomi left you a message

447
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:03,628
She never dreamed
you were going to kill her.

449
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:15,874
Kiyomi... I just couldn't forgive you.
You stole my boyfriend

451
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:22,213
Today is his birthday,
I knew she would rush home...

453
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,617
So that's why you chose
today to kill her...

455
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,985
Yes...

Takagi did you find out how
she got the poison?

499
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:19,697
Yes, it's a fast acting alkaloid poison
they use on darts in South America.

501
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:23,233
She confessed that she bought some
when she wasyabroad a few days ago.

503
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,304
She coated a tiny needle with it.

504
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,906
Poison for darts...

505
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,876
We took so long identifying the poison,

506
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:37,415
Mouri, if you hadn't figured things out
this case might have gone solved.

508

Vs AL

510
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,654
poison for darts... yes

511
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:46,156
well, I had a feeling that's what it was

512
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:50,428
Really, so you figured that out too.
Mouri you're great!

514
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,996
Give me a break,

515
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:57,001
ou haven't even fi ured out I've been
knocking you out!

517
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:01,239
What?! A curse?!

518
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,673
Oh no!

519
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,746

520
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,749
