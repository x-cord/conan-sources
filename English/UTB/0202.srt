1
00:00:01,702 --> 00:00:05,004
Just as flowing water has no form,
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,939
deductions take all shapes and styles
In each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,641
A quiet village is in an uproar.

6
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,476
Like the case,
the: bus is also out-of-control.

8
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,044
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,813
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,581
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,150
Ran, Mr Mouri and I are being

14
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,619
rocked in a
nostalgic bonnet bus on our way

16
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,555
to Kagekuwa Village
to do some hiking.

18
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,093
But a murder takes place on
the bus we re on

20
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,563
The victim is

21
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,598
Deputy Mayor Okumura,
who is the leader of the group against

23
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,867
using the bonnet bus to promote
tourism because it is a vital means

25
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,369
of transportation for the villagers.

26
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,172
The police take Mr Yabe,
who is for promoting tourism,

28
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,209
Into custody and
things in the village begin to heat up.

30
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:26,879
To complicate matters,

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,448
a bus accident that happened
7 years ago is involved in some way.

33
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,551
While that murder remains unsolved,

34
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,286
Mayor Funaki,
who is also for tourism promotion,

36
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,621
is attacked on
the grounds of the shrine

38
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,023
and Ran IS also in danger.

39
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:47,767
==. 4&3;
THE 10th PASSENGER
PART II

42
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,071
Ran!

43
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:52,972
Conan?!

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,141
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

45
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,611
No, I'm fine, I just got ran into...

46
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,779
Never mind me,

47
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,647
I think there's somebody lying over there

48
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,886
Mayor Funaki!

49
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,721
Stabbed once in the chest!

50
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,222
Death was almost instantaneous!

51
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,825
Ran, did you see the killer?

52
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,528
I don't know if it was the Killer,

53
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,763
but I did see who rammed into...

54
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,698
What did the killer look like...?!

55
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,467
Any outstanding features?
How old, how tall?

57
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,869
Well, uh actually...

58
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,009
It was Mr. Yabe...
the leader of the Youth League

60
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:30,943
What?!

61
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,644
I don't believe it...!

62
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,317
What?! Mr Yabe killed the Mayor?!

63
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,753
No, I ss too early to tell...

64
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,154
Take me to his home!

00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:42,888

Listen...!

78
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:54,467
Ran could have ended up like the Mayor!

79
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,135
Now take me to his home right now!!

80
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,471
Yes. okay...

81
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,807
Yabe Come out here!

82
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:02,508
Don't play games

83
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,276
Mr. Mouri! We don't have a warrant

84
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,179
Yabe! Come on on!!

85
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,186
Damn! He got away,

86
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,823
The evening paper's
still in the mail slot...

88
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,492
I don't think he came back here

89
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,696
That means he called
the Mayor out as soon as

91
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,731
he was released and killed him!

92
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,334
And now he's on the run...

93
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,503
he planned this...

94
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,104
Mr. Mourn!

95
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,973
Listen! Have road blocks set up!

96
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:34,773
Yes sir!

97
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:41,881
Huh?

98
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,749
A savings pass book...

99
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,856
There's 200,000 yen being deposited
every monthistarting 2 years ago...

101
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,960
But why is he using a bank

102
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,296
tha ¢s not even in the village...

103
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,598
wonder if this money's...

104
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:08,841
The next day, the search for Mr. Yabe
was about to start...

106
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,479
Well Mr. Private Detective, it looks like
we're after prey, huh

108
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,280
Humph!

109
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,049
I don't want to work with you but

110
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,552
we can't let a dangerous man like him

111
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,953
remain on the loose
so I'll join in the hunt

113
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,923
The villagers are
also joining the search...

115
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,293
but the tension between the 2 factions
was reaching its peak...

117
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,197
Did the killer count on the villagers
to:cause acommotion...

119
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,633
or was he planning something else?

120
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,371
In the first place though, is the killer
really Mr Yabe...?

122
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,576
If these murders were premeditated,
he d have taken his pass book!

124
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,912
There are other things
I don't understand...

126
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,350
The look of fear on the inn keeper's face
when she dropped the food!

128
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,286
And the reason she was crying in front
of the memorial tower...

130
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,254
And why was Toko watching her...!

131
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,292
I'm pretty sure all of this has
something to do with

133
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,228
the bus accident 7 years ago...!

134
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,468
Damn,

135
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,605
the 1,000,000 yen the Mayor promised
to pay me is poof gone .!

137
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,608
Yabe, you rat, I'm gonna catch you,
you can bet on it!!

139
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:18,777
Hello...

140
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,946
Why, Shinichi!

141
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,550
It seems you're involved in
a big case there

143
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,387
Yes, and I need you to look through
some articles from 7 years ago!

145
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,455
Sure,

146
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,359
I can access the newspaper company's
homepage for that information...

148
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,369
There he is! Over here!

149
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,939
Wait! You re not getting away!

150
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,008
I want my money!!

151
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,478
Let's see...
7 years' ago, 7 years ago...

153
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,847
Aha...this is it!

154
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:03,588
Bus accident! 2 are killed!
8 people are injured

156
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,558
Does it list the names of the deceased?

157
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,362
Yes, it's a local paper so
they've listed all the names'

159
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,997
First, the ones with minor injuries...

160
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,766
Arggh!!

161
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,371
I've got you Yabe...!

162
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,739
Don't fight it!

163
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:21,607
It wasn't me! I didn't do anything!!

164
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,710
It wasn't me! I didn't do anything!!
Takuro Yabe (32)

166
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,077
It wasn't me! I didn't do anything!!

167
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,913
You ran, that proves you're guilty!!

168
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:30,749
Takuro Yabe, you're under arrest
for suspicion of murder!

170
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,185
Wh, what did you say...?!

171
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,387
Deputy Mayor Okumura's name
wasn't on it?

173
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,090
No, I don't see that name on the list...

174
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,193
Then, maybe,
Deputy Mayor Okumura was Killed...

176
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,530
Here re the names of
the 2 men who were Killed...

178
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,766
Yoichi Tezuka, 28 years old and...

179
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,470
Kohei Moritsugu, 55 years old!

180
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,808
Doctor! I need you to locate the
relatives of those 2 men right away!

182
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,010
No! You're wrong!!

183
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,246
When I got to the shrine,
I heard the Mayor scream

185
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,848
so I ran over to see what happened,

186
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,516
that's when your daughter came...!

187
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,686
I knew that if I stayed there,
everyone would think I did it,

189
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,221
I got scared, and
when I tried to get away,

191
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,823
I bumped into your daughter

192
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,358
Don't lie!

193
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,227
Then tell us why you went there
in the first place!

195
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,796
The Mayor called me and
told me to meet him there

197
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,665
He called you?

198
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,768
Why would he want to meet you
at such an isolated place?

200
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,205
Well uh . it's...

201
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,240
Listen carefully...

202
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,710
you don't tell us anything and yet
you want us to believe you,

204
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,178
don't you think
that's asking a little too much?

206
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,114
Explain this.

207
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,183
It's a savings passbook we found
at your place...

209
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,988
200,000 yen is being deposited every
month for the past 2 years!

211
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,425
And you're using not the post office
savings or the Farmer's union...

213
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,127
you're using a bank that's not
In this village...

215
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,595
which means...

216
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,965
it's money you don't want anyone
in the village to know about, right...?

218
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,902
I was leaking information

219
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,036
Information...?

220
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,873
Were you a spy?
For the opposition?

223
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:01,974
IUD!

224
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,076
Deputy Mayor,
the man who died in the bus

226
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,444
was the leader of the opposition,

227
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,180
he was paying me
and I've been telling him

229
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,216
what Mayor Funaki
was planning and his schedule...

231
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,888
But why was it so important that
Mr Okumura went to so much trouble...?

233
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,924
If there was a new project in the works,

234
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:23,095
then the village funds would be paid
to companies Mr. Funaki favored

236
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,164
and naturally, the companies
the Deputy Mayor

238
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:29,768
and people in the opposing faction
were connected with would be excluded,

240
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,671
that's why they had to crush
the plans for the project before it started

242
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:34,706
The Mayor found out about it

243
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,543
and told you to meet
him at the shrine, is that right?

245
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:38,577
ICC...

246
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,714
It seems when I was being
questioned the first time,

248
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,517
he went into my home
and found the passbook

250
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:51,255
So that means you killed Mr Okumura
so that you wouldn't be caught

252
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:54,326
and then you killed Mr Funaki
because you were!

254
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,963
No, that's not it!! You're wrong!!
I didn't do it!!

256
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:02,000
Kinu Komai (42)

257
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,242
Ma'am, would you mind
explaining things to me?

259
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:11,009
Eh...?!

260
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,612
What if these murders
that are supposed to look like

262
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,416
it has to do with the fight between
the 2 opposing factions in the village,

264
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,518
Is really connected
to the bus accident 7 years ago?

266
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,855
The bus accident 7 years ago...?!
Th, that's impossible....!

268
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,591
If that's the case,
then Mr. Yabe's.innocent!

270
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,561
Because, on that day 7 years ago,
he was on that bus!

272
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,864
And Ms. Koma...

273
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:32,931
so were you!

274
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,335
What in the world happened ?

275
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,971
On that bus...?

277
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,675
All clear

278
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,751
Toko Natsume (25)

280
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,687
Mamoru Kajita (35)
LB JA {ES

282
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,529
That's the truth behind
that accident 7 years ago

284
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,365
I knew it...!

285
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,502
That's why Mayor Funaki was so afraid
the truth would come out,

287
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,906
he offered to pay Kogoro all that money
so he could control the situation!!

289
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:18,577
Hello, oh, Doctor...

290
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,847
I've located the relatives of the
2 bus accident victims!

292
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,782
It was on a follow-up article!

293
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,817
Yes...yes...

294
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,952
What was that?!

295
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:28,587
That person's...

296
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,222
I understand! Thank you!!

297
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,024
Ms. Koma!

298
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,159
If I want to take the bus
at the same time of the accident,

300
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,993
what time does it leave the station?

301
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,629
H...?1 If it's that bus, it's left already...

302
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,031
Oh no!!!

303
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,786
Ms. Komai, I'm counting, on you!
You've got to catch up with that bus!

305
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,289
I don't want that person
to kill anymore people!

307
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,558
Oh please, let us make it in time!!

308
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,368
Th. this cant be happening!!! .
The 'brakes-don't'work!!

310
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,836
Are you serious?!

311
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:18,971
1. I don't believe It!

312
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:22,207
That's ridiculous!
It's all downhill from here!!

314
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:34,920
Eh?!

315
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,322
Mr Yabe killed them?

316
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,026
Yeah, he's going to be transferred
to the main precinct this afternoon.

318
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,629
Does that mean your job's finished?

319
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,263
It sure Is.

320
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,866
Not only did I lose out on the money,

321
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,868
I had to work for no pay on top of that.

322
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,103
Good grief,

323
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,838
what a hiking trip this turned out to be!

324
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,272
Yes...

325
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:54,740
Oh my.

326
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,808
I just realized,
where did Conan go?

328
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,914
I see it! There it is!

329
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,591
Mr. Kajita, do something!! Engine brake!

330
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm already doing that!

331
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,329
The wire's cut from the emergency brake!

332
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,534
The bus' brakes aren't working!!

333
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,071
Ms. Komai,
drive this car alongside the bus!!

335
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,706
Eh?! What're you going to do?

336
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,374
I'm going to get on the bus!

337
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,475
Don't do it, son!!

338
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,678
It's too dangerous! Don t do it!

339
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,988
Th, this is just like what
happened 7 years ago...

342
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,725
Th, that's right,
even the passengers are the same 4

344
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,161
That's impossible...
this is just coincidence, isn't it?

346
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,529
No! This is no coincidence!

347
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,099
Conan! When did you get on?

348
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,234
A certain person told me the story...!

349
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,803
7 years ago,

350
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,504
all of you were on this ven bus!

351
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,775
Even Mayor Funaki who was killed

352
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:07,446
and Mr. Yabe, who is suspected of
killing him, were on board...

354
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,613
a total of 10 passengers!

355
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,949
You all remember what happened,

356
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,384
don't you?

357
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:20,459
Ms. Komai, the proprietress: of
Komai Inn was the bus guide then...

359
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,563
Aw come on!
Come and drink with us!

361
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,298
Aw come on!
Come and drink with us!
Yoichi Tezuka (29)
Kinu Komai (35)

365
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:26,932
Yoichi Tezuka (29)
Kinu Komai (35)

367
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,900
Somebody help me!
Yoichi Tezuka (29)
Kinu Komai (35)

370
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,169
Don't be so unfriendly!

371
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,338
Somebody stop him!

372
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,473
Help!

373
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,377
You! Stop that immediately!
She doesn't want to drink with you!

375
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,113
What'd you say?

376
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,316
I'm just trying to have some fun,

377
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,817
don't interrupt, shoo!

378
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,185
Arggh?!

379
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,529
The 2 people that died
in that accident were.

381
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,998
The man who was bothering Ms. Komai

382
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,201
and the man who tried to save her.

383
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,639
And miraculously,
the 8 villagers survived...

385
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,411
In the end, you all kept your silence!

386
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,749
And you made it appear the accident
was caused by the 2 men fighting....!

388
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,086
You people caused the
death of 1 brave man

390
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,854
and you hid your guilt
deep in your hearts...

392
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,825
After everything I've said,
you should have come to realize...

394
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,694
the 2 murders were committed by

395
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,063
a member of that brave man's family...

396
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,399
one of Mr. Moritsugu's children

397
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:39,004
the motive is revenge!
Isn't that right, Toko!!

399
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,175
Natsume is your mother's
maiden name, isn't it...

401
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,677
Your real name is Toko Moritsugu...!

402
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,479
Eh'! Toko's his...?

403
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,381
She s his daughter!!

404
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:56,021
What did you say?!
The killer is on the bus?

406
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,557
And who is it?

407
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:03,862
I don't know!But the-busyy
MB has no brakes-and it's.out of control!

409
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,765
Hey! Call the main precinct!

410
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:07,232
Yes sir!

411
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,769
Uh...and that little boy of yours
is also on the bus

413
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,471
Eh?! How did Conan get on the bus...?

414
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,779
Toko wantedfto know
how her father died

416
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,281
sosshe moved here
anddbegan investigating

418
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,683
then she found out the truth!

419
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,253
She probably heard it
from Mr. Kajita who

421
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,288
worked with her
and befriended her...

423
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:34,793
Ironically

424
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,728
one of the men she wanted
to take revenge on,

426
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,964
Mr. Yabe, was arrested
because he and the victim

428
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,333
were on opposing factions
in the village dispute...

430
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,337
Toko knew all of you would be
on this-bus today

432
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,206
going shopping
and running errands,

434
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,309
and meddled with the brakes
so you'd all be killed!

436
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,312
At the same spot 7 years ago...!

437
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,417
Isn't that right... Toko?

438
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,821
Sheesh, I, I don't believe it

439
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,625
I don't know what you're talking about...

440
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,493
No use pretending...

441
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,363
Why are you so calm then...?

442
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,399
Because you're about
to commit suicide, aren't you,

444
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,368
you're going to die along
with everyone else!

446
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,116
Good grief!
What a bothersome child!!! «

448
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,251
Get off of this bus Conan!

449
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,654
The bus will slow down
on the next curve,

451
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,589
if you're careful, you'll just
get a few bruises!!

455
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,524
So are you admitting I'm right?

458
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,293
You're behind all of this...!

459
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,361
Yes! I confess!

460
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,365
I killed both Deputy Mayor Okumura
and Mayor Funaki...!

462
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:54,139
When the bus was crowded, I put
the poison in Deputy Mayor's drink...!

464
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,742
I waited in the dark and stabbed
the Mayor on the shrine grounds...!

466
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,576
Ugh!

467
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:00,845
That's right!

468
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,781
I came here to get revenge

469
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:05,583
on the people who were on
this bus 7 years ago!

471
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,020
My father was a very righteous man!

472
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,259
He only did what was natural, when he
saw someone in trouble, he went to help!

474
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,361
But that day...

475
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,964
If even.one of you had backed him up.!!

476
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,737
Hurry! Conan, you've got to jump now

478
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,372
It's too late...

481
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,406
even if you let me go,

482
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:33,578
it still won't change the fact that
you killed the wrong person!

484
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,646
Eh...?

485
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:41,353
Deputy Mayor Okumura, théifirstivictim,
wasn't on this bus 7 years ago!

487
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:44,489
Wh, what did you say?! That can't be!

488
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,126
As the busfguide,
you've seen him everyday

490
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,995
so you know what he always says...

491
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,798
This has been my seat for 40 years!!

492
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,534
When someone. has continued to say that

493
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,437
and if you were to*askihim
about that incident 7 years.ago...

495
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,439
You did ask him about it,
didn't you...?

497
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,908
Of course, I asked him personally!!

498
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,882
7 years ago. .? No mistake,
I was sitting right here in my own seat!!

500
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,418
He was very clear about it!!

501
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,253
But on that day,

502
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,655
Deput. 'Mayor Okumura had-<afcold
and his fever was very high

504
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,823
so he was in bed!

505
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,860
His name:wasn't'in'the newspaper either!

506
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,229
You're lying...

507
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,664
I read the newspaper myself...

508
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,602
He was probably so convincing, you just
thought you saw his name listed

510
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,670
But, then...

511
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,172
who was the 10th passenger...?

512
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,776
That person died 2 years ago
from an illness...

514
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,411
So you see,

515
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:43,647
Deputy Mayor Okumura had
nothing to do with your father's death!

517
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,487
Th, that can't be...

518
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,824
You forgave Ms. Komai, didn't you?

520
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,161
she.

521
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,068
Oh...forgive me...

522
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,604
When I saw her like that...

523
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,774
just couldn't bring myselfito kill her...

524
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,710
She's not the only one,

525
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,447
I believe all the people
who were on that bus that day

527
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,483
have been carrying
a heavy burden in their hearts

529
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,089
Please forgive us, Toko!

530
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,291
We were cowards...!

531
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,495
Please accept our apologies!!

532
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,266
Oh...

533
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,804
If we crash at the same place

534
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,440
then maybe Toko:s; father will
forgive us and rest in peace...

536
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:44,541
No!!

537
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,578
Conan has nothing to do with this!

538
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,445
Do something!!

539
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,180
There's nothing I can do...

540
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,714
I may be able to make
the next curve but

542
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:52,684
there's no way I can make
the curve at the scene of the accident...

544
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,787
Don't give up!

545
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,387
There's bound to be
a way to stop this bus!

547
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,662
There s a ditch!
Get your tires into the ditch!!

549
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,163
Ugh!!

550
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,202
It's no use!
I can't keep the tires down!!

552
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,005
That's it! The suspenders
Doctor Agasa invented.

554
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,508
They're stretchable
and snap back to it's original length!

556
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,319
Oh no!

557
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,990
Rats! Maybe it won't hold a 10 ton bus!!

558
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,740
We've...stopped .

559
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,975
Phew...

560
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,517
Conan, who are you anyway...

561
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,120
I'm just a busy body private detective!

562
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,489
Thank you

563
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,591
my little private detective...

564
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,928
That's for making us worry!!

565
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,930

The case us solved,

609
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,627
and the bonnet bus continues to run

610
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,430
carrying it's passengers and
the memories they keep inside.

612
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,567
Slowly, into the greenery...!

613
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,173
Chizuru...

614
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,242
who were you arguing with?

615
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:05,743
It can't be!

616
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,079
Here goes!

618
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:12,850
Oh no!!!

619
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,622
I hate to say this, but a lot of
time has passed since the victim died

621
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,160
No one has entered this room!
I'll testify to that!!
