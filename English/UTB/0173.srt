1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:04,036
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,905
and the breeze 1s invisible

3
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,573
deductions take all shapes-and styles
in each and every case to be solved

5
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,375
A very strange message

6
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,310
The trick is solved
and the killer is determined

8
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,845
He sees through the one and only truth

9
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,647
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

11
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,250
no case is left unsolved when Detective
Conan comes to the scene

13
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:58,384
Like always, keeping Sonoko company
in her search for men we all come to

15
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,187
the skating rink at Tropical Land

16
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:07,259
There, we meet 5 members of the Clay
shooting club and get acquainted

18
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,996
While we're all waiting for
the firework to go up

20
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,064
mSonoko's scream is heard
from the restroom

22
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,799
Kyaaah!

23
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,472
I runfover to find .

24
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,741
Waiting there...

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,546
the dead body of Chizu Itami,
who is shot to death in the chest...
#000000

30
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:27,847
the dead body of ChizuÃ©ltamp
who is shot to death in the chest...

33
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:28,347
Thexdead body of Chizu Itami,
who is shot to death in the chest...

35
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,483
Since the letter "SS" written in blood is

36
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,552
Ieft near the corpse, Pops deduces that

37
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,957
the "S" stands for Izumi Sano's last name
so that she is the killer. However...

39
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,091
I don't think so!!

40
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,460
Hmm?! Huh?

41
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,397
I think you can tell just by looking,

42
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:48,567
the victim has been shot in the chest
and has died on the spot

44
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,070
Therefore, it would've been impossible
for her

46
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,839
to write a message on the wall
after she was shot

48
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,177
Moreover, the letter WKIX" were
registered

50
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,313
In the cellular phone
of the victim

52
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,588
K.I.X...wait a sec...l remember this from
somewhere...

54
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:12,391
Dying Message Revives" Part ll

55
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,229
Dying Message Revives" Part ll

56
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:29,007
KIX... I'm sure I've seen it somewhere...

58
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,010
Officer!!

60
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,746
May I at least change shoes?

61
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,415
I came straight from the rink

62
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,552
Oh, if you let an officer escort you,
that be no problem

64
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:43,355
But, please make sure
you come right back

66
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,493
Hey, Officer Chiba,
will you please escort them?

68
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,662
Oh, yes sir!!

69
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,766
Don't cry, Yoriko...

70
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,837
Chihiro's been killed...

71
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,641
You know...Yoriko...

73
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,178
nm sure e oO cers wi wO In er.

74
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,986
Stupid!...

75
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,888
Sonoko?

76
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,524
That cellular that you have is

77
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,259
is the same as the one
the lady that was killed had!

79
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,998
Don't tell me that this kid is...

80
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,334
suspecting me?

81
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,069
What?!

82
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,673
No! I just want to have a look at your
cellular phone

84
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,741
Here

85
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:40,879
Come on, Conan...
Yiourtshouldn't be fooling around with it!

87
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,552
The sound of the fireworks you heard,
was it really the sound of fireworks?

89
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,320
Yes, of course!

90
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:52,825
It went "hyuuuuh" then,
I heard one big boom!

92
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,493
Huh?

93
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:59,231
Huh? Did you change your cellular,
Sonoko?

95
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,234
Es, well sort of...

96
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,103
Locker Room

97
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,040
I've more or less figured out the trick...

98
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:12,511
But...anybody could've committed the
murder if this trick were used...

100
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,514
In order to figure out who did it...

101
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,384
Pull yourself together

102
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,554
I just happened to remember
that incident...

104
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,891
Yoriko...

105
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,693
I envy you, Izumi

106
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:32,498
because you weren't at Clay shooting
when that accident happened

108
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:38,637
I was sick in bed on that day, remember?
I wish you wouldn't call that lucky

110
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:44,376
I'm quitting Clay shooting as of today.
I can't help feeling that there is a curse

112
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,146
Besides, I don't want to die because of
the gun accidentally going off,

114
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,814
Iike what happened to Narita

115
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,982
Huh?!

116
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:55,187
Enough of all the small talk,
Let's go back.

118
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,789
Yeah? .

119
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:03,596
I get it...so that's what it was...
That's why he wasialways left out!!

121
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,866
But, I've still got no proof

122
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,538
If couldn't possibly corner the killer with
that message alone...

124
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,439
Hmm?

125
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,781
Two black dots...

126
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,052
on't tell me that... :

127
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,455
What?!.

128
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,524
Conan?

129
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,593
Huh!

130
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,662
It can't be?!

131
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,999
Don't tell me... 7?!

132
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,003
I don't believe it?!

133
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,471
Hey...

134
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,475
There 1t 1st

135
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,615
This is it!!

136
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:01,153
I've found it!! I've found conclusive
evidence!!

138
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,358
With this I can corner the killer!!

139
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,230
A h...

140
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:15,367
Just what are you doing here...?

141
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,969
Ha, ha, ha...

142
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,370
Qmhg

143
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,740
I tell you! Stop using the scene of the
crime as a playground...

145
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,108
Inspector Megure!

146
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,109
Hmm?!

147
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,981
This coat, thought to be that of the killer
was found in the trash can

149
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,916
that is located between the skating rink
and the restroom

151
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:36,121
Okay, verify it with Sonoko who witnessed
the killer!

153
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,190
Yes, sir!! Okay!

154
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:43,462
Uh, everyone; wait!
Where are you all going?

156
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,732
We're going to return the skates...

157
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,601
You can question us after that, can't you?

158
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:54,473
We've all got alibis that we were watching
the fireworks at the time of the crime...

160
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:59,445
Yes...the alibis of everyone except Oda
who's not interested in fireworks...

162
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,514
I'm sure glad I watched the fireworks...

163
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:08,220
If I didn't watch it as usual,
I would've been suspected too.

165
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,688
Izumi...

166
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,091
It's true, isn't it!

167
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:16,562
Okay, first I'll put Pops to sleep with the
anesthesia, gun...

169
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,432
Let's not play games anymore...

170
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,033
huh?

171
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:27,039
Let's get things straight, since the answer
s already obvious...

173
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,241
IN... No, Pops...

174
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,778
Oh! Have you figured out who the killer is?

175
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:36,181
Yes...this time for sure

176
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,318
The one who waited for Chihiro
in the restroom

178
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:43,722
and killed her with the shotgun is...

179
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,693
Mr. Kunitomo Oda!

180
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,431
Yes, you!!

181
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,233
Uh?! No...

182
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,837
Hey! Wait a minute!

183
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,840
You ran into the wrong guy...

184
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:08,447
Leaving a dying message written in blood,
near the victim attempting to fool me

186
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:10,449
But, too bad!!

187
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:14,385
You were completely deceived,
weren't you?

189
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:18,056
That letter was written by you.

190
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,360
A person who was shot in the chest and
died on the spot

192
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,797
couldn't possibly have written it...

193
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:30,702
And, the comment that Ms. Izumi Sano
made just now, brought everything to light

195
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:37,476
That the killer had calculated on framing
Ms. Sano up as the killer

197
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,646
by committing the crime
when the fireworks go up

199
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,283
so that Ms. Sano, who usually does not
watch ends up without an alibi...

201
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:51,590
The letter "S" from her name was used
as well as her gun, for this reason!

203
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,461
However...she unfortunately decides to
watch the fireworks.

205
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:59,031
So, you end up being
the one without an alibi

207
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,433
Your scheme collapsed...

208
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,705
Oh no...
Ha-hi-fu-he-ho. #4

210
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,513
As a result, the killer lead us to believe

211
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,850
that Mr. Oda was the killer

212
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,520
and successfully was removed from
the hist of suspects.

214
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,223
This indeed was
what the killer was after.

216
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:27,793
Then, who on earth is the killer?!

217
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:33,065
The one who killed Chihiro Itami is,
Ieaving Mr. Oda aside

219
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,534
one of the members of
the Clay shooting club...

221
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,538
is you!!

222
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:47,946
The one who killed Chihiro Itami is,
Ieaving Mr. Oda aside,

224
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,815
one of the members of
the Clay shooting club...

226
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,817
You! Izumi Sano!!

227
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:57,255
Izumi...?

228
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:05,097
S...You used your own g
and left that letter written with blood

230
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:08,467
in order to mislead us...

231
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,370
A Killer would never leave his own shotgun

232
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,473
or an initial pointing to him
at the scene of the crime...

234
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:18,844
You took advantage of this psychology
and set a trap!

236
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,114
You moved the mouth of the gun from her
mouth down to her chest

238
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:26,518
because you wanted the letter writte Tin
blood to look real

240
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:31,924
A person who is shot in the head
would never be able to write on the wall...

242
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,725
What're you talking about?

243
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,529
I was watching the fireworks with Ran
from the very beginning

245
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,465
If the murder was committed
when the fireworks went up,

247
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,268
I would've been possible for me
to carry it out!

249
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,041
That is, if the murder was really committed
when the fireworks went up...

251
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,111
Will you cut it out!
Don't you remember what Sonoko said?

253
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,049
That when the fireworks went up, the killer
was still in the restroom!

255
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,587
No... The sound that Sonoko heard was
not the sound of the fireworks,

257
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,789
but rather the sound of
a shotgun being fired!

259
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,624
Don't be ridiculous...

260
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,394
There's no way a person can mistake
the sound fireworks with that of a shotgun.

262
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,000
Boom!

263
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,001
Huh?

264
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,272
Well? Did that sound like fireworks?

265
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,342
But, how did you do it...7?

266
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,877
This, with this!

267
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:26,478
Hmm?

268
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,045
Hmm?

269
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,015
A five yen coin?!

270
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,152
She puts it between her lips and
whistles.

272
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,688
The sound gets loud and hoarse

273
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,225
and sounds like that of fireworks!

274
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:47,032
It did kind of sound. something like that...

275
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
Right, Pops!

276
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:53,772
If only the shotgun were used,
it wouldn't sound like fireworks

278
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,108
But, if one is expecting the sound of
fireworks,

280
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,444
and the time of the show beginning was
approaching...

282
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,546
Under the circumstances back then,

283
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,116
it's understandable that
Sonoko would be deceived...

285
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:09,388
As proof, Sonoko mentioned that
only one burst of fireworks went up.

287
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,190
However, the fireworks actually started

288
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,860
with three successive shots of
red, blue and yellow

290
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,463
That's right, isn't it, Sonoko?

291
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,865
1 CO...

292
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,500
Uh-huh...

293
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,135
It was lucky that...

294
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,204
Sonoko coincidentally
happened to be in front of the restroom

296
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,341
It seems there were 2 or 3
other people there too

298
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,145
This is the only restroom you can use
wearing skates

300
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,215
It is predictable that with the "Cleaning"
sign hung on the door,

302
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,052
2 or 3 people will wait...

303
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:45,356
In other words, Ms. Sano promised to
meet Chihiro in the restroom...

305
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,493
She drives people away by hanging the
Cleaning sign at the entrance,

307
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,162
then she locks the entrance door.

308
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,165
She holds the shotgun that she had taken
out of the locker

310
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,369
and head for the restroom
where Chihiro was waiting

312
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,671
You pointed the gun at her about a minute

313
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,574
before the fireworks
were about to be set off

315
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:06,344
made the sound with the five yen coin,
and fired the gun.

317
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,815
After that you wrote the letter "SS" with

318
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,753
and rushed back to the rink
before the real fireworks went up

320
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:22,127
in order to set Oda who was not
interested in fireworks up as the killer.

322
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,497
Hey, 1s that true, Izumi?

323
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:26,698
Izumi.

324
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:33,071
I guess so...if I do so, it's true I could've
committed the murder

326
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:38,410
But, how can you say it was me? The other
three could've used the:same trick tool!

328
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,745
Izumi?!

329
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,681
I don't know who you are but,

330
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,283
will you cut out all your nonsense...!

331
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,221
KX...

332
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:49,821
Huh?

333
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,691
Do you.know what this means?

334
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:57,829
Oh...the letters that Chihiro randomly
input in her cellular?

336
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,966
No, she didn't input them randomly

337
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,536
She probably input these letters
in her cellular

339
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:08,140
while you were blocking her mouth
with the gun

341
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:13,879
Then she kept pressing the arrow button
to send out her message!

343
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,783
She hoped that we would eventually
press the re-dial button

345
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,952
and find out what she did

346
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,161
I see! That's why the row for telephone
numbers were filled with #"!

348
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,697
Pressing:on the arrow button displays
the "#" symbol

350
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,968
Hey...which means that the letters on the
display of the cellular are...

352
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:41,039
are the real dying message?!

353
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,708
So what?

354
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,179
Is K.I.X supposed to be my name or
something?

356
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,781
I heard that Chihiro said...

357
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:55,720
That Oda is always left out of your group.

358
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,390
What are you trying to get at...?

359
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,292
The name of the victim is Itami...

360
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,328
The two who are behind are
Komatsu and Misawa

362
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,967
Your name is lzumi Sano.
You still don't get it?

364
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,037
Would putting it this way, help you then?

365
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:16,775
The name of your friend who died of an
accident 6 months ago was...

367
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,311
r. Narita...

369
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,115
I get it! Airport!!

370
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:28,587
All your names are names of where
airports are located!!

372
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,190
Is there an airport in Sano City though?

373
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:38,063
Ight...Besides, I can't see how it I
connected to K.I.X...

376
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:39,998
Huh!

377
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,199
Ahhhh!!

378
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,473
Yes... K.ll.X. is the three-letter-code for the
Kansai International Airport!

380
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:53,945
It refers to the airport that is located
In Izumi Sano City in Osaka...

382
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,815
Now, do you understand Ms. [zum

383
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:02,554
But, that could be a message that
the killer used to frame me!

385
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:07,692
If I show you this, it may convince you

386
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:12,864
A strange blood stain the was on the floor
near the victim's left toe...

388
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,232
What?

389
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,501
Blood stain?

390
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:18,904
Hmm?

392
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,612
That is the trace of the blade of the skates
that was left behind

394
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,082
that Ms. Sano touched after
she finished writing the letter in blood

396
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:37,555
She still hasn't realized that the same
blood stain was left on the corridor

398
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,025
that she fled along

399
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,563
That Chihiro's blood is still left on the blade
of her own skates!

408
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,716
I see the name of the location of an airport

409
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,420
Just as would be expected of a Ms. Rich

410
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,957
who is still living off her parents and
traveling around...

412
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,827
Then, you did kill Chihiro after all?

413
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,829
But, but...why...

414
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:19,297
Narita...

415
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:20,165
Narita...

416
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,166
Narita?

417
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,972
I avenged Narita's death by killing Chihiro
who lead him to commit suicide

419
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,940
Suicide

420
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,043
But...l thought...that was an accident...

421
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,113
was brushed off by Chihiro...

422
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:41,118
That day...
And he pulled the trigger himself...

424
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,222
And, it was mistakenly concluded that

425
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,492
he accidentally died
while he was checking his gun.

427
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,730
I told him repeatedly to forget her.

428
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,333
But, why kill Chihiro because of something
Iike that...

430
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,270
If he just committed suicide because
he was brushed off, I wouldn't have done this!

432
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:04,743
I went over board because I found out that
somebody was two timing!!

434
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:07,078
Two-timing?

435
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:14,486
Yes... that day, I was sick in bed.
I got a call from Narita...

437
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,622
He said that his best friend
had betrayed him...

439
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,025
That odarwas going with Chihiro...

440
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,228
He sounded like he wasichokingiin tears

441
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:26,964
Huh? But wasn't Oda going with you,
Izumi, back then?

443
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,568
Right! This guy knew how Narita felt about
Chihiro,

445
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,706
and yet he had the nerve to two-time
Chihiro and me, snickering at us...

447
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,841
hat's not true...

448
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,512
She just did what she usual does to keep
herself out of hot water

450
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:45,116
Then, why didn't you tell Narita that over the
phone that day!!

452
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:50,588
He said he asked you but you were aloof
and didn't lend him an ear...

454
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:55,660
Yeah...l know it sounds wretched, but his
words didn't reach me...

456
00:19:55,661 --> 00:20:01,099
Because I was concerned about:you;
being sick in bed that day...

458
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:08,306
Maybe it would've been better for me to
have been shot by you...

460
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,948
We'll hear the rest of your story
at the station.

462
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,586
Hey...

464
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:30,328
Is it okay for me to believe what you just
said? No matter how far apart we are...

466
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:35,800
Yeah, don't worry...
I'm very grudgeful and persistent.

468
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:37,802
Thank you.

No matter how far apart we are

515
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:34,085
What's this, a young girl acting
Iike an old...

517
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,988
Will you be quiet, because you don't have
the slightest idea how I feel!!

519
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,389
Oh, the phone call.

520
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,262
Oh yes, hello?

521
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,397
I won! I won! Sonoko!!

522
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,267
I've won the championship*of the Winter
Karate:Tournament!!

524
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,404
There sure are unimaginably strong fighters
in the world

526
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,405
You idiot!!

527
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,342
Idiot! Why didn't you call me
sooner.!

529
00:22:57,343 --> 00:23:00,011
I sent you my phone number
2 months ago!!

531
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:04,616
Oh...I'm sorry...I didn't want to call you
and have nothing to say

533
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,916
Um, you know...

534
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,519
Sonoko, I hear that the cold is going
around in Japan,

536
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,923
so please don't go out
wearing short skirts, okay?

538
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:16,995
I'm wearing something real long
today too...

540
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,695
Just as I thought!

541
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:22,133
Sonoko seems to have bought
another cellular phone just for Mr. Kyogoku

543
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,201
I guess so

544
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:28,206
