1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:03,269
Inspiration flashes that pierces right
through.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,971
Once he gets going nothing can stop him.

4
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,973
This time it's an overnight stay at
an inn for training...

6
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,674
Ayumi and Genta disappear!

7
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,543
The one and only truth is brought into light.

8
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,345
He looks like a child but he's got the brain
of an adult.

10
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,981
His name is... Detective Conan!

11
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,015
Disappearance of the
Junioror Detective Squad"

13
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,719
eries of thievery at inns...

14
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,990
The guests and managers
have suffered losses...

16
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,492
How dangerous...

17
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:11,364
But, well. it's larceny that doesn't
use any brains...

19
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:14,132
guess there's no reason for a great
detective to make an appearance...

21
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,803
Oh, dad.

22
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,207
But the way... I don't see that
Conan around, but...

24
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,409
is he still in dreamland...

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,810
Oh...

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,513
If it's Conan, he's gone to training camp!
The neighborhood's children's club...

29
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,983
hat's that...

30
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,320
The children's club will be
putting on a puppet show...

32
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,523
A puppet show...? And, a training camp?

33
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,360
Yes... at an inn on the
Kirigaoka Highlands.

35
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:45,498
He's staying over with the
other children to practice...

37
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:51,103
which means... that kidd, detective squad
is with him too...

39
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,406
But... wonder if it's safe?

40
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:54,305
What is?

41
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:57,109
The thevery at inns that was in
the newspapers!

43
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,479
Nothing to worry abo

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,982
t's a totally different area...

45
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,251
But, Kirigaoka Highlands,

46
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:08,954
Is famous for the heavy fog
that sets in a night.

48
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,158
What if they get lost...

49
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,161
There's an adult with them,
isn't there?

51
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:18,631
Yeah, a person who lives in
ward #3 by the name of Kaibu...

53
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:21,900
it seems he did puppet plays when he
was a student...

55
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:26,205
He's taking care of the script and acting
at the children's club this time...

57
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,210
Good grief!

58
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:36,248
Let's see... "That's strange,
another person has disappeared".

60
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,583
Wait, wait!

61
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:42,988
Genta! There's no feelings in that
dialogue at all, is there?!

63
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,324
Is that right?

64
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,059
Yes, Genta...one more time!

65
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,663
That's strange... another person has
disappeared! .

67
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,998
And... next... Ayumi' s dialogue...

68
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,802
Let's see... "What's this all about?"

69
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,772
He's acting big
that Mitsuhiko...

71
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,309
Next... Conan, it's you!

72
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:10,249
Ah... let's see...
The murderer is definitely-in here..."

74
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,853
Good grief... A high school
student and doing a puppet play...

76
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:17,088
I shouldn't have come. like Haibara...

77
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,993
I have no interest in those things...

78
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,963
Shoots! I envy that character!

79
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,765
Conan; that's n xgood!

80
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,368
You're suppose to be playing the role
of a detective...

82
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,805
put:more force into the dialogue...

83
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,207
Isn't that right... Teacher Kaibuâ„¢?

84
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,144
Mitsuhiko... let's cut-out the "teacher" bit...

85
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,612
his is my first time at producing too...

86
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,582
Conan's role is

87
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,352
you're definitely rig

88
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,254
Conan... can we try it again?

89
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,588
Yes...

90
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:55,261
The murderer is definitelyaln here!!"

91
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:59,465
Umm... The movement of the puppet:
snNn't quite night...

93
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,235
That Mitsuhiko... what's he all
so " gun-ho " about.

95
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,972
That Mr. Kaibu moved into
Mitsuhiko's neighborhood

97
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,108
and they quickly became friends.

98
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:12,344
He even let him help make this story.

99
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,049
But... if I'm not mistaken. this is...

100
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,751
And, no one was left...

101
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:26,192
Anybody can see that it's been taken
from Agetha Christie's famous.novel...

103
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:29,328
I know the story! People are invited
to an island

105
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,730
and they're killed off one by one.

106
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,935
Rather than that... am hungry...

107
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,370
h, Genta...

108
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,039
Alright,

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,174
Then.? let's call it quits forenow!

110
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,311
One hour later, after dinner,
Iet's try it again...

112
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,879
Yes!

113
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,814
Gather the puppets together so they
won't get lost...

115
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,383
Yes!

116
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,652
Great!

117
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,090
Inner ime. inner ime.
It's dinnertime!

119
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,893
Oh... that Genta

120
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,861
Conan, great job!

121
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,829
Well.... well

122
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,231
ardon me...

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,070
Everybody still has a long way to go.
Hard practice is necessary!!

125
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,471
What?!

126
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,939
Hard practice! Hard practice!

127
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,941
Good grief...

128
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,748
What a thick fog...

129
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,884
guess that's why it's ca
Kirigaoka Highlands...

131
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,956
wow. . just great... I'm full!
It's no good... I can't move an inch!

133
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:35,094
Everyone! Rest 30 minutes and it's
practice again!

135
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,665
Practice again? Mitsuhiko! Give us a break!

136
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,369
Genta, there's a midnight snack prepared
00 but...

138
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,203
What!!

139
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,139
I'll do it! Let's go!

140
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,218
Everybody! Has someone
seen the Teacher around?

142
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,686
What's the matter?

143
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,888
Well... something's wrong.

144
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:07,359
He suddenly disappeared. . It's already
time to practice...

146
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,196
Come to think of it... the ward #3
uys aren't around too...

148
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,565
You're right... wonder where they've gone.

149
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,134
This is a problem...

150
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,503
Hey, have you seen them?

151
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,004
Nope...

152
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,175
h.... just as I thought...

153
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,445
The dolls are missing too!... Those
belonging to the Ward #3 kids...

155
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,082
You're right... the Teacher's is gone too!!

156
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,852
Hey, hey... this is just like

157
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:38,457
Those Wrad #3 kids probably too
it along with them...

159
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,025
But, where?

160
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,861
Well... maybe they went home...?

161
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,563
At this hour?

162
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,398
In this fog?

163
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,905
Someone's outside...

164
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,213
It's no good!! I can't see anything
th this fog...

166
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:12,124
No mistake about it!
Someone was here...

168
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,160
even those kids are go

169
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,562
What!

171
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,372
The dolls are gone too!!

172
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,808
Only ours are left!!

173
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,112
Darn it... this is a bad joke...

174
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,082
And, no one was left"... it's exactly
he same...

176
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,354
Is that... the story this puppet
play is based on...

178
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:48,794
up... in the original story, th
characters get killed off one by one...

180
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:52,431
and, the dolls disappear as each
person gets killed...

182
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:57,236
As they get killed off... you gotta
be kidding!!

184
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,473
All the children who
disappeared have been...

186
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,642
You're joking...

187
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,478
Calm down! Wesdon't know for sure
about that yet!

189
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,580
The backdoor!!

190
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,355
The fog is heavy overhere too...

191
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:21,894
(It's the footprints of those children, isn't it...
LIgie 5 Ole Tote pdit... Lose Ol Ally aU,.

193
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,163
Who's are they?

194
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,331
Could it be from that guy who was at
the window...

196
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:31,603

the managing office said

200
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,980
this is the only inn with guests today...
which means...

202
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:48,220
I don't know... but, there's no doubt
that there's something going on

204
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,689
in this foggy lodging area... Something.

205
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,591
I Know!

206
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,994
Huh? What do you know?!

207
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,865
It's the doing of that thief who raids-inn!

208
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,068
The one that's in the news lately...

209
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,202
That's right...

210
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:09,374
There's no mistake about it. He's
probably locked everyone up somewhere.

212
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,412
In thermeantime; he's planning to
raid all the inns in the area!

214
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,880
So, that's it...

215
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:22,788
Okay! If that's the case. the Junior
Detective Squad in gonna snag that thief!!

217
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,459
Agree! It's time for the Junior Detective
Squad to move into action!

219
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,128
Alright, let's do it!

220
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,997
Hat's the matter? Conan...

221
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,133
No... nothing...

222
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,973
But, if it's a thief.
Putting the kids aside...

224
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,609
Why did he take the dolls?

225
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,546
Darn it!! This is full of things
I can't understand!!

227
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:53,885
Anyway... it's best that we contact
the police...

229
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,421
it won't be too late...

230
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,057
even if the Junior Detective Squad
makes its appearance after that...

232
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:00,626
What?

233
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,730
Conan, what's the matter?

234
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,431
Can't you get a hold of them?

235
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,967
Yeah... the phone's dead...

236
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:15,574
With this...we've been completely
Iocked up in this fog...

238
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:15,874
With this...we've been completely
Iocked up in this fog...

240
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,848
Conan, what are you going to do?

241
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,851
There should be someone at the
management office over the hill...

243
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,986
Are you planning to go there?

244
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:28,720
Yes.

245
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,959
That's strange... weren't there a
flashlight and candles around...

247
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,031
Yes... when we got here, we checked out
the emergency'exits:and saw them...

249
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,432
They're not there?

250
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:43,435
No... somebody probably took them...

251
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,204
Somebody...? Who...?

252
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,342
Gee Genta... who else would it be
but he thief!

254
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,878
No... we can't be sure of that yet...

255
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,716
But... at this rate, we'd get lost even
if we tried to get to a nearby inn...

257
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:02,688
Anyway let's try to find some leads
this Inn...

259
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,424
Can't count on that too much...

260
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,797
Let's go! Conan!

261
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,567
Ayumi, stay here with Genta...

262
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,303
Can't be helped...

263
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,973
Genta! Take care of Ayumi...

264
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,240
Okay!

265
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,610
Be careful... Conan...Mitsuhiko...

266
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,877
Just leave it to us!

267
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,012
Goodjgrief

268
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,394
This is Mr. Kaibu's room...

269
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,496
hall we try going in...

270
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,370
What's this?

271
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,575
It's a map of this area...

272
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,577
Inns here and there are marked.

273
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,348
What's this suppose to mean...

274
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,990
What's this?

275
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:12,724
Could it be...

276
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,661
You're kidding...

277
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,230
acher Kaibu is...

278
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,901
Genta! Ayumi!

279
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,241
Genta! Ayumi!

280
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,043
Where are you!

281
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,811
This is...

282
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,180
What's the matter? Conan?!

284
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:37,783
You're Kidaings...

285
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,388
We're the only one left...

286
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,024
I got it! I know...

287
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:51,430
The teacher... that teacher, Kaibu is
the thief that's raiding the inns...

289
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,566
The proof is that map and that tool box!

290
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,639
To raid the inns at Kirigaoka,

291
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,375
he used this puppet play practice
as a coverup...

293
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,946
He even fooled us I can't forgive him!

294
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,750
Mitsuhiko, wait a minute! Not only the
children have disappeared,

296
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,284
but the dolls as well.

297
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,388
I don't think it's just a simple burglary...

298
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,757
Conan, you're over-thinking on this one!

299
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:23,695
In the first place, Teacher Kaibu is the
only one who can take the dolls out!

301
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,230
That's true, but...

302
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,468
Anyway, all we can do is try to find
Genta, Ayumi, and the others

304
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,769
That's right!

305
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,405
And, we're going to catch the criminal...!!

306
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,073
With our own hands...

307
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:51,890
The next inn was In this direction,
wasn't it.

309
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,258
Yes...

310
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:58,096
Huh? I think this is too near
to be the next inn...

312
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,632
Let's try going anyway!

313
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,741
E.Everyone!

314
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,513
Kaibu!

315
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,288
It's him... it's him after all...

316
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,556
I's him... it's him after all...

317
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,969
Where's everyone?

318
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,506
We're going in... hurry!

319
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,545
No one's here...

320
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,450
It's mo good...

321
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,720
I'll go check out the second floor!

322
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,555
Conan.

323
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:57,556
Stay here!

324
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,661
Please make it quick...

325
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,969

00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,491

331
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,328

You're kidding...

00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:57,015
ell..."And, you're the only one th
was left"...right? Mitsuhiko!

339
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:02,954
You're joking...
You're joking?!

341
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,396
Somebody!! Somebody!
Help me!!

343
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,169
Mitsuhiko... there's no use in running!

344
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,852
Alright... come with me... Mitsuhiko!

345
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,954
Don't come... don't come!

346
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,492
Ko... don't play the spoiled

347
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:09,487
Hurry!

348
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,689
H no, oh no...

349
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,290
Terrible... terrible...

350
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,097
Gee... thanks...

351
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,332
Conan?!

352
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:22,233
Everyone?!

353
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,272
Then...... this is.

354
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:34,212
Mitsuhiko, sorry about that... We were
practicing the puppet play.

356
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,482
I had each person come one
y one to the Inn...

358
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,285
You're kidding... I didn't hear
anything about it...

360
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,923
Sorry about that... I forgot to tell
you four about it.

362
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:48,960
Then, what were those pliers and
screwdrivers for in your room?

364
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,098
H... I thought of making some simp
stage installations.

366
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:57,302
I wanted all of you to get the atmosphere
of drama as quick as possible...

368
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,471
What about that m

369
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,874
Of course...
It's so we wouldn't get lost here...

371
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,478
I heard that the fog was
really thick around here...

373
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,113
Is that what it was all about...

374
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:12,083
Those dolls that disappeared were,
of course, used for the practice.

376
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,753
I bet it really scared you, didn't it?!

377
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,922
H... Genta, you were just as scared.

378
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,858
Who? me? Not really...

379
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,962
But, when we were doing voice training...

380
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,765
you thought we looked like
we were tied up...

382
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:31,302
But we really thought you were...
Isn't that right, Conan!

384
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:36,341
Mitsuhiko. I'm sorry... Even I scared
you in the end...

386
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,742
Actually, at that time,

387
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,245
Run! Mitsuhiko!

388
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,147
Calm down... Conan...

389
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,883
All of you...

390
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,852
Is that what this is all about!

391
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,954
Mitsuhiko is the only one left.

392
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,524
Everyone, continue practicing...

393
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,625
Wait!

394
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:00,397
That guy was acting big all day today...
so, let's scare him a bit!!

396
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,600
I think that's being too mean...

397
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:06,570
t... it may be good drama practi

398
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,041
Hey . hey... what are these gus anyway?

399
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,612
You're kidding... even you, Ayumi...
It's a shock!

401
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:23,688
Hey... Mr. Kaibu... but. why did you
cut the telephone lines?

403
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,490
What are you talking about...

404
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,460
Teacher, wasn't it you?

405
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:33,131
What does it mean? If it wasn't the
teacher...who'd do a thing like that?

407
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,699
Could it be?

408
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,235
Mitsuhiko?!

409
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,236
Let's go!

410
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,904
Mitsuhiko!

411
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,140
A real burglar?

412
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:43,875
You saw me!!

413
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:44,843
Help!

414
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,478
Mitsuhiko!

415
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:47,945
Help!

416
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,214
Mitsuhiko!!

417
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,350
Conan! Everyone!!

418
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,820
The one who cut the p
Iines and took the flashlights is...

420
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:58,990
Right... it's his doing...

421
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:02,360
e work of a real burglar...

422
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,829
Don't come!!

423
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,366
Don't you-care what happens to him?

424
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,636
Everyone! Never mind me... get this guy!!

425
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,271
Mitsuhiko!

426
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,608
Don't make noise!! Be quiet!

427
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:32,190
Get him!!

428
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:32,757
Get him!!

429
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,665
We did it!

430
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,900
That was a close call!

431
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,035
It was dangerous...

432
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,370
I'm saved...

433
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,906
Conan, close your eye a bitÂ».

434
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:48,973
Okay

435
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,075
Close your eyes tightly...

Mitsuhiko! I'm sorry about that
omment a while ago...

438
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,213
You really impressed me...

439
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,784
ee, I don't care if I die...

440
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:03,221
Mitsuhiko! I won't forgive you!!

441
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:05,723
