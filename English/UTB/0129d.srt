1
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:37,897
What?!

2
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,932
Professor Hirota was killed?!

3
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,701
Agent

4
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,668
hat's ridiculous...
agent

6
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:42,869
agent

7
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,870
He was fine till just awhile ago...
agent

9
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:45,437
He was fine till just awhile ago...

10
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,041
You came here just as Mrs. Hirota was going out

11
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,676
didn't you, Mr. Hosoya?

12
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,311
Oh. yes.

13
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:56,048
My daughter is geing to
apply for Nanyo University.

15
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,785
So I came to have Professor Hirota
write out a recemmendation for her.

17
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,989
But, 'he Prefessor was so drunk.

18
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,690
I decided to leave for today.

19
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,894
Is it true that the was drinking?

20
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,529
From evening

21
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,533
Mr Monoka!

22
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,801
According {& the message in the answer phone.

23
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:19,238
you were also supposed
to meet Professor Hirota...

25
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:19,872
Yeah!

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,406
0 play chess

27
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:23,843
she Professor and I pla- chess together!

28
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,612
He asked me to come over andiplay tonight tool!

29
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,949
See, chess pieces are

30
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,049
scattered all over the floor!

31
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,352
We used to always play in this room!

32
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:37,656
Phoned twice because we
didn't decide what time to start

34
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,458
but the answer phone was set.

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,328
I came ts check out what was happening
because he wouldn't answer the phone

37
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,729
despite having called me from his side!

38
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,531
¥ You came here tonight?

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,500
Yeah!

40
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,802
I came around 21.30...

41
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,470
Although the front door was open,

42
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,638
nobody answered the door bell.

43
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,775
So, I thought he had forgotten
about the game and went to sleep

45
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,310
1 went into the house.

46
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,446
But, when I knocked on the door
of the study, nobody answered

48
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,148
and on top of that, the door was locked

49
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,083
So, I gave up and left!

50
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,184
1 SCC...

51
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,287
And Mr. Agasa arrived an hour later,

52
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,589
realized that something was wrong,

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,059
broke the door open and found the corpse?

54
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,126
Yeah, that's right.

55
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,962
By the way,

56
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,332
Wil. OTNTURUTAd. YOU Late 1iunn
after we got here. right?

58
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:23,402
Aven't asked you what you
came here for yet?

61
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,672
the act is, I am working as a model.

62
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,474
I'm suppesed be deing an article

63
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,543
Ra magazine entitled.
"The Un xpected Plain Face of a Model"

65
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,113
ihteek a picture of me
dressed in woman's clothes

67
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:37,550
during a university festival.
Tegether with Professor Hirota,

69
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:42,555
and I came to get the floppy with
the data of the picture from him...

71
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,591
He saved the data of the picture in a floppy?

72
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,225
Yes...

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,464
my husband used to input all the pictures
that he liked into the computer...

75
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,666
He net only saved pietures

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,701
He also saved the entrance exams of universities

77
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,203
the grades this s wden

78
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:01,674
and even saved the process and results of
th » chess game that he played with Mr. Morioka.

80
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,309
Ale 4
1 OCC

82
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,579
So, the killer stole all @f those floppies

83
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,048
after killing Professor Hirota

84
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,951
Which means that the criminal
killed to get a hold of them

86
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:16,889
Your:daugther's going to be applying
for Nanye Universit , isn't she'?

90
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,194
If you got a held of the floppies
with the entrance exams in them

92
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,329
she would definitely get in, wouldn't she?

93
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,264
NNO,

94
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,800
it never even crossed my mind.

95
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,436
Somebody else could've been here

96
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,205
besides us, right?

97
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,207
Moreover, the Professor was

98
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,076
also using the computer at the university.

99
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,011
The Professgghimself

100
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,948
could've taken all the floppi~S to the university!

101
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,516
S possible...

102
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,350
He never writes anything on the label so.

103
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,919
He may've taken all*the floppies

104
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:47,920
Besides,

105
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,655
this room was loeked frem
the inside, wasn't it?

107
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,157
Moreover,

108
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,592
wasn't the key to this room found here

109
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:55,695
under the notebeek that was on the floor?

110
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,465
Officer.

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,900
OOo matter how you look at it...

112
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:02,802
Exactly

113
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,304
All the possible places of entry

114
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,973
were locked and «he only possible space

115
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,975
if any was between the door and the floor,

116
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,378
which only a key would slide through...

117
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,314
If 2 rubber band or a fishing, string, were used,

118
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,283
it may've been possible to kill Professor Hirota,

119
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,384
ake the fishing string away,

120
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,052
Iock the door from the outside

121
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,653
and from the space beneath the door,

122
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,491
move the key to the center of the room...

123
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,262
It would be close to impossible

124
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,963
to slide the key nicely under the notebook -

125
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,466
What bothers me is

126
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,968
why despite all the books that
were scattered around the room

128
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,272
wasdhere only the notebook
in question on the floor

130
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,040
whieh was lined in a row
from the door to the phone?

132
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:45,778
The tape of.the answering
phone is a bit out of shape but...

134
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,614
this couldn't have possibly been used

135
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:50,483
to push the key under the notebook...

136
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:52,951
Conan Edogawa?

137
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,722
Remember, the boy in glasses
that I told you about last time.

139
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,293
You alse said that you went

140
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:03,396
to somebody's house at Beika Town?

141
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,965
Oh, you mean Shinichi Kudo

142
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,400
Right!

143
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,701
He's the boy of the Detective Office there!

144
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,138
E seems a bit different...

145
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,740
He's unusually co 1 headed

146
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,409
nd very matuse fer a child...

147
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,010
How about you, Akemi,

148
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:18,978
are you all nght?

149
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,914
Ll heard that you were in
et water or something

151
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,349
Don't worn

152
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,417
I'm deing fine.

153
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,753
I'm mere worried about you, Shiho!

154
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,056
Cut out making poison, and 98

155
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,592
fimd yourself a over er two.

156
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,494
I'm really okay!

157
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,032
I'm really okay,

158
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:44,704
okay

159
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:57,884
Impossible

160
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,686
To lock the door from the outside,

161
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,088
and slide the key to the center of the room.

162
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,524
Much less to slide it under the netebeok.

163
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,992
It would be impossible

164
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:10,162
even if the tape of the answer
hone were to be used...

166
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,565
Although there are many strange points,

167
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,568
f he late Professor Hirota was drunk,

168
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,603
it's not all that strange

169
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:21,574
if he fell together with the bookshelf.
D hit the back of his head...

171
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:23,442
Besides,

172
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,344
it's too dangerous to stay here any longer,

173
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,012
as well as useless=

174
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,681
orget it, Shinichi...

175
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,283
orget this case...

176
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,320
It's checkmate.

177
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:38,791
Heckmate 70

178
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,165
urry let's get out of here from the back doer...

179
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,300
Held it.

180
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:52,405
Don't you care to know

181
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,173
the truth of this case?

182
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,842
Ke I said...

183
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,276
No matter how you look at it.

184
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,978
Thisus_no accident.

185
00:07:59,179 --> 00:07:59,812
It's hemicide!

186
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,181
After the killer murdered Professor Hirota,

187
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,917
he used a trick and lecked this
room up from-the inside

189
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,319
to make it loek like-an.accident.

190
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,855
I'll show yeu what the truth is,

191
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,890
tarting right this minute...

192
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,726
I'll show you that there is no case

193
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,561
that can't be solved in his world!!

194
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,839
In order to get the floppy disc
that had the data of the poison,

196
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,909
made by code name Sherry, alias, As Haibara,

197
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,010
from her older sister's-teacher,

198
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:32,512
from her older sisters teacher,
Masami Hirota
University Professor

00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,582

we headed off to his house.
Masami Hirota
University rofessor

205
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,183
However

206
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,821
The Professor was found killed inside a room

207
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,558
where the deer and/the windows were 0 ked.

208
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:49,362
The cause of his death,

209
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,531
was a vielent blow on the back of the
head wih a decorative object upon falling.

211
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,134
Whis is carefully schemed

212
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,836
behind loeked doors!!!

Akira Shirokura (25)
Model

247
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,686
The questions are

248
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,122
the key that is under the notebook

249
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,191
in a straight line from the telephone,

250
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,161
and the slightly bent out of shape
cassette tape of the.answer phone!

252
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,697
How on earth. did! the killer
commit the murder... . ?

254
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,533
Orget it, Shinichi...

255
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,268
orget this case...

256
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,206
It's checkmate.

257
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:37,743
Che kmate™?!

258
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,279
This is it!!

259
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,317
Now 11 the mem ase out en the board!?

260
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,420
It's an-accident, an accident!!

261
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,654
Professor Hirota was drunk,

262
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,424
fell down together with the bookshelf,

263
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,092
hit the back of his head violently and died!!

264
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,795
Judging from the circumstances at the scene

265
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,430
it sure can be looked at in that way

266
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,398
but there are 2 or 3 points that bother me...

267
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,601
I don't give a darn!

268
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:02,902
The room was locked,

269
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,472
I and moreover, the key was under the
notebook among scattered books. right'?

271
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,441
If there were a killer,

272
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,510
how did that person lock the door?

273
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,112
That's why we're trying to figure that out...

274
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
I'm sorry,

275
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,783
but I have some matters to attend tomorrow.
So if you will excuse me...

277
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,051
I'll be on my way toe.

278
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,653
I'm leaving too.

279
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:21,921
Hey, wait...

280
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:23,523
Everybody, wait up!!

281
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,193
Oh, uh...l just...

282
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,928
H Hey, what are you using
my veice suddenly fer...

284
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,464
I've figured if out.

285
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:35,134
How the trick of the-locked door

286
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:39,372
murder was carried ou.,
as wellsas who the killer is.

288
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,973
WwW What?!

289
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:45,745
H. Hey, Shinichi

290
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,680
Never mind just move your
mouth in keeping with my veice.

292
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:48,681
Ghads,

293
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,149
Iike I've been telling you...

294
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,717
No matter how you look at it...

295
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,052
No, no,

296
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,421
that's why amateurs are no geed...

297
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,657
Nn amateur...
and just who do you think you are...

299
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,226
The ream was indeed locked fram the inside!

300
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,495
Ne matter how you look at it
it looks to be an accident...

302
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:06,032
But, this trick of a locked reom
can be carried out perfectly

304
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,802
by using the cassette tape of
the answer phone and the chess piece!

306
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,370
Assette tape

307
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,705
chess piece

308
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,843
A. Are you sure, Shinichi?

309
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,212
Hey, stop glancing at me.

310
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,147
Act mere eonfident like a detective, will you...

311
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,116
Proof speaks mere than words,

312
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:26,118
show us. will you?

313
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,388
The trick that ou have imagined,

314
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,790
right here before us all.

315
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,025
Aye! Definitely.

316
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,596
I'll have Conan help me and
replay how it was done.

318
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,465
D.Do yeu know what you're deing?

319
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,801
Yeah trust me.

320
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,402
It'll werk 100% 1

321
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,505
I Officer,

322
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:47,406
do you happen to have a cellular on you?

323
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,041
Yeah. I have.one.

324
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:52,945
Lend me that glove too!

325
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:54,614
Officer Yokomizo,

326
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,582
I've brought the cassette tape!

327
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:01,420
It is the same as the one
used in the telephone here.

329
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,355
Why?

330
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,924
Asked fer no sueh thing...

331
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,293
Huh, 'but,just a while ago this boy here...

332
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,028
Oh well, never mind, no big thing!

333
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,963
May I have the tape; officer?

334
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:17,403
First. pull out the tape to a certain length...

335
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,538
Agh, hey!

336
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,007
Set.the cassette into the phone.

337
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,509
Of course the tape is left sticking out.

338
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,380
Next, straighten:the tape that is
sticking out, and pull it straight...

340
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,282
Go out of the door.

341
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,685
And pull the tape threugh the ring of the key.

342
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,923
Then leave that key outside the door,

343
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,558
take the remaining tape

344
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,394
and go back togthe place where
he notebook was on the floor...

346
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:47,066
Next place three pawns that are of
the same height in the shape of a triangle,

348
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,901
then hook the edge of the tape-that is left.

349
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,303
Onto the pawn that is closest to the phone,

350
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,873
andyplace+the notebook on it...

351
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,442
What a joke.

352
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,111
You may be trying to knock the pawn over

353
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,746
with the force of the tape being pulled,

354
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,582
but that's jTSi a paper plan.

355
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,984
The stand of the pawn is quite stable,

356
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,620
so the key will hook on to
the pawn before it falls,

358
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,422
and come out from under the notebeok...

359
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,491
It's the opposite!

360
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,927
I'm geing to turn the pawn
upside down after this!

362
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,698
Even if the head of the pawn is round,

363
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,968
so long as the cover of
the notebook is firm like this,

365
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,101
can be placed on...

366
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:27,073
You just wait and see.

367
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,141
I'll do it for you right now.

368
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,614
First, the door is locked from the outside.

369
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:36,682
Then, the key is placed on the floor
d a phone call us made...

371
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,326
The answer phone goes off,

372
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,995
and the tape is wound .."...

373
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,899
The key is pulled in under
the space of the door,

375
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,335
and moves under the notebook
that is placed in the center of the room.

377
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,137
It will eventually bump into the pawn,

378
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,239
which will then lose its balance

379
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:01,707
and he key

380
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,044
will go under the notebook.

381
00:14:06,813 --> 00:14:07,680
It. It went in!!

382
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,549
See.

383
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,651
So. if you keep on meving the answer phone.

384
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,321
The tape is wound. and
he evidence vanishes .

386
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,623
Well? Did 1t werk?

387
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,626
Oh, it-was fantastic, Shiniehi.

388
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:22,295
Oh, no,

389
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,530
well; it's just as I thought

390
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,201
And. if the pawn is place at
a corner of the notebeok.

392
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,204
It would make it mere difficult for -
the pawn to roll under the neteboeek

394
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,140
Well. even if it did, it weuldn't
Iook very unnatural.

396
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,541
Whieh means that the one

397
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,946
who called and left 10 messages in the answer
phene in order to use the trick...

399
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,215
IS you,

400
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,083
Mr. Akira Shirakura!!

401
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,320
Then, are you the one who killed my husband?!

402
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,621
W. Wait...

403
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,457
The tape was twisted here and there,

404
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,459
and that serves as evidence
that the tape was used fer the trick!

406
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,595
Isythat right?

407
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,530
Just a minute, please!!

408
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,766
I admit that the triek just now is really superb!

409
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,703
But, why do») I turn out to be
he one who set it up?

411
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,874
All 1 did was put a lot of messages
in the answering machine

413
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,576
In the first place, if I were the one who did it,

414
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,211
I wouldn't ceme all the way back here.

415
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,414
You came back to get semething, didn't you'?

416
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:16,883
Yes...

417
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,218
You came to get he tape of the answer phene

418
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,887
because it had your fingerprints
Il over the place...

420
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,924
When I teek a leok at the tape awhile ago,

421
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,392
I could tell in one glance.

422
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,829
There were the fingernprints,.of
somebody all over the tape

424
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,964
And I could also tell that

425
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,867
his was an unprepared, impulsive murder.

426
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,802
You prebably met

427
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,638
Professer Hirota tonight

428
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,439
and got into an argument

429
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,209
You then, impulsively hit iim on the head:

430
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:46,946
Fortunately, this trick crossed your mind,

431
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,848
and you were able to think up
a locked door murder

433
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,650
which looked to be an accident.

434
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,787
But, since the murder wasn't
planned ahead you didn't have gloves

436
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,390
And you couldn't help getting
your fingerprints on the tape.

438
00:15:57,858 --> 00:16:00,760
Therefore, you decided to be
the first to discover the corpse.

440
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,664
And.after your made Mrs: Hirota
confirm thatethe door was locked

442
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,167
you were waiting for atime
when you could switch tapes.

444
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,970
However, we found the corp @ first,

445
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,638
and the police arrived sooner han expected.

446
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,640
SO having no chidice, yew came here

447
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,976
Iike you said mm he tape!

448
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:21,214
You went out of the way to
Ieave your name on the tape.

450
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:24,584
So that in case you couldn't get the tape,.back,

451
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,687
it would make it more difficult
to see through the trick.

453
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,289
If there are many blank recordings,

454
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,092
whether you like it or not,
attention would focus on

456
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,961
the tape with your fingerprints on.

457
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,431
Youscan go ahead and check
Mr. Shirakura If you like.

459
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,267
He's beund to have Professor Hiretass
floppies on him somewhere.

461
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:44,003
After all, he couldn't have possibl. cheeked

462
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,172
the centents of the large batch

463
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,307
of floppies he took in sueh a short time

464
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,777
Then. can we start by searching your house

465
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,112
Mr. ShirakuraO?

466
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:56,115
They're in the dashbeard of my car

467
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:58,050
that is parked in front of this house.

468
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,686
All the floppies are there...

469
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,856
The one with the data of
e pictures is there too

471
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,658
Pictures?

472
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,027
Didn't I tell you awhilerago

473
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,329
that I'm supposed be deingea celumn

474
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,132
In a magazine entitled,
The Unexpected Plain Faee of a Medel "

476
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,169
and that & teek a& picture of me
dressed in woman's clothes

478
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,504
during a university fes ival,
ogether witiWProfessor Hirota...

480
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,675
but, what he had sent me
was a message that said,

482
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,511
There is Nething Better Than
This Plain Face of Yours."

484
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,512
and a picture of my face

485
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,382
in the past...

486
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,217
Your face in the past?

487
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,252
I had plastic surgery

488
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,921
when I became a model...

489
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,822
I changed my name teo.

490
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,759
I thought it was just the picture.

491
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,361
My face wasn't all that clear
because of the make-up and wig.

493
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,964
And since I was in woman's
clothes. thought it'd be funny...

495
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:47,633
I naturally couldn't give the~editor
a picture of the face of the past...

497
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,839
So, I came to ask the Professor
to lend me the picture .

499
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:58,377
Oh, I forgot which floppy it was that

500
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,380
had he picture of you
dressed in woman's clothes!

502
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,685
If it's the picture I sent to you,
I can get it now.

504
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,988
I can send it to
the editor If you liker

506
00:18:10,224 --> 00:18:12,091
I got enraged at his words...

507
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,527
and when I snapped back e myself...

508
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:18,130
Hirota was om the floer before me.

509
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,171
The rest 1s as he had explained.

510
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:28,174
Verything is right to the smallest detail...

511
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:31,577
Okay, please come to the station with us, then.

512
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:32,712
Hey!

513
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,180
Yes, sir!

514
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,721
Mr. Shirakura...

515
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,490
Maybe it's nene of my business...

516
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,660
But- I think that Professer Hirota
sent you the picture of your past

518
00:18:47,661 --> 00:18:50,463
because he wanted you
to have more confidence

520
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,466
in yourself as well as be true to yourself.

521
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,169
1 would've hiked to

522
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:59,939
hear those words directly
from Professor Hirota

524
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,242
Too bad...

525
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,016
Well, that was a fantastic deduction!!!

526
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,985
Thanks to you, the case was solved,

527
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:13,886
Mr. Agasa.

528
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,922
Oh, no, well.

529
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:20,059
And I would like to have the floppy
at I came to get right away...

532
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:24,864
We'll have to check out
the evidence at the station first...

534
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,666
So he says! What now?

535
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,468
Can't help it

536
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:31,838
I guess we:ll get out of here-fer now...

537
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,306
Okay.

538
00:19:33,307 --> 00:19:34,540
Then, we'll be heading heme.

539
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:35,908
Take care!

540
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,444
Hey, come on, you teo!

541
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,747
Why?

542
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:45,418
Why didn't you

543
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,653

544
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,656
Your sister

545
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,759
You still haven't realized?

546
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,361
Masami Hirota is

547
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,464
an alias that my sister took
from Professor Hirota's name!!

549
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,099

550
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,935

Masami Hirota

554
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:19,685
If you go,

555
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,853
you will be murdered

556
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:23,289
Thank you.

557
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,857
I'm sorry,

558
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:25,725
Conan.

559
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:30,963
Who IS the mastermind?

560
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:36,935
Where are you?

561
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:38,171

Masami Hirota

565
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,612
Akemi Miyano.

566
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,082
It's a shot!!

567
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:51,584

Masami!

570
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,858
It is a big-organization

571
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,326
that is wrapped irr mystery.

572
00:21:01,128 --> 00:21:03,229
I. a low rank member. know only one thing

573
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,731
that the color 1 the organization is black...

574
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:06,933
Black

575
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,204
Members of the organization like to wear...

576
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,839
Iack clothes like a crow...

577
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,177
Take this:

578
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:20,313
Iease

579
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,748
before they notice

580
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,317
I'm counting on you.

581
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,618
Uttle detective

582
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,357
0, she was your older sister...

583
00:21:31,692 --> 00:21:32,525
That's right!

584
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:34,093
Hey...

585
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,595
With your pewer of deduction...

586
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,930
yeu could've easil seen through

587
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,067
what my sister was up to!!

588
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,602

Why it

591
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:51,444
Her trembling..crying voice,

592
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:54,914
brought 'backs memories
of a painful and-"sad case

594
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:57,350
that Ijhad almost forgotten.

595
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,018
That was

596
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,656

A week later,

666
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:36,182
the floppy was sent to us from the police,

667
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,152
SO we decided take a look at
in on thefjcomputer right away

669
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:44,156
It's a wonder it made it through
the investigatien of the police.

671
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,526
All the floppies of the organization are»

672
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,160
plain t xt files

673
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:49,762
unless a password is entered.

674
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,864
They would never BB suspected.

675
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:53,599
How us it 1

676
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:54,567
Will! it came bu r

678
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:58,037
And the«data that is in here
is-not only of the poison

680
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,474
The real name, address and
code name of the persen

682
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:04,210
who was werking @m the poison
before lswas plaeed

684
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,412
in my position is.supposed to be in here 00.

685
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:10,082
The name of the person who invested in
this research should also be in here

687
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,084
I see

688
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,122
If*we do it right. we might be
able to expose them

690
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:24,063
seems like the old man
alled Hirota dropped dead...

692
00:24:24,932 --> 00:24:25,998
Yeah.

693
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,333
It saved us the trouble of killing him ourselves.

695
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,470
we still don't know the whereabouts

696
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,905
of the woman who got away...

697
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,941
They're checking to see

698
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:39,245
if somebody within
the organization helped her escape.

700
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:40,479
And now,

701
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,716
the places the they may hide
have all been gotten rid of.

703
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:47,220
I'm sure she'll come oution her own soon.

704
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,589
I heard that the floppy with information

705
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,159
on the peisen was forfeited by the police.

706
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:55,294
That's nothing to worry about.

707
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,598
That floppy is a bit rigged.

708
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,569
WwW. What's happening?

709
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:07,974
What is this?!

710
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,976
- @mputer virus,

711
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:10,710
Night Baron!

712
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:11,944
What?!

713
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:14,814
The fleppy has beensprogrammed

714
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,749
Se that if fits booted uprwith a computer

715
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,085
other than the organizations.
A virus eats the data.

717
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,319
How careless.of me.

718
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:22,320
Then all the data is .
