1
00:00:01,851 --> 00:00:03,352
Friendship. Romance. Mystery

2
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:05,554
Because we cherish them we can continue

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,406
An old nostalgic mansion
In the countryside

5
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,058
Among the tourist attraction is
a'feeling of a new case

7
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,759
He sees through,the one and only truth,

8
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,727
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

10
00:00:12,728 --> 00:00:14,830
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,221
This is really a charming place.

13
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,024
I feel like I'm back in the old days.

14
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:25,344
You feel nostal sick or something, yeah.

16
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,512
Huh?

18
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:31,567
You mean nostalgic. Genta.

19
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,368
Since when did they change it?

20
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,872
Just how old do you think you are,
nyway...?

22
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:41,410
It certainly looks like a.place
that is talked of a lot since

24
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,379
It's going to be selected as an Earth Heritage.

25
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,115
Recently there's talkiabout something else

27
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,188
What us that. Conan?
What's that something else?

29
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:57,960
That is...
The ghost story!

31
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:00,195
Ha ha ha.

32
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:00,629
Ha ha ha.

33
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,465
Oh. you meanies. all of you.

34
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:04,700
Hee hee

35
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:08,070
Are there talks. about a ghost?

36
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,872
From about half a year ago.

37
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:13,007
People started saying
they witnessed~a child ghost.

39
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,177
And the rumor seems to have spread.

43
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:22,184
Don't you guys know this tour is a gift
for solving a case?

45
00:03:22,185 --> 00:03:25,988
Why don't you try
to get a taste of good old Japan?

47
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:28,557
Indeed. For god's sake.

48
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:31,193
Ill try to get a taste good old beer. ha ha ha.

49
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:33,161
Come oniinmsir I

50
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:36,131
Ha. ha. ha. That's him alric ht.

52
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,171
(Bi%R)

53
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,410
This place really makes me feel
as if we've time warped.

56
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:51,747
So. we will stay here for the night.

57
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:55,417
This place is an earth heritage
and inn for tourists.

60
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:58,120
This is really good old Japan.

61
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:01,189
Oh. There are three floors inside.

62
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,059
SO it has more rooms than it looks like
it has when seen from outside.

64
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,596
There must have been a large family living here.

65
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,231
Huh? This is...

67
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,333
What is it, Conan?

68
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,434
Well,

69
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:15,737
the stone and the soil around the stone are new

70
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:19,274
For a hundred year old house of heritage,
it's strange...

72
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,879
They are going to stay with us.

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,379
Hi. good afternoon.

75
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:25,614

Hi, nice meeting you.

77
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:27,783
Hi, nice meeting you.

78
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,118

Can I take a'hotbath?

83
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,945
How about air conditioning?

84
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,631
I guess you can't expect these things,
ha, ha, ha.

86
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:44,499
He's awful.

I'm embarrassing you?

94
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,383
You said so. didn't you ?

95
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,485
Stop it. Stop. how unsightly of you.

96
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:04,152

00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:08,390
Stop? Who are you. dirty old man J Co

If you want to address me at all. you can call me,

99
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:13,228
Kogoro Mouri.

100
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,362
Mourn?

101
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,365
e means that...

102
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,134
The sleeping Kogoro, the detective?

103
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:22,737
They call me by that name. in spite of myself.

104
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:25,707
Did you hear that? In: spite of myself!
So theatrical.

106
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,242
No, I didn't.

107
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,145
This is gorgeous!
Little Rumiko is so impressed!

109
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,546
So you're a famous person, pops!

110
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,248
Stop it. ladies.

111
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,318
You are making my beer spill over.

112
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,185
Ha. ha, ha.

113
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:43,258
My name is Shoukichi Sakamoto \
and I'm honored to meet you fr. Mourn.

115
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,927
I'm Kazuaki Kuwajima. Glad to meet you. sir.

116
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:49,931
An. And I am glad to meet you. gentlemen.

117
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,200
Hun! What a bore!

118
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:54,770
Excuse me, sir.

119
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,039
Huh? What?

120
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,157
Excuse me,

121
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,244
but your inn is located a block down,
at Ishizuka house.

123
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,646
Why didn't you tell them sooner?

124
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,492
How delicious! This pot of wild boar!

125
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:19,461
This iwana fish is so delicious too.

126
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,829
Delicious. delicious.

127
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,732
The aroma of this misossoup-is so fine.

128
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,934
Yep. It warms your body.

129
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:30,472
Well, It's best for winter, this.hot sake.
Take one. .please.

131
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,008
2 Oh. Thank you. sir. I will.

132
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,076
Lay off!

133
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:36,812
Oops. Huh?

134
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:39,314
They made it up and put it on the magazine.

135
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,400
It's not real and you won't see it here

136
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:43,752
Hun!

137
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,454
Dear!

138
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,222
Don't you be rude to our guests.

139
00:06:47,223 --> 00:06:51,259
Excuse me. we are very,busy right now.

140
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,328
Huh? What was that all about?

141
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,499
It's this, Ran. This article in the magazine.

142
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,502
Oh.- What about it?

143
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,371
Wha! Ghost seen at the Earth Heritage site"!?

144
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:06,475
Unexpected busy business bewilders
people of the district.

146
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:09,111
Off-the-wall but it sells?

147
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,179
We don't need any ghostihere

148
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,615
What a nuisance! {

149
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:14,616
I see.

150
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:15,817
It should be.

151
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:19,354
An earth heritage is the pride of the world.

152
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,090
So much so that
it is an asset to all mankind.

154
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:24,759
Exactly. and we agree with you.

155
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:29,598
How dare they use it to attract people here
as if this were another tourist attraction

157
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,666
for a crowd of curious people?

158
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,718
It really is

160
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,504
Now this is for you.

161
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm just doing my share to welcome you...

162
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,344
That's Mr. Mourn!
Your words.are precious to us.

164
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,379
Now you can drink to that.

165
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,680
Well, thanks to you. I will.

166
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,631
Wow.

167
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,683
Ah, you're the one to enjoy drinking.

168
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:51,987
Off you go with more drinks.

169
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:54,289
Hey. Now they started\...

170
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:56,558
Well. we are leaving now...

171
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,026
Thanks for everything, guys!

172
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,729
Good night.

173
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,397
You've done your share. guys.

174
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,799
Now.lets drink up once more.

175
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,801
It-is-so delicious!

176
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:09,371
Conan, we should be going now.

177
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:10,205
That's right.

178
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:11,873
What are we going to do? Sleep?

179
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:13,041
No way.

180
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:17,546
How can we go to sleep before making sure
if the ghost is real or not?

182
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:18,880
Of course

183
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:23,418
Sure. We are here to search for facts!

184
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,886
Aren't we. Conan?

185
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:26,488
Oh, me?

187
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,223
It suits you, Conan. Go with them.

188
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:28,790
It suits you, Conan. Go with them.

189
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:29,991
I'll - ass.

190
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,194
I'm staying here
and going to read a book in the room.

192
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:33,528
Ha. Haibara. you.

193
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,553
What's the matter with you, Conan?

194
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,389
Oh. Uh, it's nothing.

195
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,676
By the way. let's go take a walk for a while.

196
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,027
At this time of the day?

197
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,779
It's not that late.

198
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,016
Besides, I get to see the attraction over there.

199
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,730
Beware of fire, everyone!

200
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,266
I'm scared but it's beautiful!

201
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,768
It doesn't surprise me
if it comes up in this setup.

203
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,638
They do it every evening.

204
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,941
Each house sends someone
in turn for the night watch.

207
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,612
Fire is the biggest enemy
to a house with thatched roofs.

209
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,915
The best they can do is take precautions
against fire for themselves.

211
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,183
The whole village takes
and shares responsibility...

213
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:31,720
In a way, this is very reasonable.

214
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,271
All's well.

215
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,189
Good and thank you.

216
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,892
Click, click.
Watch out for fire, everyone!

218
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,800
Who... are you?

219
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:52,440
Hey. who are you?

220
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:59,314
Watch out for fire, everyone!

221
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:01,850
Huh?«Ayumi is not with us.

222
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,718
She was with us a moment ago.

223
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,153
Ayumi!

224
00:10:05,154 --> 00:10:07,055
How on earth did she get lost?

225
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,089
Ayumi!

226
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,058
Ayumi! Ayumi!

227
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:14,428
I'm sure she was with us here.

228
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:18,133
I say she got hungry
and went back to the inn alone.

230
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,969
No. She is not like you. Genta.

231
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,936
Are you sure?

232
00:10:21,937 --> 00:10:23,371
Mmm. What's that?

233
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,239
What?

234
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,140
Did you find her?

235
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,747
Oh, it's Ayumi's scarf.

236
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:33,648
I'm sure it is.

237
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,562
Wait, wait for me.

238
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,364
What's your name?

239
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:50,332
Who are you?

240
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:53,401
Wait for me. Don't leave me alone.

241
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,002
Waa.

242
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,370
Wait!

243
00:10:55,838 --> 00:10:58,239
Oh? Ayumi's lost?

244
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,076
I'm sorry
I guess we weren't careful enough.

246
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,878
We decided we should come back
and search for her with more people,

248
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,979
SO we came back.

249
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,216
I see. Let's all go look for her together.

252
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,288
Mumble., mumble.

253
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,291
Gosh!

254
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,093
On. I see dad can't help us.

255
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,431
My man, too.
He never stops drinking once he starts drinking.

257
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,735
Let me call the villagers
to help with the search.

259
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:27,601
Thank you.

260
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,137
And we thank you, too.

261
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:30,605
I'll help you too.

262
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,239
Yeah.

263
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:34,709
Hey! What's the matter?

264
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,010
Is something wrong?

265
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:37,645
I'm gonna help you.

266
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:38,580
You can't and don't.

267
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,649
What's the matter with you?
I'm not trying to sell anything to you.

269
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,650
Pfoo!

270
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,589
Ayumi!

271
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,425
Ayumi! Ayumi!

272
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:00,969
We've found her!

273
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,272
She's at the root of the Water God cedar tree.

275
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,228
Ayumi!

276
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,880
Come, on: Ayumi!

277
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,682
Ayumi!

281
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,424
- - 5 Y

287
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,363
Mmmm

288
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,488
Oh. Conan?

289
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:37,439
Ayumi!

290
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,057
Are you alright?

292
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,609
Oh. everybody.

293
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,728
Do you feel any pain?

294
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,130
You appear to be free from injuries but...

295
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm alright. No pain at all.

296
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,702
Can you talk a while?

297
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,237
Yes.

298
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,404
What happened?

299
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:55,707
It Sw...

300
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:56,441
It's...

301
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,909
Did you see a girl?

302
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,345
I did.

303
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,281
She was about 10, bobbed hair. and

304
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,849
earinghka red skirt.

305
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,551
Can't be!

306
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,725
It can't be.

307
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,460
Mr. Nagakura...

308
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,963
She came to see Efiji. Mami did come

309
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,864
Mami

310
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,267
That-girl. Her name is Mam:.

311
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,601
Yes.

312
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,105
Mami and Eiji had been friends
since childhood.

314
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:31,558
Mami was a year younger,
and they were very close friends.

316
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,851
Yes. lim sure it's her.

317
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:45,690
Mami believes that Eiji is not guilty
and came to see him.

320
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,058
Not guilty?

321
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,760
Cut it out!

322
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,928
Young lady

323
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:54,499
you've mistaken something else for her,
I'm sure of it.

325
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,733
Huh'?

326
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,902
But how do you know?

327
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,704
I'm sure I saw her.

328
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,773
Do you doubt her, pops?

329
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,026
Ayumi is an honest girl.
She doesn't tell lies.

331
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,995
Calm down, everybody!

332
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,814
Well. why -are you certain that she saw wrong?

333
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,382
Mr. Nagakura?

334
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,183
But of course.

335
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:14,552
Because both them...

336
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,787
Eiji since last month

337
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,089
and that girl since ten years ago.
Have been dead.

339
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,490
What! .

340
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,727
Died ten years ago. wow.

341
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:23,561
Then she was...

342
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,096
A ghost...

343
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,097
Aaah.

346
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:32,203
I, I can't stand that kind of a story
Ha. ha, ha.

348
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,638
So it's true.

349
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,606
So they appeared.

350
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,074
I'm scared...

351
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,476
Don't you worry, Keiko.

353
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,444
Huh

354
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,813
What's the fuss all about?

355
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,732
Where have you been:tall this time, dad!

356
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:45,683
Huh

357
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,020
You. you all,... who's behind all this ..7?

358
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,154
Dear...

359
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:50,922
Huh

360
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,258
I got it. They are behind all this!

361
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,993
The. ?

363
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,861
You can't fool me with such a trick!

364
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,064
You won't have your way with me, never!

365
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,165
A s&s oo

366
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:06,070
And:Eiji. That fellow is not my son!
Keep that in mind!

368
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,207
How can you say that!
How cruel, Eiji just...

370
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,009
You hold your tongue!

371
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,344
Calm down, Mr. Nagakura.

372
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,612
The sake took hold of you.

373
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,347
That's right.

374
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,717
Cool down and have more hot sake.
And you'll be...

376
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,069
Leave me alone!

378
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,665
I smell something.

379
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,300
This village has something 5
other than a ghost.

381
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,067
Yeah.

382
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,770
It seems worth investigating.

383
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,470
Yep.

384
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,941
Was that a ghost?

385
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,475
That Mama...

386
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,917
QJ) TY

387
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,719
Es CS

388
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,965
The house of Otsuzawa.

389
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,836
Mami had been living
In this house with her parents

391
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,921
She was the only child in the family.

392
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:15,923
Hey. Ayumi!

393
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,553
Mami died of a disease.

394
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:33,624
And then the parents moved out
to some other place.

396
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:38,696
Are there any photos left?
Maybe not, it's been 10 years now

398
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:43,601
With a photo of her,
we can tell if what Ayumi saw was real or not.

400
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,872
That's right!
How well your mind works, Au.

402
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,409
Real? You mean the ghost?

403
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,946
You of all people start talking like that...

404
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,814
Don't you believe her, Conan?

406
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,986
Dont you know I'm the detective
who is making his way

408
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,071
with logic and reasoning.

409
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,188
There is no place for a ghost in...

410
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,190
I'm not asking anything of the sort.

411
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,191
Huh

412
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,796
They're both asking you
if you believe in Ayumi.

415
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,070
A. Ayumi!

416
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,440
Yousllspay for this. Conan!

417
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,375
What the...

418
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,844
And now we go for Eiji.

419
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,945
Huh? Oh, yeah.

420
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,094
Suicide? Eiji Nagakura killed himself?

421
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,496
Yes: There is no doubt about it.

422
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,832
Since you asked me,
I checked on Eiji Nagakura

424
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,837
in the crimerarticles in the newspaper,
and I found one.

426
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,574
It took place half a year ago

427
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,010
in the town of Shoujin.

428
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,480
It's right next to this village °*
you are staying in.

431
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,217
They found his fingerprints at the scene.
He was wanted.

433
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,219
And he probably gave up on running.

434
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:13,558
Eiji Nagakura is a jewelry robber
who committed suicide.

436
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,961
But his mother believes him to be innocent.

437
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,964
That's why the village people
were reluctant to talk.

439
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:22,834
Conan.

440
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,068
Mmm

441
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,971
I didn't tell a lie.

442
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:30,074
I really saw her. Mams.

443
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,776
Ovo

444
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,077
I want you, Conan.

445
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,512
To believe me.

446
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,815
So I want you to 1

447
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,916
You want him to investigate. don't you?

448
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,319
Yes.

449
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,489
Of course he will do it for you,
and just for you.

451
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,226
Aibara, are you serious...

452
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,660
Conan Edogawa. are you ready?

453
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,200
This is one place that's eerie
even in the daytime.

455
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,302
I saw her over there and

456
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,507
she acted as if she wanted me to follow her,
1p to the large tree.

458
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,374
Then,

459
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:08,445
Then? What happened then, Ayumi?

460
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,348
She disappeared.

461
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,781
Disappeared?

463
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:14,952
She just disappeared into darkness.

464
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,389
And she never appeared again.

465
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,959
I got tired of calling her

466
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,062
and it seemed I went into sleep
at the foot of the tree.

468
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,797
Uh-huh.

469
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,567
Where did she disappear?
Exactly where?

472
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:29,834
Mmm.

474
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,771
The mist was thick...

475
00:19:33,821 --> 00:19:36,574
It was there beside the tree.

476
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:40,711
Huh

477
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,319
It's still new.

478
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,056
It says 'Tama.
It could be the inn across the street.

480
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,392
Oh. That's the story.

481
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,862
Thisikimono was blown:away by the. wind.

482
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,630
Ayumi saw it-and thought
it:was the girl by mistake.

484
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,366
What are you talking about, Genta?

485
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,970
Clothes hung-out to dry,
won't come flying this far.

487
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:10,908
It's not a mistake. I actually saw her.

488
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,844
1. I believe you. Ayumi:

489
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,415
It must be some coincidence

490
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,651
Hey. Are you insisting there's a gho...

491
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:21,618
huh

492
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,887
I saw him yesterday...

493
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:26,591
What on earth is he doing?

494
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,733
Beware of fire, everyone.

495
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,195
Footsteps?

496
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,747
It's walking!

497
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,549
So it really is a ghost after all!

498
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,485
But a ghost doesn't walk on foot. Genta.

499
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,421
You're right! Then. it means...

500
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,457
You stay here!

501
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,662
We'll go with you.

502
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,329
Then, keep quiet.

503
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,669
Shh.

504
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,838
All's well on this floor.

505
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,939
It's on the top floor.

506
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:24,649
Darn it!

507
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,356
Who is it?

508
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,824
You!

509
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,193
What were you doing?

510
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,297
Ugh!

512
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,735
Augh! Mr. Nagakura!

513
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:48,656
Call an ambulance.

514
00:21:48,657 --> 00:21:49,440
And the police!

515
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,358
Yes. will.

516
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:50,975
Yes, will do.

517
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,211
The culprit is not far yet.

518
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:58,749
Ran!

519
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,285
Oh. there...

520
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,454
Mami! So she was real.

521
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:05,489
Where are you going?

522
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:31,832
I can't believe it.
A ghost attacked Mr. Nagakura!?
