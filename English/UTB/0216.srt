1
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,419
With a strong heart
and power of deduction,

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,355
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

5
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,423
Today is part ll of a true suspense story.

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,292
Get ready for a surprise,
when you find out who the killer is.

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,060
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,896
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,064
no case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan.

13
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:59,518
While we were driving along the coast,
our car broke down

15
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:04,056
and we ended up spending the night
at the villa of a lawyer called Mr. Tachibana.

17
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,626
However, the following day,

18
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,695
right in front of our very eyes,

19
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:15,101
the boat that Mr. Tachibana was
on capsizes and he drowns to death.

22
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,739
It seems to be that
Mr. Tachibana was killed

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,840
nt <<
It seems to be that
Mr Tachibana was killed

29
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,643
1 Z TaD
by a man with the initials 1 .K.
that was also blackmailing him.

34
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,881
It was thought that
the man was Tatsuya Kumada,

36
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,951
a man that Mr. Tachibana had won
an innocent verdict for 5 years ago.

38
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,954
Therefore, we rushed over to his place,

39
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,555
but-what we endedlup seeing was...

40
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,593
Mr. Kumada, we're coming in...

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,801
W-What's going on here?!

42
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,937
The suspect Kumada...

43
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,874
has committed suicide!

44
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:02,281
BAY OF THE REVENGE" PART II

45
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,551
Please back away.

46
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,423
It looks to be he used this chair
to commit suicide

48
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,493
But, this rope is sure tied
in a strange way...

50
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,662
The rope is tied to
the railing of the veranda.

52
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:21,801
Could it be because if it were tied
the ordinary way to the pillar,

54
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,702
his feet would touch the ground?

55
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:32,078
Well, there was a loud noise upstairs.

56
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,014
Like something toppling over

57
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,782
Just once though.

58
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,918
About what time was it?

59
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,687
Maybe a little after 7:00 in the evening...

60
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:47,026
It fits the estimated time of death which
Is thought to be around 6:00 to 7:00pm.

62
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,929
About 7:007

63
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:54,567
Then I'll be of no help,
because I got back at about 7:15 pm.

65
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,302
I see...

66
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,003
But, that's strange...

67
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:02,241
When I got home, I heard
Mr Kumada's washing machine running.

69
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,377
Are you sure about that?

70
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:05,945
Positive.

71
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,180
It sure is strange for one

72
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,416
who is contemplating suicide
to want to wash clothes.

74
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,418
Just as I thought,

75
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,385
this is...

76
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,625
Hey!

77
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,794
What do you think you're doing Look out!

78
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,296
Oh, I'm sorry

79
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,500
Which boat was Mr. Tiachibanasriding inv.

80
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,835
The one to the very right at the end.

81
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,403
I want to go take a look at it.

82
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,641
Hey, hey! Are you investigating
on the case or something?

84
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,078
Yep, I'm a detective.

85
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,781
Well, well, working hard

86
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,951
What is this scratch...

87
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,420
Hey!e-

88
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,688
Did you find something?

89
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,424
Was this scratch always here?

90
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,027
On, Lord, I've seen it now for the first time!

91
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,562
It's still new...

92
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,900
I wonder if Mr. Tachibana or
the police who found the boat did it.

94
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,368
What a bummer...

95
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,437
The boat that was stolen was found,
but the anchor was stolen.

97
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,207
I tell you! Why is all this happening to me?

98
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,675
The anchor?

99
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,210
Yeah,

100
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:14,612
the one that is used to keep the boat
from drifting away while fishing...

102
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:18,083
This type of anchor is thrown into the sea.

103
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:22,588
The one for the big boat over there
was stolen, wire and all.

105
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:23,656
See,

106
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,558
it was the same \ pe as this one here.

107
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,494
It hasn't been found yet?

108
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,497
I was told it wasn't in the boat
that was found this morning,

110
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,566
nor:anywhere in the vicinity neither.

111
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:37,836
On top of that, the anchor for the boat
that was found was also gone

113
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,172
I get the picture!

114
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,215
I'm back!

115
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,382
Oh, hu.

116
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,885
Conan! Where were you?

117
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,822
What are you doing
with Mr. Sakuraba, Ran?

119
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,958
I was cleaning!

120
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,161
And Mr. Sakuraba just came back
after taking Johan for aswalk.

122
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,097
Mr. Sakuraba,

123
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,866
the case about Mr. Kumada 5 years ago...

124
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,368
What kind of a case was it?

125
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,871
I cant tell you because it's confidential.

126
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,743
What a childish thing to say!

127
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,745
M-Ms. Sugimura...

128
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,046
Where were you all this time?

129
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,251
On a trip!
I saw the news and I came right back!

131
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:26,951
I see.

132
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,922
And, is the killer the one called T.K?

133
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,689
Y-Yes

134
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,426
You know about Mr. Tatsuya Kumada?

135
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,263
My, you already know his name?

136
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,699
He used to be an elite working for
a securities company.

138
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,370
But, one of his subordinates, Masahiko
Tsuruta embezzled his client's money.

140
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,605
After this, Tsuruta committed suicide...

141
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,074
However, after Tsuruta's diary was found,

142
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,844
it turned out that Kumada was the one
who had actually embezzled the money.

144
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,314
Kumada was.then arrested for
suspicion of framing a murder.

146
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,853
However, the person living
below Masahiko Tsuruta's room

148
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,757
heard something fall at around 10pm.

149
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,527
But, at that time,
Kumada was at a Karaoke snack shop

151
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,362
gy ~~

152
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,264
His alibi was verified,

153
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,334
and he was released
with no charges pressed against him.

155
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,902
That's...

156
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,771
exactly how it looks this time!

157
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,006
Ms Sugimura,

158
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,575
How is it that you know so much of
the incident that took place 5 years ago,

160
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,744
when it's only been 3 years
since you've entered the company?

162
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,015
I was just checking on who the initials T.K
that were signed on the letters belong to.

164
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,318
I also checked a little
on Mrs.Tachibana too...

166
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,987
I hear that your father committed suicide

167
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,923
because of Tachibana, right,
Mrs Tachibana?

169
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,395
How you must've had a grudge
owards your husband...

171
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,331
So much, as wanting to kill him.

172
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,166
Speak for yourself!

173
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,471
Didn't you use a lot of the money
of the office for personals?

175
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,008
I'll bet you killed my husband
because he found about it, huh?

177
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,676
Don't be ridiculous!!

178
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,085
Well, Doc?

179
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,319
Yeah!

180
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,022
I found out that the address
he was at during the hearing

182
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,657
was in the same prefecture, Chiba.

183
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:18,564
The family of the late Masahiko Tsuruta
include his mother,

185
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,566
Tamiko and his kid brother, Katsuhiko.

186
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,235
His mother and kid brother?

187
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,383
Granny,

188
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:40,486
is there a house around here
where a Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta lives?

190
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,856
Masahiko's house.

191
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,824
See, it's right over there.

192
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,760
There is nobody there, though...

193
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,229
Why not?

194
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:55,701
His mother Tamiko and kid brother
Katsuhiko moved away.

196
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,070
After all, they've been through so much
after what happened...

198
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:03,275
He was such a smart child
who went to a school in Germany, and yet.

201
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,979
The house won't sell
because it's in a place like this

203
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:10,849
It seems that they used to come back
to take care of it on and off...

205
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,219
But, since about a year ago,
nobody's come around at all.

209
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,572
Johann...

211
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,675
I OTC.

212
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,645
So, I finally get the picture!

213
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,920
It seems that sleeping pills
of the same substance

215
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,989
as those found in Mr. Tachibana's body

216
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,025
were also found In Kumada's-body

217
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,994
They were also found in the whisky
Ieft in the bottle.

219
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,799
Therefore, it was concluded that,
after killing Mr. Tachibana,

221
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,569
Kumada committed suicide
by taking sleeping pills.

223
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,370
Ghads!

224
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,339
No way!

225
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:10,275
Comesthis way, this*way.

226
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,245
What's in here?

227
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,949
This file, I wonder what it is?

228
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,152
An account book...

229
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,893
So, the renowned detective
is going to give his famed deduction?

231
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,230
What on earth is there
to deduce at this point?

233
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,567
Well, well, please have a seat everyone.

234
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,204
I will now disclose
the truth of what happened

236
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,040
to Mr. Tachibana
and Mr. Tatsuya Kumada.

238
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:43,509
The truth?

239
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:43,942
The truth?

240
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,476
Hasn't the case been closed?

241
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,414
Are you saying that the conclusion
that we have reached is not correct?

243
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,682
Exactly,

244
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,986
Mr. Tatsuya Kumada was also killed

245
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,755
by the same person
who killed Mr. Tachibana.

247
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,426
And, the killer is here with us!

248
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,397
What on earth are you talking about?!

249
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,634
I will explain it to you right now.

250
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,941
The same sleeping pill was detected

251
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,877
in both the bodies of
Mr. Tachibana and Mr. Kumada.

253
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:24,316
In other words, after putting
Mr. Tachibana to sleep and killing him,

255
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,952
the killer did the same thing to Mr. Kumada.

256
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:29,788
Moreover, he set it up to look as if
Mr. Kumada committed suicide.

258
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,226
Is there anyone who could have been
able to do something likejthat?

260
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,195
There are three people
who could've carried it out.

262
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,164
Ms. Yaeko Kamel,

263
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,133
Mr. Yuichi Sakuraba,

264
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,069
and Mr Tachibana, himself.

265
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,042
But, Yaeko was with us
when the boat capsized!

267
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,976
Which means...

268
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,379
W-Wait a minute please!

269
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,082
I was at the office in Tokyo
at that time too...

271
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,216
No, no!

272
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,053
The problem is not where you were
when the boaticapsized!

274
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,424
Preparations to kill Mr. Tachibana
were made so many hours

276
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,925
in advance and completely finished.

277
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,629
All that had to be done was wait

278
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,332
Ju Awhat do you mean, Mr. Mourn?

279
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,433
I see!

280
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,168
You mean the man that we saw

281
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,205
who was wearing the red baseball cap!

284
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,042
he is the killer.

285
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,448
But that was more than two hours
before the boat capsized.

287
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,752
How on earth did he make the boat sink?

288
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:39,057
All you have to do is think why the killer
committed the crime yesterday.

290
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:43,327
As you already know,
yesterday was spring tide.

292
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,265
Yes, It was spring tide indeed, and
we did have some difficulty in the search.

294
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,967
Can't you figure It out?

295
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:53,171
Spring tide is caused
by a great difference in the water level

297
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,906
between low tide and high tide.

298
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,478
That's why the killer
committed the murder yesterday.

300
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,316
Could you give us more details?

301
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,952
The man wearing the red baseball cap
who we saw,

303
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,755
approached Mr. Tachibana's boat,

304
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:15,527
and pulls the life jacket off
Mr. Tachibana.

306
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,998
Then, he throws the anchor that he had
stolen together with the boat into the sea!

308
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,268
The killer hooks the claw that is tied on

309
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,238
to the end of the rope
onto Mr. Tachibana's boat.

311
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:27,873
If set up this way,

312
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:32,344
when the water level rises because of
high tide, the anchor ls pulled and tilts,

314
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,113
and when the boat capsizes,

315
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,750
the claw comes off and sinks into sea...

316
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:42,154
Mr. Tachibana is thrown into the sea...

317
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,323
and drowns

318
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,926
What a way to commit murder!

319
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:53,198
The boat rental owner did call to say
that his anchor'had been stolen.

321
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,302
That's why the anchor of the boat
that was stolen was missing?

323
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,437
Right,

324
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,241
that anchor has probably
sunk under the sea.

326
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:08,080
They should be searching the area
where the accident occurred today, hey!

328
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,081
Yes sir!

329
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,282
I'll ask the station about it!

330
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,053
But, why would someone do
something so cruel like that?

332
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,490
Everything was done to create an alibi.

333
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,095
The killer went through all this
to create an alibi for himself

335
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,630
during the time the boat was capsizing.

336
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,699
Yes, hello!

337
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,067
Mr. Mourn!

338
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,169
They seem to have found the anchor

339
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,071
right below the area
where the boat capsized!

341
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,875
The boat rental owner just verified
the anchor 'a little while ago.

343
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,113
Moreover,
+ they found a claw on the end of the rope.

345
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,082
Let me continue.

346
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,885
The killer then returned to shore,

347
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,821
and left the cap with Kumada s name
in back of the boat,

349
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,524
so that suspicion would focus on him.

350
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,661
According to the investigation's officers,
that cap was Kumada's!

352
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,999
No hair or anything of any other person
was found on it...

354
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,036
The killer musteve used
a similar type of cap for disguise.

356
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,107
The killer probably got
a hold of Kumada s cap

358
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,110
when they saw each other or something.

359
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,348
The killer and Kumada
must've known each other.

361
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,452
As evidence of that,
the killer went to Kumada's residence,

363
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:25,423
and was able to make him drink whisky
with a sleeping drug in

365
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,394
Then the killer, after standing Kumada's
body up against the sliding door,

367
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,862
wound the rope around his neck.

368
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,899
The rope that was pulled
through the pillar,

370
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,635
was pulled through
the railing of the veranda,

372
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,672
and using this as a point of support,

373
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,974
the killer probably pulled on
the rope with all his might.

375
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,911
The rope was then tied onto the railing of
the veranda and the sliding door opened.

377
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,713
Finally, the killer set the chair in place.

378
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,248
But,

379
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,485
at around 7:00pm when
the person downstairs heard-a- sound,

381
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,154
everyone here has an alibi...

382
00:15:56,522 --> 00:16:00,225
The fact is, the killer does not need
an alibi for that specified time either.

384
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,528
Just what do you mean?!

385
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,497
This is the same trick

386
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:10,502
as the one Mr. Tatsuya Kumada had used
to kill Mr Masahiko Tsuruta 5 years ago.

388
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,704
What was that?!

389
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,408
The washing machine
that was running after 7:00 o'clock!

391
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,346
The killer tied a string around the spinner
in the center of the washing machine

393
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,915
so that it would be wound
as the washing machine operated.

395
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,251
Then a hoop is made
at one end of the string

397
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,553
and hooked onto the back of the chair.

398
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,923
All that is left to do after that is to set
the timer of the washing machine to 7-00.

400
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,128
When the washing machine starts,
the string is wound,

402
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,364
and the chair falls down.

403
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,168
I'll have them check
the washing machine right away!

405
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:48,940
Which means that Mr. Tachibana
was Killed at around 1:00pm.

407
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,645
Kumada's estimated time of death
Is between 6:00pm and 7:00pm

409
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,249
So the person who does not
have an alibi before 7:00pm,

411
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:02,854
that is, around 6:00pm, is the killer.

412
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,490
Let's take you, Mr. Sakuraba,
for example...

414
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,294
You left here around 1:00
and returned after 7:00.

416
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,229
Please wait a minute,

417
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,964
there are many who had a grudge
against Mr. Tachibana!

419
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:17,469
Did you check all those people already?!

420
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,173
Sakuraba, What did you come to pick up
at the office yesterday?

422
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:27,112
Moreover, why was it at about the same time
Mr.Tachibana's boat had just capsized?

425
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,483
Mr. Sakuraba,
did you come to get this account book?

427
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,987
So, that you could make it look

428
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,556
as if Ms. Sugimura used the money?!

429
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,026
Why you!

430
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,360
I, I'm sorry...

431
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,431
I was going to adjust the book
with Mr. Tachibana last night

433
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,400
to set you up and make it

434
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,635
Iook like you spent the money
that he:lavishly used. 7

436
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,572
That's why I was relieved to hear that
Mr. Tachibana had passed away.

438
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,608
Mr. Sakuraba!

439
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,643
Just what do you mean
by you felt "relieved"?

441
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,113
I was sick and tired of assisting
Mr. Tachibana's wrongdoings!

443
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,050
He threatened me saying that
if I didn't do as he said,

445
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,752
he would see to it that I wouldn't be able to
function as a lawyer in the future...

447
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,722
I was read. to break down any minute...

448
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,625
Mr. Sakuraba; well hear
the rest of your story at the station...

450
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,328
No! I didn't kill him!

451
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,331
If you resist,
we'll arrest you right here on the spot!

453
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,166
Please believe me!

454
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,768
I'm not the one
who killed Kumada and Mr. Tachibana,

456
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,903
I'm innocent!

457
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:27,906
That's enough!

458
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,608
Mr. Sakuraba didn't kill anyone...

459
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,379
The one who killed them both...is me!

460
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,082
No!!

461
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,317
Y-Yaeko...

462
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,987
I was waiting for you to confess.

463
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,156
I knew you were not the type of person
who could: frame somebody

465
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,992
and keep silent about it.

466
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:52,364
Yaeko could ve put sleeping pills
in Mr. Tachibana's thermos at any time.

468
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,201
That day, after we all left,

469
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,603
you disguised yourself as Kumada and
Ieft from the back door.

471
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,139
You then
approached Mr. Tachibana's boat.

473
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:08,012
Soon later, you witnessed Mr. Tachibana's
boat capsize together with us

475
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,750
When you went shopping at sundown,
you parked the car in

477
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:15,320
the parking lot of the supermarket,

478
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,158
disguised yourself again, and headed for
Kumada's place.

480
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,694
Isn't that right?

481
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,231
Please take a look at this.

482
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,500
Conanxfound this name.plate in the yard m

483
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:32,737
of Mr. Masahiko Tsuruta's house...

484
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:34,706
Johan?!

485
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,443
Yes, if you read it in German
it's read: Johann.

487
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,747
This name plate ls probably one that
your son brought back

489
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,350
from Germany where
he was an exchange student,

491
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,753
isn=t that- right...Mrs. Tamiko Tsuruta?

492
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,856
What?!

493
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,259
You mean Yaeko is. .?

494
00:19:54,527 --> 00:20:00,231
Yes, the mother of Masahiko Tsuruta
who was killed by Kumada!

496
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,204
I should've realized it sooner...

497
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:11,576
Yesterday, Johan chased the boat
you were riding at the cape .

499
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:17,348
I'm sure that Johan knew it was you
despite your disguise.

501
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,286
My younger son passed away
Iast year too,

503
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,621
so Johan is the only one left for me now.

504
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,192
I lied saying that he was
a stray and he came here to live with us.

506
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,831
I fought with all of my might in
court, and yet no one recognized me.

508
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,570
I aged all of sudden from:thei
inappropriate sentence of the hearing...

510
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,171
And...

511
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,309
Six months ago, Kumada finally appeared.

512
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,979
I happened to hear about
the trick using the washing machine

514
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,714
from the other side of the door...

515
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,617
Kumada was promising Tachibana

516
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:56,087
that he'd pay any amount Tachibana
wanted to handle the case.

518
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,858
Tachibana won
Kumada an innocent verdict

520
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,295
despite knowing that
he had killed Masahiko.

522
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,199
I followed Kumada
back to his apartment that day,

524
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,336
and thought up the idea of killing him
and Tachibana

526
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,005
when I saw the red baseball cap
that he forgot here.

528
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,509
And you started
sending letters of blackmail

530
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,678
that looked to have been mailed
from Kumada to Mr. Tachibana...

532
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,049
I've been so scared since yesterday...

533
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,018
But, I'm really relieved now.

534
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,990
You were expecting to get arrested
to begin with, weren't you?

536
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,593
That's why you went ahead
and committed the crime

538
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,896
despite a detective like me being here...

539
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:43,501
I guess so.
I'm so sorry for all the trouble I caused...

Dad! Now what?!

584

Weird, and I just got it repaired.

585
00:23:31,542 --> 00:23:34,045
When are we ever going
to make it back to Tokyo?!

Please help us!
We just need to get to Tokyo!

589

Maybe more cars will stop
if I take his place?

Hey! Ran!

00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,846
What's wrong!?

Ran!

598
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,483

high school 'girls being hit-and-run...
