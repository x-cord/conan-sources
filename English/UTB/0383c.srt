2
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,598
It is the top of the 4th:inning. the batter for

3
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,001
Ohgane High School Is
number 5 left. Shigeta.

5
00:02:01,977 --> 00:02:02,910
He hit the ball!

6
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:04,045
The left line.

7
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:06,314
(HAN
A Hie caught the bal

11
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:08,683
He caught it! Hescaught it!
Great play!

13
00:02:17,643 --> 00:02:20,094
Hat 3rd is really fantastic!

15
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,394
Ye).

17
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:22,897
NA 77
He sure is.

20
00:02:23,148 --> 00:02:23,531
\ KOHNAN

22
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:33,040
At any rate.let's get with this code!

23
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:37,745
Before the end of the bottom of the 6th
inning we've 'got to locate where

25
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:41,983
this numben47.3, 4 indicates
and find the 2nd cell phone

27
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,219
Before that man wearing the white cap

28
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,089
uses the bombi\to commit suicide!

29
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:52,743
But, these numbers are
hard to figure out again

31
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:55,196
Not really. I've figured out half ofgit!

32
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:56,397
What 2!

33
00:02:56,398 --> 00:03:00,868
Because we figured out
that the first code 96.7.13

35
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:05,206
indicated that the first cell phone
was on the 13th aisle

37
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:08,109
at the edge of the left pole!

38
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:12,912
OT 1S the distance from
the home base to the polo.

40
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:15,483
NO 7 WR ears iii: $01
the number on the back of

42
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,985
the uniform and left of
high sehool baseball.

44
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,921
The final 13 means
the seat on the 13th aisle!

46
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:24,525
Which means that the number 3
in the parenthesis of the numbers 4/.34

48
00:03:24,526 --> 00:03:26,427
the number on back of the uniform

49
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:30,464
and the Inst number 4 means the 4th
aisle of a seat somewhere, right?

52
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:34,635
But we've got to find out
WACO {ne Cone adn 130

57
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:38,472
The first number 41s probably
A Clie Se eos fee Ya 3}!

59
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:42,343
There's no doubt
that it is a seat by t-he 1st base.

61
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:45,880
In"high school baseball
the player with number 3 is at 1st base.

63
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:50,084
But. Heilchan. the (one wefiring
number 3 at Kenan High School is

65
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:52,186
CHI:
3rd base

67
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:55,523

foo. 9
Out!

73
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:00,961
sO you shouldn't be concerncd about him.

74
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:05,032
But, if the guy made «
the code in accordance,

76
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,002
to this final game
between Konan and 'Ohgane

78
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:10,671
ma be the game
would be of some concern. 3

80
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:12,640
@kay. tell you what!'&

81
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:17,144
I'll ggjcheck the 4th aisle
of the infield stand by 1st base.

83
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:18,913
So kiddo go check the 3rd base side!

84
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,081
Okay!

85
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:21,314
What about me?

86
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:24,552
After you get us into the infield stand

88
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:29,023
wait for us at the map of the Koshien
outside that we saw a while ago.

90
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:34,161
That place is right in the center of the
infield stand of the 1st and 3rd base

92
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:38,799
$0 whether I find the cell phone

93
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,171
@kay, while I'm writing I'll call and ask
my superior at Hyogo Prefectural Station,

95
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:49,376
if the company Takano Transport
that was bombed and set on fire

97
00:04:49,577 --> 00:04:52,980
by the guy wearing the white cap
had been hated by someone recently.

99
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,816
Yeah do that will you
Mr. Ohtaki.

102
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:02,123

shows no signs of*weakening atiall
even at the final!

108
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:11,832
K ah!

109
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,100

110
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:15,770
Hey. what's with you, kid.

111
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:19,373
U. Uh

113
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,776
Okay. their really going for it!

114
00:05:21,777 --> 00:05:24,612
Will the 9th player strike out in a row!

115
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:30,050
Fool! Use more balls and slow down
the progress of the game

117
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:35,523
What? Is thatitrue?

N the bottom of the 4th inning.

126

Thanks to the hit of the big slugger
of Konan High School.

128
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,816

How's about it? Did you find it?

I soarched all through the 4th aislo

And?! how about you?

207
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,007
Same here.

209
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,476
I guess we'll just have to decopher

210
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:52,446
the meaning of the figure 47

211
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,983
You know, Heiji

212

that's it!

227
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:19,206
Then, there's no doubt about.

228
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:21,425
The 2nd cell phone is there!!

229
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,277
Huh? Why?

[That's right!

233
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,769
47 is tho atomic number fer gold!!

235
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:34,388
Let-s go outside once

236
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:36,590
and go.in behind the hack-net
and check the seats in the 4th aisle.

238
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:38,325
But. I wonder if we'll make it in time?

239
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:40,894
Tho seats under the Gin san
behind the back net

241
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:42,696
has 100 seats an aisle.

242
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,465
If we -try checking every seat from now

243
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,667
three outs and that's it

245
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:49,169
Then. maybe It's '1st base or 3rd base?

246
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,638
Because there's a "3" under "47"

247
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,005
Fool!

248
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:54,908
You just checked there!

249
00:10:54,909 --> 00:10:57,211
There's got to be something else!

250
00:10:57,212 --> 00:11:00,547
Number 3 on the back of the uniform
that would indicate a seat under Gin-sanl

252
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,451

Another number 3.
On the back-of the uniform

257
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:13,927

Huh? Oh. Hei-chan!

259
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:18,231
Did you figure out the code.?

260
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:19,733
Yeah

261
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:22,269
The first 47 stands for Gin-san,

263
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:26,473
the next 3 in the parenthesis is

264
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,659
The one wearing the number 3
on the back of his uniform

266
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,745
The Ba Bruce monument!

267
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:34,031
Which means that

268
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:36,250
the location of the 2nd cell phone is

269
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:38,619

What's up!

279
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:06,496
The player made 1st base
because the catcher fumbled!

281
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:08,332
But. we've got to hurry!

282
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,783
It's two outs already

283
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:11,084
There's only 1 more out to go!

with a runner on first
base because of a fumble!

It's a foul fly.

306
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,985
But the ball flies
in front of the Konan bench by 1st base

308
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:47,354
The catcher stops going after the ball

309
00:12:47,655 --> 00:12:48,755

Yeah.

According to what my superior told me,.

353
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:13,874
the truck of that company ran over
a person a month age in To « 0,

and it seemed one person died

Maybe that accident has fy
something to do with this?

358
00:14:19,947 --> 00:14:23,950
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with Koshien?

He hung up without saying anything

381
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:07,988
If the guy's saying that he's going to
commit suicide using a bomb,

383
00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:10,073
it'sot surprising that

If he was one to get upset
over something like that

389
00:16:16,063 --> 00:16:18,031
he would've pushed the switch
for the bomb long ago

, andithe stand"somewhere here
would be in badatrouble!

393
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:23,103
There's some kind of meaning to it

394
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:25,338
The blank in this code...

395
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:29,276
It's Indicating some stand. of Koshien here!

396
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:40,587
But. what an odd.guy

398
00:16:41,622 --> 00:16:45,826
wibhe really wants to commit suicide
why would heygive out complicated clues

400
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:49,129
and make people look for where he is?

401
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:52,365
Maybe he wants somebody to stop him?

402
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:53,967
Huh?

403
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:56,536
I'm sure that

404
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:59,623
person's hoping deep down
in his heart that somebody will stop him

406
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:01,708
An dimaybe
he doesn't even realize it himself

408
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:03,577
He wants somebody to stop him?

409
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:07,647
Because the code that he thought up

410
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:12,519
cannot be made unless he's
interested in Koeshien or baseball

412
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:17,190
It's hard to believe that such a person

413
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:19,893
would want to do something like that
at Koshien

415
00:17:19,894 --> 00:17:22,729
much less use a bomb to commit suicide,
night?

417
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,598
I guess so.

418
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,933
Then. Mr. Ohtaki

419
00:17:26,934 --> 00:17:28,068

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,337
Please call the Hyogo Prefect-urea! police
once more

422
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:33,073
and ask them for more
detailed information

424
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:35,742
about the traffic accident a month ago

425
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,143
that Takano Transport. the company.

426
00:17:37,144 --> 00:17:39,145
The man set fire
with a bomb to was involved in?

428
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:41,047
Also want to know
what the motive of a baseball fan

430
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:44,117
who would do something
Iike this at Koshien is too

432
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:46,152
Okay

433
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:47,854
Then, shall we

434
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:49,923
think about this code

435
00:17:49,924 --> 00:17:52,125
and look through
the seats ih the 13th row?

437
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:55,095
Just look at each and every seat

438
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:56,463

when the bottom of the 9th inning ends.

a bottom of the 9th inning or not though.

00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:04,704

00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:07,140
Unless Ohgane.who Is
batting first, catches up

446
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:08,775
or wins the-score

447
00:18:08,776 --> 00:18:10,911
the top of the 9th inning
will be the end of the game.

451
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,127
The pitcher gets into set position

452
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:30,430
Aaagh. he 3rd runner has dashed off!

453
00:18:30,498 --> 00:18:31,998
It's a squeeze!

454
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:36,836
It's a short fly in front of the pitchor

455
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:37,437
It's: a short fly in front of tho pitcher

456
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,745
H He caught the ball!
He caught it!

458
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:48,081
It's a direct catch by the 3rd!

The ball goes to 3rd base
and it-s~a double play!

463
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:54,854
Home base is far-foriOhgane High School!

464
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:57,057
It's the top off the 8th inning and
though they've-establish opportunities.

466
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,191
They haven't scored a point yet!

467
00:19:01,095 --> 00:19:03,897
The score is still 0-1.
It is the bottom of the 8th inning

469
00:19:03,898 --> 00:19:06,031
and Konan High School will be batting...

471
00:19:07,835 --> 00:19:08,969
Yes.

472
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:10,937
Huh?!

473
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:12,439
Huh?!

474
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,940

Oh. here it is.

I'm sure that you would know
since you like high school baseball. right?

489
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,168
The name Hiroshi Torimitsu.

491

In the first game
during the spring selection .

493
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,775
The left hander of

along with Ohgane's ace.

No, it:s nowhere

527
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:39,352
It seems that it's nowhere in the seats

537
00:21:51,532 --> 00:21:54,501
See! There's a player with no number
on the bk of his unitormaneat the bench

539
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:57,937
Huh? Yeah

540
00:21:57,938 --> 00:21:59,556
the ball boy. right?

541
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:00,774
I thought so too

542
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:04,477
I checked the seats on the 18th aisle
behind both benches.

544
00:22:04,478 --> 00:22:05,845
But found nothing.

545
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:10,884
