Mr. Mouri, what good timing.

35
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:29,569
Huh?!

H.Hold it. one at a time please.

41
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,847
I have this uncomfortable premonition...

Spicy. Bitter and Sweet Flavor

43
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:52,358
So. what you're saying is...

44
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:57,597
Etsuko, you saw a man coming running out
of room 105 on the first floor of this condo

46
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,368
The time this happened was
about 2 hours ago at 9:00 in the morning

48
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:06,539
And... Officer Kinoshita, you came here
after Etsuko reported this to You

50
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:07,874
Yas, sir

51
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:12,312
Then you found the corpse of Ms. Fumie
Ozawa. the woman renting this room,

53
00:03:12,645 --> 00:03:15,114
and concluded that she committed suicide.

54
00:03:18,636 --> 00:03:22,488
Listen. I saw the scene with my very eyes.

55
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,358
There was a suicide note
and the room was net messed up...

00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,476
Come. come...

67
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,346
and is there a possibility
that it was made to look like suicide?

69
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:52,085
I had the medical examiner come over
and investigate. just in case but...

71
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,087
Judging from t-he degree of-postmortem
rigidity.

00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:58,558
The estimated time of death«issthought to be
between 6:00 to 8:00 last.night.

75
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,895
If the man she says,she witnessed
committed the crime.

77
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:06,799
He would've had to stay withethe dead body

00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:05,290
with her body leaning against the wall
and sitting down.

106
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,961
What a strange place to choose
to commit suicide. though...

108

that she had embezzled more than
30.000.000 yen of company money,

133
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:12,125
It,seems, that this will be concluded
as suicide ust as Officer Kinoshita sa s.

135
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,893
Please look at the calendar!

136
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,395
She's got a dentist appointment!

137
00:06:17,097 --> 00:06:18,463
C.Calendar?

138
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:26,639
Its true that she has a dentist appointment
written for today.

140
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,109
You sure have good eyes. Etsuko...

141
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,495
You mean you can see
what's written from there .

143
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,481
Y.Yes: .well, sort of.

144
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:39,018
A calculated suicide
to the point of getting a wire ready

146
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:42,487
Would such a person make
a dentist appointment for today...?

148
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:44,157
Wait a sec.!!

150
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:47,826
Officer Kinoshita!
This may possibly not be a case of suicide!

153
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:52,365
So was she killed after all
by the man in that picture!!

155
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,168
No. I can't really answt hat,yet .

157
00:06:55,536 --> 00:07:00,973
Officer Kinoshita, was this roo locked or
unlocked when you came here?

159
00:07:00,974 --> 00:07:03,743
Yes sir: the door was not locked...

160
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:07,379
Which 'means she committed suicide
without locking the door

162
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,447
Rather,

163
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:12,819
a person.who commits suicide would
probably be.reluctant to be found in the act

165
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,822
The picture that was found atsthe front
entrance-was peeled of! from here.

167
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:17,089

Pops. I wonder what this is?

176
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:33,239
There's some kind of white powder here

177
00:07:41,498 --> 00:07:42,582
Ouch

179
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:57,930
It has no smell and is dry...

180
00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:00,700

187
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,752
Inspector, the money that Ms Orawa
was in charge of at her company

189
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,888
a sum of about 30.000.000 yen Is missing

190
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:25,324
Her superior Mr. Shimizu is off teday.

191
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:29,262
Which means he doesn't know
that Ms. Ozawa committed suicide.

193
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:33,532
And, we've also come up with'something
unexpected.

196
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:38,303
This man who isVleading the cooler box is
where she sent her mail to.

199
00:08:38,304 --> 00:08:40,039
He's her superior Mr... Shimizu.

200
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,008
You mean her superior was going with her?

202
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:44,176
Nobody in the company
seems to have known

204
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,779
that they were going witif*each other.

205
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:48,147
Moreover.

206
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:52,718
It seems that this man Shimizu liked
gambling and invested a lot of money into it.

208
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,688
Inspector, sounds fishy. don't you think?

209
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,291
Excuse me. Inspector.

210
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:01,928

00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,836
and excuse me for being rude,
but who are you...?

219
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:12,838
Please get out of the way
and don't interfere.

223
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:18,110

00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:28,754
Getting right down to business

226
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:30,723

Weren't you going with Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

239
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:46,572
If so, it would seem natural that she would
discuss the matter with\ ou...

269
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,592
So at about 9-00 this morning.

272
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:42,995
I was at the airport in order to board
the plane headed for Haneda.

274
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:45,031
This is the cut half of the plane ticket.

275
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:52,471
Then, where were you last night
from 6:00 to 8:00?

278
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,774
was In the midst of the class reunion

279
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,709
This is the name card
of the person in charge.

281
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:58,978
Please let me have it for a while .

282
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:00,346
Oh...sure.

283
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,414
Go check on It!

284
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:02,448
Yes: sir!

285
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,350
Mr. Shimizu has an alibi.

286
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:07,987
But, Etsuko insists
that she dfihltely saw him...

288
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,022
If this Is not a suicide case...

291
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,260
[4 [4

293
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:32,745
How was it?

294
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:35,380
Wasn't what that man said<an outright lie!

295
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,851
It was just as Mr Shimizu had said.

296
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:42,688
I confirmed with the chairman of the class
reunion as well as the airline company.

299
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:48,961
Etsuko probably nustook someone else
to be Mr. Shimizu

301
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:50,663
But Etsuko has good eyes. doesn't she?

302
00:11:50,664 --> 00:11:54,400
Because she was able to see the words
on the calendar from far away. right?

304
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:58,337
Then, are you saying that she wanted toe
sct Mr. Shimizu as the killer?

306
00:11:58,338 --> 00:11:59,638
For what?

307
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,341
It's totally Greek to me...

308
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:04,777
Where's Officer Horita?

309
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:07,779
He is questioning a courier at the entrance
of the condo

311
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,548
because the courier seems to have seen
something...

313
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:13,085
SiffOe my alibi's been established.

314
00:12:13,086 --> 00:12:15,421
I guess I'll get heading home then.

315
00:12:19,392 --> 00:12:20,126
No you don't!

316
00:12:20,127 --> 00:12:20,593
No you don't!

317
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:23,662
Don't let him go! He is a killer!

318
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:25,197
Etsuko...

319
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:26,866
What a woman

320
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:29,668
Do you have a grudge
against me or something

322
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:32,471
Do you have proof that I'm the killer?

324
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:37,576
I knew her since she was a little child.

325
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:42,281
She thought of me as~her mother...
and told me everything about herself.

327
00:12:42,282 --> 00:12:44,582
She told me that she was going with
a person called Shimizu.

329
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,553
She also confessed to me that she
embezzled money from the company

332
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:50,656
Under his orders.

333
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:52,825
What a thing to say.

334
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:55,995
It's ticklish...

335
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:57,630
Stop It

336
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:04,336
It was «On vibrator,
0 gosh that was ticklish...

338
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:06,238
Yes. this is Mourl.

339
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,707
The thing that medical examiner asked for?

340
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,745
She has no bad teeth?
You mean Ms. Fumie Ozawa?

342
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,414
But. she had a dentist appointment.

343
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,717
Oh. no. thank you very much.

344
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,754
Nothing is wrong with her teeth,
and et she had a dentist appointment...?

348
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:28,994
I don't want to be a bother, but I don't think
this is Ms. Ozawars writing on the calendar.

350
00:13:29,462 --> 00:13:33,799
Since I'm her superior,
I used to see her writing all the time...

352
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:38,337
WO GAR FY OF YO
until we get it evaluated but,

354
00:13:38,655 --> 00:13:40,322
it does look different

356
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:43,526
Thon who wroto in tho calendar?

360
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:49,615
From what I hear, this woman here is
the one who first found the body?

362
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:51,917
I see, VI understand now.

363
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,354
It's not unusual for the first person
to find the body is the killer.

366
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:59,457
Well, it's too bad that Etsuko is the killer .

367
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,427
Just what do you mean. Mr. Mouri?

368
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:05,364
Etsuko wanted to set Mr. Shimizu up
as the killer.

370
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:09,668
'What's why she set it up so that it looked to
be as if Fumie had a dentist appointment.

372
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:12,137
She also peeled the picture from the album

373
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:14,505
and put the picture at the front entrance
for all to see

375
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:18,409
Etsuko, just in case, could you write
the word dentist for me. please?

377
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:22,765
It's that woman over there,
but are you sure?

379
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:25,100
Yes. I am.

380
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:27,119
She hid it here.

381
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:35,127
Inspector!

382
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,012
What is this?)

383
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:40,366
What?

384
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:47,673
Etsuko, you came into this room a little
after 9:00 this morning today. didn't you?

386
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,091
NEKO

387
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:53,946
The driver of a courier saw
you come out of this room.

389
00:14:54,281 --> 00:14:58,617
Moreover, you seemed to be in a rush
and bumped into him

391
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:04,423
here's 5.000.000 yen here.

392
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:06,725
Can you explain
where this money came from

394
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:11,030
and why you hid it in the gas meter box

395
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:14,967
I-brought the money from my house.

396
00:15:15,302 --> 00:15:20,372
I hid it becauserwhen I went to report
Fumie's death to the police

398
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,642
I'didn't want to drop it just in case...

399
00:15:23,977 --> 00:15:27,046
You've come-mm 'this mom after all!

400
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:28,480
No. I haven't!

401
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:32,384
You killed Ozawa yourself
and tried to set me up as the killer.

403
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:34,119
Just what do you think you're saying!

404
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,523
Mr Mouri please don't hsten to
what this man as saying!

406
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:40,192
Well. what a predicament...

407
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:43,729
It's a lie. One of the two Is'lying.

408
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:46,465
Etsuko or Mr. Shimizu,
which of them is the killer.

410
00:15:52,072 --> 00:15:53,305
What's this?

411
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,975
The scale of a fish?
Why would something-like this be here...

413
00:15:58,311 --> 00:15:59,345
Maybe...

414
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,115
,see...So. that's the story

415
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,326
I did write-it

416
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:17,229
and I am the oné~
who put the picture there too.

418
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,998
Was it to put the blame of the crime
on Mr. Shimizu?

420
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,917
No. that's not it.

421
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:24,703
I did it to have Mr. Shimizu
who is the killer arrested.

423
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:27,573
Ihtaame to this». room thiswmornlng.

424
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:31,143
I was going to accompany Fume who sad
she'was going to turn herself into the'ipolice

426
00:16:31,144 --> 00:16:33,545
I brought money along with me

427
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:37,416
thinking that returning some money
would make what she did a bit lighter.

429
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:45,240
I just knew
that Mr. Shimizu was responsible

431
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,860
for the way I found Fumie.

433
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:51,597
She told me that she was goingito confess
everything to the police.

435
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:56,802
But there is 'nothing in this room
that hints that Mr Shimizu didsanything.

437
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:59,271
ADORE Liki JON) OUR & = OsinO
in the front entrance

439
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:01,807
and schemed writing
what you did-on the calendar.

441
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:04,543
The killer is Mr Shimizu!

442
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:10,115
But. Etsuko that's your side of the story

443
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:12,951
ind we 'can't believe it completely.

444
00:17:12,952 --> 00:17:15,387
After all. Mr. Shimizu does have an alibi...

445
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:19,925
We'd like to know where you got
such a sum as 5.000000 en too

447
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:22,127
so would you please come to the police?

448
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:29,001
Mr. Mouri. thank you for waiting

449
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:31,503
This is Mr. Inoue,
who works at the ice making shop.

451
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:34,306
Ice making shop? What's this about?

452
00:17:34,307 --> 00:17:38,777
Just as ou had assumed...
Ice had bee, bought.

454
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:44,349
Officer Sato and Horita, take her to
the police and hear her out, will you.

456
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,416
Yes. sir.

457
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:02,233
Inspector. please wait.

458
00:18:02,234 --> 00:18:03,902
Hmm?! What is it...

459
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,905
Oh! Mr. Mout! Did it start!

460
00:18:06,906 --> 00:18:10,275
Let that person go right away.

461
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:14,746
The one who needs to go to the police is
you. Mr. Shimizu!

463
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:16,949
Why do I have 10 go to the police!

464
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:20,618
Mr. Inoue. when did he come to buy ice?

465
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,254
Yesterday afternoon.

466
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:26,191
He came to buy four blocks of ice
totaling 15 kilograms.

468
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:29,495
I remember him because he brouc ht
a large cooler box along with him.

470
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,231
That's it. At this time of ear.

471
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:35,701
How long does it take force to melt
and disappear?

473
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:38,837
At normal room temperature,
about half a day.

475
00:18:38,838 --> 00:18:41,440
Thank you for taking time out to come here

476
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:44,376
Oh...no problem...

477
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:46,812
Thank you very much...

478
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:49,882
Officer Sato.

479
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:53,519
There are fish scales under the lid
for the bathtub

481
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,021
Take of the wire and come this way

482
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:58,022
Fish scales In the bathroom?

483
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:02,227
Mr. Shimizu. yesterday afternoon

484
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:05,130
you probablyfput:Ms. Ozawa to sleep
using sleeping pills

486
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:07,466
Then. you carried her into the bath tub

487
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:13,204
You made her sit on the bench you made
using ice and the lid of the bath tub and left.

489
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:17,242
As the ice melts the bench lowers
and chokes her neck.

491
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:20,612
At the estima ed time of her death
between 6:00p.m. to 8.00 p Mm.

493
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,214
Half the Ice would've melted

494
00:19:22,215 --> 00:19:25,517
And. this morning. when Etsuko found her,

495
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:29,021
the ice had melted
and the floor of the bath tub was dry

497
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:33,325
It may have been stuck to the cooler box
that you loaded the ice with.

500
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:36,662
A fish scale was on the lid of the box.

501
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:40,832
D.Does that serve as proof that I killed her!

502
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:45,771
Listen, Ms. Osawa sent me mail at 5:45
In the evening.

504
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:50,976
How can a person who is asleep with wire
around her neck do Mmcthing like that?

506
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:56,014
Conan, will you put Ms. Ozawa's cell phone
in the open space of the book shelf?

508
00:19:56,015 --> 00:19:58,517
Stick about half of it out though

509
00:19:58,518 --> 00:19:59,084
Okay

510
00:19:59,252 --> 00:19:59,885
Oka .

511
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,529
The cell phone is on manner mode.

512
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,031
Officer Sato, please call
Ms. Ozawa's cell phone...

515
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:15,400
Oh... es sir!

517
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,814
If you look at the history of incoming calls.

518
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:32,551
You will notice that she received a call
a little before 5:45.

520
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:36,788
No. but I didn't do it. I was in Hiroshima...

521
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,191
You sure are obstinate!

522
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,295
Officer Sato, please look at the place
where the wire is tied.

524
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:46,665
You'll see hair stuck to it.

525
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:50,168
Don't you see hair other than
Ms.Ozawa s hair that is dyed?

527
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:52,337
There is

528
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,839
Something that looks like
straight black hair...

530
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,810
Mr. Shimizu. when you carried Ms. O- awa

531
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:02,414
your hair got tangled with Ms. Ozawa's hair.

532
00:21:02,415 --> 00:21:04,483
However, you did not realize it.

533
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:07,886
Mr Shimizu, it will be obvious once
we get it evaluated by the forensic officers.

535
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:09,154
Whose hair it is

536
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:15,127
I'm sorry.

537
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:18,397
She said that she couldn't continue
any longer.

539
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:20,832
And that she would turn herself
in to the police so .

541
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,200
That's why I

542
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,777
You drank a lot of sweet honey.

543
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:35,814
So from now you're going to have to drink
a lot of bitterness.
