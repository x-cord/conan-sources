suddenly decide to come driving?

because it's horse racing
season right now...

I wonder if you'll be able to
see any horses you know?

I made a lot of money off her in the past.
How nostalgic.

Thank you for all the cash
you brought in back then.

Gee, you don't look too well

158

161

The racing stable over there
is used for bringing up colts.

A blacksmith, you know,
a professional at making horseshoe

200
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,877
Horses that live along with human beings
go through rigorous exercise.

202
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,746
Therefore, their hooves get scraped

203
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,748
That's why they need horseshoes.

204
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:28,287
But, with the horsesho
their hooves stay OK.

206
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:33,158
Therefore, they periodically
ake off the horseshoe...

208
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,895
And shave off the outgrown hoof.

209
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,098
Then, in order to match
the hoof that has been shaved,

211
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,233
a new horseshoe
is put in place of the old one.

213
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,304
Ha, ha, ha, you sure
are knowledgeable, sir.

215
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,338
Ms. Takeuchi is
not going to have anything to do.

217
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,675
Oh no, it's just that
I've heard a little about it before...

219
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,611
The new horseshoe is heated in flames,

221
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,081
then shaped to match
the hoof of the horse.

223
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,623
The hooves of horses
are all shaped differently.

225
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,360
That goes all four
hooves of one horse too!

227
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,697

00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,535

He's bleeding from his head,

251
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,875
which means, he may have been
kicked by Madame Leap.

253
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,211
OO. Oh no!

254
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,812

00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:43,222
Please tie Madame Leap
to the wash place or something!

266
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,885
The shape of
the horseshoe doesn't match...

268
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:18,957
Why would Mr: Sugiyama
do something terrible like this?

270
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,994
But, wait a sec...-maybe...

Maybe giving her something
to drink will help.

277
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,875
Hey, Ran there was tea left in
the thermos bottle, wasn't there?

279
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,277
No, not tea!

280
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,144
Huh?

281
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,147
Although tea does
not affect humans much,

283
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,882
it is a very strong stimulant for horses!

284
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,018
Tea is a stimulant...?!

285
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:51,356
Maybe this Is not an accident...!!

286
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,395
There's no doubt about it.

287
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,665
He was kicked by the horse.

288
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:00,466
See!

289
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,801
The traces of him being kicked

290
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,670
the mark of the horseshoe
is left right here.

292
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,138
But, just to be safe,

293
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,005
I think it would be better to double check

294
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,409
whether the horseshoe
matches that of the horse...

296
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,143
Hmm?

297
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,553
Excuse me, but
may I have your name please?

299
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,255
Oh, pardon me...

00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,058

00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:29,862

Huh?! You mean that famous...?!

303
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,534
Please excuse me for my rudeness.

304
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,670
But, since this is an accident,

305
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,005
I guess your deductions
won't be necessary...

307
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,207
I guess so.

308
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,278
By the way, what is going to
become of Madame Leap?

310
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,481
Well...

311
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,152
If it is a violent horse maybe
it would be better to get rid of it...

313
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,488
OO. Oh no!!!

314
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,290
Mr. Sugiyama's to blame!

315
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,625
He deserved to die!!!

316
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,425
Sanae?!

317
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:04,363
You mean, you don't like Mm Sugiyama?

318
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,230
Huh .

319
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,401
What do you mean
by he deserved to die?

321
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,273
Uh, Mr. Mourn, let me explain...

322
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,677
It was when I went out
to town to buy some things last night...

324
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,016
Huh? ..That car

325
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,018
Isn't that Mr. Sugiyama's car?

326
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,887
Hey he's?!

327
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,226
Sugiyama was meeting Mochizuki
who was trying to buy up this ranch.

329
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,598
Okusu is still wrapped up in making colts.

330
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,868
Oh-That's nice to know,

331
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:47,739
and I hope he fails again If he does,
this time for sure he'll go bankrupt

333
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,409
Which means you're
going to do that again?

335
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,744
Yeah! I'm counting on you, Sugiyama

336
00:11:55,114 --> 00:12:00,485
Sugiyama was betraying Mr. Okusu,
the one who saved him, for money!

338
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,689
Sugiyama came along,

339
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,892
before we had a chance
to tell Mr Okusu about it...

341
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,605
In other words,

342
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,674
Mr. Sugiyama, through orders of
Mr Mochizuki was obstructing

344
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,544
the horse rom becoming pregnant

345
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,014
so that the ranch
would fall into a financial rut.

347
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,282
Right.

348
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,685
Producing horses cost
an enormous amount of money...!

350
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:39,024
If a horse as unable to have colts,
that itself is a great loss!

352
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,560
Which means that Madame Leap

353
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,896
got messed up in the ugly
dispute between humans...

355
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,965
How errible!

356
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,702
But, I wonder if that would
make the horse take revenge?

358
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,839
Because if it did, it would be the same

359
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,707
as the humans
who are doing those things!

361
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,145
That horse looks sad,
ut has nice eyes...

363
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,880
Hey! You stay out of this, kid!

364
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm sorry

365
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:06,952
Conan!!

366
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,221
1.I'm sorry.

367
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,889
It's okay.

368
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,026
Huhv. Your pants are wet.

369
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:18,630
Oh, I was cleaning the stalls
and splashed water on myself.

371
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,699
I'm sorry, did I get you wet?

372
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,769
Nope, I'm okay.

373
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,742
I'm pretty sure that this case will be
processed as an accident...

375
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,476
Thank you so much.

376
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,212
Um, officer,

377
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,882
don't you have to take the horseshoe that
Is the murder weapon with you?

379
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,883
Huh?

380
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,752
Isn't the evidence going to be collected
and taken to the police station?

382
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,154
Yeah... but...

383
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,091
If the horseshoe needs to be
removed I'll do it now

385
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,562
I used to do all the works
in the past too, you know...

387
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,764
Back then, I hadino money
to hire a specialist so

389
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:57,369
I still don't...
I guess I'm in the samfiboat even now...

391
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,704
Iease put it in this bag...

392
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,640
Okay, I've removed it...

393
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,142
Okay, everything s done

394
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,744
Good girl, for sticking it-out...

395
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:10,415
Huh. there's blood
on the back of this horseshoe too!

397
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,483
Huh?

398
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,618
He's right!

399
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,487
There's a lot of blood smeared on it...

400
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,022
That's strange...

401
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,424
Just as If thought...

402
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,893
I've figured eve "thing out now!

403
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,296
The killer as well as
how the crime was committed!

405
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,833
No matter how strong
the horse isgit's:difficult for

407
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:31,436
blood to find its way
all the way behind the horseshoe...

409
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,806
If so, there is only
one possible answer...

411
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,409
Blood was smeared
onto the horseshoe beforehand?!

413
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:38,944
Most likely,

414
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,078
what happened then was...!

415
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,680
Oh, but wait

416
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,282
that's Madame Leap's blood.

417
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:45,417
Huh?

418
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,152
See take a look.

419
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,424
The nail's been hammered in sloppily
that the veins have been damaged.

421
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:57,229
I tell you, that Sugiyama
just did a really sloppy job.

423
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:58,964
With a job like that done on it,

424
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,165
it's not surprising
that the horse go wild...

426
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,666
gn runydri

427
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,801
gh...Funyah

428
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,735
Dad?

429
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,339
MM. Mr Mourn,

430
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,607
IS anything wrong?

431
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:13,879
No, it's just that
I've figured out who killed Mr. Sugiyama.

433
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,347
Huh?!

434
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,749
But, I thought this was an accident...?

435
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,752
No, it is none other than homicide!

436
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,622
Conan, show everyone
the you know what!

438
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,023
Es, sir!

439
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:26,892
Here it is.

440
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,896
This is what I picked up
at that wash place

442
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,399
This is chocolate.

443
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,803
But, what about this...?

444
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,273
If tea is a stimulant to horses,

445
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,742
wouldn't chocolate do the same?

446
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,744
E, Exactly,

447
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:50,348
a substance called
the obromine is in chocolate.

449
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:55,687
There is someone
who gave chocolate to Madame Leap!

451
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,689
No way! Who could've
done something so terrible!

453
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,491
Mr. Okusu,

454
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,093
what did you do with the chocolate

455
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,229
that you offered Conan
at the front desk a while ago?

457
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,065
Huh? Oh, that, well...

458
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,202
I left it back in my office

459
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,536
If ll remember correctly,

460
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,673
I think you put it away
In your pocket back then?

462
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,212
D.Don't tell me that Mr. Okusu

463
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,348
used chocolate
to excite Madame Leap...

465
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,684
But, how can we tell

466
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,018
whether Madame Leap
ate the chocolate or not...

468
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,955
A simple urine test would do.

469
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,489
Besides,

470
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,826
if the chocolate is
checked for fingerprints

472
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,662
we can even conclude
who gave it to the horse!

474
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,331
There is no need for that.

475
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,135
I gave Madame Leap the chocolate!

476
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,738
O,Oh, no?!...

477
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,007
Why?!

478
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,543
Why did you do such a thing?!

479
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:54,479
Although I understand
that you may have hated Mr. Sugiyama,

481
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,616
how could you even think of
making Madame Leap kill Mr. Sugiyama...

483
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,551
Hold it, Sanae,

484
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,156
Madame Leap is not the one
who killed Mr. Sugiyama

486
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,693
The one who killed Mr. Sugiyama is

487
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,429
the one who put a horseshoe

488
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,832
that did not fit
onto the right hind hoof of Madame Leap!

490
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,367
What?!

491
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,703
Which means that Mr Sugiyama
wasn't the one who put it on?

493
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,372
Of course not!

494
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,974
If'a professional is
to do an amateurish job like that,

496
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:28,747
even if it's to get on someone's nerves,
he would lose his job on the spot!

498
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,081
And besides,

499
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,185
the blood that was smeared on the back
of the horseshoe was Mr. Sugiyama's.

501
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:39,858
The killer probably struck the back of his
head with a brand new horseshoe!

503
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,793
Then,

504
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,130
not knowing what to do
with the blood smeared horseshoe,

506
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:50,001
the killer hurriedly
put it on Madame Leap...

508
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,204
You would never do
a sloppy job like that

510
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,942
no matter how much of
a rush you were in, right, Mr. Okusu?!

512
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,912
Could it have,been
the guy called Mochizuki,

514
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,847
who maybe got:into
a dispute-with Stigiyama...?

516
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,051
That is unthinkable,

517
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:10,121
because it would be much easier for him
to take the evidence along with him

519
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,557
and walk out of here
before he is witnessed by anyone,

521
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,893
than to go out of his way
to make it look like an accident.

523
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,430
Besides,.if he had planned
the murder.beforehand,

525
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,433
he would have planned
everything out more carefully.

527
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,569
Then, who did it...7?

528
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,238
Just as Sanae had pointed out,

529
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,041
Mr. Okusu would
never do such a sloppy job.

531
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,645
But, judging from the fact

532
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,781
that he wanted to remove
the horseshoe as soon as possible

534
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:41,118
he must've known about the
abnormal horseshoe at an early stage.

536
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,320
In order words,

537
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:46,925
he figured out somehow from the
situation at the scene, who the killer was,

539
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,461
and in order to protect the killer,

540
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,930
gave Madame Leap the chocolate.

541
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,932
Then, went back to the main house

542
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,801
and waited for
Madame Leap to go berserk

544
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,806
He wanted us,
the guests, to hear the commotion.

546
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,677
A person that Mr. Okusu
would want to protect

548
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,346
enough to even risk giving chocolate
to beloved Madame Leap

550
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:12,150
Sanae was with us all the way,

551
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,219
so she couldn't have
committed the murder...

553
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,255
So, that leaves us
with no other choice than you...

555
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,526
Mr. Ninomiya!

556
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,128
Well?!

557
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,562
No!!

558
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:27,298
Your slacks seems to have been wet,

559
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,036
but, maybe if we check
Iuminol reaction will appear?

561
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,172
Becausea'ou struggled to
fit the blood smeared horseshoe,

563
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,041
that was the murder weapon,

564
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,911
onto the hoof of the horse,

565
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,714
despite it still not being shaped
to fit the hoof of the horse yet.

567
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:49,154
Getting soiled by dirt happens
everyday on the ranch, but...

569
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:55,093
if it's the blood of the victim,
you'd have to wash it off, wouldn't you?

571
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,597
I didn't mean to kill him...

572
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,801
I really didn't mean to...

573
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,438
But, I just couldn't forgive him!

574
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,641
Not being able to bear it,

575
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,710
I pressed Sugiyama for an answer
as to what we saw last night...

577
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,914
Then, he said that he would kill me.

578
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,150
He insisted that he could simply make it
Iook like the horse had an accident.

580
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,618
Then, he snickered.

581
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,556
While we were struggling...

582
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,695
Sugiyama died...

583
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,935
No matter if I was not myself
when everything happened,

585
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,070
it is a fact that I tried
to put the blame on Madame Leap...

587
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:45,276
And I'm the very one
who should know more than anyone else

589
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,278
how despising it is
to put the blame on-a-horse...

591
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,584
Mr. Okusu...

592
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,954
I'm sorry...1...Il...

593
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,057
I'm the one
who needs to apologize to you.

595
00:20:59,458 --> 00:20:59,991
Huh?

596
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,328
I sort of had an idea

597
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,563
as to what Sugiyama was doing.

598
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,031
I kept it from you
because I thought that

600
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,668
if I let word out of it to you,
who has a strong sense of justice,

602
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,604
the problem would be
blown out of proportion.

604
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,439
I should have told you about it somehow,

605
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,674
if things were going to turn out this way...

606
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,445
I'm so sorry, Ninomiya...

607
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,954
Mr Ninomiya...Mr. Okusu...

608
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,791
Every person is responsible
for compensating

610
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,127
for the crimes that he has committed...

611
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:38,762
No matter how much
you protect the culprit

613
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:41,666
or try to cover up
the crime that has been committed,

615
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,402
doing so is not a solution
to thegproblem at all...

617
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:46,804
And, it doesn't matter

618
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,841
what reasons may have existed
for committing the crime.

Go for it!

665
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,971
The black and green caps!

666
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,006
Cheer them on!

667
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,108
Go for it! 2~6!!

673
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,914
Will you lend me this picture, gramps!

674
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,449
I promise I'll give it back to you!!

675
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:13,518
In other words...

676
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,853
If I can figure outiwhere this is,

677
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:18,856
I would be able to locate
the place Akio is being confined...

679
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,093
What's up, Ayumi?
