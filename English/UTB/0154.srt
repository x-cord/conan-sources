1
00:00:00,801 --> 00:00:02,835
Inspiration flashes
piercing through to the truth

3
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,237
Once he gets going,
nothing can stop him.

5
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,706
Summer vacation's just started,

6
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:08,641
what kind
of boyfriend will Sonoko catch?

8
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,710
The one and only truth is
brought into the light.

10
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,678
He looks like a child
but he's got the IQ of an adult.

12
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,281
His name is...
Detective Conan

14
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,175
The three of us
went to Izu to do ome swimming,

16
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,509
The three of us
went to Izu to do some swimming,

18
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,479
Ran and=*I¥sare witness to a
strange summer event!

20
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,914
Can you believe it!

21
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,084
Sonoko gets herself a boyfriend,
his name is Masahiko Michiwaki!!

23
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,019
But,

24
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,587
while she's in seventh heaven

25
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,490
waiting for him to
pick her up for their dinner date,

27
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,159
someone attacks her!!

28
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:16,202
Is it my imagination
or are we being watched...?

30
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:21,440
What bothers me is that
man with the glasses, which Ran saw.

32
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,177
And the man
who attacked Sonoko.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,813
Is he really...

35
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,616
just an burgular?

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,256
SONOKO'S DANGEROUS SUMMER PART 2

37
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:52,638
There it is!

38
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,576
What a lovely restaurant!

39
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,813
But it doesn't seem that popular...

40
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,249
Maybe:we*tgotihere toorearly?.

41
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,484
Hmmmmm

42
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,987
Are you sure you
aren't coming Sonoko?

44
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,622
Go on!

45
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,125
I couldn't
sleep last night,

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,061
thinking about that
man ;kept me awake.

49
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,328
I'll rest in here.

50
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,265
Oh alright'. Abut-what a waste...

51
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:25,771
There're drinks In this
cooler box, so help yourself.

53
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,807
Thank you so much!

54
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:30,443
We'll see you later Sonoko.

55
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,378
Have a nice time.

56
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,450
After your nap and
if you're feelin Yup to it,

58
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,319
join us in the restaurant.

59
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:40,986
I will.

61
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,161
I'm so sleepy...

62
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,167
The seafood here is delicious...

63
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:59,004
I'm so disappointed.
I wanted Sonoko to try it.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,674
I wonder if she'll be OK...

66
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,542
sleeping inside a hot car...

67
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,011
Don't worry
I turned the air conditioner on...

69
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,485
Wow, look at this!

70
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,186
Is this for 1 person?

71
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,221
Yep!

72
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,689
Therews'quantit «
and price is low!

74
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,558
That's the secret to
this restaurant's success!

76
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:23,362
Oh brother,
a full course meal for lunch...

80
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,313
Didn't I tell you
the food was great?

82
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,882
You were right!
It was delicious!

84
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,651
I'm completely stuffed...

85
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,586
Thank you very much!!

86
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,088
I feel bad for Sonoko though.

87
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,923
Huh?

88
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:51,924
You're from the inn...

89
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,192
You're from the inn...

90
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,395
Do you come here often too?

91
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,731
No, this is my first time...

92
00:04:59,199 --> 00:04:59,999
By the way,

93
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,901
where's your
brown haired friend?

95
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,136
I haven't see her anywhere...

96
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,838
You mean Sonoko,

97
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,473
she didn't
get enough sleep last night,

99
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,942
so she's resting
in the car parked outside

101
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,277
Look!

102
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:11,944
Eh?!

103
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,879
Isn't that your car, Masahiko?

104
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,582
Why's it moving?!

105
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:17,483
Oh no!

106
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:18,850
There's a cliff up ahead!

107
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,227
Please come again...

109
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,099
Hey, where you think
you're going, pay your bill!!

112
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,576
Those are lock opening tools!

113
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,317
The sidebrake's disengaged!

114
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,619
Wake up Sonoko! Sonoko!

115
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:54,820
Eerah!

116
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,524
Rats! I can't put
full strength in while I'm running!

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,759
Oh no!

119
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,094
We're almost there!

120
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,129
Conan, get away from the car!

122
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:08,968
Whoa!

123
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,538
Hah!!

124
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:16,975
Hmm?

125
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,177
Ran...

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,481
Sonoko!
Grab hold of me!

128
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,616
Huh?

130
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,633
Are you guys alright!

131
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,766
Yes.

133
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,302
Just barely!?

134
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,571
That was close!

135
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,206
Boy I'm glad you're safe!

136
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,008
Hey you!!

137
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,576
Why didn't you put
the sidebrakes on?

139
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,045
Don't be ridiculous!

140
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,346
I had them on!

141
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,148
If they weren't on,

142
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,516
the car'd have
fallen off the cliff a long time ago!

144
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,487
Someone released the sidebrakes!

145
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,187
What?!

146
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,890
Someone broke into the car

147
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,192
using lock picking tools!

148
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,297
Someone who wantedsSonoko dead!

149
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,702
I see...

150
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:23,709
So someone broke into the car
while Sonoko was asleep inside

152
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,878
and released the sidebrake.

153
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,847
Causing the car
to drive down this gentle grade

155
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,216
and fall over
the cliff, is that right...

157
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,919
Here's the diver's report.

158
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,357
The sidebrakes of the car
in the water were disengaged!

160
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,558
And we

161
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,694
found this lying on the road.

162
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,096
These are lock picking tools!

163
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,831
Is this a professional hit?!

164
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,933
It's been wiped clean of prints!

165
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,669
Did you find anything else?

166
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,004
No...

167
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,039
the only other thing we found

168
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,041
was a puddle of water that
Ieaked out of the cooler box where

170
00:07:56,343 --> 00:08:00,145
the car was
parked in the parking lot.

172
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:01,613
Sonoko.,

173
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,884
did you see anyone
suspicious lurking around the car?

175
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,052
I wouldn't know...

176
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,521
I didn't
sleep much last night

178
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,091
so I was
fast asleep in the car...

181
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,761
ever since arriving in Izu,

182
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:20,199
we're bein followed
for some unknown reason...

184
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,867
one person
following us is over there.

186
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,573
Would you mind
identifying yourself?

188
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,642
I work at the inn
the girls are staying at

190
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,411
I came here today

191
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,514
to have some tea.

192
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,617
- The inn's not busy during the
afternoon and I had some free time.

194
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,086
He's not the one!

196
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,989
When the car started moving,

197
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:48,093
he was already
in the restaurant with us!

199
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,664
If he had broken into the car

200
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,201
released the sidebrake
and then come into the restaurant,

202
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,606
we would have seen him walk in...

203
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,909
The waiter told me

204
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,879
the backdoor is
always kept locked...

206
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:11,450
We first noticed him
when he came out of the restroom but

208
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,154
there's no window
Ieading out from inside the toilet!

210
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,957
And of course,
Masahiko's in the clear too!

212
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,128
He was having
Iunch with us at the time

214
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,830
and he never left the table.

215
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,565
Which means

216
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:31,236
the most likely suspect
is the man following us!

218
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,672
Who is he anyway

220
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,747
well take all your
statement down at the station!

222
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,649
So please get!into the car!

223
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,417
Did you say can!

224
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,152
L..uh...

225
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,822
Don't feel like
riding a car just yet...

227
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,490
It scares me...

228
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:52,825
Then

229
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,127
why don't you and I
walk to the police station?

231
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,330
It's not far from here,

232
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,398
the view's nice,

233
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,266
it'll refresh you,
what do you say?

235
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,069
Yes I'd like that!

236
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,205
Wait just a minute!

237
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,740
What if she's attacked again?

238
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,043
Sonoko does have
brown hair, you know!

240
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,546
It's possible her assailant
is also the murder suspect!

242
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,015
You have nothing to worry about!

243
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,552
No one would be fool enough
to attack her in broad day light.

245
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,689
But there's
always the possibility 1!

247
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,624
Don't worry, Detective!

248
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,326
Masahiko will be with me...

249
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,661
and so will Ran!

250
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,330
Argh~ alright then,

251
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,398
but don't stop off anywhere,

252
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,167
come straight to the station!!

253
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,568
Es, Sir.

254
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,914
Icant believe it,

255
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:50,616
the attack at the inn last night

256
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:51,984
and then he car incident today

257
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,152
what's with you anyway...

258
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,222
Sonoko... are you sure
you don't know what's going on?

260
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,157
No, I have no idea...

261
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,127
Maybe it's because
you're so charming?

263
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,997
Yes...why is he after her...?

265
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:08,500
if he wanted to kill her,

266
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,037
why didn't he do it
when he broke into the car?

268
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,973
He didn't have to go «.
Through all that trouble

270
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,510
car go,over the cliff...

271
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,382
We planned on leaving Izu
as soon as we had lunch

273
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,952
so we put
all our bags in the car,

275
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,121
they've all gone up
in flames now

277
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,122
Rats!

278
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,258
Why is all of this happening!!

279
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,860
All you lost was your luggage.

280
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,495
I lost my car too.

281
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,931
Yes, you're right...

282
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,866
just because
you got involved with me,

284
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,935
I guess }
I brought you bad luck.

286
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,170
No, I don't think of it that way,

287
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,173
I'm not so unluc « ,
you lost all your memorable photos,

289
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,275
you can't replace
those once they're gone.

291
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:55,279
All tha s left
Is that 1 picture now...

293
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,248
You mean...

294
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,182
You know,

295
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,585
the one I'm going
to show to Shinichi

297
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,053
I have it on me at all times,
you have nothing to worry about!

299
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:02,988
Eh?!

300
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,755
You still have! it?

301
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,859
Get rid of it,
you're making me mad!

303
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,528
That's it, it's that picture!!

304
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,432
He wants to
get rid of that picture!!

306
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,002
That's why he had to send
the car over the cliff, to get rid of

308
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,770
both Sonoko and her luggage!!

309
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,674
But I don't understand.

310
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,213
Why does he think Sonoko took
an incriminating picture of him. 7?

312
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,851
There wasn't a single
unusual photo in the bunch...

315
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,390
did I overlook somethi g?

316
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,101
It's him again!

317
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,071
I think we're being followed.

318
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:53,872
What?!

319
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,674
Is it the killer?

320
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:56,775
Can you run?

321
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,243
Uh, sure...

322
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,010
Alright then,
here we go!

324
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:00,746
What the?!

325
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,581
Let's go too!

326
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,226
You're putting her into
more danger going into the woods!

328
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,996
No! This is more thrilling!!

329
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:18,864
Right?

330
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:19,598
Oh yes.

331
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,933
Let's split up and lose that guy!

332
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,308
That's strange

333
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,978
if he's Sonoko's attacker,

334
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,047
«Why's he still afteriner.

335
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,015
All the pictures were burned...!!

336
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,422
A train...?

337
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,323
Hey, that's right,

338
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,558
this is .the woods
where they found the body yesterday...!!

340
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:51,430
When we passed
this place the other night,

342
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,031
I'm sure a train went by...

343
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:56,568
What is this ?

344
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,370
I'm missing something here....!

345
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,854
Rats...! I lost them...

346
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,724
the situation's turning bad...!

347
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,296
Give it up, you...!!

348
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,866
If you thought we'd keep
running, you made a big mistake!!

350
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,134
Oh...hey...

351
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,404
Ouch!!

352
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:35,407
It's your fault for wearing
sandals when you run in the woods!

354
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,242
Sandals...?

355
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,111
It was you wasn't it...

356
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,713
You attacked
Sonaka last night at the inn

358
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,015
and then today you
sent the car over the cliff! 2

360
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,585
Hold on there!! That's...

361
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,386
No use lying...!!

362
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,822
Your hairy arms are proof enough!

363
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,091
Let's have a look...!!

364
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:56,261
There should be bite marks
where Sonoko bit you last night!

366
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,931
What?! It can't be...no bite marks!!

367
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,733
Maybe on the other arm!!!

368
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,736
I don't get it,
there're no marks on this arm either...!!

370
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,104
What's going on!?

371
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,906
Who are you anyway?!

372
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,374
Well, actually...

373
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,177
I'm a detective with the Chiba
Prefecture Police Department...

375
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,279
You're just showing me the cover,

376
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,048
I'm not stupid enough
to fall for that trick...!!

378
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,919
My father was once a
police officer, you can't fool me

380
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,356
When an officer has to
identify him or herself,

382
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,860
they must display the "Koukyuyoushi
Daiitchou" face of their police identification!

384
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,230
Shoji Terabayashi at your service...

385
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:32,998
Oh my 2!

386
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,399
It's the real thing

387
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,336
I've been following a
suspect in a certain case...

389
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,638
A suspect...?

390
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:40,939
Ran!

391
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,676
When you wear sandals,
you don't usually wear socks, do you?

393
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,512
No not really

394
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,580
Oh no!

395
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,915
Sonoko's in danger!!

396
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,917
Ouch...

397
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,252
I stepped on a branch...

398
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,453
I guess

399
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,689
wearing sandals in the
woods wasn't such a good idea...

401
00:15:58,224 --> 00:15:59,524
Are you alright. .?

402
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,728
Eeth marks...!

403
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,204
Why are you so surprised...?

404
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:13,705
Uh.. um...

405
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,541
There's nothing
to be so surprised about,

407
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,609
is there?

408
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,477
After all...

409
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,216
this is the bite mark
you gave me last night...

411
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,156
es... so that's it...

412
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,090
So that's it

413
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:32,591
Ss. so that's it

414
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,793
Sonoko didn't
bite an arm last night,

416
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,862
she bit his calf...!

417
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,864
It was so dark
she couldn't make it out...!!

419
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,601
He thought Sonoko
took his picture because

421
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,204
the sparks
the train's pantograph produces,

423
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,207
Iit his back
at the time of the murder,

425
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,278
when Sonoko
passed by holding a camera

427
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,779
he jumped
to the wrong conclusion...!

429
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,316
He thought
there'd be a shot of him with the victim!

431
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,652
That's right

432
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,420
and I remember his saying...

433
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,522
Don't worry,

434
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,691
you look good in anything,

435
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,127
whether it's a
kimono or a bathing suit!

437
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,229
The only time she wore a kimono

438
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,098
was to the fireworks
shown 2 nights ago. .!!

440
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,767
We only met him yesterday,

441
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,969
how could he know
what she looks like in a kimono...!

443
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:19,671
Rats!

444
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:20,572
Why didn't I.

445
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,575
Why didn't I
figure it out sooner!!

447
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,844
What are you doing!!

448
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,680
Give me that picture...!

449
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,983
The picture you were going to
have some detective look at!

451
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,454
You probably thought
you took a picture of a couple dating

453
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,190
but I was
in the midst of committing murder...!

455
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,559
Just like now...!!

456
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,995
F-Four...?

457
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,498
He killed four girls...?

458
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:49,100
If he was responsible
for the murder the other night.

460
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,535
Then she's probably the fourth. .!

461
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,570
For some reason, he
Kills only girls with brown hair!

463
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,874
I've had him
marked for a long time

465
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,610
I got him on a
stolen vehicle charge once,

467
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,179
but there wasn't enough proof
on the murder charge...!

469
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,050
I came to Izu because I heard there
had been a similar murder before

471
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,419
and there he was...!

472
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,256
But I got here too late.
He'd already killed...!

474
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,725
I don't understand though...!

475
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,961
He was in the
restaurant the whole time,

477
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:18,063
why'd the car
start moving on its own?

479
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,431
It was the ice...!

481
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,134
He had a cooler box...!

482
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,538
He took a
wedge shaped piece of ice out,

484
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:28,940
put it under the left front tire

485
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,041
so it wouldn't move...!

486
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:31,743
Then,

487
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,679
pretended to talk
to Sonoko who was inside

489
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,615
and released the sidebrake...!

490
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,117
Then

491
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,685
he left some
Iock picking tools on the ground!

493
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:44,489
To divert the investigation... .!!

494
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,156
I see...

495
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,295
that's why he left 2 spaces
open when he parked,

497
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,698
so there'd be no cars obstructing
his car's path when it moved...!

499
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:54,799
On top of that,

500
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,701
the melted ice would
just appear to be

502
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,471
water that leaked
out of the cooler box!

504
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,539
But why...?!

505
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,708
Why does he kill only
girls with brown hair...!!

507
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,777
I told you, didn't I?

508
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,846
A girl jilted me in a cruel way....!

509
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:08,947
That's why,

510
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,248
that's the reason,

511
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,018
whenever I see flirty girls like you,

512
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,420
I get so mad...!!

513
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,323
Girls with brown hair
remind me of her,

515
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,759
how she ruined my life!!

516
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,128
Look over there,
isn't that Sonoko?!

518
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,062
What?!

519
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,498
Oh no!!

520
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,068
I don't get it!!

521
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,004
Why're all the guys
that make a play for me so weird!

523
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:35,874
I hate you God!!

525
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:39,477
Wha...?!

526
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,283
Are you alright?

527
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:46,818
I'm fine...

528
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,887
but, how about you. ?

529
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,522
Oh, this?

530
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:00,899
Now I remember!!

531
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,466
Eh?!

532
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,235
I knew I'd seen that guy
with the glasses before,

534
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,770
it was at the tournament!!

535
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,570
Euh?

536
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,808
He's captain of the
Haido High School Karate Club!

538
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,410
He's the Kick Attack King!!

539
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,916
Makoto Kyogoku

540
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,286
Wow.

541
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,456
You're a very reckless lady...

542
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,327
You're just lucky I had some free time
and just happened to be close by...

544
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,062
Free time...

545
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,765
do you mean you were
following me all this time...?

547
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,799
That's right,

548
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,701
I was following you!

549
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,803
Until I lost sight of you
in the woods...

551
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,074
I knew you might think
I was a stalker.

553
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:46,743
Before he met you,

554
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,982
he'd been flirting
with a few other girls,

556
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,983
it got me worried...

557
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,919
Why did you worry about me...?

558
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,855
You don't even know me...

559
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:58,823
You didn't notice me

560
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,625
but I'd seen you once before,

561
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,161
at a karate tournament.

562
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,631
You were cheering like mad
for your friend...

564
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,435
I never dreamed
you'd reserve a room in our inn.

566
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,743
I suggest you stop

567
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,812
wearing
outfits that look like lingerie,

569
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:23,515
it arouses
the guys more than neccessary...!

571
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:24,983
Of course!

572
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,185
You're free to ignore my advice

573
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,188
and pass it off
as just another casual remark

575
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,324
made by
one of your many suitors...

Makoto's gone

Teitan High School

628
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,434
But why...?

629
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,371
You and he were getting
along so well since then, weren't you?

631
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,574
He said
there is no one strong left in Japan

633
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,776
so he went off to train abroad...

634
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,478
3 days later.

635
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:34,712
Ran!

636
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,216
Let's go see the baseball
team's practice game'])

638
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,219
The other team's ace
is a freshman,

640
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,454
I hear he's so cute
and just so adorable!

642
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:45,890
Good grief,

643
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,226
I thought you were
going to wait for Makoto to return...

645
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,827
That was then

646
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:51,062
This is now...!!

647
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:54,799
I knew it...

648
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:07,045
There's a key in the water

649
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,047
A window...!?

650
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,218
It's impossible, no one could
get in and out through there!!

652
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,522
What trick did the killer use

653
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,791
to lock this room?
