22
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,650
I went to an amusement park
with my childhood fnend Ran.

24
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,387
When I happened to witness a suspicious
dealing being carried out by a man in black.

26
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,789
Absorbed in watching the event,

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,726
I did not realize that another man
in black was sneaking up behind me.

29
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,662

and forced'to drink poison.

When I regained consciousness

32
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,399
I realized that my bed. had
shrunk to that of a child's.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,068
If they find out that Shinichi Kudo is alive,

35
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,204
danger will fall"upon the people around me.

36
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,674
Through DocterAgasa's advice,
I decide to hide my true identity.

38
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:27,246
When Ran asked me for my name.
I instantly replied, 'Conan Edogawa.

40
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,981
In order to gather information
on the men in black.

42
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,250
I decide to free-load at Ran's house,

43
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,519
because I find out that
her Father is a detective.

00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,217
1ICaSsSo...

244
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,755
Ow! Yes! That's a copy o
Picasso's "Crying Woman!"

246
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,492
Gogh, Monet; Gauguin... . Utrillo...

247
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,360
They all look genuine!

248
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,564
Brother drew all of these!

249
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:47,033
He was in the art club of his high scheel,

250
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,368
and was good at copying
ther peoples=paintings...

252
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,472
Hey, don't tell me he's been +1dnapped
and being forced to draw pictures.

254
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:58,311
Possible if the masterpieces are copied
and exchanged for the reabenes...

256
00:12:58,312 --> 00:12:59,912
0, that's not possible either...

257
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:05,618
His sketches are indeed good but he needs
a bit-mere practice as to color'and touch.

259
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,486
It's net goodenough to be counterfeit yet .

260
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:11,123
Amd this is not a kidnapping fer ransem either.

261
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,626
Because if it were so,
it would be easier to kidnap yeu

263
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,760
than to kidnap your brother
who is in high school.

265
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,698
What bothers me, is this painting.

266
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:20,832
I've seen him somewhere before

267
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,702
Soseki Natsume...

268
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:26,973
Yes! Bretlver was a great fan of Soseki!

269
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,710
He-liked that painting se much that he even
entered it in the community exhibition.

271
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:38,985
But, everybed. was complaining about it
because was a copy of his picture...

273
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,654
@nly one weird weman praised it...

274
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:42,455
A weird woman'?

275
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:49,395
Yeah she was wearing a broad-brimmed
hat and dressed in black from head te toe.

277
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,734
When was that?!
When did youfsee that weman?!

279
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,403
About 10 days ago.

280
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,873
Were there any men dressed
in blaek besides her?!

282
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:04,076
Here were two...

283
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,945
on't tell me that

284
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,682
What's the matter, Conan?

285
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:13,952
It couldn't be that

287
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:24,864
MN -sosass

288
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,936
Hey», fake me to a place near here
that your brother is likely to go!!

290
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:33,806
His wallet, and his train pass
are in his drawer.

292
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:35,808
Ven his bicycle is at the front door.

293
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:40,346
It's highly probable that your brother
was called out near here and kidnapped!!

295
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:44,350
I see, so if we search the vicinity
aybe we'll find some clue...

297
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,151
Come on, hurry!

298
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:48,888

A week ago at sundown

301
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,972
I wonder I don't think she came

00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:09,775
but. don't remember seeing a weman
dressed f@blaek

305
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:13,179
Ithough I'm.sure she'll standout,...

306
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:07,099
We've gone to all the place
he may been called out to

308
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,070
Iike coffee shops, game centers,
department stores and back alleys

310
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:15,074
There is nobody who?saw himrthat day .

00:16:36,964 --> 00:16:39,098

with @ thousand yen bill... Strange.

331
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,664
Maybe he didn't h ve llcose change?

332
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:15,668
If he had a thousand yen» he could've
bought it at the vending machine outside.

334
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,537
He didn't have §@ go through.the trouble
of waiting @8 the .check out counter.

336
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,074
Maybe the cigarette he wanted was sold out?

337
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:28,748
Will you show me the 1.00 £en bi
that the man just gave you?

339
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,850
Never mind, just let me see it!

Wait up!

349
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:19,732
Hey, Conan, What's the matter

350
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,473
What is it about the-countesfeit that y u were
talking about ? the convenience storex

352
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:33,613
That'man... bought cigarettesw
with a. 1000 yen, right?

354
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:36,281
He did so, although there was a vending
machine right outside the store

356
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,617
and went out of his way to line up 1
at the counter.

358
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:42,421
In other words, he usedva: thousand yen
that the machine wouldn't accept!

360
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:46,158
A counterfeit that the human eye
is likely to overlook!!

362
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,031
But, that has nething to do
with brother disappearing. does it"?!

364
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:56,836
It has everytRimg to do with I him?
You remember. dent you?

366
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:59,238
The portrait of a certain person

oseki Natsume...

369
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,179
Come to think of it. the thousand yen bill
has the face of Soseki Natsume omit...

371
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,314
Then, then, brothers...

372
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:12,318
Maybe somebody s
through his talent. for art,

374
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,521
and has im confined some place,
fercing him to make counterfeits.

376
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,791
We can't be sure if that man-s invelved or net,

377
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:25,131
but maybe they're the guys who shrunk
my body... Those men in black...

00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,999
Runk your bedy...

380

He,just-may take me to where they

416
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,124
Oh, the station.

417
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,729
A stand?!

418
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:05,998
No...

420
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:10,670
Yeah... That man wearing
a black hat came here!

422
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:14,674
He bought a cansof 110 yen
coffee with a theusand yen.

424
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,610
H me, just as 1 theught __.

425
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:22,415
He wasnetéfriendly, and besides=&
there was a'strange-seal stuck on. the bill.

427
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,016
He*was a weirdo.

428
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:27,787
And, do yo knew which way he went?

429
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:32,058
. After-he bought-thé-can of
e was using-the phone-over there

431
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,993
He placed Icose.changeion-the phone up...

432
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:39,265
and was talking on the phone
until he used it all up

434
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:42,201
aybe for about 10 minutes...

435
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:48,841
Did he by any chance ask you to give him
the change in 100 yens and 10 yens?

439
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:54,747
I'mixed.500 yen'and-gave-him-89Ofyen...

440
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:58,751
The change that he got at
the convenience stere is 770 yen.

442
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,156
One 500 yen coin and two 100 yen coins,
one 50 yen coin and two 10 yen coins

444
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,361
If the 890 yen change that
he received at the stand is added.

446
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:09,962
The money that he can use to
make the phone call would be

448
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:16,903
five 100 yen coins and eleven 10 yen coins.
That is, 610 yen all together.

450
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:21,174
F he had mere lease change
on him. it be mere than that...

452
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:25,444
He used"more than 610 yen for a call
approximately 10'minutes long?

454
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,746
Was he making a long distance call?

455
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:29,714
Den't tell me he went somewhere far away

456
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,118
te the place where his
Iephone partner is waiting...

458
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:35,555
No, .if he call from ublic phone
to.a cellular phone

460
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:37,190
it would cost 10 yen per 9 secends...

461
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,858
here is still that pessibility

462
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:44,397
Hey, kid? are you an acquaintance
of 'the man wearing the black hat?

464
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,232
Es, sort of...

465
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:50,536
Oh, great. Please give this to him.

466
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,672
50 yen?

467
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:57,710
He was in such a rush that
he forgot to take this 50 yen change

469
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:00,146
from the ticket vending machine.

470
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:02,548
Which ticket vending machine was it?

471
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,684
The one for the Tohto Line, over there.

472
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,620
Do you know which.button he res ed?!

473
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,222
I don't know...

474
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:15,361
He put in one 500 yen*cein, and
I sauna-lot of loese change came out.

476
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,798
But. was more concernedrof
the rubbish at his feet tha

478
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,767
I didn't notice anything else...

479
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:25,505
Thank you! I'll go after him! Bye!!

480
00:23:25,506 --> 00:23:27,306
Eah...

481
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:33,512
He probably get mere than
three coins as change

483
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:35,114
