00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,503

Dad,

178
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,259
I brought Sonoko and her friends along.

179
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,361
Hello, Miss.

180
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,432

00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,968

I accepted Sonoko's kind offer and
came along

191
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,985
Nice to meet you.

192
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:08,270
I was just thinking that

193
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,389
it was kind of sad
with so little attendance,

195
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:15,727
because it seems that nobody will be
attending from the bride's side...

199
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,865
Come, come, Mika. don't talk like that
in front of our guests. Ho, hon, ho...

201
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,735
Miss.

Yes he's just fine
and playing golf everyday.

Thank you! ho. ho. ho...

212
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:39,751
Since I have no successor that I can rely
and entrust the Ohga Financial Group to.

214
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:43,955
I've got to stay healthy and
keep on working Foh, foh, foh...

216
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:49,895
Hey. hey...

218
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:09,314
Hey. Ran!

219
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,249
Do you think this would look nice on
4-Mr Makoto?

221
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,851
Hmm-1 don't really care for it...

222
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,588
Huh
I wonder if Shinichi had one like this?

224
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:18,189
Oh brother...

225
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,835

227
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,784
Huh.

228
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:46,318
Hi. there.

229
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,920
Did you already go take a look
at the Glass Museum...?

231
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,122
No I just got here too...

232
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,130
Sonoko, it's Grandma Tae and Mika.

233
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,302
Oh, grandma likes antique glass.

234
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,138
Conan, take a look at this. Isn't it pretty!

235
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,207
17th Century, it says.

236
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,077
So glass has been around from
that long ago...

238
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:18,283
In Egypt. they seem to have been making
glass decorations since 3000 AD.

240
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,952
It's been around from that long ago...

241
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,121
urmg e umeo 1e Xoman mpnre.

242
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,856
The blown glass method was invented.

243
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,058
And it's also said that
they even had window glasses.

245
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,861
Is that right...

246
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,663
You're quite knowledgeable, aren't you...

247
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,402
Well, I'm a glass craftsman from Hotaru,
Hokkaido. I took time off from work,

249
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,340
and came here wanting to see the glass
works of Nagasaki.

252
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,009
I OTC.

253
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,947
My liking for glass, developed into
my having a glass workshop in the city.

255
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:53,284
What do you think,
we have dinner together tonight...?

257
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,154
I'd like to hear about glass in Hotaru too...

258
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:59,257

00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,392

00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,413
Wow! How tall.

262
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,599
The town is like a toy!

263
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,868
What a nice view...

265
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,207
I always used to like high places!

266
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,146
See, the people walking below
Iook like swarming ants.

268
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:24,683
Doesn't it just make you feel so good?
Foh. foh, foh...

270
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,079

You're most welcome.

283
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,263
I didn't think that
Shinya would beat Mika and get married.

285
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,133
Ll V:
He beat you to it. didn't he?

287
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,802
I don't buy cheap stuff...

288
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:25,744
That's right, Mr. Takahashi,
I'd"like you to, attend tomorrow's wedding.

Shinya will have to shoulder the
Ohga Finance Group in the future.

294
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,492
I'm sure that attending the wedding
will not be a loss to you too.

296
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,260
W.What...I'm a glass craftsman and...

297
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,399
Okay. I'll attend.

298
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,068
Thank you

299
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,137
Akane.

300
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,673
Wear this at your wedding tomorrow...

301
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,883
This is a ring that has been handed down

302
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,951
for generations to the wives
of the Ohga family.

305
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:08,920
The founding president

306
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,889
who started a shipping
industry at the beginning of the Meiji Era

308
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,359
gave this to his wife
when he first went to Europe.

310
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,728
Thank you very much.

312
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:18,263
Thank you, mother!

313
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,800
Maybe it's too soon to give it to her yet.

314
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:23,601
But.

315
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,139
L'also=received-it from you
and wore it to the wedding.

317
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:30,341
Itrs: because in your case

318
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,611
everyone had viewed you
as"being the rightperson

320
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,079
as the wife of the family
head to begin with

322
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:37,949
The only time the ring
Is to be handed down

324
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,503
IS when the bride is approved of as
becoming a member of the Ohga family...

326
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:47,158
Which means you all don't approve of
Akane as being my wife?!

328
00:13:51,429 --> 00:13:51,996
Well,

329
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,599
she can wear it
during the wedding ceremony. though

331
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,271
It seems like...

332
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,408
We've been invited to some wedding...

333
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:19,274
What the heck was that!

334
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,292
Is that how the family of somebody
who Is going to have a sacrediwedding

336
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,228
tomorrow supposed to act?!

337
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,763
What the hell's going on, Sonoko™!

338
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,565
I told you that

339
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,101
they went through a bit of a hassle
before the wedding was decided. didn't I?

342
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,838
Sonoko. why is that grandmother
so mean to Akane'?

344
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,708
Shinya declared that if they
didn't app ove of him marrying Akane,

346
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,844
he would leave home

347
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,046
So, it seems the Ohga family
all reluctantly approved...

349
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,983
But... Akane's such a nice person!

350
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:48,052
The family of a financial group has
all kinds of hassles. .l

352
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,356
What?! You mean
they don't like her family lineage?!

354
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,992
And it seems grandma doesn't like
the fact that

357
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,860
S1€esS "years ocer wan um el er.

360
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,264
that's no reason to be mean to her

361
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,151
Hey» the show's started!!

362
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,816
Ran! I'm going to go over that side
and watch.

364
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,084
Be careful. okay!

365
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,326
Ah gee

366
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,330
it sure is inconvenient- to have a
small body at times like these

368
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:33,731
Huh

369
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,806
That's Akane and Mr. Takahashi?!

375
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,585
kane, you look fantastic

376
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,971
You can say that again!
You look just marvelous

378
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,174
Make sure you throw me the bouquet after
the wedding ceremony. okay Please!

380
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,575
Promise now!

381
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:18,576
Hey. hey...

383
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:19,677
LIA wie)

384
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,879
I'm not sure if I'll be able to aim right.

385
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:22,947
But I'll try my best.

386
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,820
Only an hour more to go
before the wedding.

388
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,622
Akane is so beautiful!

390
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,829
Hey. Shinya

391
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,964
how about a word to the bride?

392
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:40,698
Oh. yeah.

393
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,770
You look really dazzling...

394
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,237

Oh. come on. Sonoko...

397
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,278
Shinya.

398
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,815
How unsightly of you
to be entranced by your bride.

400
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,351
Stay in your waiting room
until it's time for the wedding.

402
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,287
Akane...

403
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,091
I will take on the role of the brides father.

404
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,460
Thank you so...

405
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:10,895
Oh...?

406
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,034
It's your foot...

407
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,169
I think you stepped on this.

408
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,471
Huh, oh...is that it?

409
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,740
Oh, I'm so sorry. really sorry.

410
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,281
This picture,
are they your parents, Akane?

412
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,233
Yes...

414
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,122
at me

415
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,226
Aagh!

416
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,695
G. Grandma!

417
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:47,498
Grandma!

418
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,634
My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

419
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,636
I'll get better After a little rest.

420
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:53,237
Here

422
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,372

425
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,507
Rest a while till. it's time:for the ceremony.

426
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,477
I wonder if Grandma Tae's okay?

427
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,479
I hope it's nothing serious...

428
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,287
I'm fine!

429
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,887
Huh? But...

430
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,893
Huh ?!

432
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:22,600

What's the matter. @onan...?

00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,373
Akane! The ring! Do you have it...?

437

Huh?! No...

438
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,284
The ring is...gone

439
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:41,953
R.Really!!

440
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:44,489
It.It's gone!!

441
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,493
What's this?

442
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,096
You're in it!

444
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:52,630
SS eo 9

445
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:55,566
If I remember correctly. this is...

446
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,769
a picture that Shinya took for me

447
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,570
when we came to reserve
this wedding hall in June...

450
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,174
What does this mean?

451
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:03,941
Beats me...

452
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,346
If I lose that: ring

453
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:09,647
how am I going to take
responsibility for it .

456
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,349
how am I going to take
responsibility for it .

459
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,351
I know I can't simply apologize...

461
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,554
Akane!! What-re you talking about!

463
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,356
It's just a ring after all...

464
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,293
Let's all look for it!

465
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:42,747
What,

469
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,550
we ru )y rung us 0s...

470
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,222
Is that... .true?!

471
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:51,822
Yes...

472
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:55,693
Call the wedding off!

473
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:56,761
Huh

474
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,564
We-re calling off this wedding.

475
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:00,431
What?!

476
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,768
There will be no wedding
until the ring is found!!

478
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,903
OO. Oh no. we can't do that now!

479
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,172
Come now. mother dear...

480
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,374
Think about it. Masayo!

481
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,041
Huh

482
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,111
Ever since talk of this wedding
came around.

484
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,846
Bad things have-been happening one
after the other.

486
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,816
And that girl's to blame for everything.

487
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,151
To top things off.

488
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,221
She loses the ring,
which is a family treasure...

490
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,623
It's not Akane's fault!

491
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,096
And? What is Akane doing right now?

492
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,031
Vs JT
She says she wants to be alone

494
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:35,299
and is in the waiting room...

495
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,702
I see. ..She must be in shock...

496
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:39,637
Everyone,

497
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,772
it's almost time for the ceremony to begin!

498
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:43,774
Is something wrong?

499
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:46,510
The ruby ring is lost...

500
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,378
What?!

502
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,315
You mean that ring that
the founder brought back from Europe?!

504
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,919
It was definitely there until all of you came.

506
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:57,922
Hey. Shinya,

507
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,724
just what are you trying to say'?

508
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,160
Don't tell me that you're suspecting us!

509
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,029
When Sonoko and her friends came

510
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,498
she says she was sure the ring was there.

511
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,033
Which means

513
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,435
it has to be the work of somebody
who came into the room later. right?

515
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,440
Uh, it couldibe that glass craftsman
from Hotaru called Takahashi...

517
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,444
This picture was left
behind in place of the ring.

519
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,647
Since Shinya is the-one
who took this-picture,

521
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,982
anybody from

523
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,319
the Ohga family could've got hold of it.

525
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,522
You can't really tell...

526
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,991
Akane had the picture too. didn't she?

527
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,694
She could've stolen the ring

528
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,230
and left the picture behind to make it

529
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,015
Iook as if someone from the Ohga family
took it. right?

531
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,433
OO. Oh no!

532
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,902
Well. no big deal

533
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:48,439
It doesn:t-feel.good
being suspected-anyway

535
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,110
so let's-have them check every nook
and cranny of our rooms right away.

537
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:54,312
However

538
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,449
so long as the whereabouts of the ring is
unknown, this marriage will be cancelled,

540
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,116
understand?!
