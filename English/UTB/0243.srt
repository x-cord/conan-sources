This is the briefcase I told you about.

Why not?

00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,166

85
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,833
What's that?

86
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,068
It's a "jizo" statue...

87
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,304
It must have fallen In
some sort of an accident.

89
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,472
Let's put it upright.

00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,707
Oh, no, no, don't!

91
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,244
If you do that, a curse might fall on you!

92
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:05,911
What?

93
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,612
Oh, no!

94
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:07,446
Oh, my!

95
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,717
It-s the great detective Kogoro Mourl,

00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,620
who barely escaped
being arrested thellastitime...

98
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,222
Well, hold it...

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,058
The klutz at Gunma Police...

100
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,094
What are you doing here?

101
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,764
I have business at the Aociyaf : okan,
just ahead from here.

103
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,800
Uh...

104
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,170
Is it related to the case of
the unidentified man in the red jacket?

106
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,509
Actually, I'm also
on my way to Aoiya Ryokan.

108
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:40,146
The body was found around here,
in this Kashiragami Forest...

110
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:44,383
Kashiragami is the name of a god
who causes headaches.

112
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,753
People with worries on their mind
who go deep into the forest are...

114
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,923
captivated by the forest
and never come back.

116
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,492
This forest is famous for suicide.

117
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,828
S,Suicide!?

118
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,028
Yes!

119
00:04:57,029 --> 00:04:58,898
The statue that you were
about to set upright was

121
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,866
the "Forward Fallen Jizo"
that appeases the spirits.

123
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,770
It is said that making
it upright invites misfortune.

125
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,972
That's why it is left that way
for very long time.

127
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,277
Since were all heading to the:same place,
I'll take you all by car.

129
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,648
Oh... no... my daughter wants to
walk in the forest...

131
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,784
But... your daughter is already in the car.

132
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:20,986
Oh my...

133
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,661
So, the body found was
that of an employee at Aoiya Ryokan?

135
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,495
Yes.

136
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,133
The body was found during a hunt
for wild edible plants...

138
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,969
But, there was something wrong
with the body.

140
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,004
What-was wrong with it?

141
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,275
We found car keys
but no driver's license...

143
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,146
Cigarettes without lighter or matches...

144
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,983
The man supposedly died in summer
but was wearing a sweater...

146
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,153
How do you know he died in summer?

147
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,356
The evidence was found
In the knapsack he was carrying.

149
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,325
A package of milk and a bun

150
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:03,762
with product life expiring
exactly 4 years ago on July12.

152
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,398
This had been verified our receipt from

153
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,868
a nearby convenience store
where they had been purchased

155
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,139
Both milk and the bun had been
squashedfand ruined on impact

157
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,108
when the body hit the ground.

158
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:17,610
Hit the ground?

159
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,913
The body had a noose on its neck,

160
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,717
and there was a broken. branch nearby,
to which the rope was tied.

162
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,287
Most probably, the man: hung:himself,
and the branch broke later.

164
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,924
That appears to make it suicide.

165
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,893
Yes. That is why I am planning to
ask the employee

167
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:40,266
who 'discovered the body to find
the reason for the questions we have.

169
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Why are you going:there, Mr. Mouri?

170
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,939
Well, this man in the red jacket
reportedly saw the owner of the inn.

172
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,842
What!? When was that?

173
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:54,246
He said that was around
October five years ago...

175
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,218
I have been told that this man
showed up at the inn suddenly

177
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,820
and told the owner this...

178
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:07,893
I will pay ¥100,000 for you to keep
this briefcase and the envelope..."

180
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,764
He said, "I'll come back to get it
one year later, no matter what."

182
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,565
An briefcase and envelope?

183
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,833
Yeah.

184
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,770
He told the owner to give him back the
briefcase if he personally shows up

186
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:21,473
and to hand anybody else
who shows up the envelope.

188
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,512
Although there's no proof
the man in the red jacket

190
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,481
and the body found are
one in the same person...

192
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:35,754
The man reported emphasized
not to forget the red jacket and long hair

194
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,690
so probably, it ls the same man.

195
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,926
In the end, it appears he did not show up.

196
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,830
Come to think of it,
the dead man had long hair

198
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,532
So, this is what you think happened.

199
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:50,269
The man deposited the briefcase
with the inn owner five years ago

201
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,371
and said he will return to pick it up
no matter what.

203
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,707
Roughly one year later in summer,

204
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,876
he killed himself on his way to pick it up.

205
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,848
The guy is a fool.
He cannot get it if he's dead.

207
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:07,720
That's why I've been:asked
by 'the owner to solve this:mystery!

209
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:11,190
He had been paid not to report it to the police.

210
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,392
That's why he didn't tell anybody.

211
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,260
IS that s

212
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,228
Excuse me.

213
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,699
So, nobody came to claim
the briefcase?

215
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,304
Actually, a man who claimed to be
his' proxy showed up the next day,

217
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,440
the man in the red jacket
deposited the case.

219
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,778
He was a strange man, bearded,
wearing a hat and sunglasses.

221
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,682
Although the owner could not decide
right away, as he was directed to do,

223
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,651
he decided to hand
the envelope to the man,

225
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,820
And then?

226
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:46,925
The man opened the envelope
right on the spot, and read the memo.

228
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,862
He appeared angry
and tore up the memo

230
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:54,900
And threw it away in the trash can in the
Iobby. He left and never returned again

232
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,302
What did the memo say?

233
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:03,041
The owner was curious
and collected the pieces

235
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,212
When he glued them together, he saw
seven letters written hastily in blood,

237
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,880
I will curse you to your death!

238
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,255
Goodness, that's why
I told you not to come.

240
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,389
But.

241
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,425
Don't worry!

242
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:23,162
Uncle Kogoro will solve the mystery

243
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,130
as soon as he gets to see
what's inside the case.

245
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,166
Well, yes .

246
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,001
And what's inside...

247
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:35,140
It might be the man's long hair...

248
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,379

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,914

Why, is this your first time here?

260
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,699

Yes, I was shocked.

268
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,580
Yes, I was shocked.

a person dead there.

00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,755
Were you the only one
who found the body?

289
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:24,156
Oh... yes.

290
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,994
Excuse me, do you always go
picking plants all by yourself?

292
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,362
Well,

293
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:35,834
Mr. Jimbo, the owner Mr. Onda and I take
turns when picking plants in the forest.

295
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:40,472
However, I have
the highest percentage of finding bodies.

297
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,442
I have the knack to feel
the presence of dead bodies in the air.

299
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,344
Is that so...

300
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,281
In fact, it's usually my turn after our trip.

301
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,949
I had no choice...

302
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,817
What does that mean?

303
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,587
Every year before summer vacation,

304
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,222
the inn is closed for all employees
to participate in a group tour.

306
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,058
You see, the entrance to the forest
is right in front of the inn.

308
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:04,363
That is why
more people commit suicide at that time,

310
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:06,698
when there are less people
around here to be watching.

312
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,435
If it is suicide, I have nothing to do.

313
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,207
Hey, isn't this person in sunglasses
a police detective, too?

315
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,342
Oh, no, this is...

316
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:23,148
I am proud to present to you
the great:detective...

318
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,518
You must be
the assistant of Mr. Kogoro Mourn!

320
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,288
No, no... he is in fact...

321
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,091
Mr. Motuiri has already arrived
and is already waiting in his room.

323
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,896
What?!

324
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,866
You said
that Kogoro Mouri is already:ihere?!

326
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,068
Yes, three hours earlier.

327
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,437
Then, what about the briefcase?

328
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,838
He brought it up tothis room.

329
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,412
He is such a nice person he gave out
autographs to all the employees.

331
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,547
Please don't soilgit.

332
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,117
I'm planning to get it framed.

333
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,522
Where is he now?

334
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,791
He's in Room 209.

335
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,558
I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!

336
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,561
Wait, Ran.

337
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,329
What?

338
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,432
You know,
in the old Japanese samurai movies.

340
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,736
That delectable scene in which the
genuine one confronts the impersonator.

342
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:21,173
Bearing*the unbearable,
suffering the insufferable

344
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:25,010
When that impersonator begins
his chintzy detective show...

346
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:29,615
I enter and show my genius as sleuth,
sweeping the crowd off their feet!

348
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,284
What kind of plan is that! How foolish!

349
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,754
Officer Yamamura,
you'd better tell him that!

351
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:36,588
That...

352
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:38,957
That sounds likeva great idea!!

353
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,891
Brilliant, isn't«it?

354
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,995
Please let me in on that!

355
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,529
Leave me out!

356
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,433
Excuse me, but can I have your names?

357
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,269
Our names?

358
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,872
Mitsuemon of Echigo

359
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:59,111
I'm just a plain old man

360
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,946
Yes you are. My Master.

361
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,047
Huh?

362
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,984
Yes, and give me the cheapest room!

363
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:06,718
Yes, Sir.

364
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,186
Excuse me!

365
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:13,025
Your daughter appears to have left
her cell phone inside the car.

367
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,494
Isn't this your daughter's?

368
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,464
Thank you, I'm obliged

369
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,466
Your gesture is appreciated!

370
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,601
Shall we be on our way?

371
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,806
Then, my aide Suke-san, shall we take
a bath and have a drink later?

373
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:31,209
Ah... no... I do appreciate,
but I am on duty.

375
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,512
He says he's Mitsuemon of Echigo.

376
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,729
Absolutely great!

377
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,863
No, no... that was nothing...

378
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,199
This away, you can do away
with the impersonator.

380
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,635
We'll be able to see
his detective show tonight.

382
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,606
How disgusting!

383
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,847
The show doesn't appear to be starting...

384
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,284
Tihatis.why-I"'told you. We should
have been talking to him earlier!

386
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,653
That impersonator might have
escaped already!

388
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,657
No... it seems nobody left the inn.

389
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,560
If he's not doing it,
it'sshigh time we go pay him a visit.

391
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,597
Hey! Are you there? Phony!

392
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:27,065
Hey! Come out!

393
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,568
He doesn't come out...

394
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,972
Hey, it's all dark in here!

395
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,075
Hide being under covers
because you can't solve the mystery!?

397
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,345
Wake up!
The real Kogoro Mouri is here...

399
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,315
What's this!?

400
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,521
This... is...

401
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,532
Here you are! Officer!

402
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,600
What's the matter?

403
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,102
Everything is the matter!

404
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,838
Detective Mouri has been found
In his room, hanging from his neck!

406
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:07,606
What?!

407
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,574
Anyway, you have to.come
in a hurry, too!!

409
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,510
What?!

410
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:20,085
Mr. Mouri!! How can this be...!

411
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,954
In my tears, your face looks distorted...

412
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,824
But, why did you do
something foolish like this...

414
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,527
Sleeping Kogoro has gone
to sleep for'eternity...

416
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,862
You overdid your joke!!

417
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,398
What is this silly talk?

418
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,232
What?!

419
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,402
We haven't allowed anyone into this area.

420
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,539
You'd better call your colleagues at
Gunma Police,

422
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,873
as well as the forensic team!

423
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,676
A...a ghost!

424
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,413
What!? A phony?

425
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,048
SO you are the real...

426
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,819
That man impersonated
Mr Kogoro Mouri.

428
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,288
This is the real detective,

429
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,190
the great Kogoro Mourn.

430
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,428
I knew it! I knew your face...
from somewhere...

432
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,131
Please forgive our blunder.

433
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,834
I had never seen your face...

434
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,370
But why did he pretend to be Mr. Moun?

435
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,974
He probably wanted to see what's inside

436
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,644
Look, the key is still in the keyhole.

437
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,614
True, let's look inside.

438
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,620
Huh?

439
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,056
What in the...

440
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,426
Sports papers?

441
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,527
Akagi-maru?

442
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,563
Isn't Akagi-maru that sumo-wrestler who
retired 4 years ago

444
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,198
after sustaining serious injury;.

445
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,101
Look closely!

446
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,937
This paper features the September
sumo tournament fiveiyears ago!

448
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,672
That was when

449
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,743
he 'drewymedia; attention for winning for
the first time in 18 years.

451
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,579
But why is it here...

452
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,115
Hey, there's something under
the newspaper.

454
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,251
Look, somethin 'What looks like
black yarn...

456
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,557
For God's Sake...

457
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,993
It's only a bundle of hairpacked
IN newspaper.

459
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,197
B-but... the hair is long!!

460
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,199
I hope.

461
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,636
It's not the curse of the longhaired man
in the red jacket

463
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,604
who died for years ago.

464
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,339
JIf a curse can kill people,

465
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,910
the police and we detectives are
out of business!

467
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,778
Well... umm...

468
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,046
this is what happened!

469
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,683
Five years ago,
two men had a wager.

471
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:35,787
Over what will happen to an athlete
one year from then

473
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,489
The two men were...

474
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,858
the long-haired man in the red jacket,

475
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,327
whose body was discovered
sometime ago,

477
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,962
And the other, the bearded man
who claimed to be me

479
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,132
and was found hanging by
his neck over there.

481
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,668
And the professional athlete is
Akagi mar...

483
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,871
who enjoyed the peak of his career
five years ago!

485
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:56,408
The longhaired man told the
bearded man...

487
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,477
My answer is in here.

488
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,814
I will place this in the care of the inn
owner and give you the key.

490
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,217
I will place this in the care of the
Inn owner and give you the key.

492
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,221
Then, who's the bearded man
with the hat...

494
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,024
who came as pro « of the
Ionghaired man...?

496
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,427
He probably was the bearded man.

497
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:19,097
The memo with the writing,
I will curse you to death,...

499
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,299
Was probably a threat to kill,

500
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,268
if he breaks the promise and
comes earlier.

502
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,135
B-but...

503
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,538
The sports papers in the case

504
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,974
what's got to do with the answer?

505
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,041
Remember,

506
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,043
there was one more thing in it-hair.

507
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,547
When a sumo w estler cuts his hair...

508
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,716
That means-retirement!

509
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,850
You got it.

510
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,953
However Akagizmaru won the
Nagoya tournament,

512
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,956
just before he suffered the
fatal injury...

514
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,058
and was promoted to the rank of ozeki.

515
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,761
The wager probably involved
a large amount of money...

517
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:54,031
Believing that the wrestler is not likely
to retire, the longhaired man...

519
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,602
Committed suicide
before arriving at the inn.

521
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,373
But, why would this man
commit suicide?

523
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,541
Because the prediction made by
the longhaired man was right.

525
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:08,246
When he learned that
the longhaired man died for years ago,

527
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,916
he wanted to know
what was inside the briefcase.

529
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:17,789
He heard that the owner of the inn had
solicited my services over this case...

531
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,591
He pretended to be Kogoro Mourn

532
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,861
and was able to check
what was inside the case. However...

534
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,397
The prediction turned out right.

535
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,233
He was driven by the sense of guilt of...

536
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:32,504
Causing the long:zhaired man to
kill:himself years ago over the wager,

538
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,072
He hung himself with his belt

539
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,708
To kill himself as well.

540
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,911
What wonderful brainwork!!

541
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,679
You exceed your reputation!

542
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,982
Of course, you're right!

543
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,655
No one gets killed with a curse
In this age of science and technology!

545
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,890
IT IS a curse!

546
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,557
What?!

547
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,192
Here, look at this carefully

548
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,894
The length of hair is not equal,

549
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,762
some are permed and some are dyed

550
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,433
In addition, it's slightly wet...

551
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:05,870
If all this hair had been wet for five years,
don't you think it's a curse?

554
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,443
This is not the curse of
the longhaired man!!

556
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:17,415
It is the evil spirit of a hippie
who has long-dyed and permed hair!!

558
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:18,750
Not again.

559
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,151
By the way,

560
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,521
your hair was wet a while ago
right, Ran?

562
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,323
Well, of course!

563
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,325
I just had a bath!

564
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,893
Don't be so nosy!

565
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,361
Bath?

566
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,664
But you just told me
that you weren't able to take a bath

568
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,666
when you went to the bathhouse
in the early evening...

570
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,602
That time, there was a sign at the door,
saying it was closed for cleaning!!

572
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,304
Talking about being wet,

573
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:43,641
the tatami mat at the entrance
out this room was a bit wet-wasn't it?

575
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,176
Well... yes...

576
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,049
Are the baths cleaned
in the early evening in this inn?

578
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,950
No... no.

579
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:55,386
The baths are cleaned usually
in the middle of the night.

581
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,123
That means that...

582
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,891
someone in the inn...

583
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:03,495
Hung up the sign in front of the women's
bathhouse, to keep people away.

585
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:07,464
In order to collect
a large amount of women's hair

587
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,567
from the drain to bring it here...

588
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,704
Placing the bundle between
the newspapers in the briefcase,

590
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:16,040
orchestrating to appear that it was
the curse of the longhaired man...

592
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,810
Possibly to distract
the police investigation.

594
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,012
En<... oh, no---itsamust mea

595
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,182
Yes... this is murder!!

596
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,487
The tatami mat was wet probably...

597
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:36,027
Because the culprit went into
the bathhouse in a hurry in socks...

599
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:40,265
And the culprit knows where the
CLOSED FOR CLEANING" sign is.

601
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:44,868
That means,
the culprit is among the employees.

603
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,578
Yes... this is murder...

604
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,014
The culprit probably...

605
00:21:56,015 --> 00:22:00,985
Is the person with ties to the longhaired
man who died four years ago.

607
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,053
The nagging point is

608
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,957
the strange circumstances
under which his body was discovered...

610
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,127
Car keys were found,
but no driver's license...

612
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,096
Cigarettes were found,
but no lighter or matches...

614
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,633
And, he was wearing a sweater
when it was summer .

616
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,733
Most probably,

617
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,737
the longhaired man didn't kill himself.

618
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,040
That was the murder, too.

619
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:27,478
Someone had tampered with
the body for some special purpose...

662

I can't see how anybody can do
omething so embarrassing...

664
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,977
Well, I'm so sorry that I'm childish!

668

H,How did you know?!

669
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,520
Just as I thought.

670
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:17,055
