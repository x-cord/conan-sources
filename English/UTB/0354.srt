00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,236
Friendship, Romance, Mystery

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,105
Because we cherish them
we can continue

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,639
The client is a famous child actor

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,274
The search for a mother leads to
a hot springs

7
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:09,975
He sees through the one and only truth,

9
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,076
He sees through the one and only truth,

10
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,177
A child in appearance

11
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,345
with the 1. Q of an adult

12
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,047
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

15
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,383
If I get married. what are you going to do,
Kiichi?

17
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,720
So. you're going to get married after all.

18
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,456
I try so hard to stop you,
but you just won't listen.

20
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:04,923
Dad...

21
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,091
Why you

22
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,292
Agh!

23
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,460
Aaagh!

24
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,628
Ah. Pops...

25
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:11,130
Dad!...

27
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,031
Hey. Dad. are you listening to me?

28
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,435
Shut up. be quiet, will you!

29
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,471
This is Yoko's best scene, you know.

30
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:24,042
Kiehi, I will never forget you...

31
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,345
This is the scene of the beach in Atami

32
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,114
where Kiichi and Omiya appear
in the story "Konjikiyasha. right?

34
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,049
Just how many times
are you going to watch that video....!

36
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:34,987
Agh!

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,088
Hey. Ran!!

38
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:38,423
Never mind the video

40
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,594
Tell me why you refused
Mom's invitation to go eat together!

42
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,530
Oh, yeah...

43
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,099
11/!
That day's inconvenient for me

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,900
May I ask in just what way is it
inconvenient-for you?!

47
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:49,701
Who cares!

48
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:54,473
I mean it's not that she's dead or
anything and we get to see her anytime!

50
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,742
Konjikiyasha...

51
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:01,713
Was never completed because the author
died while he was still writing the story...

53
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,549
So the two characters in the series

54
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,484
Iost their way to happiness)forever...

55
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:05,717
Iost their way to happiness forever

56
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,420
In our case...

57
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,558
We're going to see. it through...
and make it, no matter what...

59
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,160
I hope you re not thinking...

60
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,697
of trying to get Eri and me
back together again, are you?

62
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,998
Of course I am!!

63
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:24,870
It's only natural for kids to want to live
happilywith both their parents. isn't it?

65
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,805
That's nonsense

66
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,372
Huh 7!

67
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,463
There are people who abhor even looking
at their parent's faces. you know...

69
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,684
And. I'm one of them...

70
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,686
What's with this brat...

71
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,987
Huh?

72
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,556
You sure look familiar...

73
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,692
A.are you by any chance...

75
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,494
The child actor that is famous for acting

77
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,296
in dramas and movies,
Kazuki Kinukawa?

79
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:53,265
Y.Yeah. I am...

80
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,668
Wow~=~You're way cuter than
you look on TV!

82
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,440
And? What does that famous brat want
with our detective office here?

84
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,742
I want you to look for somebody.

88
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:03,942
I want you to look for somebody...

89
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,376
I want you to look for somebody...

90
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,979
A woman called-Atsuko...

91
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,414
whowkeeps sending me
postcardssike these...

93
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:16,605
TA NA
(BJ #)
The Little Client Part 1

96
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:17,656
TA RA
(BJ #)

99
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,944
It's true that

100
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:24,763
all there is here is the name of the sender
and no address.

102
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:25,664
Wait a minute.
Aren't these fan letters?

104
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:31,737
It's full of comments about
the dramas and movies that you acted in!

106
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,338
She seems to} be
a really great fan of yours...

108
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,942
She's sent you postcards

109
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,076
once every month from spring
two years ago to winter last year...

111
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:42,347
But all of them are stained
and wrinkled up...

113
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,284
You should*putthese away nicely
if they're fan letters

115
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:45,684
You should put these away nicely
if they're fan letters

117
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,752
I can't help it, can I?

118
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,955
They gave me the.creeps so I just kind of
Ieft them lying around...

120
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,174
Give you the creeps?

122
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,410
Because they're not fan letters.

123
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,712
They're postcards from my mother...

126
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,997
They're postcards from my mother...

127
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,899
Y.Your mother?

128
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,100
Yeah...

129
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,135
They're postcards from a stupid lady.
Who 6 years ago.

131
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:08,323
Abandoned me in front of the door of a
church as if I were a piece of trash...

133
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:12,778
Oh...that's why you mentioned not
wanting to see your parent's face...

135
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,078
Oh...that's why you mentioned not
wanting to see your parent's face...

137
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,749
But if you want us to look for her, it
means that you want to see her after all...

139
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,151
Don't get me wrong.

142
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:19,951
Huh

143
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:23,622
I just want to see the lady and give her
a piece of my mind!

145
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,024
I want to tell her not to claim being
my mother at this point just

147
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,427
because I'm famous now!

148
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,145
Ha...ha.ha...

149
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:31,563
Oh...

151
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,098
It's amazing how you,figured out

152
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,234
It doesn't say so anywhere and yet...

153
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,152
4 I can tell!

154
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:40,572
Because the name and the handwriting
on the postcard are the same as

156
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,107
they were on the memo that was
Ieft with me when she abandoned me...

158
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,508
Looking for her is not going to be
easy though...

160
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:43,759
Looking for her is not going to be
easy though...

163
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,009
Looking for her is not going to be
easy though...

166
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,643
Looking for her is not going to be
easy though...

169
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,513
The postcards are stamped from
different places,
gr -- .

172
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,748
all the way from Hokkaido,to Okinawa

173
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,617
You can tell that she really
Iikes to travel, though...

175
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:52,884
Oh...

177
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,754
Never mind then

178
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,957
I'll go look for another detective
that will search for her

180
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:04,296
I think that your mother's in a hotel or inn
some place in Atami

183
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,499
Where is it written?...

184
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,901
Look at this postcard.

185
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:10,969
There as something

186
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,638
that looks like the hand and head of
a statue on the bottom part, right?

188
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,308
Doesn't this statue look familiar?

189
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,477
Hmm. . Oh!

190
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,044
Hmm. Oh!

191
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,979
Now that you mentioned it,
It does look familiar

193
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,247
Mugh...Mugh, mugh...

194
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:26,251
Oh. I see! It's this!

195
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,587
It looks just/like this'pose...

196
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:32,290
Which means it's probably the statue of
Kiichi and Omiya at the beach in Atami!!

198
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,277
She probably:-used the top part of
the postcard set

200
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:37,862
which is made:;up of four postcards...

201
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,030
Phooey...

202
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,766
It could be that she used something
that she bought as a souvenir too...

204
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:45,287
But, there are three other postcards
Iike it too

206
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:47,973
And they're all the upper left ones?

207
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,842
If she's, rich enough to travel to
Jinns throughout Japan,

209
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,878
I think she would send
all four types of,postcards and

211
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,248
I'm sure that postcards of other places
would be mixed among them too, right?

213
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,183
Of get it!

214
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,401
I think your mother didn't want you to
know where -she wast

218
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,653
kn wswheredshe was,

220
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,122
SO she sent only thegpostcards

223
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,590
because they're the ones that are
the hardest to tell

225
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,893
that thus as the statue of Kiichi and Orniya!

226
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,379
She probably used postcards

227
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,048
that remained after everything else sold
out from the shop at a hotel or an inn!

229
00:07:13,049 --> 00:07:15,717
Then she probably gave it to the guests
that came to stay,

231
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:19,237
asking them to send the postcard out
after they returned to their homes.

233
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:19,704
I see!

234
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,439
I see!

235
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,375
People from all over Japan
come to hotels or inn,

237
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,376
if we check the hotel roster.

238
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,278
We can figure out where they came from!

239
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,446
Which means

240
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:31,716
your mother is an employee of
hotel or an inn...

242
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,119
Um. why don't we take a drive to Atami!
Either way!

244
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,254
Well, I don't see why not...

245
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:40,392
But if we find her,
I hope you're, goingsto pay the fee?

247
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,727
Yeah...a whole lot!

248
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,730
Unlike that lady. I'm rich...

249
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,503
Come on. let's go and get it over witht

251
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,206
My schedulejgjopen
only today and tomorrow...

253
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,075
Nast kid...

254
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,077
You're kind of like Conan...

255
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,013
Huh? How dare you...

256
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:11,356
No, I have no idea...
We don't carry postcards like these here.

258
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,424
I see...

259
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,292
Thank you very much.

260
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:17,996
Ghads...
We come all the way to Atami and...

262
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,500
Ghads...
We come all the way to Atami and...

265
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:26,171
We're sweating it out here
without even going to a hot spring...

269
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,941
Maybe a postcard didn't suffice
as a lead after all 7?

271
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:39,484
Uh, Ran...
Carry me please!

274
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,089
Oh, if you're tired,
I'll piggy back you.

276
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,092
I want to be carried!
I want to be hugged'.not piggy backed!

278
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,693
Hey, you...

279
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,363
My goodness...
Talk about spoiled...

283
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,835
This is just about where
that lady/has a mole...

285
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,702
Huh 2

287
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:05,310

00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:11,082

292
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:15,637

You don't hayverto:do that

299
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,896

aboutwjust where it us...

301
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,765
But. I want to be sure. .

302

308
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,315
but this set of four postcards
didn't sell too well...

310
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,185
so having no other choice
we divided it among ourselves...

313
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,321
since we couldn't return it to
the publisher either...

316
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,390
Wow! It's just like you said, Conan!

317
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,693

this inappropriate question but,

IS there a woman by.the name of Atsuko

321
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,235

323
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,171

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,373
And? What's up today?
Did you come to spend the night here?

340
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,441

00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,825
I came here just to check things out

349
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,561
but I guess it's my lucky day
to have the entire cast out here today

351
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,097
This is sure going to make a great:story!

352
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,702
How come he knows about the mother...?

353

Uh. why don't we stay?

357
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:22,847
Maybe Kazuki's mother is"working/here
under a different name.

359
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,782
Phooey .. I

360

Quiet!

375
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,848
We're so busy as it is that we can't be
bothered with extra guests you know!!

377
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,317
Don't push your weight around
just because you're a bit famous!

379
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,722
Phooey!

381
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,159
Is that the attitude to take
towards guests?

383
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,731
You gave me your word, editor...

384
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,835
Keep a page open for me, okay...

385
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:20,572
If this isn't duff gen. the book will sell...

386
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,311
Because it's about the number one
kid actor. Kazuki Kinukawa's father

388
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:31,231
being a killer...

389
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:39,356
Ah. I'm really full ..hic!

390
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:44,212
Oh, goodness. Thanks to you,

00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:49,417
Sigh... Huh?.

394
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,572

400
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,419

Being able to take a bath with Kazuki
will be a memory of a life time!

423
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,005
Oh. but...

424
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:46,758

425
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,295

Yes... because we wait till
all the guests are done...

430
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,048

See, it shows below, doesn't it?
Il.'-+()...

564
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,617
There is a mole on the chest
of the woman

566
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,686
who is choking Mr. Kamoshita's neck
fromibehind...

568
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,154
Ghads! Bummers.!

569
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,692
No doubt about-it!! The killer is a woman
with a mole on her chést. Mr. Mourn!

571
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,793
Oh, true...

572
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:09,160
Oh. true...

573
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:09,627
Huh'...

574
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:10,228
Huh'...

575
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:14,132
Which means the killer is
The killer is my...

577
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:14,399
Agh...

578
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:14,899
IP nil
Aah...

580
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,067
Kazuki?!

581
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:16,666
Kazuki?!

584
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:17,168
Kazuki?»

586
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,357
Wipe yourself...

587
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,294
Kazuki, where are you?

589
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:54,505
You came to this inn to look for
Kazuki Kinukawa's mother...

591
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,077
Yeah... The clue to his mother was
that she has a mole on her chest but

593
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,780
I didn't think that there'd be a mole
on the chest of this killer too...

595
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,682
I mean, it's obvious. isn't it?

596
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:08,986
The mature is. rtawe and the face of
who really took this picture?

598
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:13,458
The picture is static.:and the face of
the killer is conveniently not taken!

600
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,261
It could be that the killer took
this picture deliberately

602
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,531
and rigged the time and date on it
to create an alibi...

604
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:23,134
I don't think so

605
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,135
Huh?

606
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,137
Not him again

607
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:30,074
Because the killer has the string
around the man's neck

609
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,809
and is pulling the string with both hands,
right?

611
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,947
The killer can't press the shutter
with both hands full!

613
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,982
If the killer took the picture,

614
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,000
I think the killer would.wear clothes

615
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:42,153
so that you can't tell
if it's a man or a woman!

618
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,091
The killer probably didn't know
that a picture was being,taken!

620
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,860
Right! Pops?!

622
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,228
Y. Yeah

623
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,132
Why did Mr. Kamoshita have
his cell phone on him

625
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,233
when he was being attacked
by the killer.

627
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,802
Maybe he was talking to somebody?

628
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,471
Then, why don't you try
the re-dial button?

630
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,406
Why don't you keep your mouth-shut...

631
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,275
Agh!

632
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:08,412
It seems he was talking to someone
10 minutes before he took the picture!!

634
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,251
What?! Kamoshita was?!
Are you serious, officer?!

636
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,485
Yes...

637
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,872
If you don't. mindfil-d like you to give me
your:name and tellkme: what you do...

639
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:21,092
I'm .1Zumiya, the editor of
Weekly*ot" magazine.

641
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,962
Kamoshita is a writer who brings us
a lot of scoop articles.

643
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,664
He called to say

644
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,268
that the woman with the scoop story
came to his room a little after 23:30.

646
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:37,208
Pi] nw
Hejsaidjthat the woman is taking
a shower in his room no"

649
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:41,012
and to not worry

650
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,680
because he'll make sure that he takes a
picture of the woman with 'his cell phone.

652
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,867
And who is this woman with the scoop...

653
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,487
The mother called Atsuko,
who left the kid actor Kazuki Kinugawa

655
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,389
in front of the door of a church
when he was a baby!

657
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,092
She seems to have been a devil
threatening Kazuki's actor's agency

659
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,296
to dish out 20,000,000 yen yen if they
didn't want her to publicize the fact

661
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:02,300
that his father is a fugitive
for having killed somebody.

663
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,703
Although-the agency didn#t really believe
her story at first.

665
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,070
She knew the name of the church

666
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,839
as well as the characteristics of
Kazuki's body in detail,

668
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,760
so they deposited the amount
into her account...

670
00:20:12,761 --> 00:20:15,596
Since allitheif dealings were
carried out by e-mail

672
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:18,983
he had no idea of what
she looked like or how she sounded...

674
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,485
Kamoshita,
who smelled that there was a scoop.

676
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,755
Wentstointerview her in-person.

677
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,358
That's why he brought up
the 20.000.000 yen

679
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,894
to see if anybody would come up. front.

680
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,629
Inspector!

682
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:37,034
The waitresses that have no alibi
after 23:48 are here!

684
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,005
You a

685
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,772
You ar

686
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,293
Oh...hello again...

687
00:20:45,294 --> 00:20:47,378
And? What do you want with us?

688
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,879
Did something happen?

689
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,247
Did something happen?

690
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,182
There was a murder...

691
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,516
A person called Mr. Kamoshita.

692
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:55,185
Who was staying in this room
was strangled...

694
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:56,187
What?!

695
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,221
Oh, no...

696
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,155
No joke 7?

698
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,095
I'm going to have to check
your bodies a little bit...

700
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,236
Like the killer whose picture was taken
when she killed Mr. Kamoshita!!

702
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,573
Hey, wait a minute? Are you telling us
to strip naked right here?

704
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,107
What?!

705
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:16,574
Oh... No

706
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,241
Oh... No

707
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:21,178
of course arwoman police will be here
and you'll be checked in another room...

709
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,514
O, Oh, okay then...

710
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,316
Then hurry up and get with it,

711
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,385
because we still have work left to do!

712
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,453
There's no need for that!

713
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:33,190
See! I have no mole.

714
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,062
MH. Hey... Ms. Bessho?!

715
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:41,499
Right...it's not like we're going to
Iose anything so why not.

717
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,235
Oooooht!

719
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:48,306
Go on! They're going to suspect you
if you don't, Ms. Kusano!

721
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,473
Oh. all right...

723
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,110
Oooh...

724
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,578
Cool it: Pops...

725
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:58,849
Huh... 7? (
Y. You have a mole on,your chest!!

727
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,451
Take a good look. will you!

728
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,853
My mole is on the opposite side 4
when compared to the picture, isn't it?

730
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,255
CA Rooo

731
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,990
Rather than checking on our moles,

732
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,791
why don't you go check the fingerprints
on the murder weapon

734
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,527
You found it, didn't you?

735
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,996
The-black string that was in the picture
a while ago!

737
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,296
Oh, well...

738
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,998
Oh. well...

739
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,267
We've been looking for it for a while...

740
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,937
but we can't find it anywhere...

741
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:24,025
The black string that is
thought to be over 1. meter...

743
00:22:24,026 --> 00:22:26,444
Right. the problem is
the murder weapon...

745
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:30,698
and that mole...
