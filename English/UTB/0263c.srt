1
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,371
The heart contains mysteries,
stars and snow sparkle for the two.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:09,075
Naniwa is the stage for
a tag team match of Conan and Heiji

5
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:12,378
He sees. through the.one and. only truth,
a child in appearance with the.l.Q. of an-adult,

7
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:14,714
No case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan.

10
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:56,749
OSAKA DOUBLE MYSTERY
THE NANIWA SWORDSMAN AND
HIDEYOSHI TOYOTOMI'S CASTLE

13
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,219
Yes! that's it! This is my wallet!

14
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,154
You're very-luc +

15
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,890
I figured you might be coming back
right away

17
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,560
so I kept it here instead.of giving it
to the police!

19
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:11,430
It's a veryiprecibus wallet. isn't.it?
It was-filled with amulets

21
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,766
It sure is! Thank you so much. ma-am!

22
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,836
You mean you had more than
1 amulet in there?

24
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,372
I bought a charm to chase away evil'too!

25
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:21,173
So that we wouldn't be involved in
another case

27
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,609
and have it ruin your visit to Osaka
Iike last time...

29
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,210
How sweet....!

30
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,144
What?!

31
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,947
A burning man fell from the tower?!

32
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,148
Areryou sure about:that?,

33
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,085
eah the police are there and
everything's going crazy!

36
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,890
It didn't work. none of them...

37
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:38,958
I guess not...

38
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:46,298
Inspector OtakHyou sure are busy...

39
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,701
Two murders two days straight...

40
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,970
ell, it's my job...

41
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,239
It's amazing though,

42
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,174
how did you know the victim's
name was Yuji Kato...

44
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,777
I looked on his badge...

45
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,445
Is badge...

46
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,981
you mean the crest on his chest?

47
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,850
That's Hideyoshi's crest,
he Goshichi paulownia...!

49
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:09,588
As soon as I saw it I knew he was the
Hideyoshi character from their group

51
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,457
$0 I had them come and identify the body!

52
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,859
What do you mean. Hideyoshi character?

53
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,328
As part of the tours entertainment.

54
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,666
We have each member act as a famous
person from the Warring States period

56
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,269
and also have aspenalty game

57
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,440
For instance, I'm Mitsuhide and
yasu...

59
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,177
Wakisaka is Nobunaga and
IS Nene...

62
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,381
and Kato over there was Hideyoshi...

63
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,184
I see: that sure sounds like a lot of fun...

64
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,187
« But I don't understand how you could
Iose track of

66
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,788
one of your tour members and
him end up like this...

68
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,056
Uh, well...

69
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,993
He disappeared so suddenly and
we were looking for him all this time...

71
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,529
He was wearing a flashy fleece outfit

72
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,865
so we figured we could spot him
right away...

74
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:57,670
Who'd have thought he'd fall from
there in a ball of fire...

76
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:02,475
By the way. can you think of a reason why
» Mr. Kato would commit suicide?

78
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,009
Uh, no. I don't have the slightest idea...

79
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,679
How do you know it was suicide?

80
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,283
First off it's raining so hard. no one
would go out there on the roof!

82
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,954
And then he:was wearing clothes made of
fleece, which is very flammable...!

84
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,224
That proves he went out on the roof
himself and set himself on fire!

86
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,558
Uh, huh...

87
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,561
but, you sure do come across a lot of
urders, don't you...

89
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,498
maybe you're cursed or something?

90
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,564
Not really,

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,302
the Chief of Police's son comes across
them more often...

93
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,372
Eh? Is Heiji here too?

94
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,444
Yes. He and Conan went inside the
castle just a little while ago...

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,915
Hey Kudo, be careful, it's slippery up there
because of the rain!

98
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,386
Ow embarrassing...
I feel like a trained monkey...

100
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,393
Did you find something!?

101
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,196
There's a lot of teeny tiny pieces of
omething up here...

103
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,268
It's a lighter

104
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,372
Could this be the lighter he used...

105
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,708
It doesn't make sense though...
why Is it here...

107
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:11,143
Eh...?

108
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:11,510
Eh...?

109
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,180
Hat's this mark...

110
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,250
just don't believe it...

111
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,252
why would Kato commit suicide...

113
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,321
I don't believe it either...

114
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,724
he was really looking forward to
coming to Osaka...

116
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:30,462
I guess you nevergknow what people are
really thinking about...

118
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,232
Maybe he'd planned all along

119
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,936
to commit suicide here
in the land ofiHideyoshi Toyotomu...

121
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,205
All we have to do is find what he used to
set himself on fire with

123
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,473
Right... That's all we need to find...

124
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,875
We found it!

125
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:47,346
It was_.on.the roof of the tower...
it's a highter!

127
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,417
Why isn't that the lighter Kate had?

128
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,218
Yes. I think it is

129
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,019
That settles it, it was a suicide!

130
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,155
I wouldn't be too sure about that!

131
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:56,455
Eh...?

132
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,024
The cover. on this lighter was closed...!

133
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,628
Do you think someone committing suicide
would. take the time to close the cSver?

135
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,996
But Heiji...

136
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,466
maybe the cover closed when
he dropped it...

138
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,537
If that were the case we should have
found it further down theiroof...

140
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:16,542
Besides, it looked like something else was
there before the lighter was put down...

142
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,076
What do you mean, something else..7?7

143
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:23,482
When we found the lighter, there was a
dry spot in a strange shape under it...

145
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:28,087
not a rectangle shape like this lighter,
twas a nice fan shape...

147
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:34,560
I'm pretty sure something round was put
there before it started to rain...

149
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,697
after the rain started, that round thing
was replaced with the lighter...

151
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,699
Isn't that right. kid...

152
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,300
# Yup!

153
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,437
But Heiji, what was that thing...?
What do you think that round thing was...

155
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,973
Beatsime:.ilthaven:t'figured that.out yet...

156
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:52,177
Bull think it has something 10 do with the
Iittle chips.all over the place...

158
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,981
Inspector Otaki! We've laid out all of the
victim's personal belongings out

160
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,287
Wallet, watch and cellular phone...

161
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,290
Keys. cigarettes
and a piece of something...

163
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,824
Huh...? A scroll...

164
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,695
What in the world...?

165
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,564
Only the word dragon is on this thing...

166
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,902
And what is this from

167
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,038
It looks like piece of pottery...

168
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:20,706
Hmm? That piece .

169
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,240
Hmm? That piece...

170
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,776
Isn't-<itspossible that piece is theisame \

171
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,712
as the ones they found )
on-the 6ther burned bodies?

173
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:31,817
My dad and your father were-«talking
about it in the car last night...

175
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:35,621
there were 2 other burned bodies. one
was found in the inner moat 13 years ago

177
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,290
and the other was found just recently
in the outer moat,

179
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,459
both victims had pieces of pottery that
Iooked the same.

181
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:46,498
And I heard them say that the one they
found recently had 848 written on iti:

183
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,702
848+? What does that mean...?'" +

184
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,838
No one was really sure

185
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,307
but it seems that those pieces
J are a part of some kind of treasure

187
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,375
Treasure...?

188
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:58,377
I'm not making it up!

189
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,446
They were whispering
ke 'it was a secret...!

191
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:03,315
They said something about huge fortune
the great man left behind...!

193
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,051
Did you say huge fortune?!

194
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,521
Are you sure you're not making
all of this up...

196
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:11,190
Hey Hattori

197
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:11,924
Huh

198
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,460
Look at this piece of pottery...

199
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,664
There's shiny stuff stuck on
the inside of it .

201
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,400
Hey...isn't that gold?

202
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,471
Think so Lou ws not much -
so I don t-think it's much of a trea tire...

204
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,141
Boy. I just don't understand this case...!

205
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,710
It's a mysterious enough that Mr. Kato
Ieft the tour and went up the roof

207
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:37,216
but it's even harder to explain
why he suddenly burst into flames...

209
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,551
And the biggest question...

210
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,087
Why Mr. Kato grabbed

211
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,591
the.umbrella... just before he died...!!

212
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,894
Umbrella could refer to rain.

213
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:51,897
And rain makes me think of
the Ryuko rock

215
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,565
right here at Osaka Castle...

216
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,300
What's that?

217
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,568
You mean you don't know...?

218
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,437
Here at Osaka Castle,?

219
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:58,937
standing on both sides of
the Sakura Gate, protecting the tow

221
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,974
standing on both sides of
the Sakura Gate, protecting the tow
Sakura Gate Ryuko Rocks

224
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,308
we have rocks called*Ryuko Rocks...!

225
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,413
That's what they've been called
since long ago because

227
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,681
it's said that when it rains, the figures 4
of-a dragon and tiger:appear on them

229
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:11,483
Rain.

230
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,351
Rain...

231
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,353
Hmm...

232
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,220
Let me borrow that for awhile!

233
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:15,721
Hey?!

234
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:15,954
Hey?!

235
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,556
What's going on?!

236
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,291
That's evidence!

237
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,234
Ahaha...

238
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,702
her:story might just be true...

239
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:36,508
Yeah, there's still a possibility it could
e hidden somewhere...

241
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,510
the treasure of Hideyoshi, the man
alled Lord of Gold"...

243
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,448
Is somewhere: in Osaka Castle...

244
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,750
1, treasure.

245
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,351
Hideyoshi's treasure...

246
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,423
Yeah, it's me...

247
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,759
Don't make a move yet...!

248
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,762
It doesn't look like the copsil be
Ieaving soon.

250
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,499
Don't worry about it!
The thing we want's right in. front of me!

252
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,501
Make sure you've got everything.ready...!

253
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:21,553
What?! You know what the treasure
Hideyoshi left is?!

255
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,154
Are you sure?

256
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,057
Yes, I'm pretty sure about it...!

257
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:29,695
The clue is the piece of pottery
Mr. Kato had...

259
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:33,098
take a good leek at it,
there's just a little bit:here and there

261
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,167
but you .can see that
there's gold stuck on the inside

263
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,435
You're right...

264
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,038
But how do you knew there's a lot of
treasure just by looking at this piece...

266
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,308
Now. put it together with this scroll that v
Mr. Kato had and look again carefully!

268
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,847
But this scroll only has the word, dragon
on the upper right hand written-on it...

270
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,850
What is this...?!

271
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,787
Several sheets of paper were pasted
over the word that was written there...

273
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,790
It's just like the Ryuko Rocks,at
Osaka Castle,

275
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,793
when you wet the paper,
the word underneath appears....!

277
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:06,265
Yes but most of the words have been
burnt and you can't read them...

279
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,201
And what about this?
What's this drawing on the left?

281
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,003
Isn't that a gourd?

282
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,273
I The gourd is the symbol I
on Hideyoshi's flag. it's his standard!

284
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,207
Eh?!

285
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:20,012
So is that mean that piece might have
come from pottery shaped like a gourd?

287
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,181
And are you saying
that it was filled with gold?

289
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,585
But according to this diagram,

290
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:30,656
It was about 1 shaku high...
which is only about 30 centimeters...

292
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,591
No matter how much money
you stuffed in it,

294
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,726
it's so small,
it wouldn't add up to much...

296
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,395
Did you forget?

297
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,399
I 1:8 been said that whenever General
Hideyoshi won a battle,

299
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:45,337
he:added a small gourd and that's how
'his golden standard was created...

301
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,873
The bottle gourds....!!

302
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,475
Bottle gourds, you mean?!

303
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,743
It. it can't be...?!

304
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,945
That's right...

305
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,548
if there were 1,000 of the same thing.
That would be some treasure...!

307
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,818
And if you were to consider the history
behind it, it would be priceless...!

309
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,555
The burnt body
13 years ago had a piece,

311
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:08,260
so did the other recent body
and now Mr. Kato, it could mea that

313
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,997
maybe:.they-were after the treasure...

314
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:16,735
but they were killed by someone who.
Wanted it all for themselves...

316
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,571
I don't understand though...

317
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,241
how did the Chief of Police
and your father know

319
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,811
that it:-meant a huge treasure just
y looking at the 2 pieces...

321
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,547
They hadn't seen the scroll yet...

322
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,483
They probably knew
by looking at the shape...

324
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,219
The piece my father
was looking at in the car,

326
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,022
Iooked like it came from the
top of the gourd

328
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:40,158
and he said the words 848 was
written on it...

330
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,627
I ORB

331
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:46,365
848 is a number between 1 and 1,000...

332
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:50,902
, If both of the pieces had gold stuck to
them on the inside,

334
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,904
that theory might be correct...

335
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,375
But that sounds like a fairy tale...

336
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,976
B. but it isn't entirely impossible...!

337
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:02,681
It's been said that even after Hideyoshi
died, leyasu was intimidated by him

339
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:06,451
because of all the gold and silver he'd
stored in Osaka Castle...!

341
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,621
There's a legend that when Hideyoshi
wanted to purify the water in the well,

343
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:15,394
he put a huge amount of gold in the
Kinmeisui directly in front of the tower!

345
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:19,264
Even if that's true, what makes you. think,
this is refers to hidden treasure...?

347
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,868
For all you know, this scroll ¢ould just
be a blueprint...

349
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,002
Stupid!

350
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:28,140
Hiding gold in pottery and layering
sheets of paper!over the scroll is

352
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,276
the proof someone deliberately wanted
to hide something...!

354
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,577
That scroll's the dragons chapter..!

356
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,047
WCrmeans st $ sO O:-VIOUS...

357
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,214
About the tiger...

358
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:41,153
If that scroll with the dragon is like
the Ryuko Rock

360
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,289
and the drawing of a gourd appeared
when it got wet...

362
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:47,292
then there should be a scroll with
a tiger somewhere too....!

364
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,760
And what's more.

365
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,764
There's 2 high possibility that scroll will
show us where the gourds are hidden...!

367
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,933
Isn't that right...? Heij:...

368
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,267
Isnt'that: right... 7? Heiji...

369
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,202
M£ Mr. Toyama. sir... 7?!

370
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,670
Wh. what brings you here...?

371
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,806
I gave himfa call!

372
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,674
The prefecture! police's main
headquarters is fight over there!

374
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,675
J Huh?

375
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,446
It seemed to be linked to a case
dad was involved in before,

377
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,980
besides if I didn't do something like this,

378
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,249
you'd never tear yourself away
from this place. would you Hep!

380
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,186
She's gone and butted in again...

381
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,389
Kazuha's right, let us take care of this...

382
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,856
Yes, listen to him"

383
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:23,195
I know a real nice place in the Shimbashi
direction of Osaka Castle!

385
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,796
Let's have dinner there!

386
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,264
Be:quiet!!

387
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,266
Someone.died rightlin front of our eyes

388
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,602
how can you stuff your face...

389
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,305
I mean, have dinner...
it wouldn't feel right, would it...

391
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,941
So. you should just forget about me

392
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:39,811
do have dinner with Ran.
Won't mind Ka ..Xazuha...

394
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,947
To heck with you. .!

395
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,750
Let's go Ran!
We'll just go without them!

397
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:47,686
WwW. wait a minute Kazuha...

398
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,934
Come on, quick, let's go!
It's a super delicious Italian restaurant!

400
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:07,005
Excuse me, would it be-all right if we got
something to eat too?

403
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,675
We havenst had\anything to eat
since lunch

405
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:14,946
My clothes got wet from the rain so
I'm going to the hotel first and-change...

407
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,348
Uh, wait...

408
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,816
We'll be right back...

409
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:20,285
the hotel we're staying in is close by

410
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,622
All right then but don't be long!

411
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,694
That voice... it can't be...

412
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,468
Hey Otaki...

413
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,335
Yes sir!

414
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,870
Listen

415
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,409
Yes sir, I understand!
I'll tell my men right away!

417
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,744
Rr Be careful!

418
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:46,945
Yes sir!

419
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:56,021
Heizo... it's me...

420
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,760
You did. it for Heiji; didn't you...?
Calling your father like that...

422
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,627
E 1 bide'?

423
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:06,097
You knew your father was deeply
involved in that case

425
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,633
so you figured if you called him in

426
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,569
he'd fill Heiji in with all the information
he'd be dying to know...

428
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,239
But you didnit want him to catch on
SO you used that tone with him

430
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,242
So, what if I did... I love seeing it...

431
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:21,780
I love seeing how his face glows
whenever he solves a case...

433
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,382
I'm such a fool, aren't I...

434
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,784
Yes. a major fool!

435
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:27,586
A major fool?!

436
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,222
And so am I...

437
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,329
It's sO frustrating. but there's something
so wonderful about Shinichi

439
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,331
when he gets like that...

440
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,066
Uh huh...

441
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,369
Oh, but-.only when he gets like
thatsthough

443
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,071
Isn't that night Conan, you agree
don't you...

445
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,475
Oh no, I forgot to bring Conan along!

446
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,410
Sot Is
You're right...

448
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,950
Hey Hattori

449
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,888
Take a look at this. I found something
strange in a strange place.

451
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,022
A battery...?

452
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,624
All a minute...

453
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,693
if that came from when Mr. Kato
burned up...

455
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,195
ght... it was no suicide.

456
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,865
It was murder...!

457
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,168
Don't worry about it!

458
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,306
Heiji and your father are with him

459
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,110
and besides, there are a lot of police
around here...!

461
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,178
Nothing's going to happen...

462
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,816
The victim's name is Maho Katagiri...
a member of that tour...

464
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,952
according to Kazuha,

465
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:11,022
her coat caught on fire and she fell
into the moat as if she were collapsing...

467
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,560
but the cause of death is
a blow to the back of her dead...

469
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:18,697
She probably got it when she fell,

470
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,767
I think she hit her head
n the girder over there...

472
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,636
Was it suicide?

473
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,439
It looks that way, at least for now...

474
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,443
Are you sure she wasn't holding anything
else beside the lighter?

476
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,778
Yes. I'm sure, that's how it looked to me.

477
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,248
Was there anybody neariher?

478
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,150
NO not near her but...

479
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,587
There was somebody near the bridge's
entrance. wasn't there?

481
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,320
Yes...

482
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,322
That's it!

483
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,724
That's who set her on fire!

484
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,791
I don't think it was possible though...

485
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,862
that person was on the same side
as we were...

487
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,264
I definitely think it was suicide though...

488
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,533
Don't be stupid!
No way it was suicide!

490
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,069
There's got to be something here!

491
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,804
Something to prove it was murder!
There has t » bel!

493
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,070
Something to prove it was murder!
There has to be!!

495
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:01,740
S. stop that Heiji!!

496
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,719
D. dad...?!

497
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,989
Heiji, stop acting like
you know everything...!

499
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,691
Don't you understand...?

500
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,694
Do you know
how much-trouble you cause

502
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,562
every time you meddle
IN police matters

504
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,031
Calm down sir!

505
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,635
Heiji's just trying to solve the crime
in his own way...

507
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,970
oops. sorry...

508
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,839
Mr. Mouri, that may be how you see it.

509
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,476
But when it comes to this kid, you don't
call his methods police work...!

511
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,677
He's a pest...!

512
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,881
People flatter him
by calling him a high school detective

514
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,016
and that's given him a swollen ego,

515
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,419
he interferes with our investigations
by handling the evidence

517
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,621
and the victim's bodies
all because it's his hobby...

519
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:53,558
he's nothing more than
a crime scene assaulter...!

521
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,162
To prove my point, look around 2«people
have died right in front of'his eyes

523
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,030
and he hasn't done anything to stop it!

524
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,031
He was so sure
that nothing else would happen

526
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:04,169
because the police had the area covered!

527
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,906
Actually...you could say
we were just as much at fault...

529
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,707
at any rate...

530
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,110
Meddlesome amateurs should leave....!

531
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:14,379
Get-out of my sight, immediately!!

532
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:14,813
S, sir...!

533
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:15,280
S. sir...

534
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,047
S, sir...!

535
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,849
You're being too hard on him

536
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:18,716
Otaki... 4

537
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,987
Did you forget?
I told you to follow thatfguy, didn't I...?

539
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,858
Oh, that's right!
No wonder the Chief's so... 4

541
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:31,195
es.:. that's his way of showing
he cares about his son:...!

543
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,137
Otaki, are these both murders?

544
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,405
Uh, no...

545
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,608
Regarding Mr. Katoés case.
He fell from the tower as he burned

547
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:49,147
and we found a lighter on the roof with
he victim's fingerprints on it...

549
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:55,420
As for Ms. Katagiri, she lit the fire on
herself and fell into the moat.

551
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,156
Kazuha herself witnessed this...

552
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,825
there are several things
we can't explain

554
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,028
but I'm almost certain
there were both suicides...

556
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:08,299
If that's the case, then 2 or 3 men should
be enough of cover the work here...

558
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,970
Toyama, lets got.!

559
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,241
The police have
more important work to do,

561
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:18,643
we can't spend so much time
on a case as minor as this...

563
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,246
Ch, Chief...!

564
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,451
Heizo...

565
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,053
1... you can't be thinking.

566
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,266
Aw, don't look so disappointed Heir.

567
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,733
The Chief's probably angry

568
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:47,472
because 2 people died
SO close to headquarters...

570
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,275
Still, he didn't have to hit him...

571
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,745
Maybe it's all the killer's fault...

572
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,079
Remember, the story

573
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,252
Aboutgyour dad, driving us home and
they were talking about some pottery...

575
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,088
Well, there's a continuation to that...!

576
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:08,760
They said it was possible that when the
burnt body was found 13 years ago

578
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,162
there was a rash of armed burglaries

579
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,232
and that the burglar might
unexpectedly be discovered...

581
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,568
Armed burglaries?

582
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,503
Yes, there were 5 consecutive incidents

583
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,906
7 people were killed and
the vicious killer is still on the loose...

585
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,308
Are you saying that

586
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:28,579
Hattori's father thinks the killer in these
recent cases is the same person...

588
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,048
Aha, now I get it...

589
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,717
Heizo didn't want to put his son.in danger

590
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,386
sO he acted coldly to distance V
him from the case,

592
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,589
that's so touching...
it makes me want to cry...

594
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,259
I Yeah... it makes me want to cry too...

595
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,863
Who'd have thought
my old man would go soft like that...!

597
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,065
He. Hew... .?

598
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:50,668
I don't take orders very well....!

599
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,604
If I get pushed. I push back...!

600
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,741
I'm going to solve the case and shove
the killer right up my father's nose

602
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,544
Ha. haha, haha...!!

603
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,880
What he's saying is he's more stupid
ham obedient...

605
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,683
but that's strange...

606
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:08,286
You'd think that being his father,

607
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:12,423
he would know what his son wouldn't
give up so easily...
