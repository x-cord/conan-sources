What is the name of the Jodo painting
depicting the descension of Buddha on earth?

16
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,994
The "Shouju-raikou-zu", right!

17
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:12,865
Hey. hey, hey... get done with it! I can feel
my brain beginning to hemorrhage!

19
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,736
I can't help it! I have a
Japanese history test tomorrow

21
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:20,439
I didn't have time to study with all the
extracurricular activities I have!

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,408
Then, why not do it at home?

24
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,510
Did I hear you say something?

25
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,646
You're telling me to stay
home when I was the one who won

27
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,648
the meal coupon for dinner
in Chinatown in the lottery?

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,551
That's why, I'm telling you to
do it when you get back home!

31
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,688
That's not enough time!

32
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,190
There're a lot of TV programs
I want to watch tonight...

34
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,161
But, reading inside a

36
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,930
Worry not! I have superb sense of

42
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,689
He was standing in the ran

43
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:17,763
But I can't tell where it was...
A backstreet in a strange city...

45
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,768

Shinichi's face...

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,021
Why are you wet?

52
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,390
Why that lonely look?

53
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:47,993
Tell me, Shinichi...

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,997
Hey, Ran... Ran. .!

Nothing

300
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:55,220
Come and sit here away from your
pigheaded father. Let's talk...

302
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,194
Tell me what you want. I'll serve
some up on a plate for you.

304
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,327
Oh, thanks...

305
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:04,529

Hey! I said no "pitans
and egg dishes!

309
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,539
What's wrong?

310
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,278
I'm allergic to eggs.
I'hate even the sight of them.

312
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,813
Is that so...

313
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:27,452
Anyway, young lady, eat all you want.

314
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,488

Hey, kid, this is a Chinese restaurant.
They don't serve curry here.

324
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:43,368
What? I want curry!
I want to eat curry! Curry! Curry! Curry!

326
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,039
No curry?

344
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,047

346
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,983

352
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,028
What? Dang!

353

354
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,101

Gwa-a-d, now she's takingycare of me...

356
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,610
Oh! Here it comes!

357
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,380
Peking duck here is the best!

358
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,648
Oh. wow

359
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,817
By the way, are there
actresses who you like?

361
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,286
Yes! There are two!

362
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,956
One is Yukiko Fujimine.

363
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:13,659
Actually, she is the mother
of a friend since kindergarten

365
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,760
I've idolized her since I was a child.

367
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,696
Who is the other one?

368
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,432
The other is an American actress...

369
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,803
Sharon Vinyard though
she died a year ago...

371
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,072
Oh! That great actress!

372
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,777
I had the opportunity to meet her once.
She was wonderful .

374
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,880
When did that happen?
Meeting an American celebrity...

376
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,115
When you weren't around!

377
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,018
Yukiko Fujimine and Sharon Vinyard...

378
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,187
more substance than ,
glitz seems to be your taste...

380
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:45,257
They both have gained ,
Iegendary status .

382
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:52,197
Iumph! If she had died, s
he could have been a legend, too...

384
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,900
Huh? Who's she?

385
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:20,892
The victim is Mr. Shiro
Kawabata age 46, film producer.

387
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,730
Death by asphyxiation triggered
)Y cyanide poisoning...

389
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:33,505
Geez cyanide, arsenic, caustic soda where
do criminals these days get these toxins?

391
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,076
And, did he eat
something before he died?

393
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,711
Yes, a peking duck.

394
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:43,115
According to the waiter who served him

395
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,917
he started to suffer right
after he put it in his mouth...

397
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:51,556
Ho. ho... Peking duck for his
Iast dinner! What a way to go!

399
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:56,995
But, poison was not
found in that piece of duck meat,

401
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,732
and the waiter did not
have it in his possession.

403
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:07,539
The victim probablJlhad cyanide on his
hand before he bit into the food...

405
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:12,711
ee... That means that the murderer

406
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:18,383
Was sitting among you
here at the table?

408
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:23,155
Anyway. I would like to ask all
of you your relationship with the victim...

410
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,824
Yes, member of the
movie production staff...

412
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,095
The female lead in the movie got
hurt before the shooting started...

414
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,464
That's why we were discussing it...

415
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,635
Whether we should find a replacement
or scrap the project altogether...

417
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:40,305
Then, Mr. Kawabata took
on a liking for that girl

419
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,875
and invited her and
her father to our table...

421
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:49,347
Hum? You, with the beard!
I've seen you somewhere before!

423
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,285
Yes, of course! I am the...

424
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,854
Probably a criminal on the run!

426
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:02,160
No. no, no I'm Kogoro Moun!!

427
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,795
M-Mourni!

428
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,096
Not that...

429
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,598
Famous detective

430
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,566
Yes, yes!

431
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,770
That two-b
detective called Smoking Kogoro...

433
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,972
Sleeping! Not Smoking!

434
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,575
Inspector! I found positive toxic reaction!

435
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,509
All right!

436
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,109
All night!

437
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,211
We didn't find it in the other dishes...

438
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,679
We didn't find it in the other dishes...

439
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:27,519
Cyanide has been found on the chopsticks,
plate, and towel the victim used

441
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,522
It was strongest on the towel...

442
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:36,061
Who sat beside him when he fell?

443
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,331
Me! I sat on his right!

444
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,132
Then, who was at his left?

446
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,405
I sat on his left eating my dumpling...

447
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,075
That makes things easy...

448
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,981
the person who poisoned the victim by I
acing his towel with cyanide is...

450
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,150
You, Mr Detective!

451
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,385
What! Me!

452
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,088
A kid like him won't be able to.commit
murder, and with you sitting on his right,

454
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,625
switching must have been easy!

455
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:11,262
If the victim was right-handed, he-most
probably had his towel on his right!

457
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,197
Hey. hey...

458
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,903
You expected him to wipe his hands
before he ate his Peking duck, right¢

460
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,271
How's that!

461
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,408
I think I've seen you
somewhere before...

463
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,777
Don't try to distract attention!

464
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,146
I have the same feeling...

465
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:28,980
You do, too, eh?

466
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:33,084
I've only seen your face on
TV and newspapers!

468
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,453
Inspector Yokomizo! Sir...

469
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,887
Huh? What is it?

470
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,123
Yokomizo...

471
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,560
Oh! Yes! You're Yokomizo! Yokomizo!

472
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:47,332
I suspect that you committed a
and had to shave your head.

474
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:51,870
That's why you're so embarrassed and
are pretending not to know us!

476
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,139
Hey! Hey! You, the great pretender!

477
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,742
Well, to tell you the truth, that hair you
had was quite unkempt.

479
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,778
You look much cleaner...

480
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:05,517
You are talking about my brother
Sango with the Shizuoka police.

482
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,720
I am Jugo Yokomizo
of the Kanagawa Police!

484
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,389
A brother?

486
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,457
For real?

487
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,728
It appears that the naive and trusting brother
of mine respected you, but I'm different!

489
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,333
I don't have an inkling of respect for
slaty peope I ece ec ives.

491
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:22,968
Sir... Inspector...

492
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,569
Oh. kept you waiting...

493
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:29,107
Look what I found on the
jeans the victim was wearing...

495
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,676
Some sort of the stain...

496
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:37,349
Oh, that's Mr. Kawabata's soup!
I spilled it when I sat next to him...

498
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,450
What? Next to him?

499
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,920
I thought that you and the
kid were sitting next to him!

501
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:46,024
Mr. Kawabata changed
seats just before he fainted...

503
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:53,064
He took a seat between Ran and me.
Later, Conan sat next to him.

505
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:58,570
Then, before he changed seats,
he was sitting next to the girl and...

507
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,504
It was me...

508
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,975
But, I just happened to sit
there because Mr. Kawabata

510
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,511
invited that detective
and others to our table...

512
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:12,884
Incidentally, before Mr. Mouri arrived,
we sat beside Mr. Kawabata...

514
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:17,288
But then, we were seated
quite apart from each other...

516
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:22,293
I-I was seated right at opposite of him, ¥
so I'm innocent.

518
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,996
We will know after we investigate...

519
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,265
Then, why not check his jeans?

520
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:32,270
Mr. Kawabata changed his seat
after he got the soup on his lap...

522
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,539
He wasn't trying to
wipe it off with the towel.

524
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:40,812
If you check the stain, you'll probably know
when the towel was tampered with, right?

526
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:41,679
Isn't that right, Uncle Kogoro?

527
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,647
Isn't that right, Uncle Kogoro?

528
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,250
Well... yeah...

529
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,088
What! There was no cyanide in the stain?

530
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,723
Did you check it thoroughly?

531
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,959
Yeah... the waiter said he replaced the
chopsticks that fell on the floor

533
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,299
with the soup on the victim's order there
was no cyanide on the chopsticks either...

535
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:06,604
That means, the culprit replaced
hat towel with a poisoned on

537
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:14,045
which means the suspect
IS you, who sat on his right!

539
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,816
Nonsense!

540
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:20,151
Why would I have to kill Mr. Kawabata,

541
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:24,022
when I have seen him for the first time at
a restaurant I came for the first-time!

543
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,091
Humph! There's no telling...

544

asked to appear in the movie

00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,030

time sounds suspicious, too...

549
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,732

00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:39,471

00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,239
wants happening...

552
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,030
win... a rainy day again.
I saw him who is he

554
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:13,771
Or, is it somebody else
who looks like the Inspector?

556
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:20,078
I can't remember...
That faint image of three faces

558
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,515
A mouth smiling...

559
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,351
Angry eyes...

561
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:31,356
What...?

562
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,527

565
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,972

566
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,277
Oh, I'm okay. I just felt faint...

567
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:59,017

We're in trouble...

574
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,933
Ran must be really sick...

575
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:18,970
