I'm a detective hired by Kobayashi.

174
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,428
Kobayashi had been
searching for evidence of plagiarism,

176
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,630
In order tO sue you.

177
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,099

With two hundred, million yen
you can buy this disk.

184
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,718

00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,757
What!

504
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:13,961
You saw what's in the disk.

505
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,097
Now I have to kill you all...

506
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,065
uh, fun...

507
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:21,269
No. Please:.don't!

508
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,639
No! I have to eat mom's grilled @el...

509
00:20:24,873 --> 00:20:29,010
Really. That's too bad. Genta...

510
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:34,198
As I suspected, it was you
Yukari Hachisuka

513
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,387
Conan!...

514
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:43,991
When Michiba-called his
partner "87. it dawned on me that

516
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,161
B" stood for Bee, an in

517
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,364
In Japanese, bee is "hachi...

518
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:57,672
Hachisuka...Your last name
has also the word, hachi in it,

520
00:20:58,106 --> 00:21:01,041
so I concluded that
Bee was your code name.

522
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:05,379
I guess you are in a relationship
with Michiba, aren't you?...

524
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,516
Yes. We are gonna get married; soon.

525
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,819
And in order to protect
our promised future,

527
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,554
I would do anything! +

528
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:15,189
Anything, literally...

529
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,357
Conan!

530
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,826
Ms! Please, don't!

531
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:20,594
Did you know?...

532
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:24,732
That all this conversation is
being recorded by the police

534
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,367
C. cellphone!

538
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,841
Yukari Hachisuka! You're under arrest for

539
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:35,776
attempted murder of Conan Edogawa!

540
00:21:36,578 --> 00:21:38,713
It's game over...isn*tit...

541
00:21:39,414 --> 00:21:43,617
Yukari Hachisuka and
President Michiba were, thus, arrested.

543
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,971
The blackmail detective was found alive.

544
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,890
Also, the kids seemed
to have learned that

546
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:54,829
their stupidity had caused a lot of trouble.
