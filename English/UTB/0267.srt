1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:02,034
The heart contains mysteries,

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,970
stars and snow sparkle for the two.

5
00:00:04,338 --> 00:00:05,771
Valentine's Day is coming up soon}

6
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,640
Both love and the case get to the core.

7
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,508
He sees through the one and only truth,

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,310
a child in appearance with
the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,779
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan!

12
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:52,611
We all came to a lodge called
Suito Mountain Lodge

14
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,780
Iocated in a remote
mountain area together

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,116
with Sonoko, who invited us...

17
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,888
However, one of the guests
staying at the lodge,

19
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,325
a journalist named Yoshitaka Nigaki
fails to return to the lodge 2

21
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,662
after going inte the woods
despite a violent blizzard...

23
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,602
After awhile of searching for
Nigak! in the woods.

25
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,210
We found him dead

26
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,146
Blood stains that have been wiped off...

27
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Sunglasses that have been
put back on him .

29
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,754
AndOAko"s chocolate...

30
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,491
Why did the killer bring the chocolate

31
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,893
from the kitchen to where it was found?

32
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,631
Why on earth?!...»

34
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,035
(# Btw)

36
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:53,138
Bloody Valentine Part 2

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,973
(3 BR)

39
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,149
And, what did they say?

40
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:03,449
ChiyoKo Yuasa
(Owner of the lodge)

42
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,418
Did the police say they'll be right. ove

48
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,821
An avalanche is a lie, right?

49
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,024
There seems
have been an avalanche

51
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,760
about 8.00 this evening and
the tunnel seems to be blocked off...

53
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,829
They say they don't know when

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,763
they'll be able to come
here until tomorrow...

56
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,501
See! It's just as I saidOO

57
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,406
Oh, how was the chocolate?

59
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,543
It was gone after all

60
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,411
Just Ako's chocolate...

61
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,415
Darn!

62
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,086
I brought back Mr. Nigaki's
camera and video camera

64
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,555
thinking that we could get some clues,

65
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,291
but thé video tape is unused...

66
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,561
The only clue we have left now is

67
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,097
the used roll of film that
is left I Sidé his camera...

69
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,766
But, if the forensic officers can't come,

70
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,035
we can't develop-the. film...

71
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,270
Oh...l can develop and print the picture

72
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,473
if you want me to.

73
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,740
Huh?

74
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,143
Since Mr. Nigaki said that
he wanted to see the pictures

76
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,011
right away after he took pictures of them

77
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,180
I brought a set of
the necessary equipments

79
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,016
Let me use your bathroom. okay?

80
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,219
It's just right to usesfor a darkroom

81
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,687
Yeah, go ahead...

82
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,622
I"1 help you then!

83
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,497
Hey. was that all that was inside?

84
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,099
Weren't there any more films or tapes

85
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,568
in the knapsack
of the guy who was killed?

87
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:30,870
Yeah, there were...

88
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:35,608
but the films and tapes
were all unopened...

90
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,344
Which means that the guy was killed

91
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,679
before he filmed anything on video...?

92
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:45,350
Or'maybe Mr. Nigaki preferred
taking pictures to filming videos...

94
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,218
That's not true!

95
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,486
That's not true!

96
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,224
He preferred filming videos
to taking pictures.

98
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,293
He was filming a lot last night too...

99
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,163
Can you show us that video tape then?

100
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,298
OO. Okkayrsoo

102
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,867
there are a lot if) his bag.

103
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,802
SO I don't know if we can tell
which one is last flight's but...

105
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,139
F.Forget it. kid!

106
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,807
Let's not watch the video
a dead man took...

108
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:09,241
Huh?

109
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:09,608
Huh?

110
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,745
Did he film something he shouldn't have?

111
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,281
That's not what I mean...

112
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,950
t's Kind of eerie...

113
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,021
Why don't we all watch it
together in the living room?

115
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,489
Okay...

116
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,093
If we. watch:it'together
we may'be.able:toifind a clue...

118
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,963
I'll go get it from his room then...

119
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:44,076
Oh, is this the love chocolate
you're going to give me?!

121
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,946
Wisong...dl This is for me!

122
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,283
Hey. hey. don't tell me you're giving
it to someone else...

124
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,551
uld be...

125
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,954
It sure is no fun watching

126
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,956
somebody elses home Video after all...

127
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,359
I'm going to make

129
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,427

the night here tomorrow.

131
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,362

135
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,633
I've got a super gift for you too, you know.

136
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:09,335
Huh?

137
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:10,536
Darn!

138
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,937
What a lemon!

139
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,138
Come onl!

140
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:13,806
Come mun

141
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,548
Sorry. it's a lemon...

142
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,018
This is a treasure that
my hdisband bought

144
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,487
for the first time with Reiko!

145
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,489
Reiko?!

146
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,891
She was fy husand's ex-wife.

147
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:38,030
I was told that she died
12 years ago because of an illness...

149
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,031
_y ay Ry

150
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,100
Hey, Saburo!

151
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,335
It's time for you
to go back to your cage already!

153
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,873
She remarried him

154
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,744
I've heard about them
from the previous owner too.

156
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,747
This granny came to spend the night here

157
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,083
just when he was depressed
after having lost his wife.

159
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,021
And they hit it off right from the
start and got married just like that!

161
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:05,024
Granny's sweets were highly reputable

162
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,093
and this lodge was going
well for a while but...

164
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,497
I guess it's tough without
husband after all...

167
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:14,066
You heard about this before, you said?

169
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:16,735
That means you both come here a lot?

170
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,872
N.Nope. just once in the past.

171
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:24,877
Hey, by the way, is that
the last of the 4 video tapes we watched?

173
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:29,748
Yes...that's all of the videos
with yesterday's date on it...

175
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,352
Okay. so there's only so
much left of this video tape!

177
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:37,856
I'm going to challenge making chocolate
for the first time in my life starting now,

179
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,024
SO goodbye everyone.

180
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,628
Good grief...it's finally ended...

181
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:47,166
You two don't seem
to have been in the video?

183
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,337
O,of course, I just got here this morning!

184
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,405
I just got here a while ago...

185
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,543
SO. Were Mack to where we started.

186
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,814
We've figured out
what time Mr. Nigaki was killed. though!

188
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,681
Huh

189
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,484
Take a look at this picture!

190
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,154
It's a picture that was taken
when he was punched Mt

192
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,256
Huh

193
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,559
How can you tell?

194
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,895
Do you see this blurred shadow?

195
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,231
It's not in any of the other pictures,

196
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,100
just this last one...

197
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,003
This is theyshadow formed by
7 blood stains on the cameraYvens!!

199
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,071
What?!!

200
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,375
The shutter probably
went off accidentally

202
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,443
after he was punched and fell to
the ground from the shock...

204
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,613
But, you can't really tell
if those are blood stains yet...

206
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,014
There's no mistake about it!

207
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,150
We put film in his camera
and tried it out,

209
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,220
and got the exact same result.

210
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:47,092
Which means he was killed
uring the day time...

212
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,028
Something's not right...

213
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,767
Mika's explanation
doesn't make sense!

215
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,271
In other words, the killer

216
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,808
may be among the three of you...

217
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,545
Who were not at the ledge
with us during that time .

219
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,479
Hey. hey...

220
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,948
Then, what's with that chocolate?

221
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,652
It was here at the lodge
until 8:00 at night, wasn't it?

223
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,088
Just who brought it out then?!

224
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,557
In the first place,

225
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,826
what stupid person would go back out

226
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,029
into the blizzard just to put
the chocolate near the corpse!!!

228
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,365
T.That's true...

229
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,801
It could be that...

230
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,404
it really exists...

231
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:38,010
in this mountain. a being other than us...

232
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,016
WwW. What do you mean,
1 being other than us.

234
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,617
Come to think of it,

235
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,688
before I met all of you here,
I ran into a queer guy in the woods...

237
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,755
Huh?!

238
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,359
A huge guy wearing a black knitted cap!

239
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,430
I mistook him for a bear
and almost shot him.

241
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,866
A black knitted cap ?!

242
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:02,935
It.It can't be...

243
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,271
ont tell me...

244
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,532
A man wearing @ black knitted cap...

245
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,801
Don't tell me. it's him

246
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,803
Uh, excuse me...

247
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,040
T.The person you saw in the woods.

248
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,876
Do you remember what he looked like?

249
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:44,610
Huh

250
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,880
I may know him...

251
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,414
I wonder...

252
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,484
I could tell that he was
a man from his physique but...

254
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,555
he had goggles and a muffler on so
I didn't get to see his face at all...

256
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,358
see...

257
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,228
It could ve been Natsuya

258
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,863
I'm sure it was...

259
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,865
It's Natsuyal!

260
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,933
He was alive after all...

261
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,869
Let's gO@et him

262
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,537
Mika

263
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:14,940
No way!!

264
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,609
You can't go out in this blizzard!

265
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,079
H.He's. Natsuya's waiting in the woods!

266
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,948
Natsuya's waiting...

267
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,683
NatSuya died!!

268
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,085
Hé died in the avalanche -4 yeas ago!!!

269
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,293
M sorry...

270
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,295
I'm sorry, Mika...

271
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,932
h...who is Natsuya...

272
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:44,469
He's my older brother whose whereabouts
have been unknown since 4 years ago

274
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,606
Mika was going stead, with him

275
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,678
Sc. the checkered chocolate that Mike
was making this afternoon was...

277
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,149
Yes...l was going to take
he chocolate to his grave...

279
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,952
because he liked checkered patterns.

280
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,890
My brother grave is also in the woods

281
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:09,928
beside the graves of
the previous owner and his ex-wife...

283
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,864
Not only the graves of
e three are here...

285
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:18,070
In this forest there are the graves of
those who have died in this mountain,

287
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,139
whose identities are unknown...

288
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,209
But. all but the three graves were all destroyed

289
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,678
by the mountain animals.

290
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,617
Why are only the three
graves left undestroyed?

292
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:36,488
Probably because I pay visit
to them everyday with Saburo...

294
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,691
Just like my husband
used: to when he was alive...

296
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,928
Well, but if you insist that
someone other than us,

298
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,197
are in the mountains...

299
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,233
The guy wearing the black knitted cap

300
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,036
roaming around in the woods
is definitely the killer.

302
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:52,904
What do you mean?

303
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,442
I have no idea when that guy
called Nigaki was killed but...

305
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,480
the guy who left the chocolate
next to him is the killer. right?

307
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,449
All six of you left the
chocolate in the kitchen .and

309
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,851
went out about 8:00,
to look for Nigaki. right?

311
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,854
If everyone found the chocolate together,

312
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,622
it's impossible to put
the chocolate there...

314
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,893
I met all six of you near the lodge.

315
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,830
It was probably right after you all
Ieft the lodge to look for Nigaki.

317
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,735
It would take 20 minutes to get
from the lodge to the site of the crime,

319
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,404
which is the woods,
no matter how much I rush.

321
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,273
So. I would have no time
to put the chocolate there.

323
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,843
And of course,
I wouldn't have been able to do it either

325
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,146
At around 8:00 I was far away

326
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:38,216
from the lodge watching the tunnel
get buried under the avalanche...

328
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:42,087
you could've heard about
the avalanche on the radio news...

330
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,891
No. because the avalanche
was announced just about the same time,

332
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:50,362
we got back:to the lodge
and called the police...

334
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:54,032
Well, the only one who
could've brought the chocolate is

336
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,601
that lady there who
was making the chocolate...

338
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:58,403
Huh

339
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:01,740
I hear that before everybody
went out together,

341
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,743
you and the other lady left together
to look for the guy, right?

343
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:08,013
You two weren't together
all the while, were you?

345
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:13,085
N.No, we split up part way
and searched for him...

347
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,822
If you made similar type of
chocolate the night before,

349
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,958
you could've placed
the chocolate near Nigaki

351
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,960
when you went out the first time and...

352
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,363
if you secretly took the chocolate
that you madéOftoday together with you

354
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,466
when you went out to
search with everybody else,

356
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,335
you could make it look as if
the¥Killer took it...

358
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,337
S.Oh no...

359
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,005
That's impossible

360
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,806
Huh?

361
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,143
There w $ a blizzard.outside already

362
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,011
when we went to.look for
him the first time!

364
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,415
If he was killed then,
th re should be'snow.in: this picture

366
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,685
picture that was taken at
the time of the crime too. shouldn't there?

368
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,087
What about the chocolate...

369
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,123
Why §6n't you compare them, then?

370
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:54,626
Took a picture of all the chocolato
that everybody made today...

373
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,963
If you take a close-rook.

374
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,966
The chocolate that was found
at the scene of the crime is a bit melted

376
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,668
and dented slightly out of shape...

377
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:05,003
I would sure like to meet a person

378
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,272
who can shape the letters
exactly the same: like this,

380
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,475
as well as insert it onto
the chocolate so much alike as it is.

382
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:15,280
What she's saying is,
your deductions are off.

384
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,882
Y.,Yeah...

385
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,084
well, that's for the better. isn't it...

386
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,554
Now we know the killer isn't among us

387
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:25,824
I can sleep without worrying then.

388
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,726
Goodnight then, everybody.

389
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,226
Goodnight then. everybody

390
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,031
Which means...

391
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,834
the killer is the man
earing the black knitted cap...

393
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,938
hh... . you know the film that was
Mr. Nigaki s camera. are you sure

395
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,341
the pictures are tic one ) tht ere taken
by Mr Nigaki yesterday and today?

397
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,342
What?

398
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,546
Because it was already used
and wound, wasn't it?

400
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,682
It could've been inserted
some time later, right?

402
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,753
Then. would you like to look at and
sompaie he other pictures in this film?

404
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,589
The video that
he filmed yesterday is also here...

406
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,993
The clothing of the three are all the same
in the Pictures andtinsthe video...

408
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,529
And of course. «Mr. Nigaki who is

409
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,498
taking the pictures and
filming is virtually not included...

411
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,700
Moreover, mostwef the pictures
were taken at night

413
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,237
The fact that at the end of this film

414
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:16,141
there was that blood
tained picture means...

416
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,245
the pictures were-taken
this afternoon doesnat it?

418
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,717
Nobody's gone outside since
we arrived at the lodge yesterday

420
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,654
to the time he left with
his camera this afterfdon...

422
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,858
Which means that he's the
only one who could've take the picture!

424
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,794
Well, the only other possibility is that

425
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:39,064
some trick is used when de eloping film

426
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,167
How could I have done
something like that

428
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,437
Ran was with me right through
while I was developing the film!

430
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,404
Right

431
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:46,705
Right?

432
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:51,042
Oh, yes, she didn't do anything strange.

433
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,711
Nd besides.

434
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,113
she even used a glove
when taking the film out of the camera

436
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,916
SO that he wouldn't put
he fingerprints on the film.

438
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,218
Moreover: if you look at the negative

439
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,988
I'm sure you can see
that nothing was done to it...

441
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,725
Right. if there was anything strange.

442
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,393
There was a picture
that was completely black.

444
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,861
Completely black?

445
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,096
There W 8 two of them

446
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,632
the pi&turO with blood stains @n them...

447
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,968
Pictures that were completely black
and you couldn't see anything...

449
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,371
Really?

450
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,505
Uh-huh...

451
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,775
I think the shutter just
accidentally went off

453
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,045
when something was over
the Tens covering it...

455
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,581
Just as I thought...

458
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,717
The picture with the blood stain on
it is A trick after all!

460
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,520
But. I can't figure it out.

461
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,256
How can you take a picture like that?

462
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,526
And what baffles me more is

463
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,195
fro chocolate that was by the corpse...

464
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,366
Putting something like that there,
would nullify the trick...

466
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:49,601
Hey, Saburo

467
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:50,035
Hey, Saburo
Don't tell me that the killer is actually

469
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,103
It's your favorite ball!
Ronit tell me that the killer is actually

471
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:52,637
Donrt tell me that the killer is actually

472
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,341
that man wearing the black knitted cap
who is hiding in the woods?

474
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,909
Huh? Strange...

475
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,413
when I came last year, you loved
playing with the ball. Saburo...

478
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:06,918
why is the name ofithat dog Saburo?

479
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:13,124
Because before him there was
a Tare and Jiro: but they both died...

481
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,259
Huh? They died?

482
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:19,331
Yeah, Taro was the name of my husband.

483
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:23,034
It seems that Jiro was
a Shikoku dog just like Saburo.

485
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,771
But after the death of his first wife

486
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,308
it seems to have died as
if going after her...

488
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,979
I want to see he picture of
that dog named Jiro!

490
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,916
I think I can find pictures
of Jiro in my husband's album...

492
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,721
If I remember correctly, Mr Nigaki
was 'using my husband:siroom...

494
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,124
Oh. would you like me to go andlgenit?

495
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,193
I'll go with you then?

496
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,262
Uh- does:Saburo have some
odd-habits or something?

498
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,367
Like going out on walks
a lot and stuff like-that?

500
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,435
Nope. he usually stays inside the lodge...

501
00:18:58,436 --> 00:19:02,640
T.he:only:time:he goes out is when
e-comes:aong: 0 egravewl me...

503
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,243
He's smart...

504
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,979
so when we get near
the grave he runs ahead of me

506
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,781
and waits for me in front of the grave...

507
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,384
Come to think of it.

508
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,853
When there is a blivzard
and he can't go out,

510
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:17,389
he doesn't eat his dog food...

511
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,592
although he usually
eats it on regular days

513
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:23,495
Well: buton-the:day after the blizzard

514
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,964
he seems back to his normal self
and pigs.out on the food...

516
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:27,732
Oh...

517
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,873
Isn't that Ako's voice...

518
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,346
What's the matter?!

519
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,947
Talk about rude!!

520
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:47,485
T, y were in here
going through Nigaki's things!

522
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,553
What?!

523
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,156
Oh, no, it's not what it looks to be...

524
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,358
We just thought there may be clues
to solving the case, so!

526
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,562
We didn't take anything...

527
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,599
Okay. I guess I'll have to body check you.

528
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,068
Yeah...

529
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,836
Let's go to the room over there.

530
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,808
A blood stained parker

531
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,343
The blood stains are
not on the stomach area

533
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:15,680
Oh, that's the parker

534
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,950
that Mr. NigaKi was wearing
when he got hurt!

536
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,752
Ur? when he got hurt...

537
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,758
He hurt his left hand thumb when
he was dicing chocolate with a knife...

539
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,627
It wasn't much of a wound

540
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,464
but he was surprised
and flung his hand around

542
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,666
so the blood splattered
onto His parker too

544
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:39,871
Granny rushed to get
he first aid box and turned it over

546
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:44,142
Ako, who worried about him
breaks out in tears

548
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:48,413
It was a total mess, with me holding him
down from going wild and all.

550
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,883
Well, the worst part was looking after Ako

551
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:55,019
who got super depressed after that

552
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,221
Right?

553
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,491
Oh, sorry.

554
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,026
@h, here, here,

555
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:03,628
here it is!

556
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,997
See, the dog to the left is Jiro

557
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,732
and the dog to the right.is Saburo!

558
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:12,137
He's wearing a medal
he was awarded by the prefecture

560
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,672
when he rescued alperson who got into
an accident in the mountains...

562
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,807
Huh

563
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,810
I wonder if the one to the left is Saburo
and the one to the right is Jiro...

565
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,880
Just as I thought...

566
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,416
I've figured out the case...

567
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,688
Now I know why there
were black pictures taken

569
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,491
before the blood-stained picture...

570
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,227
Who took the chocolate out and

571
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:11,563
why it was put near the corpse.

572
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,934
Who killed Mr Niga

573
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,002
That is...

574
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:20,738
That person!!
