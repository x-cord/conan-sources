1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,169
Even destiny serves
as a clue to deduction

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,338
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,173
Those two have our complete attention,

6
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,408
a wager between two adults
causes the case to expand.

8
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:11,043
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,945
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,481
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

13
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,654
Hey, Miwako!

14
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:02,321
Hmm?

15
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,725
An officer of the renowned Metropolitan
Police Department First Division

17
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:09,862
Is lying around during the day with
her mouth full of tangerines, watching TV.

19
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:13,031
Give me a break, it's my day off.
It won't hurt to take it easy, will it...

21
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,438
Here, then!

22
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,842
Not again! Pictures of
my marriage mate candidates.

24
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,112
If you've got time to be loafing around,
Iook through them, will you.

26
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,713
No way!

27
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,714
I'm sick and tired of looking at pictures

28
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,350
because I've got to look through
bloody pictures of autopsies all the time.

30
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,357
How did you ever end up
turning into such a tomboy?

32
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,161
It's all my fault...

33
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,162
I raised you giving you too much freedom.

34
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,266
I couldn't possibly face up
to your father, who died on duty

36
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,070
and is watching over us from the heavens.

37
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,138
Okay then!

38
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,473
But, I'm just merely going to
meet them, all right!

40
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,977
My, just as would be expected
of my daughter!

42
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,146
You have the same taste
as I when it comes to men.

44
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:10,723
Love Story
at Police Headquarters-4" Part I

46
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:12,992
What?!

47
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,693
Officer Sato is going to meet
a marriage mate candidate?!

49
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,328
Right!

50
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,597
I'm sure that Miwako is
all dressed up by now

52
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,132
and meeting that man right now...

53
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,438
Um, and just who is that man...?

54
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,873
Miwako doesn't know either...

55
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,042
Because she told me

56
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,711
she chose the picture without
even looking inside the envelope.

59
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,349
You mean she's meeting a man
she doesn t even know the looks of?!

61
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,118
No problem, though!

62
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:43,255
He's a man that decided to meet a woman
officer who is in active duty, right?

64
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,093
I'm sure he's a very independent and
reliable, square middle aged man...

66
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,195
Japanese Restaurant
Minatorou"

68
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,429
Hey, hey, hey!
Japanese Restaurant
Minatorou"

71
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,696
Hey, hey, hey!!

72
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,568
10 minutes have already gone by
since the promised time of meeting!

74
00:03:56,436 --> 00:04:00,039
A man who has the nerve to keep a lady
waiting couldn't be worth much anyway!

76
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,208
I'mVtleaving!!

77
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,244
No big deal, he's only 10 minutes late yet.

78
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,378
Ms. Sato?

79
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,448
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

80
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:15,855
I am Isokichi Kamei, please
remember me from here on after.

82
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,858
W~~What, What's thi

83
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,694
Is this old man supposed to
be my marriage candidate?!

85
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,629
No! He's the butler!

86
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,199
Well, since this meeting
popped up so suddenly...

88
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,836
The Mr. and Mrs. are on a trip abroad,

89
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,273
SO sire asked to
come along in their place.

91
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,308
Sire?

92
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,244
Hi, I'm so sorry!

93
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:42,915
I took a while tr in to choose flowers
that would suit you, Ms Sato...

95
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,152
Oh no, I shouldn't call you
Ms. Sato today, but rather...

97
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,224
would it be all right for me
to call you Miwako?

99
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,693
S,Shiratori?!

100
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,530
Long time no see, Mother dear...

101
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,631
Hello

102
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,301
WwW. what? why?

103
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,802
Just what are you talking about!

104
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,405
You chose him yourself, didn't you?

105
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,139
Huh?!

106
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,010
Being attracted to a police officer,
no doubt you're my daughter after all.

108
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:14,847
You mean no one in the 1st Division
knows about her meeting 'today?

110
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,314
Officer Takagi doesn't either, then?

111
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,251
G@ No. She said that she would never agree
to going out with the man anyway,

113
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,788
and is embarrassed,
so she was keeping it a secret...

115
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,425
Besides, Miwako is quite popular
with the guys

117
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,260
that if the word goes out,
it may cause a commotion.

119
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,431
But, what if the man
she is seeing wants to marry her...

121
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,100
No problem! Because it's all worked out

122
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:39,305
that she gets out of there
when the time is right!

124
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,408
Nobody would ever want:to.marry
a woman who splits the scene saying

126
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,177
that she has to go cover a case, right?

127
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,348
But, who's going to do that?

128
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,117
You silly thing.
Who else but Officer Takagi?!

130
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,188
I'm going to mail him on his cellular
with the message, "Miwako's In trouble!

132
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,727
Lie saying that a criminal case has come
up and take her away from where she is!

134
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,364
I'm sure that he'll going bursting in with
a face that you've never seen before!!

136
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,165
You witch...

137
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,766
He may just confess how he feels for her,
if situation pushes him to do so.

139
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:11,302
Hey, why don't we go there too!

140
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,372
But, It's pretty far from here...

141
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,107
Why don't you give us a lift there,
Yumi, then?!

143
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,276
I can't because I'm still on duty...

144
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,750
What are you all doing here...

145
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,185
Dr. Araide!

146
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,620
Lucky!

147
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:28,754
Huh?

148
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,958
But, what an honor.

149
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,629
To think that you chose me from among
the number of candidates that you have.

151
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,766
So, like I've been saying
it was sheer coincidence!

153
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,035
The picture that I chose without
even looking at happened to be you!

155
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,605
Oh, come on, Miwako, saying something
Iike that to hide your embarrassment.

157
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:51,644
I rather prefer... that it was a coincidence.

158
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,645
Because it would mean

159
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,882
that your beautiful fingers were
guided to my picture by some work of God.

161
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,386
I feel that it was a work of fate.

162
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,655
R,Right...

163
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,057
Splendid, Sire!

164
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,829
I can't possibly tell him that
I picked his picture up with my toes

166
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,565
I wonder if Yumi's really
going:to carry out what we planned. 3

168
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,003
I'll send my kid brother over,
so hang in there.

170
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,105
She promised saying so, but, I wonder...

171
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,076
I wonder who she means by kid brother?

172
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,816
Are you all right? You've been sneezing
quite a bit, Officer Takag:.

174
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,617
Yeah...

175
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,122
Yes, Takagi here.

176
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,092
Oh, Officer Takagi?
Did you read the mail I sent you?

178
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:40,959
Mail?

179
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,297
Robber!!

180
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,732
Someone, please catch him

181
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,200
Okay, let's go after him, Officer Chiba!!

182
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,268
Yes, sir!

183
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,805
Hello, Officer Takagi?

184
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,307
Hey, are you listening?

185
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,742
Hey, Officer Takagi!

186
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,978
E,Excuse me, we're the police.

187
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,180
Please let us through!

188
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,916
Oh, thereahe is! That's him!!

189
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,387
He went into the alley!

190
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,355
Don't let him get away!!

191
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,031
Are you all right, Mister?

192
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,800
Did you see someone wearing a helmet?

193
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:28,240
The guy rammed into me and
ran towards the restroom of the park.

195
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,015
Oh, Officer Takagi!

196
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,355
Here are) helmet, a coat,
a bag and gloves...

198
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,391
No: doubt about it,

199
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:48,394
the man who robbed the convenience
store is inside the public restroom.

201
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,431
Police! No use trying to flee any farther!

202
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,966
Come out quietly, will you!!

203
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,274
Hey, hey, what's with all the fuss...
Hiroshi Zama
2J)-9

206
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,779
What do you want...
Eiko Koshimizu

209
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,082
WwW, What would the police want to with
Yasuo Kamieda

213
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,987
1, Three people?

214
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,957
These are the three people
who were using the restroom

216
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,692
Well?

217
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,029
Can you make out who bumped into you?

218
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,801
Not really...because my glasses fell off
when the person bumped into me,

220
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,803
so couldn't see very well
since my vision was blurred...

222
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:36,175
Any little thing will do!
Please tell me what you remember!

224
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:40,012
Well, the person was taller than me...

225
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,183
She was a girl wearing
blue clothes under her coat!

227
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:50,956
Ms. Koshimizu is a only woman,
but the clothes she's wearing is black.

229
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,827
What do I know!
That's all I remember!

231
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,195
O,Oh...

232
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,364
Hey! I don't have any idea
what's going on, but...

234
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:03,302
If we have nothing to do with
what's going on, can we head on home?

236
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,404
I've got other commitments after this so.

237
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,773
P.Please wait!

238
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,845
You may leave only after we finish
questioning the other witnesses!

240
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,314
What 21

241
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:19,151
S,Shiratori... Don't tell me that he's
the one from the police department?!

243
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,287
Yes, he's in the Tsuru Room
together with Ms. Sato.

245
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,591
Which means that the man
Officer Sato is meeting is...

247
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,726
Inspector Shirator?!

248
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,395
Uh... would you like me to
take them a message?

250
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,598
Uh, well, no, we're...

251
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:38,070
We were asked by the families of the two
to bring them an interesting gift.

253
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,174
It's going to take some time to prepare,

254
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,743
so will you please let us use
the room next to the Tsuru Room?

256
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,547
Yes... sure,
since it ust so ha ens to be vacant.

259
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,250
Thank you, Miss.

260
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,685
Please wait a while then.

261
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm very sorry to trouble you

262
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,956
That kid is pretty sharp...

263
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,996
My, how delicious!!

264
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,099
We had our chef come over
to cook for us here,

266
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,902
so that you could taste the kind of meal
that we eat at the Shiratori residence,

268
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,271
and had him make
these exquisite Japanese dishes!

270
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:16,842
Sire had informed us that Miwako
does not care much for French cuisine so.

272
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,279
Oh? Did you have food
that you didn't like?

274
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,214
Hey, Miwako?

275
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,248
Huh?

276
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,983
Uh, yes.

277
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,222
Uh, excuse me!

278
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:36,061
Is there anyone who-witnessed the robber
in this convenience store a while ago?

280
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,297
Hey, Officer!

281
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:42,167
Wouldn't it be faster for you to ask
the employee of the convenience store?

283
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,069
We already did!

284
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,706
She said the robber stuck out a knife and
showed a paper, said Give me the cash,

286
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,642
so the only thing she remembers
IS the helmet and coat.

288
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,712
Hopeless case...

289
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,481
Darn it... give me a break...

290
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,816
Uh, officer?

292
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,520
I can tell you how tall the robber was!

293
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,624
The person who was wearing
a helmet and a coat, right?

295
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,095
I was watching through
the window of the shop, but...

297
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,898
I saw the person's head
sticking out of the throng of people,

299
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,300
so I think the person's height
was about 180 centimeters...

301
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,773
180 centimeters would be
the tallest of the three, Mr. Zama.

303
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,776
Come to think of it,
he was wearing a blue sweater.

305
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,914
Oh and when the person's coat
flipped over a bit I saw the color green!

307
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,049
Not blue?

308
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,118
No, I'm positive that it was green!

309
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,922
Were able to tell if it was
a man or a woman?

311
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,025
With a height of 180 centimeters
wouldn't it be a man?

313
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,593
I see...

314
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,827
Hey, Officer!

315
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,629
Yes?

316
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,367
That coffee shop owner was bragging
that he looked at the robber close.

318
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,369
RR. Really?!

319
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,071
Yeah, I sure saw him!

320
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,374
The weirdo wearing a helmet
who went running off!

322
00:12:55,908 --> 00:13:01,747
It was when I was getting the samples
of the lunchtime menu out.

324
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:04,349
Can you give me
the characteristics of that person?

326
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,319
I'm not sure if the person
was a man or woman,

328
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,521
but the height was
about 170 centimeters!

330
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,290
The person had a coat over black clothes!

331
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,360
B.Black... did you say...

332
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,666
About 170 centimeters
would be Mr. Kamieda.

334
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,868
But he is wearing green colored sweater.

335
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,871
Hey hey, what's going on?

336
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,845
Well, I guess we'll excuse
ourselves for a while then.

338
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,682
You two take your time
and talk things out together.

340
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,920
Ney, ney... yum...

341
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,989
When is she coming to pick me up?!

342
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,393
I see.

343
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,062
So someone is supposed to come rescue, I

344
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,632
the beautiful princess from
the hands of the evil prince?

346
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,868
D.D.Don't be ridiculous!
Just what are you talking about!

348
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,637
Okay, let's do this.

349
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,240
If Officer Takagi comes to get you,

350
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,776
I shall gracefully back down.

351
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:09,815
But, if he chickens out and
doesn't show up, you will be my wife.

353
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,851
Huh? Why is it Officer Takagi?

354
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:15,921
Why not?

355
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,894
It's just a joke! A joke!

356
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,431
I just wanted to see you look troubled.

357
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,499
All right then...

358
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,200
Huh?

359
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,802
It's a deal!

360
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,704
What 21

361
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:37,209
H,Hey, Officer Takagi,
just what-is going on?

363
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,644
The testimony of the witnesses
don't match...

365
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,115
There were three witnesses
in all, weren't there».

367
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:48,820
Yeah... all three of them remembered
the characteristics of the robber very well.

369
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:54,826
The man who bumped into the robber said
that it was a woman wearing blue clothes.

371
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,763
The High School girl who was watching
through the window of a shop said,

373
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,166
that the robber was more than 180
centimeters tall, wearing green clothes,

375
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,801
and most probably a male.

376
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,437
And the owner of the coffee shop insisted

377
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:09,141
that the robber was about 170
centimeters, wearing black clothes.

379
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,411
All three witnesses had something
absolutely different to say.

381
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,914
V.,Very true...

382
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:20,552
I don't believe they told a lie.

383
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,888
Yeah.

384
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:28,927
Shall we begin interrogating
the three suspects then?

386
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,795
Yeah...

387
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,567
What do you mean, it's a deal.

388
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,337
Are you sure you know
what you're talking about?

390
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,007
Yes, I do.

391
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,776
If Officer Takagi comes here to get me,

392
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,145
then this meeting for possible marriage
is called off immediately, right!

394
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,949
If he doesn't show up,
I marry you and become your wife.

396
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,885
Instead of waiting without a time limit,

397
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,954
Iet's set the limit at sundown,
what do you say?

399
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,759
Hey, hey... you've gotta be joking,
Officer Sato.

401
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,762
Things are starting to sound
really interesting, don't you think?

403
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,531
But, what if Officer Takagi
doesn't show up?

405
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,069
It could be that Officer Sato is
after a Cinderella story, you know.

407
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,905
Inspector Shiratori is after all
the son.of'a... coon

409
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,607
that attends most of the parties
held at my house, so.

411
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:21,146
I thought that Officer Sato and Officer
Takagi really got along well though...

413
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,983
Well, she went as far as
to say what she did

415
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,353
So, I think she thinks
that the odds are in her favor.

417
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,624
Okay. So, it's all right with you then?

418
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,293
Yes! I will not go back on my word!

419
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,833
Right, right, it's Officer Takagi.

420
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:47,372
I'm sure that he's the one that's going to
pick me up that Yumi was talking about!

422
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,575
S...l just know he'll com

423
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,245
I'm sure?

425
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:05,457
My name is Yasuo Kamieda.
I teach at a prep school.

427
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,759
I stopped over at that restroom

428
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,629
on my way to a book store nearby,
where I was planning to by a book.

430
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,999
I'm Hiroshi Zama, a part-time worker.

431
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,170
I just happened to use that restroom
on my way back from band practice!

433
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,574
I'm Eiko Koshimizu. I work at an office!

434
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:26,011
I was taking a walk when I suddenly
came down with a stomach ache.

436
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,612
So I went to that restroom.

437
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,583
Now that I've said all
I have to say, let me go!

439
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,585
It's already after 2:00!

440
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:37,389
Huh? You're wearing two wristwatches?

441
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,425
My boyfriend's abroad,

442
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,493
so I'm wearing a wristwatch showing
the time of the country he's in too!

444
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,697
It's notanice calling him
at a ridiculous time, is it?

446
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:52,370
Back in Jr. High School, a teacher
told me to wear two wristwatches too.

448
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,339
Because I was always tardy for class!

449
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,643
Hey, mister!! What's so funny?!

450
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,947
Uh, well, I always tell my students
at prep school

452
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:06,017
to take off their watches during class,

453
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,719
so I just thought what a difference...

454
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,721
You mean the wristwatches
of the students?

456
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:14,025
Yes, because I want them to concentrate
on the lessons without thinking of time.

458
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,296
I also removed clocks of the classroom
as thinking out other things to help them.

460
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,367
By the way, about the band
you just mentioned Mr. Zama?

462
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:25,370
Oh, I'm playing in the band
with my high school friends.

464
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,605
A visual type band!

465
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,775
When I play in the band,
I dress like a woman.

467
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,112
I may not look it, but I get a lot of calls
from my fans and I'm pretty popular too.

469
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,982
OO. Oh... I see...

470
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,820
Oh, talking about phone calls, there
was a call for you from Yumi a while ago.

472
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,954
She said for you
to read the mail she sent you.

474
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,824
I'll bet she wants to go singing
at a Karaoke or something again.

476
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,293
Little does she know of
the predicament I'm In...

478
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:51,629
Oh... a convenience store robbery.

479
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,768
Oh, no, I just had something
I wanted to ask Officer Takag:.

481
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:01,539
Please tell him to give it
his best shot then, Inspector Megure

483
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,945
H,Hey... What's this about a
convenience store robbery?!

485
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:10,081
Wasn't Officer Takagi supposed to
be checking ona case today?

487
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,817
After he finished checking on the case,

488
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,520
he seems to have run into
the convenience store robbery case.

490
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,991
It seems he's already narrowed the
suspects downto three people, though.

492
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,128
It seems the testimony of
the witnesses are a bit various

494
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,797
What do you mean various?

495
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,198
There's only one suspect, isn't there?!

496
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,567
Well, I don't have the slightest idea.

497
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,570
Okay, I'll contact
Officer Takagi myself, then...

499
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,044
It's against the rule for you
to call him from your side.

501
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,812
It's much too disadvantageous for me.

502
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,314
Well, I'm sure everything
will turn out all right.

504
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,853
He'll rush over here as soon as
he arrests the convenience store robber.

506
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,823
Or, maybe you don't believe he will?

507
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,992
It... It's not that .

508
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,064
Then again, if a police officer abandons
the case in the midst of an investigation,

510
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,932
and shows up in a place like this,

511
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,267
he'll have to go through
disciplinary action

513
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,135
taken against him
for violating duty regulations.

515
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:09,074
If I remember correctly, he went through
a pay cut once before, didn't he?

517
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,178
If he has the guts to
show up here knowing

519
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,247
that he may have to undergo
disciplinary action for the second time,

521
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,250
1 Il admit that
he's been¥aiman- about the whole thing.

523
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,124
The situation doesn't look too good,
does it?!

525
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,727
Oh come on, we can't just do nothing...!

526
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:31,296
Quiet...!

527
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,899
I've got to go to the restroom.

528
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,837
He "Officer!

529
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,440
Just how long to you intend to
keep us locked up in this car?

531
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,442
The sun's going to set!

532
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,578
Oh, so just a little while longer...

533
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,950
Oh, hello, is that Yumi?
My hands are tied just yet and...

00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,053
This is Shinichi Kudo

536
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:55,954
What?!

537
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,623
Conan asked me to give you a call...

538
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,126
WwW, what did Conan ask you to do?

539
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,363

00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,099
and take note of the situation
that you're in now.

542
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,970
But, the only mail I got today
was from Yum...

544
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,173
Miwako is In trouble!

545
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,642
Resue her from Minatoro where she is
holding a marrige meeting...

547
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,913

548
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,017
So, you haven't read the mail, have you?

But, don't worry, please calm down.

There's still a lot of time
to go till sundown,

Officer Sato agreed to the terms
that her husband to be stuck out at her.

557
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,171
If you don't solve the case
by sundown and go to get her,

559
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:51,209
she's going to have to accept
her partner's marriage proposal.

561
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:55,813

All three suspects testified totally
differing characteristics of the robber?

00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,101
How interesting.

570
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,070
In, Interesting, Shinichi...

571
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:26,310
