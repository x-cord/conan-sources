ran into Officer Sato and the others of
the police department in disguise

21
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,986
Since a FAX warning
of something bad happening

23
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,755
happening at the parade
was sent to police headquarters

25
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,956

Officer Shiratori!

36
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:23,709
What about officer Takagi

37
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,313
It exploded just as he
went over to the car to move it.

39
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,714
If he got caught in the explosion,
I doubt that he would make it

It can't be...

I made it*to-safety by a hairsbreadth,
so please don't talk like I didn't make it!

50
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,531
When we were checking to
see If Mitsuhiko who was

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,203
taking video pictures near theliscene
had taken any pictures of the bomber

54
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:54,373
What! Another bomb went off?

55
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:58,543
Yes?Othis time'it was at the phone
booth in front of Haido*Park

57
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,281
From the type of bomb that was
used, it's most likely the same bomber

59
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,285
Which means that the bomber
IS not after we, the police

61
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,823
but carried out an extremely
heinous prank against the Tokyo Spirits

63
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:15,061
I wonder if it's really only a prank
of bad taste towards the Spirits

66
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:18,130
And, besides, this...

67
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,433
tape that Mitsuhiko took

68
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:26,539
Is something that will point out
the bomber really recorded on it?

70
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:32,378
If so. wh-at the heck is recorded!

Don't you think this
Iady is suspicious?

00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,097
She's been glaring
towards the camera right through

80
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,467
True, she kind of looks bothered...

81
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:56,869
She just doesn't like
the idea that Mitsuhiko

83
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,371
is filming her mini-skirt
from a low angle!

85
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,475
Oh, but, no.l.l didn't
mean to do anything like that

87
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,510
Twin. what about this man Withuthé beard?

88
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,714
Yeah, he seems to be looking around
the ground. deesn't he?

90
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,786
Look carefully at his hand!
He's holding a child's shoe, right?

92
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,990
He probably came to the parade with
his wife who was carrying their child

94
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:23,596
both shoes ust ha) ened to come off,
and I'm pretty sure he's looking or them

96
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,998
I see...

97
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:31,103
\ Hey! Officer Tékagi. you've gotta tell
us some things that;you've noticed too

99
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,542
And, I'd like to have a word with you later

100
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,511
Officer Takagi!

101
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,112
Did you say something?

102
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,914
Are you watching carefully or what?

103
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,316
I've already watched: it three times...

104
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,886
But, no matter how many times I
Iook at it, it's the same thing

106
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,423
In a crowd, if you think someone looks
suspicious, they look suspicious.

108
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,060
If you think they don't then, they don't

109
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,298
It's virtually impossible to pick
the bomber out of this crowd

111
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,534
That's true...

112
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,570
Which means that the bomber
would've thought the same thing

114
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,504
But, the bomber stole the
video camera

116
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,608
and attempted to remove
the tape that was inside

118
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,610
Whatever for...

119
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,684
The bomber just thought something
was recorded, when nothing was...

121
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,252
Nothing was?

123
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:22,688
Wait,

124
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,323
Welk 61 ol
NOthing was taken means

00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,193

131
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,639
No, nothing really...

132
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,841
Then, it's no good?

133
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,944
No, not really.

135
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,514
because something was recorded o Sit,

136
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:53,018
bu rather because he was trying to hide
evidence that nothing was recorded!

138
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,086
What?

139
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,256
Just what do you mean?

140
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,027
There's something
mfve got to confirm first. though

142
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,365
Hey. Conan: what thclhecks going on!

143
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,266
What do you mean hide evidence
of nothing recorded!

145
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:14,106
Nothing was recorded on the tape I took,
the bomber didn't have to steal it, right?

147
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,543
Wait up @onan!

148
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,012
Hey, Conan!

149
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,549
Just as I thought

151
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,950
It's just as I thought!

153
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,022
W. What's with the mail box?

154
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,793
You know what time Mitsuhiko climbed
on top the mail box, don't you?

156
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,463
I don't remember details like that!

157
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,466
We can figure that out by
watching the video tape

159
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,701
because the time is also recorded

160
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,670
T.That's right!

162
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:48,574
'a Ww

163
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:54,546
Uh. it was the lime I was recording
something far away by zoom so .

165
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:59,118
Here it is!
It was 2:28 in the afternoon!

167
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,022
After that we ran into Officer Sato

168
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:09,795
until 14:38 when Mitsuhiko quit taking
video, we were by this mail box, right?

170
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,965
S.So what?

171
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,367
Then, take.-a look at this!

172
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,470
Look at the time the mail is
supposed to be picked up!

174
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,473
On holidays it says about 14:30

175
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,311
that meansythey come to pick the mail
uprabout 2:30 in the afternoon, right?

177
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,112
Y.Yeah...

178
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:33,118
Which means, we didn't see what we
were supposed to see, doesn't it?

180
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,588
Right!
The mailman"s car!

182
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,591
CI}!
He never came to pick the mails!

184
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:45,864
The road was blocked by the parade
so maybe it couldn't come through

186
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:50,069
No. they usually choose
a parade course

188
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,638
that does not interfere
with duties of that sort!

190
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,508
Besides only one lane is being used for
the parade that there is no way

192
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,510
that the mail truck cannot
make it's way here.

194
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:04,583
But, if the roads are crowded, it's
easy to be late about 8 minutes

196
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:09,922
No way, It didn't looK
Iike there was a traffic jam

198
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:14,259
and the collection time indicted on
the mail box is iniintervals of 5 minutes

200
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,262
If there is a discrepancy of
5 minutes earlier or later,

202
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,865
the only thing thinkable
is that something came up.

204
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:25,237
The one who triedbto steal Mitsuhike's
video camera is the bomber, right?

206
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:30,209
Right, what does the mail truck
have anything to do with this?

208
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:34,480
And besides. would anyone want to
steal the video tape in the first place?

210
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:38,317
If it was left as is, nobody
would've noticed anything

212
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:44,255
but now, it's like telling everybody
that something may be there!

214
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:48,093
Yeah, I guess they
didn't intend to steal it either

216
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,198
If we were just a bunch of ordinary kids
who came to watch the parade

218
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,569
II get it! Yumi's mini-police car!

219
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:02,674
You were witnessed talking intimately
with Yumi in front of the mailbox.

221
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,377
The culprit tried to
get rid of the evidence!

223
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,615
Yeah, If a bombing
incident takes part nearby,

225
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:14,286
it means that there is a possibility the
bomber would be recorded on the video,

227
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,856
and the police would without
doubt check the film out

229
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,260
Moreover, if we are
acquainted with the police.

231
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:25,297
The time it would tak) to check the
tape out would be pretty speedy...

233
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,534
That's what the bomber was afraid of!

234
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,871
They probably noticed Mitsuhiko's
video camera only after

236
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,606
they set the bomb up
under Officer Takagi's car

238
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,943
that was parked right
opposite the mailbox

240
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,114
They couldn't go retrieve the bomb

241
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,350
So they decided to get rid of the tape

242
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,885
I don't understand. though...

243
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:50,689
The bomber FAXED the police

244
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,891
to sort of let them know that
something was going to happen, right?

246
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,192
Y.Yes!

247
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:53,792
Y.Yes!

248
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,593
Y.Yes!

249
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:59,130
If they go ahead and call all the police
officers over here and blow the car up,

251
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:04,303
it's obvious that the police will
come frantically after them

253
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,339
Maybe they want
to distract the police?

255
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,376
By pretending to be the
same %Brhber 3 years ago?

257
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:16,081
Although»! have no idea
what kind of a case it was

259
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,951
Similar to the case 3 years ago,

260
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:22,387
it is extremely likely that the
bombers are after the lives of we,

262
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,822
the police just as they were then!

263
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,794
You looked so much like him,
the you in disguise...

265
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:33,599
It seems that the one Officer Sato was
trying to save just a while ago was...

267
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,903
I want to have a word with you later...

268
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:43,442
The question is,
what the bomber is after...

270
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:47,112
Yeah, it's very likely that the bomber
is not after the police ,

272
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,981
nor playing pranks
against the Spirits.

274
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:55,087
If my deduction is
correct, they are after...

276
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,356
But, since I'm still not sure,

277
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,627
I want you and Officer Takag
to check something out for me

279
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,730
You can count on us!

280
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,733
Officer Takagi. are you listening?

281
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:12,271
Y.Yeah, I'm listening

282
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,242
This is Ayumi!
€onan, I've found: the mailbox!

284
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,146
Okay, what's the location of the
mailbox and the collection time?

286
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,916
The mailbox is under the
pedestrian overpass,

288
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,218
two traffic signals away
from the first mailbox...

290
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,520
The collection time is...

291
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,890
AbJtit 14:35!

292
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,791
Okay's

293
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:37,896
MitsuhikO here! I've found in front of the
convenience store on 2nd Street!

295
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,767
Mhe'timeti about 14:45"!

296
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:46,872
T. This Genta! I found one
near the park on 3rd Street

298
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,374
The tithe i1sp14:55

299
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,577
Hey, Genta, how
come you're whispering?

301
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,416
I can't help, because I went through
someones yard. which was a short cut.

303
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,651
I was mistaken for ajthief
after women's underwear,

305
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,688
and I'm hiding from the
Iady who came after me

307
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,524
Hang in there

308
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,793
Now all we.have to
do is wait for Al

311
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,393
Yeah...
vy <4

313
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,130
Oh it's her!

314
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,332
This is the woman in black...

315
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,367
Hey!

316
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,770
The location of the mailbox is
on the side of a bus stop

318
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,873
that I's about 150 meters west
from the mailbox on 3rd Street.

320
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,743
The collection time is 16:25

321
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,814
I just saw all of you now,
can you see me?

323
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:29,681
Yeah!

324
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:35,654
« Lastly the pick up time
for the mailbox is...

326
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,590
150...

327
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,463
So. if I match all
information with the map...

329
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,900
The course of the mail
truck is like this...

331
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,837
Just like you said. Shinichi

332
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,407
it seems to be getting-farther and
farther from the course of the parade

334
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,478
In addition, today is the
/Sunday/before payday

336
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,215
Now, all we have to do is wait for I
@fficer Takagi to contact us

338
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,887
If there were no traffic-accidents
or road construction is this area today

340
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:14,359
the reason the mailstruck-didn-t
come to pick up the mail is...

342
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,186
Excuse me...

343
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,856
What's the matter, Mr. Tsutsumi

344
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,760
If you're dropping off the mail that
you collected, 'go around the back and

346
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:53,999
Oh, well, a large number of very
odd mail is mixed in the bag

348
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,836
1.1 want everyone to look at it now.

349
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,739
But could you open
the front entrance please?

351
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,643
O.Okay. I'll go open it right away...

352
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,329
T.Thank you.,so.much,
for the trouble

354
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,897
No problem

355
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:31,069
Se. what's this odd
mail you're talking about

357
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,671
W Well that's

358
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,178
H.Hey, just what do
you think you're doing?

360
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,015
Sorry, sorry, the
stuff I wanna.show is

362
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,788
This, Mr. Mailman.

363
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,022
AA gun!

364
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:55,260
Hey! The guys back there come up
front here with your hands in the air!

366
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,896
If you hesitate I'm going to kill you!

367
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,898
Hurry it up!

368
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,167
Over there. too!

369
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,037
Quit taking your time!

370
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,574
Okay, take!it all out, the cash

371
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:13,912
It's right before pay day
so I'll bet you're loaded!

373
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:21,153
So that's why you chose today, that would
overlap with the Toyo Spirits parade

375
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,587
Today, when the employees
at the post office

377
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,122
office would be reduced
because it's a Sunday...

379
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,591
You sent faxes and used
bombs to deceive us

381
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,327
into thinking it had something to do with
the bomb case 3 years ago,

383
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,229
and lured us out...

384
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,168
You went on te make-it 10ok like a bad
prank towards the Spirits to throw us off

386
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,304
And while we were being confused

387
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:45,143
you attacked the post office using
the mail truck you hi-jacked

389
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,114
Well, it's;not such
an intelligentuideatthough

391
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:55,487
Hey. you over there! Gut out your
babblingOHurry it up andget up here!

393
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:59,157
So. he says. Hurry all of you!

394
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,928
Come on, hurry!

395
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,567
HHey: what's going on?

396
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,302
W. Why...

397
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,839
Why are there so many of you,
when it's a Sunday!

399
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,707
Oh, didn't you know?

400
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,443
Although we all belong to civil service

401
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,580
we're not like the post office employees
who have regular days off

403
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,983
We're on duty
24 hours 365 days a year

405
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,552
That's how it is for us police officers!

406
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,688
C.Cops!

407
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,857
Inspector Megure!

408
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:36,461
We've taken:custody of all the mailmen
we found tied upyin the mail trucks!

410
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,195
Good.

411
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,530
Y.You cops!

412
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,931
Cut it out!

413
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,571
Because your way of
thinking sure isn't wise

415
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,477
D.Dang it!

416
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,883
So. the post office
thieves were arrested.

418
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,558
The other robbers; who
set bombs at different. places

420
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,495
different places and were waiting\for the
others to return were all safely arrested

422
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,464
And. that night...

423
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,065
And. that night.

424
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,637
But. it's a wonder you figured out

425
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,873
that the bomber's real target
was robbing the post office

427
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:26,611
Oh, well, not really,
the kids dropped the hint

429
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,583
Oh, you mean Conan, right?
He's no ordinary kid after all!

431
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,518
V.Very true...

432
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,957
I'm sorry, about this afternoon, for
slapping you all of a sudden like that

434
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,791
I'll bet it hurt?

435
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:45,230
Oh, no, I'm to blame
for not following orders...

437
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,133
A.Are you all right, @fficer Sato?

438
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,168
The burn on the palm of your hands...

439
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,637
I'm fine, though it still hurts a bit

440
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,326
Although it still kind of stings.
I'll be fine.

442
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,227
All"ll"have to do is put a
Iittle-spit on it and wallah!

444
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,463
O.Oh%I guess so! I'm glad...

445
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,541
Officer Sato?

446
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,142
What?

447
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:34,913
You mentioned earlier that
you wanted to talk to me...

449
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh. that...

450
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,749
Oh. that...

451
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,088
@ @Officer Sato...

452
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,694
Let's call off the
date we were planning on!

454
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,697
I'm cursed!

455
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,531
C.Cursed?

456
00:18:55,001 --> 00:19:01,039
Because, all the people that I ¢
herish vanish from before me

458
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:05,777
My father, my
PE. teacher in elementary

460
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,848
school, my senior
in baseball club and...

462
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,253
And, him too...

463
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:15,820
And, him too...

464
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,060
I don't want to go through
anything like that ever again...

466
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,363
@.@fficer Sato...

467
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,969
So. I'd rather we stay like we are now
colleagues at the police station

469
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:36,307
O.Officer Sato...

470
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,277
Officer Takagi...

471
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,287
That's the way to go!
Go for it Takagi!

473
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,822
Push! Push!

474
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,757
Push it, man Push!

475
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,634
You guys are sort of heavy...

476
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,906
Officer Sato I...

477
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,342
Officer Takagi?

478
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,214
I will never...

479
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,230
Right, You and me, we don't
really work out to begin with...

481
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:37,268
Right, right!
I cuter girl is way better for you!

483
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,570
Y.You think so...

484
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,637
Yes, yest

485
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,875
You chicken... w

486
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,645
Bye for now then!

487
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,251
Officer Sato...

What's the matter,
Officer Takagi

542
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,808
You look kind of pale...

543
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,743
Are you eating right?

544
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:03,615
Let's hurry up and start questioning the
people about the post office robbery

546
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:08,185
It seems he's still hasn't recovered
from the last time he was brushed off

548
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,922
C.Come now Au"

549
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,656
Why do you know about it?

550
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,093
Hey, Takagi! Howazit!

551
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,529
If you're notffeeling up to it, I can
take over questioning for you!

553
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,731
Oh, no, well .

554
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,433
Hey!
Takagi, your shoulder sure is stiff!

00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,036
