Just as flowing water has no form,

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,037
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,939
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,708
Today's stage is an ordinary condo.

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,243
The Youth Detective Squad use their
brains and bodies to solve the case.

8
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,878
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,713
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:17,350
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,923
I wish I could find something
nteresting to do...

19
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:07,093
The world is full of cases
Oo be solved and yet...

21
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:11,464
It's strange that nothing's
happening only around us.

23
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,899
Nothing's strange about it.

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,768
That's the way it should be...

25
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,104
What's that?

26
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,708
It's a ring!

27
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,311
I wonder where it came flying from?

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,382
There was nobody on this side.

29
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,251
I think somebody threw it
from the window of this condo.

31
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,154
Aaagh?!

32
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,255
Huh?

33
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,457
All the windows are closed

34
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,259
A prank?

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,128
Hey, watch it you!

36
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,564
I wonder why it's on something like this?

37
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:47,900
It's an "SS" shaped hook.

38
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,869
There's one here too.

39
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,739
Maybe that hook was also
attached to the ring

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,741
but came off when it fell
to the ground...

43
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,611
Wait a minute!

44
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,846
What's up?

45
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,182
Hey, hey, don't tell me...

46
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,518
Look!

47
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,987
Doesn't this look like a word?!

48
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,656
SOS?!

49
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,824
Yes!

50
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,692
This ring and "SS" shaped hooks are an

51
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,696
SOS sign that somebody is sending us!

52
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,165
Ha, ha, ha .

53
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,400
I expected them to say that.

54
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,171
If so, it must be a woman.

55
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,072
Huh?

56
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,142
There is lipstick on the hook.

57
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,113
She's right! There's lipstick on it!

58
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,383
Hey, hey, you're getting carried away...

59
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:41,053
Mitsuhiko, will you show me the ring?!

60
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,323
This is a wedding ring!

61
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,058
See, MM to A

62
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,064
1999 March 21 is carved on it!

63
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,067
This means that the ring was sent from

64
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,670
somebody with the initial My,
to someone with the initial A.

66
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,007
And that they were married ony
March 21, 1999.

68
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,543
Wow, it's amazing that
you can teliwAYum:!

70
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,013
My parents' ring has the same thing
carved on it!

72
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,484
So this ring is one that
the woman was wearing!

74
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,153
Her husband's initial is M

75
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:16,155
and her initial is A!

76
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:16,956
Uh-huh!!

77
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,558
Will you lend it to me

78
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,895
The size of this ring is about 11.

79
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,631
Regularly take sizes 7 to 9, so

80
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,567
this woman ust have pretty fat fingers.

82
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,170
Listen, you guys...

83
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,705
There's no mistake about it!

84
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,974
The one who sent out an SOS...

85
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,179
is somewhere on the 1st to the 9th floor
of this condo,

87
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,448
and is for some reason is
rendered immobile!

89
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,451
Ould it be an accident...

90
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,319
Maybe she's locked up.

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,120
Hun?

93
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,456
All the windows are loosed.

94
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,859
Which means that either she closed them
right after she dropped the ring

96
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,394
because she sensed danger,

97
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,397
or the one confining her
closed them, right?

99
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,665
We'll have to find that room in a hurry

100
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,067
because she may be in danger!

101
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,070
All right! The Youth Detective Squad,
to the scene on the double!

103
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,205
Let's go!!

104
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:07,139
Yeah!!

105
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,682
Hey! You.

106
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,151
Don't tell me you seriously think
it's a kidnap case?

108
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,686
I don't know.

109
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,556
But it's a good way
to pass the time, isn't it?

112
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:34,900
What's the matter?

113
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,504
The door is an auto lock door
and it{won't open.

115
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,239
Behind you...

116
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,708
Oh! Have a nice day.

117
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,580
So, we got in, but what now?

118
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,848
Let's check the initials of the couples

119
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,018
who live in the rooms facing
the little window that we just saw,

121
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,121
and the room numbers
from the 1st to 9th floors!

123
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,990
But, how?

124
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,526
There doesn't seem to be
a manager's room here either...

126
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,330
The-road we came from is
exactly west of this condo.

128
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,434
All we have to do is find a room in this
condo that faces exactly west!

130
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,169
This way!

131
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,037
Okay!

132
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,108
He's pretty good, isn't he?

133
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,044
That's nothing to be amazed of!

134
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,015
Tsutomu Otake...

135
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,353
The initial of his first name is "T"
for Tsutomu.

137
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:28,887
It's notsthis room.

138
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,758
All the rooms above this one should
have a number 5 on them.

140
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,826
Let's split up and check the name plates!

142
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,036
Al and Ayumi, go check
the odd number lead,

144
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,772
W'll go check the even number floors.

145
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,240
You can count on us!

146
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,781
Goju...kaze.

147
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,650
Unusual name.

148
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,219
It's not read like that.

149
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,021
It's read Igarashi.

151
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,624
Shima...

152
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:08,294
We have no way of knowing
with just the last name.

154
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,094
Uh-huh...

155
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:09,495
Uh-huh...

156
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,564
Shinichiro Ohyama...

157
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,768
the initial off his first name is "S"...

158
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,836
It's not this room.

159
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:18,837
No...

160
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,106
We did it!

161
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,375
The names of the entire family
are written!

163
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,476
FIEse RAE

164
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,846

166
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,116
Too bad, no good again.

167
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,320
Their initials are "K" for Kosaku
and "N" for Natsue.

169
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,923
And all their initials were displayed...

170
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,461
Akihiko and Misato Uehara...

171
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,330
A" and "NM".

172
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,333
We did it! Isn't this it?!

173
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:50,202
Genta, we're looking for
a husband with the initial "MM"

175
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,671
and a wife with the initial.

176
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,006
This is the opposite!

177
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,742
-_ aa
I OCC

179
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,178
Look here!

180
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,447
Michihiro Ishida!

181
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,248
The initial of the first name is "MM"!

182
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,119
We can't tell what the name of
his wife is...

184
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,588
He may be living alone.

185
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,756
Oh...

186
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,662
Five rooms may be a possibility.

187
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,065
Out of the five, four only had
their last names listed outside...

189
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,470
Um, maybe their names may be
written on the post box outside!

191
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,804
Oh that's right!

192
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,339
Let's go check!

193
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,475
Good thinking Ayumi!

194
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,544
Wait! Please stay here Genta.

195
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,481
If we all go out
we won't be able to get back in. 8

197
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,082
okay...no fun!

198
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,022
Rooms 205 and 305 have only
the last name listed, after all

200
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,927
But look! 805 and 905!

201
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,330
Yoshio and Eisuke...

202
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,066
Y" and "TE" so they aren't the ones.

203
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,002
So, we've only got three more to go.

204
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,937
Room 205 and 305.

205
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,207
I wonder if there's any way
we can check the names?

207
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:02,808
Hmm...

208
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,144
There is a way.

209
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,346
Huh? Uh, where are you going?

210
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,282
Agh, hey, just where are you guys going?

211
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,018
Hey, don't leave me here alone...

212
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:17,289
Here it is!

213
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:21,493
4-11-10 Beikacho. It's the address
of this condo.

215
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,496
The name is, Toru Igarashilyg

216
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,832
Thesinitiaks "T" so he isn't the one.

217
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:31,904
Here it is!

218
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,374
Masakazu Shima!

220
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,976
The.nitial of his first name 1s "MM"?!

221
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,244
All right!

222
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:43,248
So, the possibilities now-are
Mr. Masakazu Shima of room 305

224
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,784
and Mr. Michihiro Ishida of room 705.

225
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,855
But™this~is as far asswe can check...

226
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,755
Hmm...

227
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,457
Hmm. ..7

228
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,995
How about if we check the bicycles!

229
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,798
On, that's a good idea, Mitsuhiko...!

230
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,669
Oh, shoots! What're they doing?!

231
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,537
Hey.

232
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,805
Agh...

233
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,273
Oh no, don't close...

234
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,478
What's up?

235
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,680
It seems that you've gotten interested.

236
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,883
\ They!re so serious about it, so...

237
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,618
I found it!

238
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,954
Mr. Shimars bicycle! -See!

239
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,356
Asuka,

240
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,493
her initial is "A"!

241
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,496
Then, the husband's initial is
MM" and the wife's initial is "A"?!

243
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,430
Bingo!

244
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,231
We've finally found them!!

245
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,202
But, there's still Mr. Michihiro Ishida left

246
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,606
If it's just one family,
I guess we couldvask the neighbors.

248
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,146
I guess nobody's home

249
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,082
If the neighbor's not in,
Iet's go right down below.

251
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,462
This is the room where the initials "A"
and "WM" belonged to the wrong person.

253
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,665
I made a mistake!

254
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,269
What is it?

256
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:15,207
were doing research for
our Japanese class...

258
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,209
What, I can't hear you very well!

259
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,812
And, we're checking on
Japanese names in particular

261
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,017
Do you happen to know the name of
Mr. lshida's wife, who lives above you?

263
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,820
How should I know the name of
the wife of person who lives above me?!

265
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,226
What a lady!

266
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,496
If right below 1s no good then...

267
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,097
Let's go right above, right?

268
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,167
Mr. Ishida's wife's name?

269
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,103
I'm sure it was Fumiko

270
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,073
U-M-I-K-O...

271
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,610
Once before a postal delivery for her
was mistakenly delivered here.

273
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,745
Fumiko, which means

274
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,279
The initial of her name is "FF".

275
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:58,951
Her child is called Yuta and
he's a smart kid.

277
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,422
He got locked up in the closet
once before and couldn't come out!

279
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,289
Huh?

280
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,092
A closet, you mean the room
to the extreme west?

282
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,226
Right! Right!

283
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,862
What do you think he did?

284
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,932
He dropped toilet paper
out of the window of the restroom,

286
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,734
and let the people who
were walking below know.

288
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,604
Miss!!

289
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:22,541
Do all the people who live in
this condo know that story?!!

291
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,610
Yes, I'm sure they do.

292
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,079
It's a well known story
within this condo so

294
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,082
Oh my God!

295
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,750
It's been done before!

296
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,688
Conan!

297
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,824
What on earth is the matter?

298
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,425
We're going to the 3rd floor!

299
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,327
Because the only ones with
the initials "MM" and "A" are

301
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,831
Masakazu Shima and
his wife Asuka of room 305.

303
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,034
What's going on,
you're: suddenly so interested

305
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,639
He starting to think that there something
going on after talking to the lady.

308
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,415
What?

310
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:37,683
Hide! &

311
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,617
Huh?

312
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,418
Wait for me!

313
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,397
They're thieves!

314
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,399
They're wearing gloves!

315
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,268
Sunglasses too!

316
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:58,803
You don't even finish the job right!

317
00:13:59,138 --> 00:13:59,471
Huh?

318
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,339
Why'd you kill for?!

319
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,074
Shut up!

320
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,142
K, Kill?!

321
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,211
We're too late!

322
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,146
What shall we do, Conan?!

323
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,815
Let's call the police!

324
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,417
Hurry, into the elevator!!

325
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,487
411 £-
We've got to get outside
before they get on the elevator!!

328
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,239
Whew, that was a close one...

329
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,608
Police officers!

330
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,809
Huh?

331
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,077
Let's tell them!

332
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,280
Big trouble!
It's armed robbery and murder!!

334
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,148
What?!

335
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,816
In that condo over there!

336
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,619
You'd better hurry
or the crimnals'll get away!

338
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,287
Please hurry!

339
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,360
Hold it!!

340
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,295
You're not getting away!

341
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,497
Huh?

342
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,431
What is it?

343
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,033
It's them!

344
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,770
They killed a woman!

345
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,005
They may be armed with a gun!

346
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:07,773
What?!

347
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,708
What's with you guys?!!

348
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,443
What on earth is this about?!

349
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,044
Freeze!!

350
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,980
You kids go outside!

351
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,717
Please check inside room 305

352
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,386
The dead body of Asuka Shima
should be there!

354
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,454
Dead body?!

355
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,122
What are you talking about.

356
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,124
There's no such dead body!

357
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,259
Don't lie!

358
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,394
Then why did you say,

359
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,263
Why did you kill?" Just a while ago?!

360
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,398
We all heard you,.right?!

361
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,065
Yep!!

362
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,468
Ah come on!

363
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,603
That's about an insect.

364
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:39,604
An insect?

365
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,241
I was angry because
he carelessly killed my insect.

367
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:46,378
And, besides, I'm Asuka Shima.

Ghads, talk about being a nuisance.

376
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,127
There was no dead body anywhere!

377
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,663
Besides, we checked with the neighbors

378
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,599
and they verified that those two
were Mr. and Mrs. Shima too.

380
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,535
All of you, apologize to them.

382
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,603
Yes sir...

383
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,003

384
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,874
Were really very sorry...

385
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,275
No problem.

386
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,812
We confused you with the subject
we were talking about too.

388
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,347
But, officer,

389
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,283
it's true that someone is
being locked up!!

391
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,952
No, that's enough!

392
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,621
Don't you ever doll
something like this again!

00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,121

396
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:30,956

399
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,931
They were married...

400
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,802
We completely mistook them
to be armed robbers and murderers.

402
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,036
There is no other room

403
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,539
where the occupants initials
are "MM" or "A" Is there.

405
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,478
Something bothers me...

406
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,680
I wonder what it is...

407
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,148
Um...

408
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,686
Maybe the person's name in room 705
IS read Ayako and not Fumiko?

410
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:02,621
Huh?

411
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,557
Right! If it's read "Ayako"
the initial would be "A"!

413
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:16,468
We're: luc « to buy the meat
so cheap, weren't we, Fumiko.

415
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,336
We sure were, mother

416
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,872
So, it's read Fumiko, after all.

417
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,741
So, they're safe.

418
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,011
Hurry up, Yuta.

419
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:32,183
He's the toilet paper boy, isn't he!

420
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,962
Hurry up, Yuta.

421
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,066
What a skinny mother.

422
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,437
My mom is so over-weight
that she's wearing dad's tee-shirts

424
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,039
Over-weight...?!!

425
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,975
Ayumiy let me see-the ring!

426
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,312

427
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,049
Agh! What's with him?!

428
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,452
«Hey, Conan?!

429
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,654
What's up?!

430
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,325
Open up, what're you saying, Conan!!

431
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,296
He's gone...

432
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,175
You again?

433
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,643
What now?

434
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,512
H,Hey!

435
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,780
What's with you, anyway!

436
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,385
This is what was bothering me after all!

437
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,722
Hey, get out of here, will you!

438
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,258
Are you Mr Akihiko Uehara s wife?

439
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,861
Is your name Misato?

440
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,063
Huh? Y...Yes

441
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,599
This is yours then, isn't it?

442
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,068
I picked it up in front of
the door a while ago

444
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,504
he initials "A" for Akihiko and

445
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,540
for the initial of your fist name
Is carved on it...

447
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,875
Try it on.

448
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:16,154
Take a good look at the ring lady.

449
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,290
The initials "M" to "A" are carved on it

450
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:20,425
Huh?

451
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,295
From Misato to Akihiko.

452
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,297
Yeah

453
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,233
that's actually Akihiko's ring

454
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,770
But, Misato was wearing it.

455
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,506
That's why it was hard to tell!

456
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,841
According to the neighbors

457
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,743
they say that
Misato has recently gained weight.

459
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:45,150
Not being able to wear her own ring, she
probably wore Akihiko's ring instead...

461
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,887
Because many Japanese men don't
wear rings even after getting married...

463
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:55,093
And besides, I think that Akihiko has
slender fingers for a man.

465
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,098
What are you trying to say?

466
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:05,203
Aren't those shoes a little
too small for you to wear?

468
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,207
Phooey! What are you getting at?

469
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:16,414
What I want to say is that
you're not Misato, an impostor!

471
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,682
Huh?

472
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,818
If so...

473
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,886
What?!

477
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,434
That was real close...

478
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,717
Mrs Misato Uehara?

479
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,452
Yes, who are you?

481
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,456
I'm Conan Edogawa, a detective.

II Ri§hts Reserved

524
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,547
Her name is Ilkuyo Hasegawa.

525
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,916
She was used to be Misato Uehara's
husband's ex-colleague, Akihiko

527
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:36,187
since Akihiko had found that she had
embezzled money from the company,

529
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,956
she was fired
from the company.

531
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,024
She had committed
the crime out of hatred for him.

533
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,562
Ikuyo had visited the condo
in order to kill Akihiko

535
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:49,367
When Misato answers the door,
Ikuyo put her to sleep using a drug,

537
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,636
and locked her up in the closet.

538
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,339
Misato, who came to a while later .

539
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,208
Connects the ring to the "SS" hook

540
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,677
and throws it out of the window
in hopes of getting help

542
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,547
But, right after that,

543
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,483
Ikuyo who comes to check on her
closes the window,

545
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,087
and was put to sleep again with the drug

546
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:12,490
Wow, you really did a good job!

547
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,892
Take care on your way home!

548
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,094
Yes sir!

549
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,999
Not fair, Conan!

550
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,868
Really,
taking all the good part for yourself.

552
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,536
Yeah;you get me so mad!

553
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,940
You hold all this as punishment!

554
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,209
What?!

555
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,612
Am I supposed to hold all this?!

556
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,014
Of course!!

557
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,415
Hey, wait!

558
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,150
W What the ?!

559
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,020
Thanks for holding mine too.

560
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,890
Hey, hey not you too...

561
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,634
J It's my turn-to send out an SOS signal...

562
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,239
What is Chronin??

563
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,842
Chronin is deadly toxic so...

564
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,777
Huh?!

565
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,880
Hey, these are the gloves for 120 yen!

566
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,550
We can make mole balls with it...

567
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,952
Youth Detective Squad,

568
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,554
I've found the bicycle we're searching for!

569
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,623
Come to the scene on the double!

570
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,026
Who does that guy intend to feed it to?
