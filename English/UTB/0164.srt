1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:03,536
Inspiration flashes that pierce right
through

3
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:04,837
Once he gets going nothing
can stop him.

5
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,873
Today, the secreticode is solved!

6
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:08,841
A small hint becomes a big thing!

7
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,509
The one and only truth is brought
into the light

9
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,345
He looks like a child but he's got
the brains of an adult!

11
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,114
His name is... Detective Conan!

12
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:59,118
He planed the treasure hunt for
the Junior Detective Squad.

14
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,856
The location is the second house of
Agasa's uncle.

16
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:08,394
No one should be in the house
for:50 years sinceihe died

18
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:14,266
but there were traces of someone living
theretsecretly with strange codes

20
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,706
There were symbols like a moon, a star, and

22
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,275
on things like a vase, a plate, and
a candle stand.

24
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:32,418
We found out toys hidden by Dr. Agasa
for the treasure hunt were tattered

26
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,589
so, we felt that there was a big
secret in this house

28
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:44,397
We found out 7 secret codes after
Iooking around the house.

30
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,599
Card

31
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,034
French-Japanese Dictionary

32
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,301
Record

33
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,171
Airplane

34
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,672
Wine glass

35
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,540
Portrait

36
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,009
and gadget doll

37
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:02,448
Dr. Agasa also remembered
the same codes

39
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,552
on a letter from the his aunt

40
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:13,559
and he brought it to my father,
a detective story novelist...

42
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,561
Right

43
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,430
That novelist knew too...

44
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,834
This secret code was all in "hiragana

45
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:23,436
H Hiragana?

46
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,371
Conan, is it really...

47
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,741
It's best to think,
that the sender of those letters

49
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,943
and the person who
wrote this secret code

51
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,046
are both the same person...

52
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,950
B, But... why did he send the secret
de to my aunt...

54
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,320
He didn'tfwant anybody
but your aunt to know...

56
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,056
For example, someone
was after him...

58
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,692
Come to think of it...
y aunt said this...

60
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,396
A strange;guy often peeks
nto the mailbox...

62
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:55,267
That's probably the guy
who slashed up the toys...

64
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:59,205
Something's going on after all...

65
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,340
This house...

66
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:08,280
SECRET OF THE MOON,
THE STAR, & THE SUN

68
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,084
But...even if we know that this
secret:code is in "hiragana"...

70
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,786
we haven't the faintest idea
what's it about...

72
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,022
Don't worry, if there's a hint...
we've got it in the bag!

74
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,057
What?

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,629
White sun moon, star...
and... black moon...

78
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,433
there's differences in the
shape of the stars...

80
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,701
but none in the black sun...

81
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,103
In "hiragana...

82
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,239
what's the letter that
doesn't have a "step" or a "line"...

84
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,939
an outcast letter?

85
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,643
Doesn't have a step or line...?

86
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,378
Nn outcast...?

87
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,546
I Know!

88
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,014
Un"! Isn't it?!

89
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:46,485
That's it! The black sun
represents "~un"!

91
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,454
The next thing to look at is...

92
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,191
the three figures on the right that
are the same In all the codes!

94
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:59,532
It means that they hold a different
meaning from the ones in the front!

96
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,901
I. I see...

97
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:06,605
xt... is the'small black and wh
circles around the figures!

99
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,509
We don't know the meaning of the
black circle onthe bottom right,

101
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,278
but the black:and white circles
n the upper right...

103
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,547
judging from the position...

104
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,449
they're probably G, Z and P
sound points of "hiragana!

106
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,819
Hey, what does G, Z and P sound points
mean?

108
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,689
Don't you remember learning it at
school...

110
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,725
G, Z sound points are those two raised
slash-marks on the top right of the
Ietter...

113
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:29,862
they make up the "G" sounds
and the"Z" sounds!

115
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,598
The P sound point is that raised
circle on the top right that

117
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,900
make up the sounds
PA PI, PU, PE, PO!

119
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,469
Let's take a look at the code again...

120
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,172
The crescent moon facing up...
has a black circle...

122
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,742
a white circle... and no circle...
there are three types

124
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:49,415
In other words, this crescent moon
facing upward is one of the "HA" line
Ietters...

127
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:54,386
I see! The "HA" line is the only one
that has G,Z and P sound points!

129
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,188
With that in mind...

130
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,193
The easiest to read would be
this wine glass code...

132
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,362
The four letters excluding
the three on the right...

134
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,932
The-third black-@'sun,r,is""Mn"

135
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,135
the fourth is a letter in the " pa"
Iine...

137
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:14,473
A word that uses letters " un"
and one in the " pa" line...

139
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:18,043
Panty. hairpin, pelican...

140
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,046
Anpan bread, melon bread,
curry bread...

142
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,717
Personal computer, Japan, lamp...?!

144
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,254
It's cards!

145
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,624
That's right! This probably
says " cards"!

147
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,126
Wait a minute... if so...

148
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,596
The secret code written
on this candle stand...

150
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:41,133
e first letters "pu"... a
the fourth letter will be " ra

152
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,701
PU...Ta...

153
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,237
pun u r001, n pen , u ran

154
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,072
I see! It's "propeller"!

155
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,374
Wait wait...

156
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:52,878
if this black crescent
moon is " ro"... this code...

159
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,515
FFUPBIIBLU... TU TU

160
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,251
Iook... Look at the propeller!

161
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,122
There's a code written on the backside
of the plane's propeller!

163
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,423
There sure is...

164
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,359
If the black circle on the upper right
Isa G, Z sound point...

166
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,130
thevsecond, letter is "bu"...
he third letter is "ra"...

168
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,532
Look at

169
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,633
bu ra"...

171
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,370
Look at the oil painting!!

172
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,606
It's talking about this portrait!

173
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,608
Alright, I've got it!

174
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:28,514
The phrase, "look at" is stuckvon to
erything named in this house...

176
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:32,785
In other words, if you follow those
clues you'll reach something...

178
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:38,223
something so important a secret code
had to be used to hide it!

180
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,025
RR, Really 7?!

181
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,330
Okay, we'll solve all the codes and
get the treasure!

183
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:50,069
Hey, is there really a treasure
hidden here?

185
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,005
Ahn, I don't know if it's treasure,

186
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,041
but there's no mistake that
something is hidden!

188
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,745
LELS See... Ue Code Onl ule plidile

190
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:04,616
The third is "un"... the second is a
Ietter that has a G, Z sound point,
$000000

193
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,986
Let's see... "ka", " bi" "un"?

194
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,856
Vase! The vase!!

195
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,525
The secret code on the dictionary is...

196
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,729
Let's see

198
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,665
It's the .fireplace!!

199
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,135
If so... then, the code on

It's the wine glass!

203
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,243
Uh? Conan...

204
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,880
Until now...
there's 17 letters that we know!

206
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:40,419
And, if we make deductions from the
e... from the blank portions.

208
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,188
Are you saying something?

209
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,491
Here, take a look at this!

210
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,693
This is the chart to decode the
secret code!

212
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,561
Oww! This is great

213
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:57,403
As you can see, the sun, moon,
and stars are "AE 1 O U" that mark
each line!

216
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,172
And, all of it follow the same rule...

217
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,775
You can tell it goes
sidewards too, cant your?

219
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,344
For example, the sun and star...

220
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:09,415
The thorns surrounding it are missing
clockwise from the top...

222
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,850
The moon goes clockwise too...

223
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,820
And, the black circle on
the bottom right, that was a mystery,

225
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,389
was a mark added when
there wasn't enough-figures!

227
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,758
hhhhh, I see...

228
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:25,697
Furthermore, if you use that chart
to read all the secret codes and
connect them together...

231
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,999
This is what it becomes!

237
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,805
Look at the candle stand

238
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,239
Look at the propeller

239
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,641
Look at the oil painting

240
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,176
Look at the record

241
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,544
Look at the doll

242
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,978
Look.at the wine glass

243
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,346
Look at the card

244
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,148
Look at the French dictionary

245
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,783
iii
ook at the fireplace...!

247
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,251
The fire place!!

248
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,854
Then, the treasure is in the fireplace!

249
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,762
Gee, there's nothing here?!

250
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,165
It's a code! There's a secret
code carved!

252
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,900
What! Really?!

253
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,436
Ayumi! Lend me that decoding chart!

254
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,874
Sure! Conan, you mean this, don't you!

255
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,376
Let's see... that code is...

256
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,316
Hey! What's written?

257
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,084
Hurry up and tell us!

258
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,284
Conan!

259
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:22,654
Oh! Don't keep us 'waiting!

260
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,356
Plates».

261
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,226
Look at the plate...

262
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,726
What ?1

263
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:32,130
P, Plate? The first plate we saw?

264
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,067
Good grief... we're right back where
ored look. we started...

266
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,036
The code is spinning us in circles

267
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,171
You're kidding...

268
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,974
It's just a bad joke...

269
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,576
Joke? That can't be...

270
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,979
using a secret code that maybe
wouldn't be able to-decoded?...

272
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,914
Would he do something
so complicated?:But...

274
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:54,486
if you follow the code...
you go back to the beginning...

276
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,457
or... is it saying that thisxdecoding
chart is wrong

278
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,058
J! dS. 4 .
No... that can't be...

280
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:07,966
There's gotta be something...
Nn the order of this code...

282
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,534
true meaning...

283
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,575
It can't be helped...

284
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:21,046
Let's put everything back to where
they were before the police arrive!

287
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,757
Let's see...of

288
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,492
The plate was in the cupboard...

289
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,659
Wait a minute

290
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,563
if you connect the first letters of these
plate and vase

292
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,300
sa ka r0 pu ah re ni wa tofu da...

293
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,101
What's that. @f&

294
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,539
The vase goes here...

295
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,877
Maybe... if you change it
Oo roman characters...

297
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,313
The candle stand goes on
the fireplace...

299
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,948
guess not...

300
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,986
Professor, this airplane... where was it?

301
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:06,525
Oh, it was beside that vase... I took
It to the bedroom!

304
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,996
Beside the vase, beside the vase...

305
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,831
Maybe I should try changing
it to English?/

307
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,368
No, maybe French...
r. maybe German...

309
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,003
Record we

310
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:21,373
Nothing seems to ring a'bell...

311
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,176
Doll, dol...

312
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,154
Hey!

313
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,189
Huh?

314
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,094
Why don't you help out a bit... don't
just sit in the middle of the room...

316
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:47,132
Hey, Professor... you said the cards
were in this room too, didn't you?

318
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:52,638
They were originally right below the
clock, but I used them!

320
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,240
Which means...

321
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,678
all the items with the code written
n them were in this room...!

323
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,581
Wait a minute...

324
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,883
if you connect them with a line...

325
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:10,522
Start from the plate...
the vase... the candle stand...

327
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:19,264
Propeller... oil painting... record...
oll...... wine glass#O. card...

329
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:24,336
French dictionary... fireplace...
nd the plate...

331
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,538
It's concentrated in the center of the
room!!

333
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,440
That's why Ayuni. has passed by me
O many times...

335
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,207
Licuoridiy... viouolidly...
That's why Ayuni. has passed by me
so'many times...

338
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,443
That's why Ayuni. has passed by me
0 many times...

340
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,845
But, that's strange...

341
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:38,450
this is the center of the room,
but there's nothing different about it...

343
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,552
it's not on the floor...

344
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,260
groove...
he base of the chandelier...

346
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,262
Let's put off the treasure
hunt until next time...

348
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,164
Professor! Let me ride your shoulder!
What?

350
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,465
Hurry!!

351
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,499
A, Ahn...

352
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,267
A, Ann...

355
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,139
Whoop!

358
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,181
VV, vviidl IS IL... IIS S0Uurna...

359
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,484
H, Hey... what's going on...

360
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,922
S, Sounds like something fell upstairs...

361
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,157
Let's go and see!

362
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:21,693
H, Hey, Conan!!

363
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,108
Uff, huff...

364
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,878
Right above that room...

365
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,416
is this room!

370
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,588
onan, what's going on...

371
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,125
here's stairs in the room...

372
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,861
I see... so, that's it!

373
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:00,799
That code was pointing at the chandelier
trick in the center of the room...

375
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,369
In other words, it was pointing out
the hidden stairs in this room!

377
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:09,274
I heard that my uncle liked gadgets
but,

379
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:09,508
I didn't think he had something like
IS set up...

381
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,445
Then, could the treasure be up there?!

382
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,748
Hn, something is hidden...
at's for sure...

384
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,184
Alright, let's go running up
the stairs. Let's hurry!!

386
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,721
T's this room...

387
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,689
s pitch black...

388
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,926
At this rate, we can't see anything...

389
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:32,097
anyway, let's open the window...

390
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,165
Huh... 7

391
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:36,968
nished 1 yen coins... A

392
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,471
is is a tube of oil paint...

393
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:44,376
Oh, look! Something's on the desk!

394
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,744
Is it treasure?!

395
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,017
Hey, what's the matter?

396
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,322
What is it... speak up...

397
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,058
Skeleton!!

398
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,560
What?!

399
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,768
W, Who is it... that corpse... 7

400
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,937
Didn't I tell you a while ago?

401
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,540
There was an old person with
skilled hands living here...

403
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,609
He's probably the one who carved the

404
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,945
1 yen coin and
wrote those secret codes!

406
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,714
He wasn't killed, was he...

407
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:28,019
he passed away whi
writing a letter to your aunt...

409
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,623
Looks like he had a bad heart...

410
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,427
But, how did he know about this
hidden room?

412
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:40,065
The only ones who knew about it were
my uncle and aunt who lived here...

414
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,900
There's one other, isn't there?

415
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,768
Before your uncle died

416
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,272
there was a person who was
and out of this house...

418
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,241
Fore my uncle died...

419
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,076
That painting...

420
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:55,881
Right, that portrait of your aunt and

421
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,049
It's that artist who painted that picture!

422
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,086
He probably heard about this
hidden room from your uncle

424
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,255
while doing the painting...

425
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,858
But, why did he have
to live and hide here?

427
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,395
And, those coded letters to my aunt...
hy...?

429
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,331
Reason...Is probably...

430
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:14,132
Huh... 7

431
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:14,399
Huh...?

432
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,767
Hat's this...

433
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,105
A 20 dollar bill printing plate?!

434
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,706
Counterfeit!!

435
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:26,077
He was probably as
at the desk by someone to make it!

437
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,581
But, it bothered him and he
ilsappeared with the plate...

439
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,852
To escape from that somebody,

442
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,121
Those letters he wrote to your aunt

443
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:39,124
were to show her his appreciation for
Ietting him live here...

445
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,192
He used the secret code because he
didn't want anybody,

447
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:45,664
other than your
aunt, to know where he was...

449
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:50,468
Then, that person who was
peeking into my aunt's mailbox was...

451
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,139
the person who order
the counterfeit!

453
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:58,076
And, the person who slashed up the toys
ou hid is also the same person...

455
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,878
Nn excellent answer...

456
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,117
I thought I'd found where that guy was

457
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,187
and where he hid the
printing plate...

459
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:14,693
but, there were only toys in the box...
dl slashed them up...

461
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:18,430
I heard that he was friendly with the
owner of this house

463
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,832
and suspected this
was the place...

465
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,536
but, I didn't know
there was a hidden room...

467
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,704
Thanks, kids...

468
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,406
uu rat...

470
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,512
Don't move! I don't want to make a
urderer of myself...

472
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:39,050
And also... if you make the wrong
move and the bullet

474
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,320
hits the plate,
won't be of any use...

476
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,829
Young lady?

477
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,432
Hat's right... you...

478
00:18:54,433 --> 00:19:00,372
Get that printing plate from the old
an and bring it over here...

480
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,012
That's it... you're a good girl.

481
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,781
If you can bring it right over to me...

482
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,485
I'll give you a reward...

483
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,026
Y, You brat! Wanna get blown away!!

484
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:26,297
Don't panic! I'll give it to you later...

485
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,334
Tomoaki Okuda...

486
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,404
Why do you know my name...

487
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,639
I heard it from that person a while ago!

488
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,843
Ah! How can a corpse talk...

489
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,880
Listen... if you listen closely,
you can hear him...

491
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:44,883
His spirit is probably still wandering
ound here...

493
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,487
Ha ha hal You brat! If you
ake anymore wise-cracks...

495
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,156
moaki Okuda...

496
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,225
O(O 00010),

497
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,163
moaki Okuda...

498
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:15,012
ell. just as promised...
II give you this...

500
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,884
Take it!!

501
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,261
C,Conan! Let's escape while we can!

502
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,296
Huh?

503
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:34,165
T, That's right! If that
host appears again...

505
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,534
Oh that voice...

506
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,470
It's this... this!

507
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,872
The Yaiba Reco-Changer!!

508
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:45,910
I recorded my voice and played
it over and over again in slow!

510
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,381
But, how did you know that guy's
name?

512
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:55,453
Oh! It was written in secret code on
that unfinished letter on the desk...

514
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,124
It said, "I don't want this master-piece
to get in the hands

516
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,758
of Tomoaki Okuda"!

517
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,127
I see...

518
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,529
He wanted to leave this masterpiece
in the hands of my aunt

520
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,631
whom he was indebted to in the past...

521
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:11,603
so, he left the secret codes in this
house to let her know where he was...

523
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,939
Ah... that aunt... what is she doing
now?

525
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,779
Oh, she passed away last year...
