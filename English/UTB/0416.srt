00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,522

fingerprint is the killer's...

00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,659
And? What about the-alibis
of the rest of the suspects?

215

The alibis everyone except
Mr. Watabiki are quite ambiguous. #

217
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:33,502
So. the fingerprints of everyone
except Mr. Kunitomo were taken

219
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:37,873
just in case, but only Mr Sekiguchi's
fingerprints were found on the rope so far...

221
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,676

fingerprints of Mr. Kunitomo?

224
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:46,982
he said he won't see anybody
until Oct. 4th is over,

226
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,683

he didn't want to see anybody. didn't he?

But, there are no traces of the window
being forced opened.

00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,941

under these circumstances...

263
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,159
How in the world...

264
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,579
Did the killer get inside?!

265
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:26,581
We've got to call an ambulance right

268
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:29,651
although under these circumstancges,
it may already be too late...

280
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:54,308
There was a rope ted to the veranda where

00:10:10,593 --> 00:10:11,726
Intruder!

295
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,112
...A bell?

296
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:22,370
What in the world is happening?!

297
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,640
Um. what's with this alarm?

298
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:26,908
Did ou. do something?

299
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,276
Oh. Conan?

300
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:29,344
Sorry.

301
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:34,749
Dad tried to force his way in and touched
the fingerprint recog iition device...

303
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,753
despite the fact that only the people who
Iive In this house are allowed to touch it...

306
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:44,558
At any rate. stop the alarm-andiopenithe
door! Do you know where the button 1s?

310
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,495

315
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,909
Hey. hey. everybody's inside...

316
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,247
His pulse is gone and he snot breathing.

317
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:09,284
Dl DOE Was A if

318
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,385
I'll call an ambulance!

319
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:13,855
I'll go inform the officer who as below
about this .

322
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:15,090
Wait!

324
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,527
I already calledathe¥ambulance.

325
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,164
Please don't movevrom here. everyone!!

326
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:29,504
Huh?!

327
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,907
Ran?

328
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,207
Ran?

329
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,210
Are yoursti Iroutside the door?

330
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:37,746
Y.Yep. I'm here...

331
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:41,750
Then stay on the lookout for any
suspicious people that walk out. okay!

333
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,652
Inspector Yokomizo and Pops

334
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,955
will you both check to see If there are
traces of the windows

336
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,824
#.0of the other rooms on the 3rd floor having
been forced opened?

338
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:51,226
Huh? Why?

339
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,561
Because! Look at this!

340
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:56,331
Huh"?

341
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,067
This 1s a trace offa ll having been
stopped-on, right?

343
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:03,071
It means somebody was here. right?

345
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:04,739
Y.Yeah...

346
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,242
4 Whoever it was probably surprised
Mr. Kunitomo.

348
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:11,146
( Causing him to get an attack and kept him
from drinking the medicine

350
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:11,713
causing-him to get an attack.and kept him
from drinking the medicine

352
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,348
And this rope...

353
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:16,918
IS probably what the killer used to
get away...

355
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,553
It wasn't swaying!

356
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:19,587
What!

358
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:20,154
What!

360
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:25,460
I heard Mr. Kunitomo's loud voice from
the interphone on the 3rd floor.

364
00:12:25,461 --> 00:12:27,128
so I went to tho rodm downstairs and
fou 1d the rope.

366
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:28,430
SO I went 10 the room downstairs nd
found tho rope.

368
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:30,181
It didn't even take me a minute

369
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,900
{.Hey?! In that case .

370
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,802
Correct... maybe the killer

371
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:36,704
saw me climbing the rope and.

372
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:40,375
Decided not to run away,
but came back to this room instead?

374
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:42,143
C.Could be .

375
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,214
If the killer surprised Mr. Kunitomo to
induce a heart attack.

377
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:49,751
Took the medicine bottleraway
stepped on the pill andicrush it

379
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:53,303
and fed after making sure that
Mr. Kunitomo was-dead.

381
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,106
It would take at least a minute

382
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,492
The rope should still be swaying.

384
00:12:58,059 --> 00:12:59,827
Which means that...

385
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:03,965
it is very likely that thc killer 1sstill here
on the 3rd floor...

389
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,433
Huh?

390
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:09,771
T. Then why don't we split,up and look for
the killer!

392
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,072
G Good idea!

393
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:12,340
That's too dangerous! v

395
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,443
Hat if you run-into the killer...

396
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:19,447
But. if we dilly-dally the killer will get away!

397
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:22,250
Wouldn't it be faster if we all go look for
the killer together?

399
00:13:22,651 --> 00:13:25,119
Okay. let's do this then.

400
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,455
We search one room at a time

401
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:30,558
First I'll go In an check the windows.

402
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,561
You all come into the room after me...

403
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:35,997
Mr. Mouri, please go out into the corridor

404
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:38,832
and stay on the look out for any
suspicious people.

406
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,536
O Okay. I got you!

407
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,308
Hmm...

408
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:50,612
Nothing abnormal!

409
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,013
Please come in all of you...

410
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:55,416
Nobody s hero

411
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:57,351
No one ere either...

412
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,787
Lets go on to the next room:then...

413
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:06,211
We"searched all the 78oms. but there
was no suspicious person anywhere.

415
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:10,598
Moreover, all the windows on the 3rd floor
were locked from the inside

417
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,201
and there were no traces of the windows
being forced opened either.

419
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:18,773
Hey. Ran!=Can you hear me?

420
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,826
Have you=seen anyone leave from that
door.

423
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,382
Three paramedics carrying a stretcher went
in and out though...

425
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:28,850
Nobody besides them passed...

426
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,386
Which means that...

427
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,291
This kid is making up stories.

428
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,426
What's with you, man?!

429
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:40,762
No. there is still another possibility...

430
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:41,829
Huh!

431
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,965
Whon Conan openod the door
with the fingerprint recognition device

433
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,766
and we went inside

434
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:45,667
and we went inside

435
00:14:46,602 --> 00:14:48,736
the killer who was hiding on the 3rd floor

436
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,306
could've joined In
among us...

438
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:52,774
OO. Oh mo...

439
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,309
Wait a sec!

440
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,076
Wait a sec!

441
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,278
Are you saying that the killer is among us?!

442
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,880
Well, not really...

443
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:03,051
We all ran here after hearing the alarm,
you know!

445
00:15:03,052 --> 00:15:06,588
Didn't you see us come in from behind you?

446
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:12,427
WwW Well I do remember that Mrs. Kunitomo
as with us right through but.

448
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:14,329
Mr Mouri, do you remember?

449
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,364
Not at all

450
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:19,300
Didet I tell you nBPto et anybody
else Inside...

452
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:24,505
We I appoint an officer to stand guard
in front of the security door.

454
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,608
And close off the 3rd floor.

455
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,378
As for all of you,
please let me question you once again

457
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:31,946
understood ?

458
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,717
Hom Ba other words, 4
when Mr Kunitomo was heard

460
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:40,054
shouting over the interpheno of the 3rd
floor with the fingerprint recognition device.

462
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:45,860
Aside from Mrs=Kunitomo-who was with us,
the alibis of the four of you are ambiguous.

464
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,762
Ambiguous /!

465
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,201
We were staying still in our rooms just
as the police told us to.

467
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,069
We all have our own rooms.

468
00:15:55,938 --> 00:16:00,041
Why didn't you appoint an officer to stand
guard in front of our rooms then?!

470
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,943
Oh. well...

471
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:03,711
The point is,

472
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:09,517
regardless of Mrs. Kunitomo saying that he
would not see anyone until Oct. 4th is over

474
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:11,886
how did the killer enter the room...?

476
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,856
C.Comc to think of it. back then .

477
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:18,192
FMong with my husbandss voice
through the interphone...

479
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:22,797
Kay. I'll talk te you later then.

480
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,166
Think I heard what sounded like a knock...

481
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:30,738
Y hushand didn't seem te~be surprises
by that sound .

483
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,140
A knock

484
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:37,712
And right after that. he suddenly shouted
and started suffering?

486
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,651
Don't tell me that he invited someone
in on his own...?

488
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,553
That cant be...

489
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,256
Mr. Kunitomo sent the officers who were
investigating the 3rd floor

491
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,590
on Mr. Sekiguchi's case.

492
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,727
Out and confined himself to his room on the
3rd floor.

494
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:54,395
You know? Why would he invite
someone in?

496
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,632
Even if he were to have done so.

497
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:00,885
The distance between the interphone
beside the bed and the door of the room

499
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,553
Is prett far...

500
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:06,841
It-8. unthinkable that he'd have an atthck
Iust because thokiller opened the door.

502
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,211
Even if the killer were to have some kind
of weapon on him

504
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:11,913
if his hands were on the interphone.

505
00:17:11,914 --> 00:17:14,082
Ho would probably have put his finger
In the fingerprint recognition device

507
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,550
ind openod the door...

508
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,453
What frightened Rim to the point of not
even being able to do so .

510
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,254
What on earth?!

511
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:25,426
Letes go over all the incidents that
happened so fa

513
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,764
Please start by telling me about the
ship accident.that occurred

515
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,866
13 years ago off shore Suruga Ba

516
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,868
Did anything out of the ordinary happen
before it set sail?

518
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:38,906
I went to see everyone off at the harbor...

519
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:40,908
But nothing other than Mrs. Kunitomo's
friend,

521
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,845
Mr Sekiguchi suddenly participating
ha)penced.

523
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,579
Mr! Sekiguchi suddenly participating
happened.

525
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,149
Why did Mr. Sekiguchi suddenly decide to
participate?

527
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:52,854
He had been wanting lo go cruising
with 1s tor some time now and .

529
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,656
It just sO happened that Namika and
IShigeko came down with a cold

531
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,656
Nd the number of people
boarding decreased...

534
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,126
and the number of people
boarding decreased...

539
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:00,528
If I were to mention something I thought
was strange...

542
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:01,629
If I wore to mention somothing I thought
was strange.

544
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,633
Mr Sekiguchi was carrying a large bag.

545
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:08,202
Oh...1d...the contents

546
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:12,906
I I'm sure. he sid it was
scubn diving equipmont

548
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:13,174
I see

549
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,342
I see.

550
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:18,445
And, uh. and tho people that\died back
then were

552
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:22,617
first of all, is the chef that used 'to:work
here and Shl'eko°s husband.

554
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,886
1s well as Namika's father...

555
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:29,791
The second as Mr. Watabakrs father who
worked here as a chauffeur...

Yes yes. then there's no mistake that
the prints

00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,708
are those of the person who last touched
the bottle

685
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:54,228
So. it's the same as having already nabbed
the killer!

687
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:57,798
Because all your fingerprints have already
been taken...

door?.
