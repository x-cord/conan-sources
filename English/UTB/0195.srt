1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:04,604
Just as flowing water has no form,
and the breeze has is invisible,

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,806
deductions take all shapes & sizes
in each & every case to be solved

5
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,608
A ghostly, a pocket bell,
stamps & a music box.

7
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,209
Seemingly separate mysteries
come toa singular end.

9
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,611
He sees through the one & only truth.

10
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,613
A child in appearance
with the l.Q of an adult,

12
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,948
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,819
A young woman named Haruna Yuki
asks us to locate her pocket bell friend

16
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,322
who she hasn't been able to contact
because she wants to return his music box

18
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,526
but when we arrive at her friend
Shugo Ogatajsghtime

20
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:12,263
we learn that he is dead...

21
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,066
Later that night,

22
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,902
Ran sees the suspicious shadow
of an old man walk down the corridor.

24
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,774
And Shugo's grandson Minoru,
has been attacked by someone!

26
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,312
And then, Haruna gets a mysterious
message on her pocket bell...

28
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,180
Toker seu

29
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:35,221
THE ENTRUSTED MUSIC BOX
PART II

31
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,924
Eh?! You didn't find any
evidence of a break-in...?!

33
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,894
That's right...the rain has made
the ground pretty soft

35
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:45,631
but there're no footprints out there...

36
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,900
And even someone got in before the rain

37
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,102
there should be
footprints leaving the place...

39
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,406
But we didn't find
anyone suspicious inside!

41
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:59,245
The only thing we:werefconcerned about,
was the unlocked backdoor right? ¥

43
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,112
Yes...

44
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:01,547
The back door?

45
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,314
Oh that...

46
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,251
the lock on that dooms broken,
it opens even when the wind blows...

48
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,455
That does bother me...

49
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,625
hen why don't you take a look yourself?

50
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,031
Even if someone did
get in through that door

52
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,868
don't you think there should be some
footprints on the ground? It's so muddy

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,338
Hmm, that's true... .there're no footprints

55
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,277
If there were, then maybe we could
believe that story Ran told us

57
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,312
about seeing the shadow of an old man...

58
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,015
I told you, it wasn't my imagination!

59
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:37,983
Huh?

61
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,919
Oh no!

62
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,456
Would you mind moving
your patrol car a bit?

64
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,957
Yes, right away...I'm terribly sorry!

65
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,863
First, let's go over all the details one
more time, then we'll check out the house

67
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,031
All right .

68
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,633
Young lady. where did you see
the suspicious shadow?

70
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,369
Uh, right here...

71
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,705
In this corridor.

72
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:03,576
The old man with the cane was here
then he:disappeared back there...

74
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,145
Then he must have hidden
in that room at the far end...

76
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,549
No, I was in that room
and I would have noticed...

78
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,619
But I saw it!

79
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,188
I saw his shadow through
the screen door in this room...

81
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,224
And I saw it too!

82
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,393
Hey, whose room is this?

83
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,163
Oh, that room's my wife and mine

84
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,869
When the girls saw the'shadow,

85
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,671
were you and your wife in this room?

87
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,076
My wife and I were in the kitchen

88
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:37,810
Aha!

90
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,746
D, did you findithe(intruder?!

91
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,849
No, I didn't say aha, I said ouch...

92
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,819
I stepped.on this hair pin
that was onthe floor...

94
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,955
Did you say hair pin...?

95
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:55,628
How many times've I told you
not to get In my way

97
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:01,600
Let me continue. Was your son that
got hurt.also with you in the kitchen?

99
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,704
No...we all thought he was
taking a bath though...

101
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,741
And 'could you tell me what
you three were doing in the kitchen?

103
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,277
Shiro was giving us a scolding.

104
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:14,013
He said we were being very rude to
Haruna, bombarding her with

106
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,348
so many questions after she was kind
enough to come all the way to visit us.

109
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,817
What kind of questions? wg

110
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:25,424
Well, uh, the truth is, Shugo. the head of
this household and I were bell friends...

112
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,194
And they wanted to know
we talked about and such

114
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:29,862
That's right...

115
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,331
the three of them. Minoru included were
practically interrogating

117
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,066
her like;some kind of criminal!

118
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,436
Oh, but it didn't bother me at all!

120
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,641
I talked about how Shugo's interest in
stamps-got me to collect them too

122
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,677
and I got to reminisce
about a lot of good things,

124
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,047
why l.even asked if I could come back,

125
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,115
so that shows you
that I wasn't'bothered in the least

127
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,617
Speaking of stamps,

128
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:56,322
Minoru did mention something about
hand carved stamps worth 200 million...

130
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,191
Where is he now?

131
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:03,796
. Perhaps those stamps have something
to do with what happened tonight...

133
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:07,633
I think Minoru's in his room next door...

134
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:09,635
Eh'?

135
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:10,903
They disappeared?

136
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,838
Yes, that's right!

137
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,540
Grandfather had a great collection

138
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,942
but those hand carved stamps were
by far.the most impressive...

140
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,511
We counted on the money
it'd bring when we would sell it

142
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,879
so we started buy all sorts of things...

143
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,248
You said "we"?

144
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,516
Yes;\mom and dad agreed on it...

145
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,021
Hey, listen...

146
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:29,455
Eh...7?

147
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:30,990
What isit'?

148
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,425
Is your room next:door?

149
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,094
Yes it is, why? 7

150
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,429
OK then

151
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,399
And whose room is on the other side?

152
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,501
That's grandpa and grandma's room...

153
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:43,902
Then maybe...

154
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,737
Hey, kid?

155
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,008
I knew it...

156
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,244
this is the room Minoru got attacked in!

157
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,179
Which means...

158
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,081
so the roomslay;out;is;likeithis;-eh.:.

159
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,252
I think I know how it worked«now,
ve figured out the, trick O"

161
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:04,723
Now;to figure out
whose shadow Ran saw

163
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,761
and why the music box Shugo gave
Haruna is off tune...

165
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,566
I wrote down the notes to the song
Iistening to another music box

167
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,935
but I~donst really know what is what...

168
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,607
That's the music
for that song. "Haru yo Koi"!

170
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,641
How did you get it?

171
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,511
Uh, I, it just happened to be part of my
homework for music class...

173
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,680
Let me see that! I'll rewrite it so it's right!

174
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:28,514
Hey, .give it-back!

175
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,182
Let's see...

176
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,551
Oh brother...

177
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,233
Ran...

178
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,135
Huh?

179
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,704
What is.it?

180
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,872
Oh; nothing, nothing at all...

181
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,107
Here,

182
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,142
I think that's right!

183
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,745
She's good as I suspected...

185
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,182
Hey, Ran

186
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,651
What are these three # (sharps) for?

188
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,520
that stands for A major!

189
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:09,888
A major...?

190
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,956
Why that's it!

191
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,629
If anything comes up,
feel free to call us anytime

193
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,798
Thanks...

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,570
Well the mystery remains, we still don't
know whether it was a thief or a ghost...

196
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,404
Yes...

197
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,873
excuse me,

198
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,508
Has anyone seen Conan?

200
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,647
Boy, this is so simple...

201
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,017
I've got it now...
I've figured everything out...

203
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,322
I know the identity of
he ghost in the house...

205
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,923
& and who sent the mysterious
message on the pocket bell

207
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,393
and I know what that
off tune music box means

209
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,561
and Shugo...

210
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,266
I knowswhere you hid those
precious stamps of yours!

212
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,071
Now allil've got to do is,
put.old Kogoro to sleep as usual and...?

214
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,505
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

215
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,874
Listen you!

216
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,276
How many times: ve told you
not to go wandering off!

218
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:04,843
Ouch...

219
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,212
Come on, we're going home!

221
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,081
Going home?

222
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,251
Aw, but I just found something interesting...

224
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,389
There, look at that!

225
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:18,757
Huh?

226
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,461
See what what're you talking about?

227
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:24,763
Move a little to the right!

228
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,832
To the right?

229
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,034
Ugh?!

230
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,271
Ho boy...

231
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,042
Dad?

232
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,145
I see...so that's how it worked...

234
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:41,580
Ran,

235
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,882
Tell everyone to come here!

236
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,417
Yes...sir!

237
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,919
Wait, before you-do

238
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,823
get me some black paper,a pair of
scissors, and some cellophane tape...

240
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,226
OK, where is he?!

241
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,895
You found the thief didn't you?

242
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,263
Thief?!

243
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,699
There wasn't a thief in the first place...

245
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,637
You're not going to tell us
it- was father's ghost, are you?

247
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,906
Of course not, that also never existed...

248
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:15,447
All the strange things that happened
tonight, were orchestrated by one of you!

250
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,248
Eh?!

251
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,349
Eh?!

252
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:17,850
What?!

253
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,120
But then ghostly things have
happened before tonight too...

255
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,522
Before tonight...?

256
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:28,460
Yes, I'm talking about the time Haruna
got the music box from Shugo...

259
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,598
Yes, she told us that story many times!

260
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,566
It's about the time

261
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,236
gramps gave her the music box without
telling us about it, 2 Christmases ago...

263
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,737
Uh, no...

264
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:42,307
he gave me the music box
LAST Christmas.

266
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,645
Th, that's impossible! Dad died
Iast year on December 6th!

268
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,213
Th, that can't be...?!

269
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,783
And on top of that, father had been
hospitalized since that Spring

271
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,420
and was in
no condition to move around...

273
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,654
Hey now,

274
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,356
what's going on around here?

275
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,992
It's very simple...

276
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:04,428
omeone preen e 0; e ugo an e
the package containing the music box at

278
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:08,233
Haruna's feet while she!waited for him in
front of the Hachiko statue, that's all...

280
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,503
Isn't that right. #? Shiro

281
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,274
Sh, Shiro did it?

282
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,742
Is that true?!

283
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,644
Hey, Shiro!

284
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:20,846
He asked me to...

285
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,581
grandpa asked me to...

286
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,952
He said, Even after I'm hospitalized,
I want you to look after this girl...

288
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:30,422
she reminds me of your
grandmother and she's very lonely..."

290
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,525
Do you mean. you've been sending me
messages since last Spring...

292
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,927
Yes...

293
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,029
I've been communicating with you
on my grandfather's behalf...

295
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:44,303
Actually, I intended to tell you the truth
when I saw you that Christmas, but...

297
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,906
when I saw you standing there,
with that red muffler around your neck,

299
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,475
that was how I was to recognize you,
you looked so excited and happy.

301
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,644
That's why I just couldn't
bring myself to do it.

303
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,380
But, how did you know it was me?

304
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:01,720
I knew from the start that it was you
who gave Haruna the music box...

306
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,591
I knew it the moment you came
to meet us at thelfront door...

308
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:08,026
I don't believe you...

309
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,465
When you saw Haruna, you put your hand
on her shoulder and said this didn't you...

311
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:18,837
After all, she was such
a comfort to our grandfather...

313
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,808
Atithat point,
we still hadn't introduced ourselves

315
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,677
and Ran, who's about the
same age asyHaruna, was also present...

317
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,947
And yet, you knew
exactly which one she was,

319
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,651
although no one had
actually met her yet...

321
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,419
hat's when it suddenly hit me...

322
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,690
maybe it was YOU
who gave her the music box.

324
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,494
If that's true, then was it you...
did you drop that koto on me because

326
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,196
you got mad that
I was giving her the third degree

328
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,098
No, that wasn't me!

329
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,133
Ran, turn the lights off!

331
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,601
Hurry!!

332
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,569
Yes sir!

333
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,041
Co, Conan?!

334
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,615
Co, Conan?!

335
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,620
Hey? Conan, where are you...?

336
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,889
Ran, I'm over here! la

337
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,758
Eh? How'd you get over there?

338
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,493
I've always been here!)

339
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,062
Liar...l just saw
your shadow on the screen door...

341
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,798
Take a look at the glass out in the hall

342
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,900
The glass out in the hall?

343
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,937
What am I supposed to see?

344
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,106
Why, this it...

345
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:31,009
There's a piece of
4black paper taped to the glass!

347
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,611
It's shaped like Conan...

348
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,747
I put it there a little while ago
because Uncle Kogoro told me to!

350
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,951
Then are you saying that
the old man Ran saw was...

352
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:43,321
That's right, Ran saw a shadow picture...

353
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,661
An old man's figure, cut out of black
paper is taped to the glass in the hall.

355
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,464
If a car approaches the back street,

356
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:56,601
the lights from the headlight will
shine through the half open back door

358
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,537
and the shadow of the paper cut old man

359
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:01,973
will be reflected
onto the screen door, that's the trick...

361
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,976
Now that you mention it,
when I saw the old mans shadow.

363
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,510
I did hear a shwooshing sound...

364
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,816
That was probably the sound of)
a car "passing on the rainiwet road.

367
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,417
>» CT &

368
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,252
so by using that trick,
you don't have to actually be present

370
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,188
when the old man
makes his appearance...

372
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,490
Shiro...even you could've

373
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,294
Like I told you before, I was right here...
same as when you got attacked .

375
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,396
You could have done that too.
While being in this room...

377
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:24,930
Eh?!

378
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,599
It's a simple booby trap.
All you need is some

380
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,234
fishingvine and
some hair pins to make it...

382
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,802
A booby trap?

383
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,871
The person who caused this commotion,

384
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,842
hung the koto from the ceiling in your
grandfather's room and then let it fall,

386
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,678
it was just coincidence
that you got hit by it...

388
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,449
Minoru, you snuck in there
to, check out the koto...

390
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,251
that's right, that's how you got hit...

391
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,687
You. you don't know
what you're talking about,

393
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,422
why would I want to search the koto...

394
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,791
Because during dinner,

395
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,861
Haruna mentioned thatthe
music box played "Haruo Kol

397
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,563
And since it was
your grandmother's favorite.song

399
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,732
and she always played it on the koto,

400
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:07,405
you thought the stamps just might
be hidden inside the koto...

402
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,610
B. but even if the koto
dropped down from the ceiling,

404
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,946
I don't see how it could have
knocked him unconscious,

406
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,748
there wasn't enough momentum.

407
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,783
Besides,

408
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:21,153
if he was going to look inside the koto,
wouldn't he have turned the lights on?

410
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,991
When we got there,
the room was dark, wasn't it?

412
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:31,463
Minoru didn't NOT turn the lights on,
he COULDN'T...

414
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,234
the device the culprit rigged raised the
Iight up, close to the ceiling & in the dark,

416
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:41,540
Minoru didn't know
where the light cord was

418
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,508
Left with no other choice,

419
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,745
Minoru got down on the floor &
felt around the area the koto usually is,

421
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,080
when he found it,
he intended to take it to his room...

423
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,517
then he heard the sound of the string
rubbing against the fishing line

425
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,419
& he looked up,

426
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,355
and of all the bad luck,
that's when it fell on his head...

428
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,891
Minoru...

429
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,328
OK, so you're right, you've got me!

430
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,431
But how was it rigged
to drop the koto, anyway?

432
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,234
Hah...itys very simple

433
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,537
First, you get 1 very long fishing line

434
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:17,509
wrap the light cord
around the middle of the fishing line,

436
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,478
then pass both ends of the line
under the string

438
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,449
the koto is then probably
temporarily placed on the chest.

440
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,686
Next, both ends of the line is passed
through the transom

442
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:31,590
& went through Shiro's room,
then Minoru's & then Mr & Mrs. Ogata's

444
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,692
until finally reaching the room
Ran & Haruna were staying in...

446
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,428
Then, so the line wouldn't sag,
both ends were tied

448
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,297
then set in place
between the doors with a hair pin.

450
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,300
Now for the finishing touch, all the culprit
had to do was take the koto off the chest,

452
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,302
Ietting it hand & walla,
your booby trap is complete.

454
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,305
After that.
All you had to do was open the door

456
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,679
and the hair pin would be released
& that would lead to the koto falling...

458
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,716
Now wait just one minute,
you're not saying that...

460
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,317
That's right...

461
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,820
the person responsible for
tonight's ghostly apparition is

463
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,722
the person who opened that door...

464
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,191
Kazuko...

465
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,426
it was you, wasn't it?

466
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,962
MM. mother?

467
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,030
But why?

468
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:17,836
It's probably because she didn't want
Haruna to go looking for those stamps...

471
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,174
I'm pretty sure she rigged;the:booby trap
while we were eating...

473
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,710
when she left to goprepare.our. bedding...

474
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,081
Then when she heard Ran & Haruna scream,

475
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,883
she came running

476
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,920
& opened the door nonchalantly,
causing the koto to fall

478
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,690
And then, while everyone was
rushing to Shugo's room,

480
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,692
she removed the cut out from the window

481
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:47,232
& sent a message to Haruna's pocket bell
from her cellular,trying to scare her...

483
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,704
she was trying to frighten Haruna
away from this house...

485
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:58,143
B but what did she do with
all that fishing line after that?

487
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,447
Mom was right behind us
when we got to grandfather's room...

489
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,416
She didn't have time
to take the paper off the window

491
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,719
& remove all the fishing line
while using the telephone

493
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,387
She had a very handy helper!

495
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,391
It's right behind Ran...

496
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,694
A fan. «7?

497
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,464
I'm pretty'sure
she cut the tied end of the line

499
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,466
& pulled one end into this room

500
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,635
then used tape to tape it...

501
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:28,606
To thewback of this fan syblade!

502
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,608
Yes, I see...

503
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,646
All she had to do was turn the switch on

504
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,781
& it would automatically reel the line in...

505
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,851
I still can't believe it though...

506
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:44,723
how could you think of such a thing
in the short time you had during dinner...

508
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,424
It's not impossible...

509
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,693
after all this trick with the fishing line,

510
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,162
is something I picked up from
the pranks the boys used to:pull

512
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,864
when they were children!!!

513
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,100
What about the cut out of the old man...

514
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,336
Oh that; a guest who stayed with us once

515
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,272
thought some leaves stuck to the window
was someone's shadow,

517
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:03,975
I remembered that...

518
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,978
Haruna scared me

519
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:11,449
she mentioned she collected stamps
& she said she wanted to visit us again

521
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:15,954
Uh...were you the one who sent me
\ the messages before saying. "Thief"...

523
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:19,324
Yes, that was me...I'm sorry...

524
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,493
Mother, that was terrible...

525
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,963
how could you break grandmother's koto
over a thing like that?

527
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,033
Oh. . .thatikoto isn't worth anything...

528
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,634
How can you say that...

529
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:35,272
The truth is, I pawned the real koto
& got a cheap replacement...

531
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:40,712
My new system kitchen, your new-car,
Minoru's computer...

533
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,982
we were so far in debt

534
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,153
Then I guess we'll just have to sell
the music box grandfather gave me...

536
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:53,491
Oh but I had it looked at & I was told
it was just an ordinary souvenir item...

539
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,560
That's strange...

540
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:58,296
grandfather told me that in
appreciation of my posing to be him,

542
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,899
he was giving me his music box

543
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:05,103
those who knew what they were looking at
would realize it was worth 200 million...

545
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:09,307
200 million? That music box?

546
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:14,312
Dad bought that:as:a souvenir
when he went to a hot spring...

548
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,115
Grandpa pulled a fast one on you...

549
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:22,520
The music box itself isn't worth anything.
It's the missing notes...

552
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,391
In Japan, we use
the DoReMi musical scale

554
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,028
and also the native notation, I Ro Ha.

555
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,730
The missing notes are [La], [Do] & [La]

556
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:37,702
& if we use the I Ro Ha scale,
it would be [I], [Ha] & [1]...

558
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,505
Wha?!

559
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,640
ou don't mean...?

560
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:47,879
I don't believe it. 7?!

561
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,480
It can't be... 7?!
I don't believe it...?!

563
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:49,314
It's impossible!

567
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,320
Ive got it!!

568
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:56,954
This isjit!!

569
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:57,956
Oh thank goodness!!

570
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:01,358
Hip~hip ghurray!

571
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,732
What's going on?

572
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,769
Oh thank you so much!

573
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,671
Now I can buy that koto back!

574
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,339
We owe it all to you!

575
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,675
Who are you anyway?!

576
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,548
Well, uh, the truth is.
My name is Kogoro Mourn...

578
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,783
THE Kogoro Mourn?

579
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,052
The famous private detective?

580
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,487
That's me!

581
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,756
Why didn't you tells .that-earlier!?

582
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,259
If we'd known that,
we'd have asked you to: look for stamps!

584
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,095
And Minoru wouldn't have gotten hurt!

585
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,396
Yes well...

586
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:42,867
Haha... what a selfish bunch...

00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,722
Thank you for everything!

632
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:13,458
No, we should thank you...

633
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,127
Are you sure youthave no regrets, though?

634
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:20,798
Shugo might have intended to
give you alone, those stamps...

636
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,802
I don't mind. Because I got to
keep something .worth even more .

638
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:31,676
It's grandfather's pocket bell!
Haruna gave it to me

640
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,779
and she asked if I'd continue
to give her moral support...

642
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:38,082
Tihank you from the bottom of my heart!!

643
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,286
You know, I think Spring's here!

644
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,222
Spring? It's almost Summer...

645
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,758
Never mind, for Shiro, it's Spring.

646
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,059
What's that supposed to mean?

647
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,564
Spring, come to me... .hurry to me...

648
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,036
Don't hold your breath...

649
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,275
Look out!!

650
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,083
A bump?

651
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,685
It wasn't such a big bump,

652
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,422
I don't understand why
you're making such a big deal about it

654
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,692
But Sonoko warned me
& I know "that guy would too...
