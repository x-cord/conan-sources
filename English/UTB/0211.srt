A pond that changes color
with the passing of time

00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,025

no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

12
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,049
We attended a tea ceremony
on behalf of Sonoko

14
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,987
and her father.
To be held at the Aonogi residence

16
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,790
There is a pond in the garden,
where the color of the water

18
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,492
changes into five different hues.

19
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,328
And, in the center is a tearoom that is
accessed by a connection corridor.

21
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,232
We were enjoying ourselves looking
at the pond when the incident occurred.

23
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,769
The master had hung himself and died!

24
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,673
Moreover, he died
exactly like legend had it

26
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,844
No this is not suicide!

27
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,412
It's homicide!!

28
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:32,818
I'm sure that.someone here schemed
a very clever trick and killed the master,

30
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,287
after making it look like
he committed suicide!

32
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:41,727
What is the true identity of the real
monster that is posing as the monster!

So. at a little after1 6:00. when everyone
gathered in this room,

00:02:55,142 --> 00:03:00,846
ou all saw the master s corpse
rom this veranda...is that right?

40
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:01,647
Yesqythe water of the pond was
just changing crimson.

Yes~ythe water of the pond was
just changing crimson.

wristwatch to confirm the 'time.

Yes, it was 16:00 sharp.

00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:22,601
It happened right after
Ms. Mimura returned

63
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,938
Where were you all at that time?

64
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,241
I was:taking a bath for about 30 minutes.

65
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,345
I had some business to attend to
and went out for a while.

67
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,414
Where did you go?

68
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,185
It was something personal...!
I don't have 'to answer you!

70
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,954
What about you; Ms. Hanazakir

preparations for the evening

and taking care of the guests here.

75
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,595
And you, Ryoichi?

76
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,566
As...going in and out of the guest root

77
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,471
I hear that the master burned
your precious fishing rod?

79
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,873
W.,Well...you see . that's...

80
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,509
Tell us what really happened?

81
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,314
I was told to attend
the tea ceremony tonight

83
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,818
It seemed that he wanted to
announce my becoming

85
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,821
his successor at the ceremony.

86
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,692
But you don't know an thing
about the practice o tea!

88
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,963
No way! He couldn't have possibly
said something like that!!

90
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:28,334
And, did you accept the offer?

91
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,603
No way! I refused!

92
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,143
In other words, the master
burned your fishing rod

94
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,846
because you wouldn't listen to him?
And, you hated him because of that?

96
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,915
P.Please wait.

97
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,752
Officer Yokomizo.
When the master was killed,

99
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,989
everyone including Ryoichi was
here in this room.

101
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,223
Exactly.

102
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,860
If in fact someone did go over to kill him

103
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,129
as you can see, we would've
witnessed it from the veranda.

105
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,100
I was sitting in that chair all the while,

106
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,870
no one was seen going to the tearoom...!

107
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,410
Which means everyone has a perfect alibi

108
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,213
Ms. Mimura brought something in
'hen she returned.

110
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,584
She looked to be concerned
about people seeing her

112
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,387
But. she couldn't possibly had time
to hide anything

114
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,889
Which means

115
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,028
Could that be it?!

116
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:39,237
This is it after all! Just as I thought!

117
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,407
Could I please have a glass of water?

118
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,809
I'm sorry,

119
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,878
I'm so thirsty

120
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,513
Here you go

121
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,782
Thank you so much

122
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,651
I'll make some tea for everyone
else right now.

124
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,457
Um, Ms Hanazaki.

125
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,858
Oh, yes sonny

126
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,463
Why doesn't Ryoichi want to succeed
the master despite being an only child?

128
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,265
WwW, Well...

129
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,269
Hey, keep out of this, kid!

130
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,872
But, yes, why?

131
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,375
I didn't want to become like my father.

132
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,911
Father was so haught

133
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,013
that mother was always crying in sadness.

134
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,783
But, isn't it only natural for a father
to want his son: to take over

136
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,552
the seat of the successor that has been
handed down for, generations?

138
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,323
Becoming a master means giving
speeches and lectures.

140
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:35,661
The pay is really good,
and you get to own tea bowls

142
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,997
that have been handed
down for generations.

144
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,367
That's all father was. ver interested in!

145
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,069
So, if he passes the seat onto you,

146
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,173
he can go on living the way
he has up to now.

148
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,310
That's what I didn't like about father

149
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,013
Let me help you, Ms. Hanazaki.

150
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,381
Oh, thank you.

151
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,751
If you didn't like him so much.
Why didn't you leave the house?

153
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,352
H Hey!

154
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,957
Right . well.
I was gone for quite a while actually

156
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:10,562
I had him come back because I was
burdened takingfcare of the master alone!

159
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,164
I OTC.

160
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,700
I came back on the condition
that I would not succeed my father!

162
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:17,536
He didn't have anyone to manage
his money,

164
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,638
so he said I could come back
if I handled accounting for him.

166
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,907
Really greedy, I tell you.

167
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:27,246
But, he asked you to be
his successor again.

169
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:31,817
Accounting? Then you know how mutC
money and estate the Aonogi family has,

171
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,419
don t you?

172
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,687
Hey!!

173
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,988
Is he right?

174
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,492
In the event your father dies before
his successor is decided on

176
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,696
you inherit all his estate, don't you?

177
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,399
Not to mention that the seat of the master
is free for you to do 'as you please

179
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,336
What was your real reason
for coming back home?

181
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,004
How rude!

182
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,541
Master had health problems!

183
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:59,445
Why else, but because
he was worried¥about his father!

185
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,047
It's okay thank Ms. Hanazaki

186
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,883
I'm. going to put this away

187
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,590
So. the master, being afraid of
the monster of the pond

189
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,926
stayed confined in the
tearoom where talisman

191
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,261
to keep it away were posted everywhere

192
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,765
Moreover. he extremely hated
anyone coming near the room.

194
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:24,636
Yes, he even had an alarm set up
to keep intruders away

196
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:29,975
Which means that it would be
difficult for an outsider to come in

198
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,144
Right

199
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,747
and the tearoom is surrounded
by the pond.

201
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:38,450
If anyone were to go by the only
corridor there us here,

203
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,085
somebody would've. seen:the person

204
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,455
How did the killer do it...

205
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,356
What's with you...!!

206
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:49,428
I'll bet you thought you were deceiving the
master by offering him expensive bowls,

208
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:52,698
but let me tell you, he wasn't dumb!!!

209
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,166
Talk for yourself!

210
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,801
L.hear you invested so much money

211
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,204
to the point of running your
company bankrupt!

213
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,140
Hold on a minute please!

214
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,376
All'lim asking is your relationship
with the master.

216
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,244
Phooey!

218
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,048
Huh? What's with this tea cup

219
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,784
Ms. Hanazaki! There's a crack in this cup.

220
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,888
Oh, I'm very sorry.

221
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,324
Dl bet that all you're concerned about is
how it looks on the outside

223
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,193
and don't care about how it
Iooks on the inside!

225
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,097
Care only about how it looks like
1 the outside...

227
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,432
Comeacome now,

228
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,867
I'm sure she's upset after all
that is. happening so.

230
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:34,072
I wonder? Ms. Hanazaki. I'll bet you're
glad that the master's dead...?

232
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,176
After all, he's the one who lead his wife

233
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,479
who was taking such good care of you
to her death!!!

235
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,380
I would never!

236
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,985
M's Hanazaki really too Al"
good care of father!

238
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,622
My! For all I know, I'll bet you both drove

239
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,992
master to commit suicide with
all your talks about the monster?

241
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:55,894
W What?!

242
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:56,962
How absurd!

243
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,165
Ms Hanazaki.

244
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,040
Ms- Hanazaki

245
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,375
How dare she say that I hated him.

246
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,415
Don't let her bother you. Like you already
know, she's always like that.

248
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,618
Is she his wife?

249
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,387
She looks very kind

250
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,525
She really was kind,

251
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,795
that just looking at
her picture comforts me.

253
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,865
That's why I have so many pictures
of her here.

256
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,370
She never got down on me for not
Iiking tea ceremony!

258
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,340
She used to keep company fishing too.

259
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,844
The knot!!

260
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,995
There! Somebody forced himself by here.

261
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,198
If my deduction is correct

262
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,440
Just as I thought.

263
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,243
