00:00:03,887 --> 00:00:04,536
Deduction flows with
the rhythm of the wind

00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,422
Dark stains are rinsed

00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:08,674
The mysterious answering
machine.is*the mystery!

00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,476
The strange inconsistencies will be
cleared-mane shot.

15
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,378
He sees through the
one and only truth,

17

A child in a) earance

no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:16,548
No case is left unsolved

00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,681
30-26

28
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,618

Ghads, what's this...

40
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:20,472
What do you want this early
on a Sunday morning...

42
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:26,345
Aha, ha... I'm sorry . Well...
So like I was saying. Inspector Megure...

44
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,548
Ugh!! C,Conan?!

45
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:37,022
Ninja Technique of Alibi Scheme

46
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,275
There are no signs of any struggle here.

47
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:45,030
SO the victim must've.
Been killed somewhere else

49
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:53,572
then brought here
to North Beika Park and abandoned...

51
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,707
Is.something bothering you?

52
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,911
Well I'm not sure
why I was summoned here...

54
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,512
What're you talking about?!

55
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,114
Isn't he an acquaintance of yours?

56
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:06,918
We found this
IN the victim's pocket... See!

58
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,656
M. My name card...Why is it here?!

59
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,325
Likewise, from the driver's license
the victim had on him,

61
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:18,130
the victim is YuichijKusaka 26, a resident
of Kofu City. Yamanashi Prefecture

63
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,799
Well'? Mr Mourn'?!

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,935
B.But...

65
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,304
remember him!

66
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,873
C.Conan?!

67
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,076
Sticking your nose into the case again...

68
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,646
Well, well, now,
Mr. Mouri. And. Conan... 7?

70
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:40,018
He's the one that came together with
novelist Mr. Ryutaro Tsukigata before

72
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,620
Tsukigata...

73
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,289
Tsukigata

74
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,192
Hmm Oh

75
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:47,492
Hmm--~- Oh 1!

76
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,865
Right, he's one of the two disciples that
was there back then!!

78
00:03:53,866 --> 00:04:01,540
He's the famous samurai novelist that
IS good at writing about Ninja stuff?

80
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,675
Yes, six months ago
he came to visit me saying

82
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,345
he wanted to challenge
writing detective stories too.

84
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,082
And suddenly came to interview me.

85
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,486
So, at that time you alse gave
Mr. Kusaka your name card?

87
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,293
He was indeed a salaried worker who was
training to become a professional novelist,

89
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,028
and because he was
just about to come to Tokyo,

91
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,564
hesaid he brought him
along to experience interviewing...

93
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,966
What about the other one?

94
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,769
What?! What do you mean?

95
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,504
Mr. Saruhashi!

96
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,906
Oh... Saruhashi...

97
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,442
His name is Masaru Saruhashi,

98
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:41,046
and he was saying that he lived
in Beika-cho just like Mr Tsukigata,

100
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,300
SO he went through training by always
helping to clear up the manuscripts

102
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,653
Okay-First, we'll go see
Mr. Tsukigata!!

104
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:49,054
Yes, sir!

105
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,389
Heh, heh, heh...

106
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,857
Let's go, Mr. Mourn!

107
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,992
Oh, yes. sir!

108
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,763
What!! You mean Mr. Kusaka?!

109
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:02,167
So. I think he was on his way here...

110
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,235
I see...

111
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,105
He was supposed to
come here yesterday

113
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,175
with the new story
he had finished writing...

115
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:14,579
Um. did Mr. Kusaka
have that manuscript?,

117
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,915
No. he didn't have anything on him

119
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:22,587
I got a call from Teito. Station
Iast night a little after 8:00,

121
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,524
saying that he would come by at 9:00,

122
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,391
but since he didn't come

123
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:28,727
I was a bit concerned

124
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,597
Oh, you got a call
from Teito Station at about 8:007

126
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,799
Yes...

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,603
Inspector! The estimated time of death is
between 7:00 pm and 9:00 pm

129
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,006
If he was at Teito Stationtuntil'past 8:00

130
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,809
we can narrow down his tracks
until the time-he:was killed. «

132
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:48,612
I got two calls from Mr Kusaka yesterday

133
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:50,215
One was at about noon

134
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,884
It was from his residence in Kofu

135
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:02,794
He asked me if he could come
and have me look over his new novel

137
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,398
But I had to go out so...

138
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:10,135
I told him I'd be back about 9:00 at night

139
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,338
9.007 All right I'll be there around that time

140
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,276
And then I got the second call
from Teito Station around 8:00 pm

142
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,747
Since I was out,
his message was in my answer phone

147
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,087
There is-one message

149
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,290
This 1s Kusaka.
I've arrived-atTeito Station

151
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,426
I'm going to head over
to your place from now,

153
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,962
so I think I can get there
by 9:00 as I promised...

155
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,364
Oh, the train's leaving, so I've got to go!!

156
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,769
Saturday, 8:10 pm

157
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,838
May I listen to it one more time?

158
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,039
Sure...

160
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,893
There is one message

161
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:54,980
This is Kusaka.
I've arrived at Teito Station

163
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,149
I'm going to head over
to your place from now,

165
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,051
sol think I can get there
by 9:00as I promised...

167
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,621
Oh, the train's leaving,
so I've got to go!

169
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,091
Saturday, 8:10 pm

170
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:11,830
At 8:10, Mr. Kusaka left
from Teito Station to go to Beika Station

172
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,565
There's no doubt about it...

173
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,503
But, there's something
about this phone call, that bothers me...

175
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:19,004
we RE

177
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:23,442
ERAS
He left the TeitorStation at 8:10...
On this train

180
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,511
Which means it takes approximately
30 minutes to Beika Station so...

182
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,448
He arrives at Beika Station at 8:40!

183
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,920
The crime was committed
between 8-40 to 9-00,

185
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,189
in the vicinity of Beika Station...

186
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,591
I guess this is more or less the picture!

187
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,127
Huh! Oh!

188
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,930
I've figured out who the killer is!

189
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:50,402
The killer is the other disciple,
Mr. Tsukikage!

191
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,838
Y.You mean Saruhashi?

192
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,907
I hope you have your reasons
for saying that?!

194
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,359
Of course

195
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,780
He said that he lives right
on the other side of Beika Station,

197
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,182
so he knows his way around here

198
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,519
And more than anything else
he has a motive!

200
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,724
I just remembered, 6 months.ago they
had a brawl, didn't they?

202
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:17,262
Are you telling me
to quit being Sensei's disciple!

204
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:22,067
Mr. Saruhashi, you studied
under Sensei for many years now

206
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,069
Haven't you studied
all you have to already!

208
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,603
What!!

209
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,738
Come, come now...

210
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,274
Mr. Kusaka, stop it already

213
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:33,178
I want to study under you too, Sensei

214
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,915
But since you can't watch two disciples...

215
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,584
That's not true, Mr Kusaka!

216
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,588
You have a stable life
of an employee of a company

218
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,457
No matter where
you live there's no difference

220
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,925
in the fact that you're my disciple...

221
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,226
Whether we live near you or not,
makes a difference

223
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,363
in the amount of things we get to learn

224
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,832
Mr Saruhashi,
please change places with me!

226
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,635
That's for Sensei to decide!

227
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,839
Worried of his position as a disciple

228
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,841
Is indeed a motive for killing. but...

229
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,311
It's too childish of a motive. it's absurd...

231
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:16,454
This is Takagi. yes, I see, goodbye...

232
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,990
It's from the forensic officer

233
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:23,260
Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints were not
found on the lighter in question

235
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,931
What's this about a lighter?

236
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:30,068
It was found on'the ground...
by the corpse. the lighter...

238
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,140
Excuse me...

239
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,277
This is the lighter I gave
Mr. Saruhashi some time ago!

241
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,845
What?

242
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,883
Now we not only have a motive,
but also have material evidence...

244
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,187
N.No. Saruhashi. couldn't have!

245
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,992
Mr. 8aruhashi: does
this lighter look familiar tegyou?

247
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:58,663
It's my lighter...
Though I lost it some time ago...

250
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,000
Lost it? When? Where?

251
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,070
1.l1. don't Know

252
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,339
Please try to remember!

253
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:11,343
1.1 really don't know

254
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,678
Hmm?!

255
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,116
The key to a cein locker?

256
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,618
Right

257
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,355
It's a precious lighter that
Sensei gave me as a gift

259
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,558
I'm sure that Kusaka stole it
from me because he was jealous...

261
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,026
Mr. Saruhashi!

262
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,760
Officer Takagi...

263
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:33,765
Mr. Saruhash:...
Where were» ou last night?

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
Oh, yes...

266
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,702
I was at a coffee shop
in front of the station about 8:00

268
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:40,872
I came back here once
and from about 8:30

270
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:45,143
I went 102 pub in front of the station...

271
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,079
Are you sure it was from 8:30?

272
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,749
Wasn't it a little later, like 9:00?

273
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,816
Huh

274
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:58,890
Mr. Kusaka's. estimated time of death is
thought to bebetween 8:40 to. 9:00 pm...

276
00:10:58,891 --> 00:10:59,824
What?!

277
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,832
Mr. Kusaka called Tsukigata Sense
at 8:10 pm from Teito Station

279
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:13,705
So he arrived here
at Beika Station after 8:40 pm

281
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,310
Ha. ha, ha #
I went into the pub at.8:30 pm!

283
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:20,779
I'm sure!

284
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:28,253
Please check on it.
I'm not lying...Ha, ha, ha...

286
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,193
Thank you so much...

287
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,394
Inspector!!

288
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,764
As to the coffee shop .

289
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,400
It seems he was there
from sundown and left about 8:00!

291
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,569
I got his alibi on this side too

292
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,173
He came at 8.30
and was drinking until midnight

294
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:52,043
Which means that
Saruhashi has an alibi!

296
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,446
What's going eon...

297
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,115
The story about the lighter is
just a cop out

299
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,851
If Mr. Kusaka stole it,
his fingerprints should be on it!

301
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,388
I'm aware of that... #

302
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,024
He's got a motive
and there is material evidence

304
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,326
But he has an alibi...

305
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,597
Please wait...

306
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,266
It's possible for him to commit the crime!

307
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,402
He left the coffee shop at 8:00

308
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,605
He came to this pub at-8:30

309
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,541
There're 30 minutes of unaccounted time!

310
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,743
And ?!

311
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,545
And he lied about returning
to his apartment

313
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,149
He killed Mr Kusaka
during the 30 minutes!

315
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,219
The scene of the crime is not Beikacho

316
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,888
but between TeitO Station
and Beika Station

318
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,057
If he uses the 30 minutes that
is unaccounted for to the fullest,

320
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,925
he can make it to a station in between

321
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,794
After committing the murder there,

322
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,130
he can still make it
back to Beika Station at 8:30

324
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:49,601
The actual time the
murder was committed

326
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,937
was not 8:40, but rather, around 8:15

327
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,073
That's not possible, Officer Takagi

328
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:55,874
What?!

329
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,611
Mr Kusaka left Teito Station at"8-10...

330
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,081
5 minutes later, at 815

331
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:08,419
Mr Kusaka is still way before reaching
\ the middle point of both stations.

333
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,890
During the 30 minutes time
it'd be impossible to commit murder,

335
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,292
much less even make contact with him

336
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,161
Impossible...

337
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,698
That is, unless. you use
some kind of Ninja technique that

339
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,368
Is described in Ryutaro Tsukigata's
novel or something...

341
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,437
Ninja technique of creating an alibi...

344
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,645
What kind of Ninja trick did he use...

345
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:47,808
What kind of trick'...

346
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,012
did Mr Saruhashi use anyway...

347
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:53,147
Hmm?

348
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:53,414
Hmm?

349
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,084
It's Tsukigata Sensei's new book...

351
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,221
Mysterious Centipede Ninja...
- - -w \v--49

354
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:02,891
The enemy is your friend
and your friendlis your enemy...

356
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:05,693
Counter turn after counter turn...

357
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,363
Counter turn?!

358
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:09,831
Counter...

359
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,502
I m not lying ..Ha, ha. ha...

360
00:14:14,737 --> 00:14:18,106
I got two phone calls
from Mr. Kusaka yesterday...

362
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:21,476
Tihis is Kusaka
I arrived in Teito Station just now

364
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:27,215
Saturday, 810 pm

365
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,702
I see, I get it!

366
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,420
If so...

367
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:36,824
The coin locker

368
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,494
can be used for a period of
3 consecutive days in a row!

370
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:44,699
0101...Please berinside!

371
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:50,038
It's there!

372
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:53,374
So...he's the killer, after all!

373
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,311
Hmmthere're no

374
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,113
hints, no 'matter how muéh I re 4 this...

375
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,783
Huh ?!

376
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,852
What brings you all here...

377
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:08,289
What're you talking about?

378
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,992
You're the one that told us to
come here. Mr. Mourn

380
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,727
M. Me?

381
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:15,263
Vv ha!

382
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,900
I made.
No such.::phone ca...

384
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:24,505
Iaid call you indeed...

385
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:29,978
Of course, I did so to talk to you about
the homicide case of Mr. Yuichi Kusaka

387
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:33,715
D.Did you figure
out the Ninja technique?

389
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:39,988
Yes, one alibi trick was used
in this murder case

391
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:44,525
It's a very simple trick,
but it was very difficult to figure it out...

393
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:49,998
Why? Because the one who
used the trick was not the killer!

395
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:53,601
Not the killer?
Then. who was it?!

397
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:56,004
When I heard the message
on the answer phone,

399
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:59,207
something bothered me

400
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,476
That was because despite knowing that

401
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:05,613
Tsukigata Sensei was
still not home a little after 8:00,

403
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,749
Mr. Kusaka called twice

404
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:11,085
Why did he go out of his way
to make such a phone call

406
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:13,888
when it really was no big deal...

407
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:18,226
Saturday, 8:10 pm

408
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:21,262
Yes, he did it only
to make everybody believe

410
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:24,332
1e was a el oO a 1on a pm

411
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,067
To make everyone believe?

412
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,603
Which mean, he was
actually not there?

414
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,054
Mr. Mouri, I found it!

415
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,939
Officer Takag

416
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:34,742
I found it!
The ticket you asked for...

418
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:36,611
T.Ticket?!

419
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:39,280
The ticket that was
retrieved at Beika Station

421
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:41,516
that day ith
Mr. Kusaka's fingerprints on it

423
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:44,619
Officer Takagi. what time was it issued?

424
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:49,157
Oh, yes! Uh
It was sold at Teito Sitien...

426
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:50,758
at (30 pm /

427
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,360
What, 7:30 pm?

428
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:54,495
It's not after 8.107?

429
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:56,230
Just as I thought

430
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:58,499
He bought the.ticket at 7:30 pm

431
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,135
If he boarded the train right away,

432
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:05,807
he would've reached Beika Station
a little after 8:00.

434
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,575
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting...

435
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:08,910
Officer Chiba?

436
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,612
I asked Officer Chiba
% do me a favor 100

438
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,147
I had him go and get
the contents in the coin locker,

440
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:16,451
which pick up date was overdue...

441
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:22,022
T.That's Mr Kusaka's bag?!

442
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:24,559
Huh? This is the victim's belongings?

443
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,427
Is it?

444
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:28,162
Y.,Yes .

445
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:32,033
Please put the contents
of the bag on the table

447
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:33,367
Oh, yes!

448
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:39,507
Thank you?

449
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:46,047
And Inspector!
Please rewind that tape recorder a little

451
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:48,983
Huh?! O.Oh...

452
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,155
TeitoTeito

453
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,190
Mommy, hurry!
It's dangerous to run, Kenichi!

455
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,592
T.This is?!

456
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:57,892
T.This is?!

457
00:17:57,893 --> 00:18:00,595
It's the same as the message
that was in the answer phone!!

459
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:01,529
Hmm...

460
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,299
Yes, Mr. Kusaka who
reached Beika Station.

462
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,737
Usedsthat to make it seem as if he had

463
00:18:09,738 --> 00:18:14,675
reached Beika Station at 8:10
in order to create his alibi!

465
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,978
The Ninja technique of creating an alibi.

466
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,947
Once the secret is
revealed it is a very simple trick.

468
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,416
The only thing is the one
who used this Ninja trick

471
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:25,753
was not the killer, but the victim himself.

472
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,958
What did Mr. Kusaka
do something like that for?

474
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,560
In order to kill Mr. Saruhashi!

475
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,903
After the answer phone trick,
Mr. Kusaka rushed over

477
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:44,305
to Mr. Saruhashi's apartment.

478
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,874
I guess he told
Mr. Saruhashi beforehand.

480
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,343
That he had something important
to talk about or something

483
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,848
If Mr. Kusaka were to work
out the way he planned.

485
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,249
He was probably going to make an

486
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,052
anonymous call to the
police right after killing Mr. Saruhashi

488
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:02,156
And the time of the crime would
be precisely determined

490
00:19:02,157 --> 00:19:05,326
by the police. who get
there right after the call.

492
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:10,498
According to his alibi scheme,
from between 810 to 8:40

494
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:13,100
Mr. Kusaka would be riding the train

495
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,570
to Beika Station, so he would be
erased from the list of suspects.

497
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:21,342
All he had to do next, was visit
Tsukigatazss house at 9:00 as scheduled

499
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:25,046
However. it didn't work
out as he planned!

501
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,381
He was counterattacked
by Mr. Saruhashi

503
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:30,184
who he meant to kill

504
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,092
Dang it!

505
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,633
Mr. Saruhashi who counterattacked,
carried Mr. Kusaka's

507
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,368
corpse to the park and
disposed of it there.

509
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,372
Then. just as you already found out from

510
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:54,842
Investigations, he went to
the pub at about 8:30

512
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:57,310
s 7/0

513
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,914
I'm not lying.

514
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:03,684
Exactly. You weren't lying.

515
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:06,287
You realized that the police
made a mistake and all y™u

517
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,923
did was decide to use
this to your advantage.

519
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:11,592
So, you're the one who
killed Mr. Kusaka after all...

521
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:15,630
I know nothing of that:sort!!
He didn't come to my apartment!

523
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,531
No, I'm sure he did

524
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,166
) If he had intention to Kill.

525
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:22,904
He wouldn't take the tape recorder that
he used to create his alibi,

527
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,739
nor his manuscript along with him.

528
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,310
So, I figured that he would leave it
at the coin locker of Beika Station.

530
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,882
If something is left in that
Iocker for more than 3 days

532
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:37,351
the maintenance company
opens it with a spare key.1

534
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:39,287
Since today was the.3rd day,

535
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:43,156
I asked Officer Chiba to go get the
thing that was in-the locker.

537
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,527
Mr. Kusaka's bag. that's over the se

538
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:50,765
But. how did you figure out
the number of the locker?

540
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,934
That's the point.

541
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:56,671
When we went over to Mr. Saruhashi's
home, Conan found the

543
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,506
key to the locker in
Mr. Saruhashi's room.

545
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:03,911
0101, It's a number easy
enough for a child to remember

547
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,147
You say that Mr. Kusaka didn't come, but
how.can a person. who didn't come,

549
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:12,019
drop the key in your room?

550
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,257
My room,
he did come to my room. But...

552
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:17,625
It's, okay already.

553
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,360
Mr. Saruhashi...

554
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,195
S.Sensei...

555
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:28,102
1. was afraid of him all this time.

556
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:31,672
Afraid that he would!take
you away from me...

558
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,508
I'm'happy how you feel about me...

559
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:41,248
But whether you succeed as a
professional is how much effort you exert!

561
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:48,222
I guess both Mr. Kusaka and \ 0)
forgot what was most important
