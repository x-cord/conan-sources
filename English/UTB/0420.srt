Thoughtfulness and kindness

Thoughtfulness and kindness
for the one you love

9
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:08,272
Brings about misunderstanding.

10
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:09,608
But at long last The true killer is found
in the homeland of mythology

12
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:09,942
but at long last The true killer is found
in the homeland of mythology

14
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,477
He sees through the one and only truth

A child in "pperance
with the 1. Q. of an adult

17
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,748
No case as left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

20
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,334
We came on a sic htseeinc tri» to Izumo
the homeland of mythology.

23
00:01:59,335 --> 00:01:59,835
We came on a sightseeing trip to Izumo
the homeland of mythology.

26
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:04,206
and we become acquainted with
a woman named Eiko Esumi there.

28
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:09,778
The-following«day. Eiko"s fiance is killed

29
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:13,715
and a robbery case of a sword worth
10:000-000:-yen occurs.

32
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:18,587
And of the four suspects
that were summoned to the police

34
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:21,957
were Biko and her childhood friend...

35
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,361
Please tell me

<r ~, APT YG
at around 1:00 in the afternoon yesterday...
First of all...

42
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:33,535
Since yesterday was my day- off 3
I went to Old Taisha Station.

44
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,904
Lastly. . Ms. Esumi: where were you?

45
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:39,308
I went to Hinomisaki.

46
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:42,878
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma aren't the killers.
Are they?

48
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,246
Nope...

49
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:49,384
Why aren't there any witnesses...?
It has to be that they're lying...

52
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:51,220
(ié $5)

00:02:51,221 --> 00:02:56,424

The Sword of Yamatano Oroch! Part 2

00:02:57,393 --> 00:02:59,795
Are you sure you. didn't-see wrong?

57
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,899
Of course not.
I've known her since.she was born.

59
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,368
She was Eiko of Hinodeya!
Hoh. hoh. hon...

61
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:06,902
She was Eiko of Hinodeya!
Hoh. hon. hon...

63
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,904
It was after noon yesterday?

64
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:11,540
Yep... Just about 1:00...

65
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:15,376
She always sits!on that chair over there...

67
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:20,148
EikO was here at the time that
Mr. Wanibuchi was killed?!

69
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:25,354
Since there's av witness
Eiko's Wibi's been established...

71
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,956
But. why did she say
she was at Hinomisaki...?

74
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,626
Let's go tell Pops and the others!

75
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,376

76
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:37,966
salad
It Wust as-she and Conan are saying...
I'was at Old" TaisharStation.

79
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,434
Huh?!

80
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:45,991
I go there a lot when I have time.
I feel relaxed when I go there

82
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,945
It is also the place where the
history of my mother and father started.

84
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:54,883
My mother happened to+stop by
when on a trip andiscame here to Izumo

86
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:57,552
She just happened to spend the night
at my father's inn...

88
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:01,023
They were both attracted to-each other-and
eventually got married...

90
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,958
Then. I was born.

91
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,627
Although the: railroad line has
already been discontinued:.

93
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:09,564
when I . go there. I feel like
I'can see the beginning 'of everything...

95
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:12,067
I hike that station.

96
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:12,968
I like that station.

97
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:18,240
No matter how much you 10Ok for witnesses
who've seen Eiko at Hinomisaki.

99
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,540
You wouldn't find them
because she didn't go there.

101
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,208
You wouldn't find them
because she didn't go there.

105
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:21,376
mie lH

109
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:26,748
If you were at Old Taisha Station.
Why didn=t you say $0 to begin with!

113
00:04:26,749 --> 00:04:28,550
22 Gog 7D Ze
Why did you lie about it?

116
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:29,084
Why did you lie about it?

117
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:30,719
Well...

118
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,355
Because Mr. Fukuma said
what he did: fight?

120
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,556
Huh?

121
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:39,695
Yesterday was my day off so
I went to Old Taisha Station.

123
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,231
You were more-surprisedi than an, one else
back then-weren't you. Eiko?...

125
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:47,636
Because you were there,
but Mr. Fukuma wasn't.

127
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:48,302
Because you were there.
But Mr Fukuma wasn't...

129
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:53,742
He killed Mr. Wanibuchi...for me
that's the only thing™ could think of...

131
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:59,147
So. I couldn't tell the truth
If I mentioned Old Traisha Station.

133
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:01,183
It would contradict his...

134
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:05,887
But. I was alone too so.
There are no witnesses.

136
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:10,359
If we were-at"the same place. there's no
way that we wouldn't have seen each other

138
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,164
Since Mr. Fukuma lied before you.
You, couldn't help but lie...

140
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:21,169
Hinomisaki just happened to cross my; mind
since I like it there 00...

142
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,939
I see. so that's the story...

143
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,543
But. if Ms Esumi is innocent. Mr. Fukuma's
activities become questionable...

145
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:36,318
He took the sword away fromthe murder
site not to protect Ms. Esum...

147
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,021
Bog.) fe
ut to=hide what he did.

149
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,890
Don't think+so...

150
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,025
Huh?!

151
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:47,295
Eiko*as wellias Mr. Fukuma is obsessed
over an idea and mistaken.

153
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,431
Obsessed and mistaken?

154
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:49,998
Obsessed and mistaken?

156
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:53,135
If you tell Mr. Fukuma that
Eiko has been.cleared fromisuspicion,

160
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:55,971
I'm sure hell tell you everything.

163
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:57,773

165
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:58,273
Fron
I'll bring Fukuma here!

177
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,711
Eiko! It wasn't you?

179
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:06,715
I was at Old Taisha Station right through.

180
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,651
But. then...
why?

182
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,320
Where did you find this?

183
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:12,687
Where did you find this?

184
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,822
What is this?

186
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,022
What is this?

188
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:14,222
What is this?

190
00:06:14,223 --> 00:06:14,956
What is this?

192
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,225
Where glss...

193
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:19,728

201
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:27,819
Yesterday at noon.

202
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,772
I did go to Inome Cave

203
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,310
But. it wasn't to kill Mr. Wanibuchu...

204
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:38,146
The day before yesterday.
Eiko told me that...

206
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,817
She was called out by Wanibuchi.

207
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,620
He told me to come to
Inome Cave at 1:30...

209
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,156
Why's he asking you to
come to a-lonely place like that...

211
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:52,761
I'm sure he's up to No good... Don't go!

212
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:54,729
I'll go in place of you.

213
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,667
I'll have a good talk with him and
make him give you up. once and for all.

215
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,001
RR oo...

216
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,004
Noon tomorrow. at 1-307

00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,325
So, yesterday. in order to

218
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,744
Wanibuchi...?!

219
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:22,124
You found this there...

220
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:26,194
I recognized it nght away...
because-this is what I sent you.

222
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,463
I. 1 will have to keep it for a while.

223
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,266
The key is this pendant...

224
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:35,670
I thought you went despite
my telling you not to go...

226
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:38,907
Thinking that Eiko had killed him,

227
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:42,777
you impulsively stole the: sword
to make it look like a robbery...?

229
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,746
Bf - AA
Oh. yes sir...

231
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,781
The story makes sense.

232
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,454
Hm sorry. Ryo... I lost that
pendant several days ago.

234
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,589
I couldnwmake myself tell you...

235
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:54,956
So. tha vs whatdsyou meant Conan...

236
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:58,193
So. that's what you meant Conan...

237
00:07:58,194 --> 00:08:00,562
when you said they were
obsessed a mistaken...

239
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,298
They both thought that their partner
was the Killer.

242
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:07,068
They both lied to protect each other.

243
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:10,405
CIO. aux»
How so very cute...

245
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,740
It's not cute!

247
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,477
How dare you both confuse
the case the way you did.!

250
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,881
Mr. Fukuma. you stealing the
sword is nothing other thanffa crime!

252
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,216
KO'?
Yes. sir...I'm sorry!

254

S or FEE
(wy.
Yes. sir...I'm sorry!

257
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:21,666
Yes. sir...I'm sorry!

258
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,319
( Og - Vv
If you didn't take the pendant away.

261
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:27,122
maybe the fingerprints
of the real killer were on them!!

263
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,560
I completely thought it was Eiko so I...

264
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,428
If sO. the more so!

265
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,566
Trying to cover up somebody
else's crime Is not love!

268
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:39,935
\ O...

270
00:08:40,035 --> 00:08:40,235
I understand...

272
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:40,435
I understand...

273
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,970
I understandi~

274
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:46,508
Which means that the one who
killed Mr. Wanibuchi is KazuyaglshitobLn?

276
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:51,513
That jittery attitude of Mr. Ishitobi
sure as worth suspecting...

278
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:57,719
The way Mr. Fujie acted surprised
when I introduced myself also bothers me.

280
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,523
The real/killer had this pendant. right?

281
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:05,994
Probably...and he dropped it
when he killed Mr. Wanibuchi...!

283
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:10,130
Rather. he deliberately
put it near the, cojpse!

285
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:14,101
You said you lost it
several days ago. didn't you?

288
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:18,373
Just before or 'after those days
did you see Mr. Ishitobi or Mr. Fujie?

291
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:19,574
Oh. come to think of it...

292
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,375
Oh. come to think of it...

293
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:26,114
Come on . please Eiko! If its for
you who he loves I'm sure he'll listen...

295
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:32,520
Marry him and please tell him
not to take us over! Please!

297
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,390
Just what do you think you're
saying. Mr: Fujie?

299
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:38,443
Are saying you want our
daughter to sacrifice

301
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,446
herself for the sake. of
saving your wedding hall!

303
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:47,534
I'm pleading knowing what a selfish
request this is... Please. Eiko. please!

305
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:49,137
Please let me think it over...

306
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:52,474
Eiko! There's no need to think it over!

307
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:54,943
Please leave. Mr.*Fujie!

309
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,510
How cruel...

310
00:09:56,545 --> 00:10:00,015
to tell you to sacrifice yourself f
or his own\convenience...! Eiko?

312
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,617
Come to think of it.

313
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:05,153
It was after that. that I realized
I had lost the pendant...

315
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:08,089
So. it's Mr. Fujie...

316
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,427
But, Mr. Fujie has the alibi
of having been at Matsue Castle...

318
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:14,829
His name was on the name
Iist of the castle tower...

320
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:18,433
Let's go take a look at
Matsue Castile. Mr. Mourn.

322
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,171
Right. «if the killer didn't
try to frame Eiko up as the killer

328
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:38,820
This distinct>way of writing
is unmistakably Mr. Fujies writing...

330
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,724
'kg . ,.
What 'sswritten before and after his
signature. 1:05 doesn't seem to be a lie.

334
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,158
What's, written before and after his
signature: 105 doesn't seem to be a lie.

336
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:46,194
I guess itswas just a waste of time...

337
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,997
I just thought there
may be a possibility but...

339
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,932
Which means . there's
only one person left!

341
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,734
Let's hurry back!!

342
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,338

Something, bothers me...

I can't seem to do it well.

358
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:24,933
If written in a pencil,
it could be erased. but this.

00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,967
But this

374
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:45,820
Wait Pops!

375
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,355
We're leaving you behind!

376
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,358
Yes this is Yamane...

377
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:53,361
What?! Yeah...Okay!

378
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:56,164
Mr. Ishitobi couldn't have
committed the crime. 4

380
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,366
Yesterday. a little after noon time.

382
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:03,705
In the suburbs of Izumo. there was
a hit and run-accident.-:around 1:00...

385
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:07,558
At about the same time that
Mr. Wanibuchi was killed in~lnome Cave.

387
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,226
And? t

388
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:15,717
The driver was finally found through
eye-witness reports. and just arrested.

390
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,786
It us Mr lshntobu

391
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:21,523
I get it

392
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:24,626
He wasn't jittery because
he killed Mr. Wanibuchu.

394
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:28,930
But because he was afraid we
would find out about his hit and run case...

396
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:31,800
But. if so. what about this case .

397
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:34,969
It's not Mr. Fukuma or Ms. Esumi™

398
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,439
Mr. Fujieshas a definite alibi, \)

399
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,375
possibility of Mr. ishitobi is,gone'...

400
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:44,178
All the suspects are innocent.

401
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:45,246
Right

402
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:48,283
Mr. Mouri!

405
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,082
Are \ ou all right?

406
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,585
Dad.
Are you all night?

00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,937
So. we're»back where we started.

409
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,889
Uh. Pops.

410
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,338
Yes. I'm Fujie.

411
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:10,622
Yes. I'm Fugue .

412
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,092
This is Mouri, I'd like to see you...

413
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:19,964
I'll tell you the reason when
I see you in person.

415
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:24,519
Yes. Mouri here...

416
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,721
This is Fujie. I have something
I want to talk to you about .

418
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,790
You want to talk tome ?

419
00:13:28,924 --> 00:13:31,359
I'll be waiting for you at Hinomisaki.

420
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:42,803
Oh what a magnificent lighthouse it 1s

421
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:47,942
Yes ..it's 43.65 meters
and is said to be tallest in Japan.

424
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:50,010
hat a beautiful lighthouse

427
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:58,319
It was built in Meiji 36 or 1903,
SO. it's been here for over 100 years.

429
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
'Pia.
100 years...

431
00:13:59,321 --> 00:13:59,954
100 years...

432
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:03,758
1...And. he said
wait for him at Hinomisaki. but where...

435
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,363
Right... At this time the
Iighthouse is already closed.

437
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,298
So it must be that observatory up ahead

438
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,766
Let's go

439
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,901
Yes...

440
00:14:12,902 --> 00:14:16,838
What could he want to talk to me about. .?

442
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:24,145
mma VAL QE= NIE, AVEAAVIR AY VU IRANNY AALS or

443
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:25,897
What did you want to talk to me about?

444
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,881
Huh? Aren't*you the one who asked me
to come...

446
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:27,682
Huh? Aren't you the one who asked me
to come...

448
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:33,054
Whe... please may I meet someone nice...

449
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,023
Sleeping Kogoro?!

450
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,424
Sleeping Kogoro?!

451
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,226
So. this is the rumored...

452
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:48,102
Mr. Fujie. you analogized
Mr. Wanibuchi to the Eight-forked serpent

454
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,973
His.name may/mean crocodile,
but his character'is'that-of a snake...

456
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,776
A monster that. swallows up
whatever-at targets' as prey...

458
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:57,645
Yes... an.Eight-forked serpent indeed.

459
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:03,484
It's true that Mr. Wanibuchi
may have been a hated existence...

461
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:08,556
But that doesn't mean
it's okay to kill him. Mr. Fujie!

464
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:15,163
What a thing to say. Ha. ha. ha
IS It about that again. Mr Mouri

466
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,365
That's right Mr. Mourn.

467
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:22,170
You even confirmed his alibi
at Matsue Castle yourself!

469
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,772
That was a trick

470
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:25,907
A trick?

471
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:33,047
You thought of killing Mr. Wanibuchi when
you went to Eiko's house several days ago

473
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,966
sn that right?

474
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:41,089
You pleaded with Eiko...asking her
to marry Mr. Wanibuchi and to ask him

476
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,691
to quit taking over your wedding; hall...

477
00:15:43,993 --> 00:15:49,097
But. of course
my selfish plea was not?heard...

479
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,966
And in your grief!

480
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:57,772
You happened to pick upsomething
you didn't expect to...

482
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:04,345
A thought flashedithrough-your mind...

483
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:09,400
You made two calls the day before
yesterday. didn't you?

485
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,386
The first one to Mr. Wanibuchu.

486
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,488
It went something like this...

487
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,991
I'll give you.a great idea on how to
make Ms- 'Eiko Esumi your very own...

489
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:20,028
It-s-bestifor 'both of us to meet
where there aren-t'many people...

491
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,665
I'll see you at Inome
tomorrow at 1-00 then...

493
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,935
Your other call was to Eiko...
You pretended to be Wanibuchi...

495
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:32,140
I want to see you tomorrow: please
come to lnome at 1:30 tomorrows...

497
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:35,410
That phone call wasn't
from Mr. Wanibuchi ?!

501
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,745
He used Mr. Wanibuchi's tone of voice.

502
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:41,416
Come to think of it, he said he had a cold.
His voice was not like always...

504
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:45,687
1.00 and 1:30. you designated different time

505
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:50,558
because you didn't want Eiko
to witness you killing Mr. Wanibucht...

507
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,261
And.
Yesterday at 1:00.

509
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,196
You carried
out your scheme.

511
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:58,132
Huh?!

512
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,534
Mr. Wanibuchi's wristwatch
stopping at

514
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:03,538
1:05, was not what you planned

515
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,574
you had no choice but to
carry out what you did...

517
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,745
So. you sped over to
Matsue Castle by:car...

519
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:15,516
to log your name in on the
name list and establish your alibi.

521
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:18,886
It would be impossible to log »
in from that time. Mr. Mourn!

523
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,688
No matter how fast you drive there by car,

524
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:22,857
you can get to Matsue Castle
only after 2:00!

526
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:24,559
It's not impossible...

527
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:28,463
You went to Matsue Castle
twice yesterday. didn't you?

529
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,981
Twice?

530
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,801
First, it was early in the morning...
in order to set up the trick.

532
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:04,799
You used an alias and logged
In your name and the time

534
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,535
and at the same time switched pens.

535
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,871
Switched pens?

536
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:13,191
You switched the pen to one
you could erase using an eraser

538
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:17,145
After killing Mr. Wanibuchi
you went back to

540
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,948
Matsue Castle aga and looked
for a fandom log in around 1:00". %

542
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:39,133
So: the very moment.that
Mr. Wanibuchi was Killed...

544
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:45,006
your-alibi thatgyyou were
atsMatsue Castle. an hour

546
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:47,141
away from the murder site was established.

547
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:50,211
It can easily be proven if you try it out.

548
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,680
There are ball pens that can be
erased using erasers

550
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,950
When you think about it.

551
00:18:55,951 --> 00:19:00,188
When logging in on name lists like these,
the name. address-and date are written.

553
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,256
But the time is usually not written...

554
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:05,626
Tihe fact is. nobody was:'writing
in the time until the day before yesterday...

556
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,328
However. yesterday

557
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:12,466
since the first person wrote in the time,
everyone started logging; in the same way.

559
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,802
If the firstyperson, writes
somethingdin ascertain way

561
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:18,673
everyone who follows thinks
that it is to be done this way

563
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:21,843
and follows the first pattern
without hesitation...

565
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:26,948
You used this behavior of people. to
carry out your trick. How about it. Mr. Fujie?

567
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:33,087
What proof do you have that I am the
first one who logged in yesterday morning?

569
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,691
The name: lcihiro Yamada
sure-'sounds like an alias but

571
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,227
the problem is the address.
Iaw 'Ymésyfi.

573
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,229
Naruse-shi, Tokyo?

574
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,166
So. what makes, you say thatiliwrote it!

575
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:48,035
Why us Naruse-shu a problem...

576
00:19:48,036 --> 00:19:52,740
Mr Fugue. you used to live in
Tokyo during your university days. right?

578
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,409
Wanibuchi is an underclassman of mine...

579
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,546
f Teito Economics University in Tokyo...

580
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,714
I confirmed and found out that.

581
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:05,453
The dormitory that you lived in
4 years ago was located in Naruse-shi...

583
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,589
That only shows that there is a
point of contact! But that's no answer...

585
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:15,396
It could be that a person by the name of
Ichiro Yamada actually came and wrote it!

587
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:17,098
That's not possible...

588
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,534
ecause a place called Naruse-shi
does not exist in Tokyo anymore.

590
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,335
What?

591
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,322
It merged with Haido-shi that is next to. it

592
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,742
and theifffwame Naruse~shi is
gone:x:since a year ago.

595
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:32,579
You didn't know until now. did you?

596
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:39,253
I see. Naruse-shi doesn't exist anymore.

597
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:44,492
Mr Mourn, the fact is. back then,
I thought I was doomed already...

599
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,726
This is Mourn.

600
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,796
+ The famed detective?!

601
00:20:48,797 --> 00:20:53,267
I figured that you'd
disclosed the truth in time...

603
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:55,386
It's just as I thought after all

604
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,381
How beautiful

605
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,885
I love the sunset that is
viewed from Hinomisaki...

607
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,754
I won't be able to see it
for some time now...

609
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,556
I wanted to take a good look
at it so I wouldn't forget it.

611
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:17,625
That's why I had you all come here.

612
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:24,598
I know how selfish I am

613
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,467
Despite knowing this.

614
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:30,604
I didn't want Wanibuchi to
take over my precious business .

616
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:34,075
I didn't want the monster to swallow it...

617
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:35,676
I was desperate

618
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:37,611
I know .

619
00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:38,913
Fukuma

621
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,033
Be sure you protect Eiko.

622
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,952
Who knows what monster
would appear again in the future

625
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:47,855
will

626
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,594
Wow, what a beautiful sunset!

627
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:54,962
Conan!

628
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,897
What are you doing?

629
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:00,368
Uh. I hope things work out for the two.

630
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:01,902
I'm sure they'll work out fine...

631
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:05,823
After all, they were born in the land
where the god of matchmaking resides!
