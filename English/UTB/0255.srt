Speaking of clam digging,

106
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,058
I believe
Basho composed a poem about it...

108
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:23,295
Shijimi tori futami ni wakare

I hate to correct you.

116
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,905
But I believe it was hamaguri clam,
not shijimi.

00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:33,772

119
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:34,607

Yes.

121
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,775
Actually, the poem reads,

122
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,479
Hamaguri no futami ni wakare
yuku aki zo...

124
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,983
And just so you know, he wrote that
at the last point of Okunohosomichi,

126
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:44,984

266
00:07:59,112 --> 00:07:59,878
Hah...

267
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,488
Don't you just love these hot springs...

268
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,656
yeah...

269
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,057
Me too...

270
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,194
It feels so good,

271
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,162
my body feels like
it's turning into melted chocolate...

273
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,731
Exactly...

274
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,499
Excuse me, Mr. Yagisawa...

275
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,367
Yes?

276
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,902
What is that renga
you were all talking about back there?

278
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:25,637
How can I explain...

279
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,072
simply put,

280
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,842
it's a kind of game where several people
compose poems and link them together.

282
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,279
For example, Conan,
you compose a 57-5 haiku, okay?

284
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,649
The next person
would add another 7-7 poem to it...

286
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:42,388
Then another person
would add another 5-7-5 poem to it...

288
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,091
and so forth,
Iinking one poem to the other.

290
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,327
Is it different from haiku?

291
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,229
The first 5-7-5.

292
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,264
Is called hokku. But...

293
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,401
I suppose you could consider it haiku,

294
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,169
after all,
It would contain the season word...

296
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,103
I see...

297
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,472
What kind of poem do you like,

298
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,407
Mr. Yagisawa?

299
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,411
I like poems that are humorous.

300
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,146
What about you Mr. Shiina?

301
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,046
Huh?

302
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,148
Who me?

303
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:10,349
Let's see...

304
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,086
My favorite poems are those with feeling,

305
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,356
Iike how a father feels for his daughter...

306
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,960
pardon me for asking,
but do you have children, Mr. Shiina...?

308
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,695
I have a daughter...

309
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:26,965
but my wife took her when she left me...

310
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:29,368
Oh, gee...I'm sorry to hear that...

311
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,305
I don't blame her though,
it was all my fault,

313
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,505
I was over my head in debt...

314
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:35,707
{ - iy. wally.
I...

316
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,291
Thank you for listening!

317
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,526
That was wonderful, Mr. Yagisawa!!

318
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,197
Here you go Mr. Mouri, drink up.

319
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,098
Well, that's mighty nice of you...

320
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,468
By the way,

321
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,702
have you made plans for tomorrow?

322
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,138
Oh, that's right,

323
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,273
I was meaning to ask...

324
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,709
Conan,
have you ever heard of Yaegaki Shrine?

327
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,646
Ms. Ando told me
about it while we were in the bath,

329
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,548
why don't we go there tomorrow?

330
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,784
Uh, tomorrow: mo ning,

331
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,952
we're going to
the Tiffany Garden Museum of Art,

333
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,321
then In the afternoon...

334
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,889
Yaegaki Shrine, eh...

335
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,125
I believe It houses the god of marriage...

336
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,496
It's famous for it's Mirror Lake
fortune telling, isn't that right.

338
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,630
Eh? Oh, yes...

339
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:34,099
Well then we'll have to go there too...

340
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,970
except for Mr. Ushikubo,
the four of us are single...

342
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,505
But,

343
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,974
Ran already has someone special,

344
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:42,774
don't you?

345
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,815
There's a bus that goes to Yaegaki Shrine

346
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,917
from the Matsue Onsen station
in the morning...

348
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,720
you can always go to
the art museum in the afternoon...

350
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:56,622
h all right then...

351
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,923
that's what we'll do.

352
00:10:58,992 --> 00:10:59,858
Good grief,

353
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,960
Iook at those two, all goo-goo eyed.

354
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,295
Now, now...

355
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,163
Ms Ando, listen...

356
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,031
Yes?

357
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,233
Don't you think
it's about time we picked the location

359
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,468
where we're going to compose
our first poem?

362
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:10,869
1 CO,

363
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,137
you're right...

364
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,005
Shiina...

365
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:13,839
yes.

366
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,146
The first place
for the poem composition?

368
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,915
We're going to pick

369
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,350
where we're to go to compose
the hokku portion of the poem.

371
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:26,385
Oh...

372
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,289
I remember, hokku is the 5-7-5 haiku
that starts the linked poem.

374
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,189
Yes,

375
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,092
the rule is to compose the poem
describing the scene in front of you.

377
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,760
Oh, I nearly forgot.

378
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,031
This is for you, Mr. Mouri

379
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,168
It's an-introduction to linked poetry,-
I wrote it.

381
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,104
There's a picture of us inside too.

382
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,873
Hmm...

383
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,008
I see,

384
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,976
you're all here...

385
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,012
There, I'm finished!

386
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,980
Mizuki,

387
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,382
can you get me my hat, it's over there?

388
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:58,016
Okey.

389
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,060
Here you are.

390
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,161
Thank you.

391
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,297
All right then,

392
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,365
Mr. Ushikubo, you first

393
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,032
Okey...

394
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,270
Next, we'll go according to age,

395
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,037
SO It's me.

396
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,572
Let's see...

397
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,874
The closest one is

398
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,310
Here we are...

399
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,746
All right, everyone read your slips.

400
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,682
Matsue Castle.

401
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,683
Mine is Gessho Temple.

402
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,319
Shiominawate.

403
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,053
Which means,

404
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,423
I'm at the art museum...

405
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:39,791
All right then,

406
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,060
we'll leave the hotel
at 9:00 tomorrow morning

408
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,796
then return by 11:30.

409
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,699
When everyone gets back,
we'll move to Tamatsukuri Spa

411
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,401
nd link the poems...

412
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,369
Oh no!

413
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,139
Is something the matter?

414
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,575
No, it's just that I wear contact lenses

415
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,644
and my eyes dry very easily

416
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,612
so I need my prescription eye drops .

417
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:01,813
Oh, here they are.

418
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,351
I'm such a scatter brain,
I forget where I leave it all the time.

420
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:08,420
Humph!

421
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,088
If it's so important,

422
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,024
you should always carry a spare!

423
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:15,193
I always carry an extra one in my bag...

424
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,361
On, that's right,

425
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,730
I have to make a phone call!

426
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,939
Well isn't he the busy fellow...

427
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,176
He's probably just found another victim.

428
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,144
Huh?

429
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,814
His motive for joining our group,

430
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,985
was artiall to et our mone

431
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,087
He's really a louse!

432
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,501
Listen up, Yagisawa!

433
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,205
You're the one
who can't afford to lose your business!

435
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,577
Get it all ready by next week, or else.

436
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,945
Pay back what you owe.

437
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,947
Or you'll lose your business,

438
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,215
understand!

439
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,817
Yes, I know...

440
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,430
Yaegaki Shrine
\EiSmht

442
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,302
Mirror Lake

443
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,002
Hmm...
MirrorslLake

445
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,671
It says that if the paper doesn't sink 1
within fifteen minutes,
Mirror Lake

448
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,206
you'll find the love of your life.
Mirror Lake

450
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,708
And if it sinks close to you,

451
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,043
it means that the person
you're looking for is close by.

453
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,480
Let's try-it...

454
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,024
That's why I didn't want
to bring her here...

456
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:30,162
Ran.

457
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,165
I don't know how it's going to turn out...

458
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:34,733
but .

459
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,969
Sorry to keep you waiting Conan!

460
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,740
What a cute puppy.

461
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,541
Uh huh...

462
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,544
Ran...

463
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:46,511
Huh?

464
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:52,784
Shall we go?

465
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,485
Okey!

466
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,257
Hello.

467
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,726
Oh,it's you dad.

468
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,094
Uh huh...

469
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,396
uh what?

470
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,666
Mr. Ushikubo's dead!

471
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:08,867
What!?

472
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,238
Karamete no koguchi Park
2 FEZ

474
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,913
It's Mr. Ushikubo...

475
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,481
I'm certain of it.

476
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,450
I see, so it is...

477
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,751
By the looks of it,

478
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,687
he's been beaten to death.

479
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,456
He was hit on the back
of the head several times.

481
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,458
With a hard, blunt object.

482
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,260
Officer Hirose

483
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:35,894
Huh?
Officer Hirose

485
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,828
Oh, you're not by any chance!
Officer Hirose

487
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,329
Oh, you're not by any chance!?

488
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,197
My name's Mouri, I'm a private detective.

489
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,033
It looks like Mr. Ushikubo
tried to protect his head

491
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,736
with his left hand when he was attacked...

492
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,138
That's how his watch was cracked...

493
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,241
10105...

494
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,278
I'm pretty sure we can assume
that's the time of the attack.

497
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:54,446
1 CO.

498
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,382
And about the victim's right hand...

499
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:01,186
His index finger is extended
Iike he was pointing to something.

501
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,387
Hum...

502
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,656
Bamboo huh...

503
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,526
It could be a dying message...

504
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,527
Could be...

505
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,331
There's blood on the tip of his finger!

506
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,768
And it looks like
he touched something with it...

508
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,774
There's no blood here...

509
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,746
One of the pages has been ripped out!

510
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:34,920
Ah, Autumn: is:full I suffice to say,
my lifexhas no sorrow...

512
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,789
Ouch!

513
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,791
Don't touch the evidence!!

I don't know

535
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,592
he was asking everybody questions
and then he ran off somewhere...

537
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:16,761
Good grief...

538
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:20,298
the reason
I asked all of you to come here is

540
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,101
I need to know where you were all at
when Mr. Ushikubo was killed,

542
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,770
which is approximately 10:05.

543
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,239
What are you insinuating!?

544
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,541
From what Mr. Mouri tells me,

545
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,479
you all had a motive
for killing Mr. Ushikubo.

547
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,916
Everything's bound to come out
sooner or later,

549
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,418
so I think it's better
for everyone to just tell the truth.

551
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,620
All right then,

552
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,589
I was
at the Tiffany Garden Museum of Art.

554
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,926

564
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,177
Yes,

565
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,346
I do remember him

566
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,416
I'm sure that
person was bending over by the hedges

568
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,718
beside the fountain
in the English garden,

570
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,154
something about having dropped
some coins

572
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,622
Do you remember the time?

573
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,393
I'm sure it was a little past 11.

574
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,627
Thank you!

575
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,365
Huh?

576
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,102
What are these marks?

577
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,376
I was at Gessho Temple at that time.

578
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,912
You probably know
there's huge statue of a turtle there, right?

580
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,012

To the huge turtle a mantis
does raise its ax in reverence forsooth,

587
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,089
Is what I wrote

588
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,526
The time was almost 10:05 on the dot.

589
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,995
Yes, I remember,

590
00:19:56,996 --> 00:20:00,365
he stood in front of that statue
for a long time thinking...

592
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,166
Do you remember what time it was?

593
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:04,569
I'm sure It was 11:00.

594
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,704
19680...

595
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,576
I was looking at the samurai residences
at Shiominawate...

597
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,646
I was there from about 10:00 until 11...

599

I don't have any witnesses,
samurai residences at Shiominawate

601
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,418
but I sat in the rest area
thinking up a poem.
Samurai residences at Shiominawate

604
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,054
And did you come up with something?

605
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,155
Yes...

606
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,893
Soft and gently where the sun shines
down upon autumn leaves dance...

608
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,261
This is it...

609
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,098
I don't understand!

610
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,942
From the rest area,

611
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,678
these plants would hide
the autumn leaves from view!

613
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,348
I went for a stroll along the lake

614
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,383
and then went to
the Prefectural Art Museum...

616
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,452
but ll didn't write a poem...

617
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:55,553
Why not?

618
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,089
Because, on this outing,

619
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:58,556
I had each of them
write a poem and then

621
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,758

630
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,767
No one remembers seeing Ms. Ando...

631
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,470
That's right, that memo pad...

632
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,540
There was stock information written in it...

633
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,843
The page that was torn out,

634
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,213
something must've been written on it
while that person was talking to him!!

636
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,151
Yes, Mr. Ushikubo seemed quite happy.

637
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:28,118
He jotted it down in his notebook...

638
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,887
I see, thank you very much!

639
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:31,756
Yes,

640
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,625
no Ml have all the information!

641
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:35,993
Hmm...

642
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,931
not one of you has a solid alibi it seems...

643
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,065
By the way,

644
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,534
have you found the murder weapon?

645
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,935
We're still searching the area.

646
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,540
And we'll also search the places
you all went to,

648
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,409
so please don't leave Matsue
until I say you can.

650
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:52,944
All right. 4

651
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,114
I'd like to continue
our linked poetrn session

653
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,616
as a tribute to the late Mr. Ushikubo,

654
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,118
what do you all think...

655
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,787
That's a good idea,

656
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,389
Iet's do it!

657
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,559
The linked poetry session, eh...

658
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:09,627
What!?

659
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,496
Me join their group!?

660
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,363
Yeah!

661
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,364
You're sharp,

662
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:16,034
you'd be able to figure out
who the killer is just by watching them

664
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,636
Well, sure, but...

665
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,004
That's a great idea!!

666
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,506
Please do it!

667
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,974
Yeah, okay...

668
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:28,613
I'm absolutely positive
one of those four killed him...

670
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,649
and we're going to find out
at that poetry session!!
