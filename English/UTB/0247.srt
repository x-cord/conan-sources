1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,002
Even destiny serves
a ta clie to deduction

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,837
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:07,406
A tangled net murder case on the beach.

6
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,542
The two girls also come to
terms with each other today.

8
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,143
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,812
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,581
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,918
We came to visit
the ocean-of lzu-onc Yagain:

15
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,854
Ran and the others got acquainted with

16
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,456
Yuuta Yoshizawa,

17
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,824
Noboru Shimojo,

18
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,060
and Giichi Yoshizawa at the beach.

19
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:11,464
But there was a somewhat
dark atmosphere.

21
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,003
That night, we coincidentally ran into

22
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:22,174
Mr. Shimojo, Mr. Yoshizawa and
their friend, Nobutsugu Nezu.

24
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,279
The three seem to have been waiting
for Mr. Aramaki.

26
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,384
Yet, at that time...

27
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:36,888
Mr. Aramaki was ruthlessly being washed
up to shore, a sorry sight and dead.

29
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:47,132
The Mystery Caught in the Net Part ll

30
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,912
Everybody is late.

31
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:12,558
Okay, I got it! Keep at it!

32
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,125
Yes, sir!

33
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,326
Officer Yokomizo!

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,596
I've figured it out!!

35
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,900
Uh... what did you figure out?

36
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,871
The trick that the killer used to
drown that man!

38
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:26,805
Huh?

39
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:27,807
Â» \Wihat?!

40
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,343
What }

41
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:34,246
What's the reaction of
yours supposed to mean...

43
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,117
Huh? Oh... so how did the killer do it?

44
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,320
That boat that was drifting IS a fake!

45
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,256
The real trick is very simple and clear!

46
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,595
The killer made the man drunk,

47
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,531
wrapped him up in a net
then threw him out on the beach!

49
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,669
High tide comes
and the man is rendered helpless,

51
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,605
not being able to move, and drowns.

52
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,208
So the killer didn't have to be
at the scene of the crime to do it!

54
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,444
Wow!! Sonoko, you're a genius!!

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,012
I am, aren't I?

56
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:11,450
Uh... I don't mean to be a wet blanket,
but that's impossible.

58
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,651
Huh?

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,154
Because even at high tide,
not all at once instantaneously,

61
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:18,891
water can only increase
several centimeters at a time.

63
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:24,196
If the waves touch the body
and the water gradually increases,

65
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,931
no matter what the case,
the victim would've awaken.

67
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:31,837
Besides the victim was only tangled
in the net and not tied up or anything.

69
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,841
He could've gotten up
and avoided the waves.

71
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,246
He could've escaped on all fours to
a place out of range from the waves.

73
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:45,251
But, if he were given some strong
sleeping pill or something,

75
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,719
it would be a different story of course

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,456
We haven't got any such report
from the coroner yet, though...

78
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,459
Well then, what about this?

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,297
The killer was holding him down with the
net covered over the man till he drowned!

81
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,665
How about 1t?!

82
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,701
There's no trick involved there.

83
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,371
Shoots! No good either.

84
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,539
S.Sonoko...

85
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,276
I see... So, that's what it is.

86
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,681
That's why that person did
something so weird...

88
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,152
I'm sure that he's the killer!

89
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,120
Noboru Shimojo

90
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,254
Moreover, he hasn't realized yet...
Noboru Shimojo
sm He

93
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:24,088
Noboru Shimojo

95
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:28,060
that the trick that he used in
an attempt to hide his crime...
Nobutsugu Nezu

98
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,764
is actually working against him
and revealing what he did...
Yuuta Yoshizawa

102
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:31,997
Yuuta Yoshizawa

103
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,570
Hey! Come on, that's enough!

104
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,139
Even all the on lookers have left already!

105
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,376
We said all we have to say,
and if there's nothing more, I'm leaving!

107
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,446
Oh, please wait. Just a little while more!

108
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,316
I want to talk to you. Just a bit...

109
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,651
Um, Sonoko...

110
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,421
you can't think of anything that has to
do with the murder anymore, can you?

112
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,723
So, let's go back to the hotel.

113
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,891
I guess so...

114
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,394
D.Don't tell me...

115
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,696
Is something dawning on you?

116
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,397
Like always?!

117
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,499
I guess it's just a plain old mosquito bite

118
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,873
Shinichi, it seems that the investigation's
not going to see much progress for now,

120
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,375
so why don't we get going too...

121
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,377
Come on, what good is it
going to do us to head on back?

123
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,215
When Detective Agasa's got to start
explaining the truth of the case!

125
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,350
Then, you mean, don't tell me that...

126
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,987
Yeah, I've figured the case out.

127
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:32,057
I know who drowned Mr. Aramaki on this
beach and the trick he used to carry it out.

129
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,396
I'm waiting for Mitsuhiko and the others to
bring me the tools to explain about this,

131
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,497
so when they come back,

132
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:42,935
move your lips like always and match it
to my voice through the voice changer.

134
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,138
Huh? It's not here...

135
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:50,209
Oh no, I forgot the voice changer
in the hotel room...

137
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,610
Oh no.

138
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,312
Here you are...

139
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,413
Huh?

141
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,749
AGRA.

142
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,817
Just as I thought...

143
00:06:58,818 --> 00:06:59,818
Thank you.

144
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,554
It's amazing how you figured out
we were here...

146
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,025
You were taking so long to come back,

147
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,160
so I asked the person at the hotel,

148
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,530
whether there was a murder or
something that happened near the beach.

150
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,434
I'm so sorry,
you completely slipped my mind...

152
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,537
Uh, where is everybody else?

153
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,105
Oh . they're...

154
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,407
Heeeeey!

156
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,143
Conan!

157
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,711
We found it!

158
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,113
He e, a'large shell!

159
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,015
A dead starfish!

160
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,987
Here! I asked the people living around
here to lend me a basin and bucket!

162
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,257
What are you going to use all this for?

163
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,392
Just wait and see!

164
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,396
Please give me a break, will you, officer.

165
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:48,167
Just when are we going to
get to leave anyway?

167
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,501
Like I said,

168
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,972
just a little while more until Mr. Aramaki's
estimated time of death is determined.

170
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,242
Ghads! Just how long more
is it oin to take?

173
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,379
It doesn't take this long to wait for things
Iike this in detective dramas on TV!

175
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:05,184
Besides, isn't it impossible
for us to have killed him?!

177
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,121
When we called his cell phone at 8:40

178
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,491
someone answered and hung up
right away, you know.

180
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,061
You've got the call received record
for that call,

182
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,998
and all three of us were at the Chinese
restaurant of that hotel at that time

184
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,903
If you insist on suspecting us,
give us an explanation, will you!

186
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,040
How on earth was the phone

187
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:31,276
that was tangled up in the net together
with Aramaki taken from such a distance!

189
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,646
It's the waves...

190
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,481
Huh?

191
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,950
See, look!

192
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,651
That empty can...

193
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,822
Is just like Mr. Aramaki
who was washed up to shore, isn't it?

195
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,493
Mr. Aramaki was washed up to shore...

196
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,663
I see, he rolled!

197
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:58,637
Mr. Aramaki who was washed up to shore
rolled on the beach pushed by the waves!

199
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:03,275
That's so obvious! So what about it?

200
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:08,947
He rolled along and the switch of the cell
phone that was caught in the same net

202
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,917
was pushed by a shell
or something that was also in the net!

204
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,658
With the next roll, the switch was pushed
again and the phone was disconnected.

206
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,760
As proof of that,

207
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,898
the cell phone that was found together
with Mr. Aramaki was full of scratches.

209
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:31,403
The same went for his clothes and body.

210
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,838
No doubt about it!

211
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,074
The phone connected
when you called him Mr. Nezu,

213
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,644
not because someone pushed the button,

214
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,279
but because when Mr. Aramaki
rolled around,

216
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,815
the button of the cell phone just
happened to be pushed!

218
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:48,620
In other words, if the killer could predict
that the body would roll on the beach,

220
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:54,326
the killer didn't have to be here
to connect and disconnect the phone.

222
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,595
But, wasn't that just a coincidence?

223
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,396
Huh?

224
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,099
Maybe the body rolling on the beach
could've been predicted,

226
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,668
but how could the button of
the cell be pushed

228
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:05,671
at exactly the same time
that Nobutsugu happened to call him?

230
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,372
Wouldn't that have been impossible...

231
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,275
I guess so...

232
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:16,081
But, your alibi that was based on, so
the phone call is no good now...

234
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,385
If so, why don t you tell them to hurry up
and check on the estimated time of death!

236
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,289
Hello?

237
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,494
What?! You've got
the victim's estimated time of death?!

239
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:29,827
Ont!

240
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,431
Okay, great!!

241
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,398
How was it?

242
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,167
Well, you see...

243
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,305
Hey! Cut out the whispering,
but hurry and tell us!

245
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:45,010
You know now what time
Aramaki died, don't you?!

247
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,646
Yes, now we know!

248
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,582
According to Mr. Aramaki's
estimated time of death,

250
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,120
the alibis of all three of you are voided.

251
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,755
That is, all three of you
remain to be suspects!!

253
00:10:58,925 --> 00:10:59,825
WwW What?!

254
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,895
Then, when did he die!?

255
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:06,298
If*you don't tell us what you know,
how can we be convinced!

257
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,668
I got to the Chinese restaurant after 7:00!

258
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,603
Yuuta got there at 8-00 sharp!

259
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,239
And, Shinji got there around 8:40!

260
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,676
It takes 10 minutes
from here to the restaurant

262
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,114
Nobutsugu visited his father's grave
before coming to the restaurant

264
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,149
so I'm sure that somebody
from the temple saw him!

266
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:28,820
Come on! Tell us!
What time did that guy die!

268
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,824
If that time was when we couldn't be here,
we couldn't have committed the crime.

270
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,860
Not really...

271
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,997
It can be done without being here...

272
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,902
If this trick is used!

274
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,543
1 , 1 TICK... IVIT. AaSAa...

275
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,412
Just what are you doing?

276
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,481
Preparing to explain the trick...

277
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,850
as I'm sure you all can understand.

278
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,053
Tithe sand in this 'basin is...

279
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,088
of course the sand of this beach.

280
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,124
This starfish is the victim, Mr. Aramaki!

281
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,096
And the water in this bucket is
the water at high tide!

283
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,065
O.on...

284
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,335
Okay, back down everyone.

285
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,336
Okay!

286
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,139
First, you should make a hole in the sand

287
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,710
One just big enough so that the body of
a person lying down would fit inside!

289
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,814
Then, Mr. Aramaki who is drunk,
wasted and asleep

291
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,350
is placed into that hole
with a net wrapped around him.

293
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,252
Oh, Dr. Agasa.

294
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,788
Unfortunately, that won't work.

295
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,957
You want to explain that the body is
wrapped in the net so it cannot pull free,

297
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,228
then you wait for high tide and wait for
the victim to drown on his own, right?

299
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,229
But, that's impossible!

300
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,431
Because Officer Yokomizo
just finished explaining that

302
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,968
despite a high tide, there is no way
that the water would suddenly increase,

304
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:54,439
so the victim would realize
that he's drowning and would flee.

306
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,510
How about if I use this!

307
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,512
A shell 7?

308
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:05,417
You put and press this onto the victim,
then if high tide comes.

310
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,654
Hmm - I guess so...

311
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:13,091
If a person is wrapped in a net
and has something like that put on him

313
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:17,162
he wouldn't be able to escape even if
he did realized that high tide was coming.

315
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:22,801
But, if so, the large rock would've been
found on his body when he was found!

317
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,303
Was there anything like that around?

318
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,140
No, there wasn't.

319
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:33,111
Right, if it were a plain rock,
it would've just been left on him...

321
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,948
but if that weight looked
something like this shell...

323
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,885
See what happens...

324
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:43,455
It floated up!!

325
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,692
But, wait!

326
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,928
Where did you find such a large
and convenient shell...

328
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,064
D.Don't tell me!

329
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,266
It's; that.boats.!

330
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,770
Yes, the killer got Mr. Aramaki drunk...

332
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,672
MILT vwiapplily Hin up 11 uic 11,

333
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,041
he was placed inside the hole
that was dug in the sand,

335
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:06,678
and this boat was placed
on top of him as weight!

337
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,481
This way, even if he did realize
that water was covering him,

339
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,452
it would be impossible for him
to get up and he would drown!

341
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,320
After the water level
Increases even more,

343
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:19,758
the boat floats drifts away
from Mr. Aramaki...

345
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,195
You were waiting for that time to come at
the Chinese restaurant, weren't you?

347
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,930
Mr. Noboru Shimojo!!

348
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,365
And, everything worked out
as you planned!

350
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,072
H,Hey, Noboru...

351
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,407
Don't tell me you...

352
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,810
M,Mr. Shimojo, you...

353
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,313
Am I doing okay?

354
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,248
Yeah, you're doing great.

355
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,916
Just keep on matching your lips.

356
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,791
But, what about thesliquoribottle,
sandals and button that:were in the "boat.

358
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,493
With those things in the boat,

359
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,395
it would look like Mr Aramaki
were put on board the boat,

361
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,867
but no one would even think that
he was being locked up under the boat.

363
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:04,669
Moreover, the sea water that
accumulated at the bottom of the boat

365
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,471
made it even heavier.

366
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,775
(It-was all planned to make it
harder for Mr. Aramaki to escape.

368
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,409
It is true that from what you said just now,

369
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,113
it is possible to
commit the crime without being here.

371
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,682
But, how did you come to the conclusion
that I'm the one who did it?

373
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:22,821
You knew the order of the incoming call
history of his cell phone, didn't you?

375
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:26,091
That your name is listed
next to Mr. Yoshizawa's.

377
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:31,863
That's because he said that he called
before coming to the Chinese restaurant.

379
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,766
Mr. Yoshizawa came at 8:00 sharp.

380
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,703
You made the first phone call at 7:47.

381
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:42,641
How did you know that Mr. Yoshizawa
called Mr. Aramaki before you did?

383
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,743
S,So that's because...

384
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:50,515
You knew that Mr. Yoshizawa called
Mr. Aramaki's cell phone!

386
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,286
You heard the call come in

387
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,956
when you were setting up the boat trick
that I just finished explaining!

389
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,524
I See.

390
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,330
Just what are you talking about? You're
just making an irresponsible remark!

392
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,966
I mean, so you're saying
that I'm the killer

394
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,502
just because I made a mistake
in the order of the received calls list!

396
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:15,440
There's no proof that I carried out the
trick that you explained just now either!

398
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,642
It could be that somebody
just got him drunk,

400
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,346
wrapped him up in a net
and dropped him into the ocean.

402
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,316
Right, Mr. Agasa...

403
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,252
there is no proof that
Mr. Shimojo committed the murder...

405
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,222
There is no such thing.

406
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:33,091
What we have are all proof that
are advantageous to you...

408
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,492
Huh?

409
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,328
That's right!

410
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,363
The only evidence that you have now is

411
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:45,337
that I was far awayjin that Chinese
restaurant at the time the guy died!!

413
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:47,906
Who can testify that for you?

414
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,107
Huh?

415
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,710
Aren't you one of
the witnesses for that too!

417
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,479
Oh? At what point of time
are you referring to?

419
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,715
I've become a bit forgetful recently so...

420
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,850
Why you...

421
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,953
You were there too; weren't you?!

422
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,089
Right by me, at the Chinese restaurant!

423
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,458
At about 8:00 when he died!!

424
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,628
Wait a second, Mr. Shimojo?

425
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,662
Huh?

426
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:15,467
How do you know that Mr. Aramaki's
time of death is about 8:00?

428
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:20,272
I heard you whispering
among yourselves a while ago!

430
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,674
That's strange

431
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:26,011
The estimated time of death
that was reported to me,

433
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:30,682
was from 6:00 when Mr. Aramaki
was found dead to 9:00.

435
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,051
D,Don't say anything wrong!

436
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,986
I'm sure you can get
the details of his death, can't you,

438
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,856
postmortem rigidity and death spots.

439
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,691
Absolutely.

440
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,527
The estimated time of death
Is usually assumed by signs of

442
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,064
& postmortem rigidity, death spots
and rectal temperatures,

444
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:51,937
but that is, if the body is laid to rest
in one place at constant temperature.

446
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:56,041
In Mr. Aramaki's case, his body tossed
about by the waves and spun around.

448
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:02,047
Gravity
In this case, the blood accumulates at
the bottom of the body because of gravity,

451
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,182
and it becomes impossible
to judge by death spots...

453
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:08,053
The muscles that become rigid
are difficult to set in place...

455
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:11,456
Due to constant covering with waves,
the speed of rectal temperature

457
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,060
decrease becomes abnormal.

458
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:18,096
Therefore, its impossible to
estimate an accurate time of death.

460
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:24,669
In other words, nobody including the
police know what time Mr. Aramaki died.

462
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,939
But if you are the killer that set it up
so that he would drown at that time,

464
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,208
of course you would know!!

465
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,320
Noboru!

466
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:45,390
Don't tell me
you did it for our fathers...

468
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,661
Yeah... Thank me for it.

469
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:54,265
Because I conjured up all the courage
within me to kill the bastard Aramaki

472
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,568
who killed our fathers 8 years ago!!

473
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,938
8 years ago, wasn't that
an accident th "Happened

475
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:04,142
because the men set out on their boat
despite knowing that there was a storm.

477
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,047
Our fathers didn't just sail out
to prove how macho they were.

479
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,085
Aramaki ignored the report of
an oncoming storm and sailed out,

481
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,754
so our fathers went out
after him to call him back

483
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,692
Aramaki lost control of the wheels
because of the high waves,

485
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,062
and not only did he crash into
the boat of our fathers,

487
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:28,133
but also he left our fathers
who were thrown out into the sea to die,

489
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,135
and went back to shore alone!!

490
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:35,206
I asked a timid mate
that was on board his boat at that time,

492
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,508
so there's no mistake about it!!

493
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,478
Then, why didn't you take
him to the police?!

495
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,616
He disappeared out of the blue...

496
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,416
What?!

497
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:51,356
I asked Aramaki about him, and that guy,
without a tinge of guilt, wise cracked...

499
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,960
Do you know
how a perfect crime is committed?

501
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,662
You set sail with another person,

502
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,733
and when you're out at sea,
you push the other guy off the boat...

504
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:05,370
The body won't be found
and there are no witnesses either...

506
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,806
How about it? It's simple, right?

507
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,277
Which means that
Aramaki killed that man too...

509
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,981
But, you didn't need to kill him, did you?

510
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,950
Now, you're just as guilty as he is...

511
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,954
Just what do you mean by that...

512
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,024
I avenged the death of our fathers,
for you guys too, you know?!

514
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,727
After I sacrificed myself,
went out of my way to conjure up courage

516
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,464
and pass judgment on that guy
all by myself, what's your right...

518
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,834
What right do you have
talking to me like that!!

520
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,769
N,No way.

521
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,537
Ran...

522
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,176
No way...

523
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,714
The word courage is to be used to
conjure up feelings of justice...

525
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,387
It should never be used to
justify taking someone's life.

527
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,269
The killer, who was rendered speechless
at Ran"s remark,

529
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,272
was escorted silently to the
Shizuoka Prefectural Police Department.

531
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:23,214
He wore a calm and sad smile
on his face as he was being taken away.

Maybe I stuck my nose In too far...

584
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,283
Nope, you did just great.

585
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,085
You really surprised me!

586
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:11,422
I just thought that was
what Shinichi might've said.

Are you in the mood for
Iove or something?

591
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,871
Courage...

592
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,774
Is a word to be used to conjure up...

593
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,543
feelings of justice...

595
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,717

596
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,255
Nice to meet you...

597
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:50,828
Nice to meet you, too .

598
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:07,078
Um, neither your money nor
your credit cards have been stolen.

600
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,689
All the documents have to do with
the village head's work

602
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,057
and are all dated today!

603
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,159
Something bothers me...

604
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,026
Something's fishy...
