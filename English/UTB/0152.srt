Inspiration flashes piercing
through to the truth.

00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,204
Once he gets going,
nothing can stop him.

5
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,340
Today is about a strange passenger
on the bus.

7
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,508
The incident unfolds into something
beyond imagination

9
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,110
He seesgthrough the one and only truth.

10
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,912
A child in appearance with the
IQ of an adult,

12

Conan comes to the scene.

The Old Man Disappears

This is how my name is written.

00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,456
Oh, thank you so much...

Oh, not at all...

59
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:56,662
I was on my way to visit your father...

60
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,063
Is it a request for an investigation?

61
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,465
Yes...

62
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,170
Only, it's not the kind of work that can be
discussed over the phone...

64
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:04,837
Oh..._.

65
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,808
By the way, is the muromachi Hospital still
far from here?

67
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,344
Huh? Oh, you mean the bus stop.

68
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,383
It's the fourth station from here...

69
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,220

I'm the one who asked you to wake me, and
I'm waking you up instead!

82
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,088
Is it Muromachi Hospital yet?

83
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,258
Wesrve passed that station long time ago!

84
00:05:59,259 --> 00:05:59,925
What?!

85
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,826
Did the old man get off all right?

86
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,263
The old man...Uh

87
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,865
His name was Mr. Shitara...

88
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,067
Who's that?

89
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,569
The\man that was sitting next to me!

90
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,306
How should I know.
I didn't see such an 'old man.

92
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,208
That's because you were asleep, -Sonoko.

93
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,409
Don't ask me, then.

94
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,579
Maybe you were dreaming or something...

95
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:21,847
Reaming...

96
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,316
I wonder if it was a dream...

97
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,728
Ran!

98
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,465
Uh, did an old man get off
at Muromachi Stationp?

100
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:42,100
An old man who was wearing a
cap and was holding an umbrella...

102
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:46,272
I wonder...because I lot of passengers get
on and off at that bus stop...

104
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:48,274
I see...

105
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,645
So, we're home, home at last...

106
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,381
Well, do you want to stop by and grab
something to eat?

108
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,684
Hello?

109
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,019
It still bothers me...

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,052
What does?! \

111
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,354

We're going to ask around.

122
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,870
Why are you so concerned
ver that old man.

124
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,538
Something bothers me about that old man!

125
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:26,245
I'm sure I met him some place, but I can't
remember...and besides...

127
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,783
I was just on my way to visit your father...

128
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,920
It seems he wanted{to ask Dad for an
Investigation.

130
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,756
How about over there, then?

131
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,859
Beika Newspaper Agency?

132
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,928
Beyond that

133
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,200
r. Jukicni shitara...

134
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,936
He doesn't seem to be here.

135
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,004
He's not here?!

136
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,808
{ No, his name is not listed among the
out-patient list or the in-patient.

138
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,042
Oh I see...

139
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,914
How strange, though... ..He said he was
going to the hospital, right?That old man.

141
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,917
I think so...lwonder if he just came to see
somebody who is hospitalized here...

143
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,552
No, I don't think so.

144
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,724
The name Mr. Shitara'is not
on the list of visitors either...

146
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,326
You're being over anxious.

147
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,430
If he wants to see your dad, I'm sure
he'll call in tomorrow...

149
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,865
I guess so...

150
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,533
It's got to be.

151
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,570
If not, the old man never existed
in the first place.

153
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,805
Oh, so you don't believe me after all!

154
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,246
An old man disappeared?

155
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,648
That's all I can think of.

156
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,486
Sonoko thinks it's just my imagination,
but something bothers me...

158
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,989
I wonden'if« ou could ask Inspector Megure
o look for the old man...

160
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,793
guess not...

161
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:51,730
Of course not! You're probably just
imagining things or were dreaming

163
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,603
I wonder if it was a dream after all...

164
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,106
An MO disc...?

165
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,409
What's this?

166
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,448
I wonder what it is...? ll don't remember
uying anything like this...

168
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,850
It could be that old man's.

169
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,454
But... Why... .??

Hmm...it'll take some time...But,
aren't you bin a rush?

186
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:52,224
Is\m thinking of visiting the company of the
bus that I rode this afternoon from now.

188
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,561
E might be able to get some more clues.

189
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:00,731
Okay. I'll contact you when
I get to open the file.

191
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:01,500
Okay!

Oh, is that night. Thank you very much

196
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,248
Everything's-okay. The company told me that
the bus is still running its course.

198
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,683
Okay let's go!

199
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,318
Wait up, will you!

200
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:23,255
Why in the name of earth do I have;to get
involved in this?"

202
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,992
Because. .Conan said that
you should be with me

204
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,595
to compensate for my vague memory...

205
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,364
So, it's you after all.

206
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,033
Please help me, Sonoko.

207
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,438
Ghads! I just took a shower
and was feeling refreshed...

209
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,351
What's with that car...

210
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:56,188
Hey, Conan! Looks straight ahead!
It's dangerous.

212
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,023
Ran, that car...

213
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,296
There's nothing. Now, look ahead.

214
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,075
Like I said this afternoon,

215
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,012
I don't remember a thing
bout the old man...

217
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,151
Something may be left where
the old man was sitting.

219
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,286
True!

220
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:30,055
Hey! This isn't the same bus.

221
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:36,028
That bus was not functioning too well, so
it's under maintenance now

223
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,997
Let's go! Ran!!

224
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,067
It must've been, about you girls?

225
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,034
What?

226
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:48,640
Well, I was asked where a girl named Mouri
who was on the bus, got off...

228
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,843
NO! What does that mean? Creepy...

229
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,946
What kind of person was
the one who asked you that?

231
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,683
What kind of person... well,
he was wearing a coat and sunglasses...

234
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,819
Oh no!

235
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,153
Oh, no!

236
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,094
1, That person...

237
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,762
Do you know him?

238
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,230
But, why...?

239
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,200
Let's hurry, Ran!

240
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,605
The old man who disappeared!
A top secret MO...

242
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,773
The man who is wearing sunglasses...

243
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,643
Something...Something smells fishy!!

244
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,010
Please wait here.

245
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,947
Wait, mister!

246
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,118
Hey, hey, you can't come in!

247
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,186
I'm sorry, I forgot something on the bus!

248
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,521
Over there, Conan!

249
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,522
H,Hey...

250
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,824
No doubt about it. It's here.

251
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,995
I sat here, and the old man sat next to me.

252
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,363
Do you remember anything else?

253
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,734
Hat's right! His name...

254
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,601
IS Name...

255
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,904
Right, he wrote his name on
the window back then,

257
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:30,308
because the window was
cloudy Like this, with his fingers...

259
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,645
But, it's gone already...

260
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,284
It wasn't a dream after all.

261
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:44,122
What's going on...? I have no idea
what is going on...

263
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,193
Hello...

264
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,930
Huh?!You figured out the password!!

265
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah ..and about the contents of the disc...

266
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,303
This is double accounting...

267
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,005
Double accounting?!

268
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,774
You know the company Beika
Construction Company, don't you? O

270
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:07,112
It's something that was taken out of their
accounting department.

272
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,949
It has a dummy account book, and an
account book that corresponds to that

274
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,518
which shows all the bribes given to
politicians and all...1

276
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,887
The names of all the corrupted assembly
men that had transactions dealing with

278
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,856
the general assembly, meeting of
stockholders are also listed.

280
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,359
I see...

281
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,497
The old man was sought after because
he had the double account book on him

283
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:30,702
Y,Yes. . But I thought
they finally got to me...

285
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:38,076
The man wearing sunglasses was not
after me, but rather, after the old man

287
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,980
Yep. That's why the old man who realized
that he was being tailed,

289
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,783
put this MO into your purse

290
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:49,054
Yes, and also because he knew that I was
Kogoro Mouri's daughter...

292
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,356
We've got=to find the old man!

293
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:51,823
Find him...But,

294
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:52,290
Find him...But,

295
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,058
Find him...But,

296
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:56,328
we have no idea where he is
after he got off the bus

298
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:57,395
The newspaper agency!

299
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,967
He went to thexnewspaper agency after
Ieaving the double account book with me!

301
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,168
I see!

303
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,004
Try and remember...

304
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,074
The man who was wearing
sunglasses asked

306
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,476
the bus driver about
you and Sonoko, right?

308
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,748
Which means he found out that the old man
didn't have the double account book!!

310
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:22,154
That's why he was looking for Ran who
was sitting next to him on the bus!!

312
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,688
Yes, in other words...

313
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:28,059
The old man was captured by the man
wearing sunglasses?!

315
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,196
Ran, call Pops and Inspector Megure!

316
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,764
Agh! Where are you going?

317
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,467
I'm going to loo 'around the area
that the old man got off!!

319
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:36,568
I'll 'go too.

320
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,102
No!!

321
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,940
Since they are after you, stay at the bus
company, wait here!

323
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,774
O Okay...!

326
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,626
Excuse me, may I use your phone?

327
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,994
Go ahead.

328
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,265
Uh... . my telephone card

329
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:09,301
Will you hold this for me?

330
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,168
Okay.

331
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:22,214
No, that's not it, Dad...

332
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:25,350
Are you listening to me?!
Donst sleep on me!

334
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,586
Yes, I'm listening, I'm listening.

335
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,086
8 dye /
fleas

337
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,089
Ghads, how can he be like
that at a time like this!

339
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,791
Well, is he coming right away?

340
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,194
I can't get through to him at all...!
I'm calling Inspector Megure!

342
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,769
It's pretty good for something
that was bought at the outlet.

344
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,358
OO Oh, no,...

345
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,764
Yes, that's right I'm at the Heian Bus
Company right now.

347
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,499
B, Bad news!

348
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,002
The other girl's been kidnapped!!

349
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:20,572
Shinichi, it's me,

350
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:20,839
Shinichi, it's me,

351
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,673
Shinichi, it's me

352
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,508
What's up, Doc?

353
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:28,079
Ran just called saying that
Sonoko's been kidnapped!!

355
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,247
What?!

356
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,717
The kidnapper's car seems to have gone
to the left after leaving the bus company!!

358
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,587
Left, which means the other way!!

359
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,555
Driver, please make a U-turn!!

360
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,663
Hey, you're late...

361
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:47,799
Sorry, it took me some time to get to her...

362
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,008
Strange...! We shonld have overtook the
kidnapper's car by now!!

364
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,779
On one side of this road is
the fence of factory...

366
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,882
Which means they made a left
turn somewhere!!

368
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,983
Driver, please turn right, over there!!

369
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,025
Does this road lead out somewhere?

370
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:17,562
No, beyond here is a warehouse area,
Nd It's a dead end...

372
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,998
Using this road as a
short-cut, wouldn't do any good,

374
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,900
because you'd have to go all the
way around anyway!

376
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:26,004
Which means that Sonoko is
omewhere nearby...

378
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,416
Beika Construction Company, eh...

379
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:53,565
Wait a sec...The one who's going to be
in trouble when the double accounting book

381
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,700
IS publicized is not only the Beika
onstruction Company.

383
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,636
All the companies that had been behind the
curtain dealings are involved...

385
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,309
Doc!! Is there a place called Ryujin
Economics Research Lab

387
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,111

Thanks: Doc. Aa

398
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,156

399
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,793

400
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:23,795

00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,098

00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,738
Go again and get her!!

405
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,507
O,Okay, boss...

406
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,614
Don't goof it this time now!

00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,384
Yeah, okay
What're we going to do with them?

409
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,154

00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,956

You brat!

417
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,710
The two men turned out to be bad men
who had dealings behind

419
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,214
the curtains with
Beika Construction Company

421
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,384
And, Mr. Jukichi Shitara
who and been an executive

423
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,954
of the Beika Construction Company
for a long time,

425
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:59,557
after pondering decided to take the double
accounting book out of the company .

427
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,897

433
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,150
The following day,

I still think I've seen that old man
somewhere...

482
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,810
You still can't remember, Ran?

483
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,745
Uh-huh...

484
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,983
That old man was an executive of the Beika
Construction Company:

486
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,419
so*maybe you saw
him in the papers or on television? -

488
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,855

Thanki cum,»-

493
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,602
I wonder if I'm making a mistake after all?

494
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,172
No, No...
You're not making a mistake...

496
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:30,708

Gramps!

498
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,748
Mr. Jukichi Shitara was a patron of
the coffee shop

500
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:41,286
that is located below the
Mourn Detective Agency...

502
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,029
What's the matter, Ran?

503
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,967
I have a feeling I saw that person...
with the glasses somewhere.

505
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,003
What?!

506
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,576
