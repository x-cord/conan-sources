whose whereabouts became unknown...

41
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,523
But, while listening to their story
I found out that

43
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:10,629
Mr. Itakura once had contact with
the Black Organization!

45
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,735
We somehow located the hotel where
r. a ura was I(- mg. an<- wen \ere.

47
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,272
But it turned out that
he was already dead!

49
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,781
I see...Mr Itakura was most likely
made to sit in a chair and tied

51
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,018
with both arms at his chest.

52
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,586
Therefore, it was deliberately set up

53
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,755
so that he couldn't drink the
medicine he was supposed to drink...

55
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,424
Then, don't tell me that this is...

56
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:44,563
Yeah...the specialty of our profession...

H.Hey. why do we have to be suspected?

00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:10,189
We the ones who asked Kogoro Mouri to
Iook for Mr. Itakura, you know!

71
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,359
What stupid killer would come
back to the scene of a crime

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,528
and bring a detective along!

74
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,197
I guess so...

76
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,201
If you insist on suspecting us
why don't you show evidence!

78
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,336
Evidence that we came here!!

79
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,472
Okay, the time's now!

80
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:31,543
If so, why don't you look at the
diary in the bag?

82
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,480
That's his, isn't it?

83
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:40,086
Maybe we can find out who came
to visit him before we got here!

85
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,356
It's truefthat diary is written on it but...

86
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,894
Officer Takagi, how do you look at this?

87
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,831
It can easily be viewed with the
Iap top computer on the desk.

89
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:58,237
But, if I were the killer, I would've gotten
rid of something like that long time ago...

91
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,444
This is it...

92
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:11,050
a Ura seems oO nave YRC a clary
everyday since 5-years ago...

95
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:15,588
Which means...It's in there, I'm sure!

96
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:20,391
The day two years ago when Tequila
came to see him should be there!

98
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:24,129

The hotel employee said
something strange today.

106
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:36,408
Maybe one of the three found
out what room he's in?

108
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:41,213
Oh well, all we've got to do is
change hotels then.

110
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,552
You three are suspicious after all...

111
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,891
Isn't there a continuation to that diary?

112
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,492
No, there's none.

113
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,496
Then, then, I'll go put it back
where it was.

115
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,365
OO. Oh. okay...

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,100
All right!

117
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,301
All right!

120
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,170
Huh

121
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,572
We'll pass it on to the forensic officers
just to be on the safe side.

123
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,640
I agree.

124
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,508
Shoots!

125
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,444
If the police take it with them, I
won't ever get to see it again!!

127
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,114
I've got to find the killer among
the three as soon a possible and

129
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:19,118
prove that the diary has nothing
to do with the murder...

131
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,790
Cool head...I'm sure that
something-is been overlooked...

133
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,460
That is, the clue to who the killer is...

134
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,528
Excuse me, Inspector.

136
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,931
What is it?

137
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,867
About the right ankle of the corpse...

138
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:39,371
Traces of his socks are left as
seen by congested blood on his

140
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,676
Ieft leg, but, see...no traces are
Ieft on his right leg...

143
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,413
On the other hand, on his right ankle,
there are traces of what look to

145
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,616
be scratch marks that seem to have been
made by the toe nail of his left feet...

147
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:55,688
Which means that Mr. Itakura tried to
take the socks off from his right leg...

149
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,158
But why

150
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:08,234
was he tied up in a place like this,
and why did he take off his socks .

154
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:18,110
I see, he did so to leave this behind...

155
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:21,947
No doubt about it!
That person's the killer!

157
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:28,354
Moreover, if I use this 10 my advantage,
I can even get a hold ofuthe diary too...

159
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,358
Okay, coroner...

160
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,561
Take care of the autopsy, okay.

161
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,696
Yes,

162
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:41,700
Officer Takagi, go and give the diary of
the victim to the forensic officer.

165
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,441

Mr Itakura to make the game software

167
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,844
and found Mr. Itakura's corpse .

168
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,314
The three of you who're all
employees of the same game company...

170
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:59,051
We're not from the same company!
We're all from different companies!

172
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,987
I am Sugai who asked him to
make an Igo software!

174
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,189
I'm Naito who asked him to
make a Chess software...

176
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,927
I'm Souma! I ordered a Shogi Software!

177
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,931
Please let us go already. We
just happened to be brought here

179
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:17,736
to this room by Mr. Mouri who
Iocated where Mr. Itakura was...

181
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,943
Inspector, what about me?

182
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:30,816
I.--:-We know now that Mr. Ita
had been killed by someone,

184
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:35,354
but we don't have all the
evidence to specify the killer

186
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,023
I would like the Mouri group
and all of you

188
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,493
to come over to the station
at a later date...

190
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:45,497
Oh great! I was concerned
about whether the drama

192
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:49,768
that I've been recording was
being recorded right...

194
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,438
So. I guess I'll do as you say for
now and...

196
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,306
No, I can't afford to leave just like that.

198
00:07:56,443 --> 00:08:01,513
Oh, no, I mean, well... who was that?

199
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,983
I'm saying that we can't let the
suspects leave this place!

201
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,055
Aheen!

202
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:15,394
Because the killer is rejoicing
with both arms open

205
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,597
in front of our very eyes,

206
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,601

00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,572
H.,Hey, Dad!

211
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,741
How rude!

212
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:32,978
Shape up, mister!

213
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,816
Saying all you did Mr. Mouri, I
hope you know...

215
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,820
who killed Mr. Itakura!!

216
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,824
Yes...Mr. Itakura himself told me...

217
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,494
Huh?

218
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:54,099
Hey, hey, don't tell me that you
heard the voice of the corpse .

221
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,034
His ankle

222
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,370
Huh

223
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,306
You saw it too, didn't you, Inspector?

224
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:05,577
Only the Mr. Itakura's right ankle had
no traces of socks being worn...

226
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:12,251
That's because the killer who came back
to this room after Mr. Itakura died,

228
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:16,255
thought that just one foot
wearing a sock would look unnatural

230
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,457
and put it back on him...

231
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,730
Why did Mr. Itakura have to be
barefooted...?

233
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,598
Why 2!

234
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,802
T's because unless he is
barefooted he couldn't grab

236
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,005
a certain thing or order of something...

237
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,941
Grab. .grab what. ?

238
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:41,013
Don't tell me...

239
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,952
Yes...Mr Itakura used the time he had
till his heart medicine wore out

241
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:50,889
and wrote the following on his right leg...

242
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:58,630
A dying message that
indicates who the killer is!!

244
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,539
1, This is his dying message!

245
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:13,412
What on earth is written? It looks nothing
more than an incomplete game of igo...

247
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,814
Okay, then, please help me Inspector,

248
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:19,284
so that I can explain it
simply and clearly...

250
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,555
Officer Takagi! Please give the
disc with the diary inside and

252
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:29,161
the unopened disc that was in
Mr Itakura's bag to the Inspector!

254
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,229
Oh, yes sir!

255
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,902
When you receivejthem, please sit at
the desk where the lap top computer is.

257
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:37,336
Hmm.

259
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,778
B.But what does this have to do
with the dying message?

262
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,384
I'll explain later... Will you please
boot up the computer first of all...

264
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,189
B Boot up ™?...

265
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,862
BB... Boot... up...

266
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,103
Boot...up...

267
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:12,404
Boot..up...

268
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,874
Bufiootmup...

269
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:22,014
In, Inspector to boot means to
start the computer.

271
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,085
Ha, ha, ha, only joking, just a joke...

272
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:32,157
Next, move the data of the diary
onto the desk top, and

274
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,826
put that into the empty disc

275
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:38,564
Open it... "Move it...and put it in...

276
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:43,368
Oh, so all you.have to do is copy the/data
of the di into the empty disc!

278
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,771
Like so...

279
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,647
Hey, Mr. Mouri, don't tell me that
you're doing this to make fun of

281
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,317
me not being digital minded...

282
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,787
And then finally, please turn the
computer off.

284
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,990
Phooey, that, even I can do...

285
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:05,856
Hmm?

286
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,358
Hmm?

287
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,926
Hmm?

288
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,260
What's the matter?

289
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,862
Oh, that's...

290
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,265
Don't help him Officer Takagi.

291
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,133
Agh .

292
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:19,938
Ugh! These electronic goods, I tell you...

293
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,342
You do this, and they all switch off!

295
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,548
You shouldn't pull the plug out
abruptly like that!!

297
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,819
Doing so may.destroy the data
within the computer or cause damage!

299
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,090
But, it didn't switch off even if I
pushed the switch...

301
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,792
For safety reasons it's made so
that you have to push the button

303
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,729
for a while before the computer
switches off.

305
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,063
Right...

306
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:50,402
That is a prohibited strategy that
computer users should not do...

308
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:55,741
And words like "boot" and open
are terms that are incomprehensible

310
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,677
unless the person uses the
computer on a daily basis...

312
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:05,350
You've already figured out what's
written on that Igo board, haven't.you...?

314
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:12,290
Do you understand?

316
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:14,159
Huh

317
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,163
Isn't there something strange
about this Igo stone?

319
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:18,697
Huh?

320
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:20,298
What's strange about it?

321
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,701
Because when playing Igo

322
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,904
if you surround you opponent's
stone, you've got to take it,

324
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,374
and to leave a stone surrounded
IS prohibited strategy!

326
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,310
P.Prohibited strategy?!

327
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,514
There is some meaning to this
Igo stone after all...

329
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,183
But, what could it be...

330
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,454
Okay, while everyone iJaistracted

331
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,823
with their attention on the Igo stone,

332
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,225
I'll take out the disc
with the copy of the diary...

334
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,860
What are you doing, Conan?

335
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,797
RR. Ran...

336
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,466
Hey, didn't you hide something just now?

337
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,135
II didn't hide anything...

338
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,737
What are you doing then?

339
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:02,474
1.1 though they sort of looked like
Igo stones

341
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,745
The strange patterns on the seals
that are pasted onto the keyboard

344
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,613
Huh

346
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,817
Patterns? Isn't this Braille?

348
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:15,787
Come to think of it, Mr. Itakura's vision,
just like me was getting pretty bad,

350
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:20,092
so he told me he was learning Braille.

351
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,227
Braille...

352
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,032
I get it! So this is what Mr. Mouri
was referring to when he said,

354
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:31,036
words that only people who know can
understand." This Braille here...

357
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,972
What do you think?

358
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,311
N.No...There is no form of Braille
that looks like this .

360
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:43,048
Oh, but if you ignore the white
stones it's readable...

364
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:52,390
The killer is...
Souma...

368
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,331
The evidence is the watch...

369
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,500
MM. Mr. Souma...

370
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,035
No!...Are you the killer?

371
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,706
Y how come it turns out like

372
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:11,243
Maybe somebody's trying to
frame me or something

374
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,178
No, you're the killer!

375
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,648
The reason is because you don't
know about Igo nor Braille!

377
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,118
Therefore, the killer is the one
who still has conclusive evidence

379
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,521
on him, that's you, Mr. Souma...

380
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,322
W,Wait a minute. Mr. Mourn...

381
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:29,594
Please don't talk so fast and explain
things in order as you usually do.

383
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,464
The reason why he's the killer and
the evidence that shows he is...

385
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,568
Don't rush things...Cool head...

386
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,671
The copy of the diary is already
In my hands .

388
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,075
Cool head...Cool head...

389
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,611
Whew

390
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,216
Right! When Mr. Itakura left this dying
message

392
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,419
this is probably what he thought...

393
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,857
That the killer would return
to this room for sure

395
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:03,361
after he died in order to undo the
masking tape that is wrapped up in!...

397
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,898
That's why he used this code that

398
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,367
Mr. Souma wouldn't be able to
read or even suspect...

400
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,271
And besides, if his corpse is found,

401
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,107
you three would be questioned
by the police and

403
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:19,811
it is certain that you will be shown
the picture of&this Igo Board!!

405
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:26,284
He figured that Mr. Naito whose
vision is bad enough to have to

407
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:30,055
trace the Braille in the elevator,
would read the Braille code

409
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,691
and that Mr. Sugai who asked
him to make the Igo software

411
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:35,694
would! think the prohibited
strategy strange,

413
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:39,231
and that he would realize that
this is some kind of code.

415
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,600
1.0 see.

416
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,169
And the watch which is the evidence is.

417
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,206
The watch"that Mr. Souma still
has on him

423
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:55,747
Mr. Itakura disappeared and confined
himself to this room a week ago

425
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,283
Mr. Itakura is really finic « when
it comes to watches

427
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,185
and has bad vision...

428
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,722
When you first came into this room,

429
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:07,158
I'm sure Mr. Itakura naturally
took it and looked at it!

431
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:12,230
The wristwatch that is your pride
and joy!!

433
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,935
I see! If his fingerprints are on the
wristwatch that would be evidence!

435
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,704
Yeah... Mr Itakura who has
turned corpse

437
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,274
and meets his killer again after a week,

438
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:27,579
could not have touched Mr. Souma's
watch that was bought 5 days ago...

441
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:34,052
Okay; Mr. Soma, could we have
the forensic officers

443
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,788
check your wristwatch then?

444
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,759
Yeah, go on and check it.

445
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,429
I'm sure that his prints will be
found all over the place.

447
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,769
I put a sleeping drug into his wine while
he was absorbed in this wristwatch,

449
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,707
put him to sleep and wrapped
him tightly with masking tape .

451
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,047
20 years ago, when he was a
no-name game creator and

453
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,483
I was a green-horn that just
entered the game company,

455
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:10,322
we were shogi pals who used to
o to play shogi together.

457
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,358
We used to talk a lot while
rinking together...

459
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,096
And we talked of making
a shogi software

461
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,166
that would outdo the masters of shogi
when we became big shots

463
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,503
But three days ago. when I finally
found where he was,

465
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,240
he said to me as
I walked into his room.

467
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,143
How many times do you think we should
allow a person to call wait?

469
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,378
Oh boy,

470
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,849
what a laugh, don't you think?

471
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,118
I collected cash from the master
play games

473
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,953
and kept sending it to him for 20 years.

474
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:45,522
And all I had to go on were his
words, "The time is ripe.

476
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:48,727
I went into a great amount of
debt investing in him too.

478
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,363
And yet, he has the nerve to say,

479
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,732
wait to a real master of shogi software

480
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,601
that was supposed to have been
completed...

482
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,739
I told him I was going to get some wine
to energize him and left the room.

484
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,443
I bought some sleeping drug and
masking tape along with the wine.

486
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:12,183
I didn't refuse your offer to make
Kogoro Mouri search for him

488
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,154
because I wanted to avoid being
suspected even slightly later.

490
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,524
After all, I used to talk stink about
Itakura at the company a lot

492
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,594
because he wouldn't get to
making the shogi software

494
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,897
but became famous as a
computer graphics designer

496
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:32,103
But, 20 years was much too
Iong a wait for both of us...

498
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:38,910
Being apart changes people...
Their hearts, their dreams...everything...

500
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,415
If I can call wait to life,

501
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,251
I'd like to go back to 20 years ago...

502
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:54,358
To the time... when we both held
the same dream...

00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,552
I still have some things to talk over
with this:groggy father of yours here

549
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,487
so if. you're going home hail a

551
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,390
No. because:it only takes about
30 minutes to walk home from here...

553
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,893
Bye-bye, Inspector!

554

I have it...it's right here...

In my pocket, the clue to the
Men in Black!!

557

Now all I have to do is go over to Doc's

Conan?

560
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,669
I wonder if people change...

561
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:23,575
If they're apart... will their
elings change...

563
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:30,147
It's kind of tough

564
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,750

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,758
I think he's just the way you
picture him to be, Ran!

568
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,195
So. I don't think you have to
worry about him at all...

570
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:49,434
It would really be nice if you
were Shinichi, Conan...
