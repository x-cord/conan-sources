Good grief, take a closer look!

24
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,866
Can't you read?
It says Kyogoku Makoto.

26
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:15,601
I was just kidding!

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,304
Isn't this the tea cup you
made in thefj'p'ottery class

29
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,239
you've started going to?

30
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,273
For goodness sakes .

31
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,641
But Sonoko .

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,478
Are you going to give this to him?

33
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:27,213
Isn t this a little small?

34
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,549

35
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,119

It's huge"

38
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,727
But why's your name on it?

39
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,496
The answer's so"obvious!

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,465
The man I loveais in a
country far, far away...

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,368
The. Only way I can make him remember me 'is

43
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:52,271
through those far. spaced
telephone calls

45
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,375
And that"s Where
this tea cup handrfi'éde by

47
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,277
Sonoko comes in!

48
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,147
He won't be able to forget me with this.
Now will he 2

50
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,448
But Sonoko,

51
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,683
didn't you send him
a sweater before?

53
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,452
The one you bought at the store...

54
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,487
Oh...thét. I changed my mind-av

55
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,155
Huh?

56
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,824
You were right Ran.
NS not fight to cheat.

58
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,592
And besides. no matter how hard
I work on a sweater,

60
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,928
he can only use it in the winter...

61
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:19,031
But take a tea cup.
He can use it every day, right?

63
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:20,499
Well, that's true

64
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,869
Besides, I guess I'm worried...

65
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,239
Makoto's very kind.
I'm afraid some gi'rl-will

67
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,542
' come along and
take advantage of'him...

69
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:30,876
For instance...

70
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,146
there could be a lonely widow who's
Just lost her beloved husband

72
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,749
and Makoto says something kind
to comfort her

74
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,452
and she ends up stalking him...

75
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,625
What a cruel person...

76
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,562
To widow such a beautiful
woman as yourself

78
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,665
order to pay for his sins...

79
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,302
Young detective...

80
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:04,944
My lady...

81
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,114
If it pleases you.
You may cry inside my arms...

83
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,060
No, you mustn't...

84
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:25,463
But young detective. ..I...l...

00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,326
When What was that sound just now?

264
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,028
Didn'hit come
from the storage mom?

266
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,263
I'm going to go have a look.

267
00:09:58,832 --> 00:09:59,198
Okay...

268
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:05,938
I just want you to know.
If you 'look at it,

270
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,505
we're no longer friends'

271
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,707
Oh all right...

272
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,284
Mr Minol?

273
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,389
Oh. uh ..my hand slipped
and I dropped a plate...

275
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,061
Thanks. would you mind
finishing 'Up here?

277
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,195
Of course not.

278
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,540
Ouch!

279
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,276
Is something wrong?

280
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,180
It seems like something
was mixed in with the soil...

282
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,883
I guess it was a piece of
the plate I cracked

284
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,484
it must've been on my clothes

285
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,754
I'll go get the first aid kit!

286
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,523
Do you know where New

287
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,391
Why yes, it's on the upper/night Shelf

288
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,026
in the storage. room!

289
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,496
Then bring it right away...

290
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,369
Ohdfi'flgdodness sakes...

292
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,638
to a potter. hands are
most important...

294
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,040
Is there something on my face?

295
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:17,442
No, it's nothing- .

296
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,746
By the way. I haven't
seen M0100 around...

298
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,948
Now that you mention it.
Neither have I

300
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,018
Hey, Motoo!!

301
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,152
Memo!

302
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,255
He wasn't by the kilns eithen...

303
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:31,790
How strange

304
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,560
This storage room's
the only place we haven't looked...

306
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,696
Hejwouldmt be in here. t

307
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,066
The only plac'e you could
hide in here is in that cabinet

309
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,704
Besides,
I'opened it just a little while ago

311
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,372
to get the first aid kit
and he wasn't inside...

313
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,176
The cabinet

314
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,413
a Biece of cloth...is sticking out
from under the cabinet dbor.

316
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,851
Isn't it one of the aprons
you use in class?

318
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,755
You're, right. . .'it's the sam'é pattern
as the ones we're weaning...

320
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,591
Good grief. this is like the ostrich

321
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,225
hiding it's head but leaving
its body in plain sight,

323
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,861
come on out; the gamefls oven!

324
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:10,696
M'otoo

325
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,163
Ibw AA

326
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:12,130
I1lopenit

327
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,753
Mo. Motool? What's wrong. Motoo?
Motool? Motool?

329
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:35,687
Snap out of it!!

330
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,255
Wake up. Motom'?

331
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,758
Someone call an amb'YIance, quick!

332
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,692
All right

333
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,162
And I think it'd be better
to call the police too...

335
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:46,398
Hurry!!!

336
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:46,965
Yes sir!

337
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,174
Motoo! Motoo!

338
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,981
The strangulation victim is Motoo Mino,

339
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,750
31 years old, a white collar worker...

340
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:08,887
Was he a student of this
pottery makingaclass too?

342
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,090
No, he lived-here.

343
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,094
He was married to my daughter
who died 2 years ago.

345
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,196
I see . my condolences

346
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:23,235
My name is Muneyuki Mino.
I run this pottery making class.

348
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,571
She's my assistant, Kikuyo Kasama.

349
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,741
Plgfise'tell me what the victim did
after he got home...

351
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,178
He got-home around 5 PM
as usual, then he said

353
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,747
he was going "to change into an apron

354
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,985
and help me in the class...
but some time passed and

356
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,521
he still hadn't
shown up so we all went to look for him,

358
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,356
isn't that right. Kikuyo?

359
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,525
Yes...

360
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:50,595
this storage room was the only place
we hadn't looked...

362
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,497
and then Mr Mino
opened the {cabinet...

364
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,070
And his body .
Motoo's body...oh...

366
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,140
, INS émaz'ing- that you found him there,

367
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,975
you weren't playing hide and seek,

368
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,911
who would've thought
a person would be inside there...

370
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,880
It was so obvious!
The apr6n was sticking out!

372
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,082
Isn't that right, Ran?

375
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,451
Apron?

376
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,588
It was sticking out!
Part of the apron he was

378
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,524
wearin'giwas sticking out
from under the door!

380
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,127
Do you know how long
it was like that?

382
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,962
No, I don't...

383
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,998
I remember now...
it wasn't sticking out

385
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,468
when we were
d fining up the broken plate!

387
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,269
What do you mean?

388
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,741
I accidentally dropped a plate
in front of that cabinet...

390
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,043
the students heard
the sound and came running,

392
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,878
I asked t 'é'mito clean it up for me.

393
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,949
I gugss I dropped it right after
Motoo left the storage room

395
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,451
after changing into.his apron...

396
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,755
Eh? You and the victim were
in here together?

398
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,626
Yes...the aprons are kept
in this cabinet...

400
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,163
that's why he always changed in here.

401
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,066
See. his jacket's
hanging ri'g'ht over there.

403
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,737
There's several overalls
hanging next to his jacket.

405
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,838
What are these'?

406
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,608
Those are also for the students' use!

407
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,676
When making large pots and such,

408
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,513
an apronfiiSn't big enough
to" protect their clothing...

410
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,782
I see...but I wonder

411
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,750
what the victim was doing in here?

412
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,520
Actually, while I wag looking for Kikuyo,

413
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,456
I hfi'ppened to finfl W'ér herewith Motoo.

414
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:25,690
IS that true?

415
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,525
Well, yes.

416
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,296
I was helping Him change.
Then Mr. Mine came in and

418
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,964
he asked me to look after the class

419
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,266
because he was going to the kiln.

420
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,568
And then what did you do?

421
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,937
I did as I was told.
I went back to the classroom...

423
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,107
And so Mr. Mina,

424
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,810
you were hef'e'with the victim alone,

425
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,677
is that correct?

426
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,979
Now-"wait just a minute, officer!

427
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,183
You're not implying that
I killed him, are you?

429
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,584
Like I already told you,

430
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:56,955
Motoo left the room
BEFORE, broke the plate!

432
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,158
If I'd killed him and} hid his
body~in the cabinet,

434
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,228
5 the Students would have
noticed the apron sticking out

436
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,865
from under the dodr when
they were cleaning up!

438
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:11,036
Perhaps the apron got stuck
when you came back

440
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:15,740
and Cheék'edbthe'bod'y'after
the students had finished cleaning up.

442
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,843
I don't think so!

443
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,112
While we were cleaning up.
Mr Mino went to the kiln,

445
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,716
and when we finished cleaning up
and Went back to the classroom,

447
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,919
Mr Mine was already there

448
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:33,525
After that. he was always beside
Conan working on something.

450
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,227
Isn't that right, OOnan?

451
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:37,729
Conan?

452
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,631
Uh, yes...

453
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:44,769
Mr. Mino was with us the whole time
until we found Motoo's body,

455
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,439
he couldn't possibly have
put the body in the cabinet.

457
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,976
I see...
So it must have gone like this,

459
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,678
after youuall had cleaned
up the broken fil'ate,

461
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,315
the killé'hcalledsthe victim
to this storage room and killed him,

463
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:00,785
or. the murder could have
taken place somewhere else

465
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,289
and the body brought back
hege when noone was looking

467
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,894
I just remembered! Maybe Kikuyo
saw the killer's face...

470
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:12,998
I cut my finger while I was working and

471
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:17,502
and Kikuyo came to the storage room
to getnthe first aid kit.

473
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,172
That was just before we began
our search for Motoo

475
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,541
so I just thought that maybe...

476
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,844
Did you see anyone? \

477
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,212
No, no one...

478
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,915
Where is the first aid kit kept?

479
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,951
On the upper right shelf of that cabinet.

480
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,387
What so you're saying
you opened the cabinet?

482
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,589
Yes-fl did but there was nobody inside...

483
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:39,891
That's the truth

484
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,295
Inspector!
After examining the victim's neck,

486
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:46,765
I've determined
the victim was strangled

488
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,066
with this necktie
we found around his neck.

490
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,303
Hmm. but that is strange...

491
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,739
Why did the killer tie
the necktie around the neck?

493
00:17:55,474 --> 00:18:01,279
How awful. Kikuyo gave that
necktie to him for his birthday...

495
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,214
I, I didn't (givé that (cs-him!

496
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,820
You didn't?
He told me you did though...

498
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,422
What is the meaning of this?

499
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,992
Well. uh...he said he didn't know
where it came from,

501
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,928
he found it in his bag
along with 251 birthday card.

503
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,897
He really believed it was from me,

504
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,967
he thought I was
just too shy to admit it

506
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,169
Now that you mention it, he was

507
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:28,006
mumbling something when he
walked out of the storage room.

509
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:28,974
Huh?

510
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,043
Something about money
turning peop'le in'to monsters

512
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,079
and that his birthday- had just come but

513
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:38,350
he would be eaten by a monster...

514
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,385
Eaten by a monster?

515
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,923
Truth is. officer.
I want to tell you about that...

517
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,765
All right Takagl.
Check up on that right away!

519
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:54,399
Yes sir!

520
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,570
Uh. excuse me.
Do you have-Ha" pen or something?

522
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,005
Mine's run out of ink...

523
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,206
6? course .

524
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:06,044
I'll go get one!
I'm sure there's some in the classroom

526
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,059
Aren't those scissbrs?

528
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,864
FiLdn't the man from the crime lab
ask for a pen?

530
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, yes...you're so right

531
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,371
And will you take a look at that.
/ that's my cup! It's almost finished!

533
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,206
See?

534
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,344
Oh...you really like pottery making.
Don't you?

536
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,079
Yup I love lt

537
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,482
Besudes\
I want- to finish this upibecause

539
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,583
I don't want to be like
that man who died

541
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,985
and leave things.half£'aone!

542
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,054
Half done?

543
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,122
You mean you didnit notice?

544
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,193
His shirt sleeves were rolled up
but the length was different!

546
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,862
You know what it looks like?

547
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,731
It 'I'do'ks like he was attacked
whlle he was

549
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,301
chai'n'ging into his apron and
helping I'n class.

551
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:09,441
B. but young man.
Maybeqon'e sleeve got pulled down

553
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,076
while he struggled with the killer

554
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,377
Oh, that's right!

555
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,947
Then the killer must've
pulled his necktie tool

557
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,582
His necktie?

558
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,486
Yes, his necktie pin was really low!

559
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,190
And the button hole
was stretched out too!

561
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,861
But maybe the necktie pin
Wasre? little too low...

563
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,698
Maybe he likes putting it there.

564
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,368
And maybe it's his style to wear shirts
with different length sleeves...

566
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,573
But!sir. you like both the left
and right evenly, don't you?

568
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,144
I mean when Mr. Motoo fell out,
you were stan'aing on the left

570
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,913
but you deliberately went around
td the right side and yelled!

572
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,251
You actually wanted to fix the length of
his sleeve, didn't you.

574
00:20:55,454 --> 00:21:00,858
Also. his apron was sticking out
from the right'side of the door

576
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,964
and it would've been natural
to open just the right side

578
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:10,802
but you opened both sides
at the same time...

580
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:18,376
Yes. I guess you're right.
I like things even...

582
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:19,743
I'm finished!

583
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,015
My tea cup! Pretty good, huh?

584
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,485
Yes, that's really quite good...

585
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,220
but you knowyoung man,

586
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,656
it appears as if
you're worriéd'f'éboutsomething...

588
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,791
you're either'hidihg' some deep.
Dark-secret or

590
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:37,829
debating about
something important...

592
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:42,867
I'm right. aren't I?
The soul never lies...

594
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,770
You're very good...

595
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,208
I think you should take care...
Of your own affairs

597
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:54,245
before meddling in other people's...

598
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:58,516
But...this is the cup YOU made, sir.

599
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,450
What!?

600
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:03,655
