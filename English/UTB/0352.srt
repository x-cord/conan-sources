This is it! If we could only have this...

223
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,319
wonder if we can fish with this--

224
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,954
Of course...!

225
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,689

the wound first

269
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,109
Okay...

270
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,689
Conan, you're late:
I was worried about you.

272
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,625
Hurry and get your fish weighed:

273
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,165
What's the matter?
Aren't you feeling well?

275
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,238
Don't tell me, yourdon't have
any fish to weigh!...Is that it?

277
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,512
Y.You couldn't fish even one?
All four of you?!

279
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,148
4 times 0=0 fish?!

280
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,082
Buh!

281
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,718
Sonoko. don't laugh!

282
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,988
But- Wha. ha. ha. ha...

283
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,127
We'd like to announce the results
for the first day.

285
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:07,365
In first place is Ms. Saori Ayukawa
who fished a total of 13524 grams!

287
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,168
All right!

288
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,170
Wow!!

289
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:16,106
We moved places...changed lures...
All that's left is

291
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:18,576
All that's left is luck! Yup...

292
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:22,480
Let's turn luck in our direction tomorrow
and aim for a counter win!

294
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,615
Okay!!

295
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,216
Huh 24

296
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,053
I wonder if it'll go that well?...

297
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:39,647
Just what are you talking about!

298
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,517
Cut out the stupid talk...

299
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:44,018
Ha, ha, ha, it's' nothing to get all
worked up over, is it?

301
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:46,121
Ha. ha, ha, it's nothing to get all
worked up over, is it?

303
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,156
Excuse me.

304
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:07,742
It's really huge. don't you think?
My friend fished it...

306
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,845
The person who fished this is
Ied Mr. Kanie...

308
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,116
Yeahs? Mr. Kensuke Kanie.
Me was a skilled fisher.

310
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:16,784
Ny Muy fay

311
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,956
How can you fish a big fish like that?

312
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:25,126
Because we've been fishing
since we were kids.

314
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:29,097
If you start from now, Ayumi, I'm sure
that by the time you become an adult,

316
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:30,465
you'll be a great fisherman.

317
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,168
Really?! Maybe I should...

318
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:38,039
Saori,
why did you decide to start fishing?

320
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,275
My father used to fish,

321
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:45,213
sO he used to take me along with him to
rivers and lakes since I was really little.

323
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:51,452
That's why I never went to amusement
parks or zoos until I entered high school.

325
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:53,955
What?!! Poor thing...

326
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,858
Oh, there you are, Ms. Ayukawa.

327
00:12:56,892 --> 00:13:01,963
Wanna drink with me,
in advance. celebration of your victory?

329
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:03,630
No, thank you'd rather not.

330
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:07,635
Oh; are you saying
that you don't want to drink with me?

332
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:08,635
CO oO

333
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:09,587
Are. you sure about that?

334
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,573
Are you sure
that's what you really want to say?

337
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:18,646
Ha, ha, ha...I'm just kidding, only joke.

338
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:23,418
The thing is,
{ "want you to tell me something.

340
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:24,819
Ql thought that while km here anyway,

341
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,556
I'd go and finish my work on
Rail Mania too.

343
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,827
You know almost everything
about this place, don't you?

345
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:35,063
Not really...

346
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:42,270
Please tell me and help me.
Please Saori...

348
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:44,939
Okay...

349
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,943
OR, that'll be-a great help.

350
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,211
I'm indebted to you.

351
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:53,047
Thanks so much... Ha, ha, ha .

353
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:58,553
He said, Rail Mania
I bought that magazine before.

355
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:01,389
He's a free-lance writer,

356
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,926
so he's writing for
many different types of magazines.

358
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,594
I see

359
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,170
Conan, let's fish by boat. today.

360
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,839
During this season

361
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,074
I'm sure theibass are hiding
behindthings 'hear the shore

363
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,860
and waiting for bait.

364
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,278
No matter what your reasoning is

366
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:26,481
we were IS Inga -ay near es ore
yesterday, and caught nothing!

368
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,116
So, today...

370
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,953
Right! We're getting on the boat today
in order to win.

372
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,622
I'm going to-fish on land after all.

373
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,226
I'm thinking of going
some place else today...

375
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,830
What about you. Ayumi?

376
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,266
Hmm What should I do...

377
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,834
OhlMs. Ayukawa!!

378
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,002
Good morning!!

379
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:51,172
Ms. Ayukawa,
where are you going to fish today?!

381
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:54,876
Hmm... I'm planning to Kutanisuji today.

382
00:14:54,877 --> 00:14:57,178
May l.go along with you?

383
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,583
Hmm...It's dangerous there,
so I'd rather you don't

385
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:02,884
Oh& A

387
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:06,854
I'm sorry, Ayumi. Goodluck, all off you /

388
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:10,692
Kutanisuj }
Mitsuhiko, let's take the boat-and

391
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:14,696
And beat her to the at-Kutanisuiji!

392
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:17,732
Good luck, all of you!

393
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,234
Let's.go, Ayumi.

394
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:21,002
Okay.

395
00:15:26,609 --> 00:15:28,326
M.Miss Ayukawa!

396
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:33,531
Huh? Where...Oh, true...
Ms. Ayukawa!

398
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,533
Deheh. heh. heh...

399
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,025
Aaah...

400
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,595
I shouldive gotten on the boat too...

402
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,333
Agh. a trolley!

403
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,103
Hey, hello

404
00:15:57,473 --> 00:16:00,108
What?! We hit something...

405
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,543
There-was definitely-a sound...

407
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,447
What.could it be?

408
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:08,950
Could it be something used
when fishing?

410
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:11,686
I've never seen something like this.

411
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:22,997
He's Mr. Masubuchi a candidate
for champion, right?

413
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:25,533
Which means. this must be
a good place to fish.

415
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,568
But even if the place is good...

416
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,837
Oh, but it's the 2nd day

417
00:16:29,838 --> 00:16:32,507
so I'm sure Conan and the others
have fished a lot today

419
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,175
I wonder

420
00:16:40,349 --> 00:16:42,383
Uh, what's that?

421
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:45,386
Huh ?
I wonder what he's doing.

423
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:49,323
Maybe he sulked out because
he can't catch fish and sleeping...?

425
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:51,325
I doubt it.

426
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,003
Gyaaah!

427
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:12,012
What's the matter. Ran?!

428
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,649
A.A person is... lying on the ground!

429
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,784
Ayumi, wait here, okay!

430
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,453
Oh. okay.

431
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,655
Mr. Funakiu...

432
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:21,489
1! Mr. Funaki...

435
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:30,515
Kerosene?!

436
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:36,437
If he slipped™and hit his head
there should .be blood on the rock.

438
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,906
Search for it!!

439
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,108
What is the estimated time of death?

440
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:46,981
He's still warm.
I'd say it's between 15 to 30 minutes.

442
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,217
HmmA

444
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:50,284
H.He's.sorscary...

446
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,286
H.He sysorscary

447
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:52,587
H.,He's so scary...

448
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:56,958
Oh, the ones who found him?!
Huh?...You guys are...

450
00:17:56,959 --> 00:18:00,394
If I remember correctly...
You're smo « Kogoro's...

453
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:03,064
You mean$Sleeping Kogoéro.

454
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:06,666
@fficer Yokomizo,
thank you so much always

456
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,036
Hmm.
And. you are?

458
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:11,956
I'm a junior at Teitan High school,
Sonoko Suzuki

460
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:16,310
I'm the presenter of this fishing contest
and here on behalf of the chairman

462
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,146
Oh, you're the one
who thrives on attention,

464
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,615
the daughter of the host of this contest.

467
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:22,283
Buh.

469
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,651
Kuuugh...

470
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:26,621
Will you explain the conditions
when you found him?

472
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:30,158
Sonoko and I were at the contest
headquarters but,

474
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,028
we came walking along to check on
Conan and the others,

476
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,730
then. we found Mr. Funaki over there...

477
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,999
So, the victim's name is Funaki?

478
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,768
Yup ./He said he was
free-lance writer for magazines

480
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:43,570
and was saying-that he was going to
write-an article-of this fishing contest

482
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:44,572
for a magazine called "Gekkan Bass.

483
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:47,208
Where were you kids?

484
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:52,512
I was upstream about'30 meters from
here together with Ayumi and fishing

486
00:18:52,513 --> 00:18:57,518
When you were there, didn't you hear
his scream or something?

488
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,687
Nope 2We.-didn't, did we?

489
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:01,722
We didn't hear a thing

490
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,124
Uuugh...

491
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,126
Inspector,
may I have a moment with you...

493
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:06,794
Yeah.
Did you find it?

495
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:10,531
Well. Awe searched all over

496
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:14,035
but didn't come up with anything
the victim couldrve hit his head on.

498
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,470
What?! You couldn't find anything!

499
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,338
\ 00o ,

500
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:17,704
yu00

503
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:28,015
Lwa Xnear 'Otakeiwa
between 10:00 to 10:30...

505
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:30,518
Do you have anyone
who can prove that for you?

507
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,485
I was right near him all the time.

508
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:32,987
I was right near him all the time.

510
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:36,656
Both of us were fishing together
from early morning at Otakeiwa.

512
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,793
Where as this Otakeiwa?

513
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,795
Around here.

515
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,865
You may both leave

516
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:45,600
Thank you .

517
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,770
Yikes...talk about gruffO,.

520
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:56,477
- - Only 30 Minutes had past
since Mr. Funaki had died.

522
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,081
It takes 20 minutes

523
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,415
from the contest headquarters
to where the corpse was found.

525
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,584
Without 'using a boat,

526
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,921
the only way to cross the lake would be
to use the path above the dam.

528
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:10,658
It wouldftake more than 5 minutes
to cross the dam,

530
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,262
so it would've been impossible
for anybody

532
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:16,764
who was on the right side of the lake
to commit the crime.

534
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:19,634
You're Ms. Saori Ayukawa?

535
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,302
Yes, Sir.

536
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:26,190
Oh, are you saying
I you don't want to drink with me?

540
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,743
Are you sure that's what you want?

541
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,697
Will you please tell me

542
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,031
where and what, you were doing
between 10:00 and 10:30?

544
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:35,700
Yes.

545
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,818
I was going up
the opposite way to Kutanisuiji

547
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,887
from the crossroad of the main-trail.

548
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:44,992
Is there anyone
who can prove that for you?

550
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,294
W Caw her!!

551
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:46,827
Huh

552
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,697
We were on the boat,

553
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:53,334
but we definitely saw Ms. Ayukawa
go into Kutanisuji.

555
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:53,968
Yes. we waved goodbye to her.

556
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,304
Yes, we waved goodbye to her.

557
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:57,939
No: doubt about it.

558
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,342
Okay:..you may go back to the contest

559
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,211
Thank you.

560
00:21:05,881 --> 00:21:06,280
What about us?!

562
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:07,548
What about us?!

563
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:09,450
You:guys can go too!

564
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:13,254
Huh?!...
You don't need proof of our alibi...

566
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:14,288
No. I don't!

567
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:15,923
I don't have time for kids...

568
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:20,928
I What a surprise. He's the one
who took our picture for us, night...

571
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:24,397
I wonder if that place is cursed...

573
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,435
Mr. Mina,
just what do you mean by that?

575
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:31,339
Ms, half ye

576
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,640
The things: half a year ago.
somebody died there too.

578
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:35,743
Since there was no one
around«back then,

580
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,512
the case closed-as an accident.

581
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,714
Who-died?

582
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,750
A person calledMr. Kanie,

583
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:45,753
who was very. intimate with
Ms: Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

585
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:47,387
Kanie?!

586
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:52,093
Kensuke Kanie,
he. was a skilled fisher...

589
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:58,132
Then, he was a candidate for
champion too?

591
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:01,002
Yes. Just like Mr. Masubuchu,

592
00:22:01,003 --> 00:22:03,371
he was Ms. Ayukawas's
father's student too...

594
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:05,639
Ms. AyLikawa°s father?!

595
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,808
He already passed away

596
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:12,880
but Ms. Ayukawass: father is the person
who spread sports fishing in Japan.

598
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:16,350
He established a fishing club
and taught bass fishing...

601
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,921
Somebody died there 6 months ago.

602
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,656
This is nocoincidence.

603
00:22:22,657 --> 00:22:26,861
The murderer. is most probably
one of the two!
