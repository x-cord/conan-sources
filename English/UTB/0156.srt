00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:03,035
Inspiration flashes. piercing through
to the truth,

3
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,737
Once he gets going. nothing can stop him.

4
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,772
In today's episode, a lot of police
officers make their appearance,

6
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,609
the Junior Detective League
prove to be an asset

8
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,377
The one &only truth is brought
into the light,

10
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,145
he looks like a child but he's got the
brains of an adult.

12
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,481
His name is... Detective Conan

13
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,677
YA AA

14
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:56,482
TA AA
DETECTIVE LOVE STORY 2 / PART I

16
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:56,916
FA AA

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,119
There's no doubt about it,

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,422
she's beginning to suspect your
true identity .

20
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,593
It's no use trying to keep it
hidden from her any longer...

22
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,695
You'll only end up hurting her...

23
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,999
Wh... why are you telling me this...

24
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,536
You mean you can read how a criminal
thinks but you can't read

26
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,939
the heart of a woman?

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,340
The heart of a woman?

28
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,543
I'm in love with you...

29
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,313
I have been since the moment we met...

30
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:33,185
You didn't know that. did you...
Masked Yaiba?

32
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,355
Cut, cut!

33
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,558
That won't do Conan!
You've got to look more surprised!

35
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:43,229
This is the climatic scene where the
female spy who betrayedss

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,666
the underworld confesses her
Iove for Masked Yaiba!'w

39
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:52,405
Good grief. .isn't this supposed to be
a school play?

41
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,074
Then let's do a normal story.

42
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,144
Like Momotaro or Issunboshi

43
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,981
I can't direct something that
Iacks reality like those stories!

45
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:05,184
Masked. Yaiba is just as bad...

46
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,888
Don't complain, I'm not happy as the
Potato Giant but I'm sticking it out!

48
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,190
He's right!

49
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,995
After all. we snuck in this abandoned
building to create an air of suspense!

51
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,930
Then let's do a police story!

52
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:20,266
You know what I mean, don't you?

53
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,967
Where the criminal escapes into
an abandoned building

55
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,269
& a shoot-out takes place...

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,136
Hold it!!

57
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:29,375
Stop!

58
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,812
Put your hands up &don't make a move!!

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,247
Detective Sato...

60
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,149
Ayumi!

61
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,118
Don't cone near me!!

62
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,820
Ayumi!?

63
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,957
Don't come near

64
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,293
Conan!!

65
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,364
Let me go!

66
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,267
No let me go!

67
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,470
Let me go!!

68
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,842
Sorry little girl, I must
have scared you...

70
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,311
I'm really sorry!!

71
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,664
Ayumi?!

72
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,932
Conan...

73
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,367
Where is he?

74
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,102
I think he's out on the roof

75
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:30,836
Let's go!

76
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,778
Ho, hold it...

77
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,211
Gee. whizz!!

78
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,512
Detective Sato!

79
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,213
Oh Detective Takagi

80
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,983
Detective Sato

81
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:21,320
Takagi! Go around &
come in from below!

83
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,454
Right away!

84
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,957
Hey. what happened?

85
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,197
What! A prisoner escaped!

86
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,965
Yes that's right!

87
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,934
We were taking him to headquarters,

88
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,770
there was an accident involving
a car & a motorcycle.

90
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,338
The suspect was sitting next to me but my
attention went to the accident &

92
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,308
when I turned back.
He was gone!!

94
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:46,078
He was a very quiet man, I never
thought he'd try to escape...

96
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,713
You blew it!

97
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,415
You let him escape,
you won't get off the hook

99
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,649
by just filling a report you know

100
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,551
Boy do I know it!!

101
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:06,498
18:43... escaped suspect is
apprehended... . there...

103
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,671
Oh no , the chain on the handcuffs cut

104
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,507
Oh bother... you're nothing but trouble...

105
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,878
Now then, get up!

106
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,516
I don't believe it...

107
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:28,287
The key! The key! The key!
Where's the key!

109
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,723
No. no, it's not here!

110
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,560
Good grief, I bet I dropped it
somewhere...

112
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,129
I shouldn't have been So rough...

113
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,297
1. I'm Innocent.

114
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:44,403
I'm innocent!!
I didn't kill her. Detective!!

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,776
Hey... did you hear some kind of noise
from upstairs?

118
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,146
It must be your imagination.
The place is locked up tight

120
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,715
Come on, let's get this job done!

122
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:02,621
Detective Sato. where are you?
Detective Sato...

124
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,722
Strange...

125
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,759
Isn't this an art museum?

126
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:11,163
Then why aren't there any
paintings...

128
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,598
You're.right'...

129
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,334
There're probably changing displays!

130
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:19,605
Listen here! It's very dangerous
didnst-! tell yo ids to.go home!

132
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,706
Takagi...

133
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,974
Detective Sato?

134
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,310
Takagi! Over here!

135
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,911
Where are you?
Detective Sato...

137
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,781
Detective Sato?

138
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,115
In here! Here!

139
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,186
What are you doing in there?
This is the men's room.

141
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,889
And what happened to the suspect?

142
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,793
Uh,well... I did manage to
recapture him. but .

144
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,594
I sort of made a mistake...

145
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,930
Wh. what in the world did you do?!

146
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,434
Isn't it normal procedure to
handcufPthe suspect, hands?

148
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:52,638
I didn't want him to get away again so
I inadvertently handcuffed myself to him!

150
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,073
Where's the key?

151
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:55,507
I think I lost it

152
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,310
if the other detectives hear about
this, I'd die of eabarrasseent

154
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,245
so could you please go get the spare &
not tell anyone?

156
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,581
I wouldn't be able to get in & out
unnoticed

158
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,784
the entire station is in an uproar because
of this escaped prisoner

160
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,355
I see... is that any way to talk
to a senior officer

162
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,491
besides, this entire situation occurred
when you took your eyes off the prisoner

164
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,026
& allowed him to get away, right?

165
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,928
Y. yes... you are correct

166
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,530
Alright, get going Takag

167
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,832
Yes ma: am

168
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,233
I didn't do it...

169
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,435
I didn't kill her!

170
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,938
Don't know what happened but
when I woke in the morning,

172
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,506
Miss Muranishi was dead!

173
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,175
That's all he's been saying

174
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,244
It's the truth!
Please believe me!

176
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,346
Listen to me Mr. Higashida...

177
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,117
The deceased is Masami Muranishi, she
Iived in the same condominum building

179
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,618
as you & she just happened
to be your boss

181
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,986
as you & she just happened
to be your boss
Victim
Masami Muranishi

185
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,255
The crime was committed
in her bathroom
Victim
Masami Muranishi

189
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:50,596
When her body was found, you were on
her bed, you were stone drunk asleep!!

191
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,199
The front door was locked & chained
from the inside.

193
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,868
The apartment was completely locked!

194
00:08:55,902 --> 00:09:02,307
Besides. your fingerprints were on
the doorlock & chain

196
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,510
& even on the
video cord we found around her neck

198
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,514
On top of that, you always argued
with her about work.

200
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:11,850
The night of the murder you told a friend
you were "Going to tell her off"

202
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,019
then you rushed out to go home,
isn't that so!

204
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:18,590
You were drunk. you went to her apartment
& killed her in the heat of the argument,

206
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,025
isn't that how it happened?

207
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:23,862
You locked the door so
she couldn't run away...

209
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:27,666
and after you killed her. you were so
drunk. you fell asleep on her bed,

211
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,168
isn't that right?

212
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,704
But I don't remember anything...

213
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,775
That's because you were drunk
out of your mind...

215
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:42,948
Yes it's true, I hated her for
finding fault with even job I did!!

217
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,951
But I didn't hate her enough to kill her!

218
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,087
Then why'd you try to escape?

219
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,723
Th... there's some place I have to be

220
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,125
And where's that?

221
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,127
I have a daughter in Chicago...

222
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:02,468
my wife took her when we got divorced.
My daughter sent me a wedding invitation.

224
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,272
And for the past 17 years.
I thought she hated me...

226
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,043
that's why I have to go. I have to!!

227
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:19,318
It's the truth! Go to my apartment.
You'll find the letter & the ticket!

229
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,385
B. but what can I do...

230
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:23,555
That man's not a bad man

231
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:29,495
You know 'he let me gox& when he
put me down. he said he was sorry!

233
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,331
If he was a bad man, he wouldn't do that!!

234
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,765
But listen...

235
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,503
What time is the flight tomorrow?

236
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,739
It... leaves Narita at 12:30...

237
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,441
D. Detective Sato?

238
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:47,412
Takagi? I want you to listen very carefully
to what I'm about to say to you

240
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,046
What?! You can't contact Takagi & Sato?!

241
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,250
What?! You can't contact Takagi & Sato?!
Police Station

243
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:51,582
What?! You can't contact ,akagi & Sato?!

244
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:55,254
0... I've been trying to rais
them on the cellular...

246
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:59,091
Something may have happened to them
while they were pursuing the suspect...

248
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,628
Find them!!
They should still be in that area!»

250
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:05,063
Hey Shiratori! We're going along too!!

251
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:05,964
Yessir!!

Wheat. get the real killer by
noon tomorrow?

254
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,770
D. do you mean me?

255
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:16,842
Yes that's right. I'll keep an eye
on this guy for you until then...

257
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,811
Wbesides. I'm not roin: an where for awhile

258
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,581
Alright then. I'll go get the key.

259
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,717
Let's take him down to headquarters
first then we both can go...

261
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,088
No! If someone sees you at headquarters
getting the key,

263
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,326
the boss"ll put you through the ringer,
while you-ire writing the report,

265
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,628
the plane"ll take off & it'll be too late!

266
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,499
Now listen, we're still in pursuit
of the escaped prisoner!

268
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,267
That's what we have to make it look
Iike. in the meantime,

270
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,702
you will work alone &
find the real killer!

272
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,871
That's our only alternative!

273
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,339
If the suspect is found not guilt

274
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,740
before he is delivered to
the Public Prosecutor's Office,

276
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:54,246
the police department has the right to set
him free at their discretion!

278
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,781
B:.but...

279
00:11:56,316 --> 00:12:01,720
The time limit is tomorrow morning
about 10 when this-art museum opens!

281
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:06,792
Because as»soon as someone comes In
here. they're sure to call the police.

283
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:10,996
I'll believe you until then. is that
OK with you?

285
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:13,165
1. I really appreciate that!

286
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,834
B, but I don't know if I can do it
all by myself...

288
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:20,505
Why you aren't alone. Those kids
Iook anxious to help!

290
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,141
Hehehe...

291
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:34,885
You got me? The time limit is
97) TCENERR MYO RNRCN!

293
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:40,459
You have until then to capture the
real killer & prove this man's innocence!

295
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,229
Don't worry, you can do it

296
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,998
Have faith in Yourself...

297
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,504
Hey, what're you doing?
We're going!

299
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:58,443
No, wait a minute...ll know Detective Sato's
in tight with Inspector Megure,

301
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,580
she only said
those things to encourage me...

303
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,284
His mood's been going up &down
Iike a seesaw...

305
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,319
Weird

306
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,788
Hey! What're you doing up there?!

307
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:10,856
Eh? Us?

308
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,094
Didn't you see the sign down there?!
It said no trespassing!!

310
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,263
It was an emergency

311
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,299
That's right! We were chasing a criminal!

312
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,603
Criminal. oh sure!
You're not the police!

314
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:28,240
Uh. I may not look it. but I'm with
the Metropolitan Police Department...

316
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:33,378
Of course if anyone finds out a detective is
here with an escaped murder suspect,

318
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,514
our efforts will have been for nothing.

319
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,150
Nor er or IS Oma el oO
his daughter's wedding,

321
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,919
you have to work on your own
& In secret

323
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,991
Oh. uh sorry about that, we were
just playing cops & robbers...

325
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:46,591
Good grief...

326
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,794
You think he'll be OK...

327
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,428
Eh? What?

328
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,733
That detective didn't seem too reliable...

329
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:58,036
You're so right! He seems so kind &
somewhat clumsy,

331
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,805
the kind you just can't help worrying about!

332
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,076
But he's really quite dependable
when he puts his mind to it...

334
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,544
Oh great...

335
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,146
Besides, that kid's with him...

336
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,181
I hat Kid

337
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:15,220
That kid wearing the glasses...
somehow, that kid gives me hope...

339
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,259
That's the 5th one...

340
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,161
I wonder what happened

341
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:27,499
I told you! They're looking for the
killer. Detective Sato &me!

343
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,401
Detective Takagi, you look like a hoodlum

344
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,105
It can't be helped, I doing some
top secret investigating...

346
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,507
Anyway, we've got to go to that pub first

347
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,444
That's where we'll start
because Mr. Higashida said

349
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,346
he stopped off there just before the murder

350
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,449
Yes... he was totally plastered

351
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:48,086
he said 'I'm going to tell that woman
off once & for all today.

353
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,357
But I never dreamed he'd kill her...

354
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,559
Was he alone when he left?

355
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:59,131
Mr. Kitagawa who was drinking
with him took him home.

357
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,966
There, that's him.

358
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,169
He & Mr. Higashida work
for the same coapany

360
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,740
So he's the same Kitagawa who first
discovered the body...

362
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:10,942
He discovered the body!

363
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:16,181
Yes...when Higashida & Miss Muranishi
didn't show up for work the next mooing,

365
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,784
he had the landlord.use the master key
to unlock the door,

367
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,786
that's how he found the body.

368
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,092
I'm leaving the money on the table

369
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,161
Thank you!

370
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,096
Oh, uh...Mr. Kitagawa!

371
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,033
Om with the police!
I have a few questions for you...

373
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,636
I already told the police everything.

374
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,406
I'm in a state of shock.
My friend killed our boss...

376
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,176
Please leave me alone...

377
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,644
Of course...

378
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,118
He's right, he's already been
questioned by the police...

380
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,988
so has the pub's owner
probably several times...

382
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,194
That's right! Miss Muranishi was a
Tokyo!Spirits fan &

384
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,462
Mr Higashida was anti-Spirits!

385
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,764
Really...

386
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,666
You there!
What're you'think you're doing?!

388
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,068
I'm terribly sorry
we'll be going now

390
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:13,638
Oh. I've got to call home!
My mom"ll be worried

392
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,339
Me too

393
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,240
Me too!

394
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:21,179
Good grief. I'll never be able 'to.get the real

396
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:21,947
8B ODE THY

398
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:22,981

402
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,253
No. I don't mind.

403
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,323
If Detective Takagi
Is with you I'm not worried...

405
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,625
Tomorrow's Sunday, the big day!

406
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:38,029
I'll just tell your parents you're
all coming with me to tomorrow's event

408
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,532
Event? What event?

409
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,369
Tomorrow's the day myginvention
will serve our town!

411
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:50,075
I call it [Tropical Rainbow], when
iteblows, it glows like a rainbow

413
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,944
When you're done with what you're
doing, come have a look!

415
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,546
Sure thing.

416
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,349
DidpDoctor Agasa say he'd do it?

417
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,784
Yes. he was pretty excited about a
fireworks 'display

419
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,220
they're holding in Haido tomorrow

420
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,724
Fireworks?... I didn't hear anything
about that.

422
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,628
Never mind that. next we go to the
victim's apartment. right?

424
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:10,128
Eh?... Uh, right

425
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,496
Eh?... Uh, right

426
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,099
The police again?

427
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,836
The officers who came in the
afternoon just left...

429
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,172
Yes. well there's something they
forgot to check

431
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,540
Who're those kids?

432
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,377
This is a social studies project!

433
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,647
We're experiencing police work & then
reporting to the class!

435
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,650
Oh I know. you're studying jobs &
the people doing them!

437
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:36,655
I'll return the key to you later then .

438
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,456
Yes, I'd appreciate it

439
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,931
oh, hey!
F you touch things your...

441
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,966
» Don't worry, look!

442
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:52,337
While you were buying your hat, we
bought these gloves

444
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,339
Conan told us to!

445
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,839
I see...

446
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,246
Good grief where in the world
IS the suspect & Detectives Sato & Takagt!

448
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:05,083
It seems we lost contact with them
when they entered an/abandoned building

450
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,751
in pursuit of the escaped prisoner...

451
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,187
Don't you find that strange?

452
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,390
It's not like Detective Sato to not call
in for so long...

454
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,358
You don't think...

455
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,963
They could be lying dead, killed
by their prisoner .

457
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,935
Nooo!!

458
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,271
How awful...

459
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,007
Why you, how dare you kill
my valuable subordinates!

461
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,010
Eh?! Detective Sato?!

462
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:34,245
What?! The suspect has
Detective Sato?!

464
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,314
Miss Miwa's being kept hostage!

465
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,361
0... Am I coming down with a

466
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,797
I'm sorry, this is all my fault...

467
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,335
Forget it, it we made a false arrest.
We'd have to apologize to you...

469
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,839
Besides... this isn't for you

470
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:01,806
Hun?

471
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:06,243
I just didn't want your daughter to
go through what I did

473
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,448
I lost my father when I was little
it broke my heart...

475
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,184
Come on kids. let's go home...

476
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,087
we're not going to come up with
anything no matter how hard we look

478
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,856
the guys from the crime lab
were already here.

480
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,958
There isn't a single piece of
trash on the floor...

482
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,060
There are 4 things out of place...

483
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,131
The first us, the color of the mattress,
the sheets. the pillow &

485
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,033
the curtain beside the bed...

486
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,069
everything from the kitchenware. to
the dishes,

488
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,438
down to the interior is in beige,

489
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,408
why then is only the bed &
curtain in gray...

491
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,977
I-suppose-ités-justdcéncidence

492
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:43,448
But there were beige sheets &
curtains in the closet!

494
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:48,887
And the lady who ran the pub told us
Miss Muranishi just loved beige!

496
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,958
And she also told us MisslMuranishi
Iiked the Spirits & cactus!

498
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,996
She also said Mr Higashida knew a lot
about video equipment & hated baths!

500
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,132
And that when he got drunk he would
always fall asleep and couldn't wake up.

502
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,801
That's why he was late for work a lot!

503
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:06,871
I don't think she told the investigators
that when they questioned her

505
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,774
when people are being questioned
by the police.

507
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,210
They are afraid that if they mention
something unrelated to the crime

509
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,813
they'll be reprimanded.

510
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,515
But the tension sometimes makes them
talk anyway.

512
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,319
She may not have appeared like it but
I think she was scared

514
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:22,687
S, scared...

515
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,855
The second thing is,

516
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,391
why was this calendar taken off
the wall next to the bed...

518
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:34,365
See, this is this year's To « 0 Spirits
calendar, it was in the closet.

520
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:37,268
It matches the spot on the wall perfectly

521
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:42,140
She probably took it down because the
team's not doing so good lately.

523
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,041
But look!

524
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,612
Her whole schedule until December
IS written In

526
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,914
Why. you're right...

527
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,486
The third thing is. there'rerslight
traces the furniture's been moved

529
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,954
The men from the crime lab
mentioned that«too,

531
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,823
they said she'd probably
rearranged the room

533
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:02,961
But don't you think it's strange
she wouldn't notice she'd crushed

535
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:06,131
something this valuable When she
moved:the chest?

537
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,033
They're just matches

538
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:09,968
Open it up

539
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,304
Huh. There's*a piece of paper inside

540
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,772
why, this is?!

541
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,909
It's her.marriage registration!

542
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,814
She was going to be married! But the
groomss name hasn't been filled in.

544
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,816
His seal is on it though...

545
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:27,018
The fourth thing is, the cactus

546
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:31,389
On the day of the murder, it had been
raining heavily since morning...

548
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,926
Would a cactus lover such as herself
Ieave the pots outside?

550
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,962
Which means someone besides the victim

551
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,633
moved things around for
some unknown reason

553
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,636
Yes. here it is!

554
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,541
This is the gold dolphin cactus the pub
owner gave her on the day sherwas killed!

556
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,976
But the thorns have been bent. poor thing...

557
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:55,280
So what does that have to do
with anything

559
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:59,551
e suspecC r. 1gas I a was
found sleeping on the bed

561
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:02,554
in this room sprawled out like
it was his home.

563
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,723
His fingerprints were found not only
on the video cord,

565
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,860
which was the murdrer weapon.
But also on the door lock

567
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,829
& even the chainlock...

568
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,031
No. it can't be...

569
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,166
You don't mean. this room?!

570
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,969
Shall we go check it out?

571
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,040
His apartment's in this condominium
too, isn't it?

573
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,742
Yes, let's go
