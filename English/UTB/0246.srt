1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,102
Even destiny serves
as a clue to- deduction

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,071
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:07,139
It's summer and hot!
Time to go to the seal!

7
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,641
At a beach, an incident is awaiting us.

8
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,576
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,711
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,814
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,050
I'm bored...

14
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,287
We came all the way to Izu resort

15
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,957
But, I canst swim the way
I want with this body.

17
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,327
I really want my original body back.

18
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,801
Oh, my'.

19
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,170
Are you OK, little boy?

20
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,872
Ah...I'm fine...

21
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,740
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:21,774
Yeah.

23
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,010
Bye bye!

24
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,077
Take care!

25
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,949
All right, I guess I'll make do
with this bodysfor a while

27
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,717
Hey you, Conan!

28
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,554
Play seriously!

29
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,823
Conan!IDOn=t~foljget*you;re in!

30
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,792
Yeah=mnight...

31
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,727
Well, let's start again!

32
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,896
Please, count to thirty properly!

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,838
Which on Yof the two do you like?

35
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,805
Huh?

36
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,710
Come-on'! Don't hold out! You were
enticed by their bodies, weren't you?

38
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:00,379
That's silly! Who cares?

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,183
But the young woman behind me
wearing the blue striped swimsuit

41
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,684
IS a a different story

42
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,286
I see.

43
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:12,691
You double exposed her body line
against the body line of you know who...

45
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,027
and were daydreaming about it, right?

46
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,861
Cut it out!

47
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,863
Hey, is it you, Conan?

48
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,766
What're you doing here?

49
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,235
Ra...Ran!

50
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:27,440
Hey, why is the snot-nose kid here?

51
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,207
I don't know.

52
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,644
I remember that Ran said
she would go away with Sonoko.

54
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:37,116
Aha! This is the beach
the doctor was talking about.

56
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:37,950
Yeah.

57
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,388
Oh, no. We're always caught up in some
incident every time as we take this kids

59
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,889
That's why we didn't bring him this time

60
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:48,828
Calm dow!
I think the more the merrier, right?

62
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,361
Yeah!!

63
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,307
The Mystery Caught In the Net Part I

64
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,476
Hey! It's no use running away!

65
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,877
Here goes!!

66
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,480
Ouch!

67
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,317
Well, do you give up yet?

68
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,520
Darn it! I'll beat you next time.

69
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:16,522
You re a strong player, Sonoko!

70
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,891
No, she is not, but she's just a bully who
enjoys -pickington younger kids.

72
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,627
Huh? Where's Ran?

73
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,431
While you were getting
the ball that drifted off,

75
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,733
she went up to the shore with Conan.

76
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,737
Haibara said she's a little tired,
so Ran went with her!

78
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,740
But she said she'd come back again
after taking a little rest.

80
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:45,484
High body temperature,
dry skin with no sweating.

82
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,054
And contracted pupils, a flushed face

83
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,824
But her pulse Is strong and rapid.

84
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,593
Shes got heal stroke.

85
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:58,397
The â„¢ we better bring. her
back to the hotel quickly.

87
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,798
She's all right

88
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,936
In case of moderate heat stroke like this
just resting in the shade,

90
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,305
coolingdthegneck, the chest and
the under-arms with wet towels will do.

92
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,173
Doctor!

93
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,179
I asked a shop worker for ice and water.

94
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,213
Oh thank you!!

95
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,183
How Is she now?

96
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,620
Well, her temperature is going down,
d sol think she will be fine.

98
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,556
Oh, great!

99
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,960
Please don't hesitate to let me know
next time if you feel sick, ok?

101
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,731
I'll go back to the beach
where everyone is then.

103
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,933
Okay!

104
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:37,102
Oh, boy I'm impressed by her insight!

105
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:43,008
Yeah, She was the first to notice
something wrong with Haibara.

107
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,412
But Al, you sort of brought it
upon yourself too.

109
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:50,282
Just sitting there without
even going into the water

111
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,120
If you felt tired you should have rested
with Dr. Agasa under the beach parasol.

113
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,122
Right.

114
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,793
I didn't want to feel
as if I were running away.

116
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,328
Huh?

117
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,530
You mean running away from sharks?

118
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,867
There is no sharks in this area!

119
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,503
Not from sharks.

120
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,073
But from dolphins...

121
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:17,076
Yeah, the dolphins, one of
the most popular animals in the sea

123
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:22,281
The mean sharks that fled from the dark,
cold bottom of the sea,

125
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,717
they are no match for the dolphins.

126
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,987
Hey, what are you talking about?

127
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,824
The dolphins? Aren't the sharks
stronger than the dolphins.

129
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,229
Please leave me alone. You exhaust me.

130
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,864
What...?

131
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey, what do you think you're doing!?

132
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,438
If you bump into people around,
somebody may get serious injury.

134
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,442
What's wrong?
This boat was abandoned on the beach,

136
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,778
and the sea isn't rough at all, so
no big deal as long as we hold it steady!

138
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,881
Hey, Sonoko!

139
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,084
I'm so sorry. We'll put it back
where we found it right now.

141
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,320
Heck!

142
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,723
Hey, Noboru, don't talk so loud

143
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,557
Yuuta...

144
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,527
Can't you see that
the other customers look surprised?

146
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:13,032
He's so upset now because he jus
got dumped by his girl friend!

148
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:14,233
Noboru Shimojo

149
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:18,237
Don't be ridiculous!!
I am the one who dumped her!
Noboru Shimojo
Mm BE

153
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,041
Well put the boat back then.

154
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,777
Oh, but we're the ones who took it out so.

155
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,313
Never mind.

156
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:32,184
It's also a part of our jobs
as Life Guards to clean up the beach.

158
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,087
Uh... you're Life Guards...

159
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,924
I assumed you're fishermen,
but I guess it was my imagination

161
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:43,228
Well, unskilled fishermen who cannot
should just go back on shore

163
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:43,629
Well, unskilled fishermen who cannot
should just go back on shore
Giichi Aramaki

174
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:53,038
Says you! We cannot fish
because of YOU!!

176
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,773
Stop it, Noboru...

177
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,077
So, Mr. Aramaki, as we decided before,

178
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,846
we'll meet in Tong-Poo
in the Queens Hotel at 8 o'clock tonight.

180
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,448
We'll be waiting for you...

181
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,949
Don't turn tail and run away from us!!

182
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,654
Of course, I'll go. Just you wait and see!

183
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:13,625
Hey, Ran... I think the restaurant
we booked was...

185
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,595
Chinese restaurant ,Tong-Poo...

186
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:21,066
Oh, dear, Doctor, I didn't know
you were here?

188
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,903
Yeah, well...we're staying at this hotel.

189
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,438
Let's have dinner together!

190
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,108
Won't you sit down here with us?

191
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:29,641
Oh, yes!

192
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,277
Huh? Where's AI?

193
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,812
She's sleeping in her room now.

194
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,081
She says she isn't hungry,
so she doesn't want dinner.

196
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,649
Oh...

197
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,218
Oh what's this?

198
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,954
You seem to care deeply for
that brown-headed girl, don't you?

200
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,023
I just wanted to talk to her...

201
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,593
I've barely spoken to her.

202
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,395
When our eyes meet,
she always looks away from me...

204
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,564
I wonder if she doesn't like me?

205
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,066
No! That's not true!

206
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:54,967
Oh, really?

207
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,369
Because Ms Haibara was telling Conan...

208
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,672
Aren't you lucky
that Ran's got great buttocks.

210
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,178
Hey, Conan, just what is this all about?!

211
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:09,181
D,Don't get me wrong!
Al said that of her own initiative.

213
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,685
Huh? Isn't having great buttocks
supposed to be a compliment?

215
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,722
Some type of buttercups?

216
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,793
No, she doesn't like being buttered up.

217
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,896
I see, it's not about butts...

218
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:30,569
Hey, hey, didn't she say
anything about me?

220
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,007
She said you are wild.

221
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,909
Oh, well

222
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,312
Aren't you happy?

223
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,480
She's saying you're wild, isn't she?

225
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,318
Aren't you the girls and kids
that we met on the beach this afternoon?

227
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,390
Hey, do you have the time?

228
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,225
My watch has stopped.

229
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,827
ILS 7.1<Â£...

230
00:09:56,362 --> 00:10:00,098
Darn it. I came too early.

231
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,736
All right,
I think a fight's about to start soon.

233
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,772
So, let's order quickly and eat!

234
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,874
It's not a fight.

235
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,044
We're just gonna teach a rule.

236
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,479
A rule?

237
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,347
Yeah

238
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:19,618
A rule about the law of nature that
should not be broken.

240
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,354
Oh, no.

241
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,324
He draws a seine everywhere and
takes whatever he can get his hands on.

243
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,561
Yeah . we try to limit our fish catches...

244
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,730
And we are also doing fish farming

245
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,832
We're not going to tolerate
him who came from elsewhere

247
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,802
doing everything his way... No

248
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,907
So tonight, we're gonna teach Aramaki

249
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:48,981
how long it takes to restore
the over-fished sea to its original state!!

251
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,416
Can't you control him?

252
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,986
I guess we can't...

253
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,723
There are regulations concerning fishing,
but they exist in name only around here.

255
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:00,526
So, in other words,
he gets to take all he wants.

257
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,662
Hey! Yuuta! You're late!

258
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,165
It's 8 o'clock sharp.
You're here too early, Noboru.

260
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,736
Huh? Where's Nobutsugu?

261
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,906
Didn't he come with you?

262
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:16,375
I got a call from Nobutsugu saying
he'd be late

264
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,277
because he's going to visit
his father's grave before coming here.

266
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:24,550
Oh, yeah, today is the day our father died.

267
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,084
Our fathers?

268
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:34,659
Yeah... our fathers... All of them died
eight years ago due to a storm.

270
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:42,701
Well, they were happy to die
in the sea as they were fishermen

272
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,303
You don't mince your words, do you girl?

273
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,172
They hit it off well together.

274
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,641
Hey, Sonoko! That's rude, you know?

275
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,643
What? Who cares?

276
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,245
Hey, come on...

277
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,980
Well, well...

278
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:58,450
but it's true that,
despite knowing the storm was imminent,

280
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,518
our fathers ventured to sea to fish.

281
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,020
No! It was not because the storm...

282
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:02,621
Nobutsugu Nezu

283
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,791
Our fathers' boat was sunken
by that person!!

294
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,698
Hey! Nobutsugu,
You're still talking like that?!

296
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:14,466
How rude!

297
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,902
Anyway, where's that 'Pirate'?

298
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,770
He should be here by now!

299
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,773
It's already 8:40.

300
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:25,577
I guess he forgot about us
and already fell asleep.

302
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,347
You gotta be kidding.
All right, I'm going to wake him up!

304
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:32,517
You'd be lucky to get him. I called him
up a little while ago but he didn't answer.

306
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,489
Hello?

307
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,925
D.Did he answer?

308
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,829
The call went through
but there's no answer

310
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,764
I only hear a strange sound.

311
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,633
A strange sound?

312
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,938
T, This is...

313
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:53,839
The sound of waves!?

314
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,207
He hung up!!

315
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,676
Come to think of it...

316
00:12:57,677 --> 00:13:03,081
This beach is a shortcut from
Aramaki's house to this hotel, isn't it?

318
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,017
Yeah, I know... but,

319
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,320
Now at high water,
nobody can take the beach route, I think.

321
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,622
Don't tell me...

322
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,893
He is enjoying night fishing,
while keeping us waiting.

324
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,994
It's not likely

325
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,897
OK then, why don't we go there
after getting sober.

327
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,532
Oh, yeah

328
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:43,288
I see, this person, Mr.Aramaki and
all three of you had arranged to meet

330
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:49,895
at the Chinese restaurant, "Tong-Poo
in that Queens hotel at 8 o'clock tonight.

332
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,066
Ye Â¥he didn't appear
at the expected time...

334
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:58,670
And an hour and a half
after the appointed time, around 9:30,

336
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,039
when you came here to check up on him,

337
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,877
Mr. Aramaki's drowned body, wrapped
in the net, was washed up ashore.

339
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,647
Is this right!

340
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,015
Y.Yeah.

341
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,718
Hey, you're getting too close to me!

342
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:14,519
We are not telling a lie!

343
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,188
Oh, I'm sorry

344
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:17,956
You know,

345
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:22,861
it's well known that you local fishermen
and this Mr. Aramaki were on bad terms.

347
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,398
So, I thought that
you three could've drowned him here

349
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,801
and pretended that you found his body.

350
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:30,836
What are you talking about.!

351
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,538
They're telling you the truth!

352
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,641
Oh, aren't you Sonoko and Ran?

353
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,611
We heard them confirming
their appointment with

355
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,448
the man who passed away,
on the beach today.

357
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,416
Right, Ran?

358
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,517
Yeah...

359
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:49,988
And, it's also true that
they came to the Chinese restaurant!

361
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,056
See, I told you so!

362
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,493
It's true, but all three of them
came separately to the restaurant...

364
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,094
Oh, Dr. Agasa?!

365
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,931
That thin young man
came at ten after seven!

367
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,168
The plump young guy
came at 8 o'clock!!!

369
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,872
The tanned young man
came around 8:40, I think.!

371
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,876
Those kids don't look like you at all.

372
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,779
No, they are kids from the neighborhood.

373
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,750
Their parents asked me to take them
on a trip during summer vacation.

375
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:24,256
So, Umm... Don't tell me that Conan and
the precocious little girl, are also here.

377
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,426
On, Al is at the hotel now, but Conan is...

378
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,795
Look over there...

379
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,596
Oh, my!!!

380
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,098
Hey, you! Stop that!

381
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,767
You're not allowed to touch it!

382
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,070
You know what? Don't you think
it's stange, Officer Yokomizo.

384
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,038
What?

385
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,609
Look! He drowned but his body is
full of scratches and his clothes are torn.

387
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,312
And why is he wrapped in the net?

388
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,882
Well, the murderer tried to
make him drown,

390
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,551
binding his arms and legs with the net.

391
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,654
And scratches...
Maybe he fought with the murderer...

393
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,925
Hey, the police will take it from here.
Your help is not necessary!!

395
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,795
All right, send the body for post-mortem.

396
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,696
Yes, sir!!

397
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,801
Uh... can we go now?

398
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,337
We have to prepare to
go fishing tomorrow.

400
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:16,007
No, you can't!
I have something else to ask you yet!

402
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,076
Are you still suspecting us?

403
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,747
We already told you! All three of us had
been waiting for him at the restaurant!!

405
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,682
Yeah,

406
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:29,454
but It seems more probable that he had
already killed before the appointed time.

408
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:34,426
And I don't really understand
why you came thisbeach to find him!

410
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,361
It's the call...

411
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,530
We waited for him until after 8p.m,
but he didn't show up at all,

413
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,366
so I called his cell phone
to ask him to come over.

415
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,970
He just hung up without saying anything,

416
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,607
but ll heard the sounds of waves
in the background.

418
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,575
The sounds of waves?

419
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:54,546
Yeah, that's why
we came here to look for him.

421
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:58,783
Because this beach is a shortcut
from his house to that hotel.

423
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:03,221
I also called him once,
while I was waiting alone at "Tong-Poo."

425
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,724
And called a second time
after Yuuta came.

427
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:10,762
Oh, which reminds me, I also called him
once before I went to the restaurant

429
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,365
because I wasn't sure
that he was going to show up

431
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,733
Oh, really?

432
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:19,404
Yeah, I heard the phone ring
but ll couldn't get him on the cell phone.

434
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,476
If you still doubt us, why don't you check
his cell phone to see who called him!

436
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:29,347
Officer Yokomizo. We found a cell phone
that was caught in the net.

438
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,017
It seems to have dropped
from his clothes. What should we do?

440
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,818
Can I take a look at it?

441
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,423
Check it carefully!
Mine should be listed after Yuuta's.

443
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,358
Hmm... according to the records,

444
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,597
Mr. Yoshizawa called at 7:02.

445
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:51,937
Mr. Shimojo called three times
at 7:47, 8:03 and 8.18...

447
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:55,607
And then Mr. Nezu called once at 8:41.

448
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,278
It shows that he only answered your call,
exactly as you told me.

450
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:04,716
Which means that the person
who took the call was

452
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:08,586
Mr. Aramaki himself or the murderer.

453
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,491
But then why didn't he take
Mr. Yoshizawa and Mr. Simojo's calls?

455
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,759
How should we know?!

456
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,597
Now you know that
we didn't kill him, right?!!

458
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,800
It s true...

459
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,368
If the one who pressed
the button to take the call was

461
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,806
Mr. Aramaki himself or the murderer,

462
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:33,645
it would be almost impossible for any of
these three persons here to kill him...

464
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,581
But I also think it is highly unlikely
that the murderer would take a call.

466
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,851
And if Mr. Aramaki himself took the call,

467
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,487
why didn't he take the calls from Mr.
Yoshizawa and Mr. Simojo. It's strange.

469
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:49,394
And if he took the call to ask for help
while being attacked by the murderer,

471
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,063
then why did he hang up
the phone without a word.

473
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:57,635
Hey! Look!

474
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,474
Isn't that the boat,
which we were sailing on this afternoon?

476
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,476
Yeah, it sure is

477
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,645
Hey you, go retrieve the boat right now!

478
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,681
The boat may have
something to do with this case!

480
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,647
Yes, sir!

481
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,517
Darn it!

482
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:17,122
That reminds me of the day
when our fathers died.

484
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,394
Well, their ship drifted back to
this beach at that time, just like that boat.

486
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:28,967
Yeah... without her crew
and with the big hole in the hull...

488
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,971
Anyway, no amount of grieving
is gonna bring them back.

490
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,106
So, let's just forget it, Nobutsugu.

491
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,611
Hey, you! What are you doing? Hurry up!!

492
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,779
Y.Yes, sir!

493
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:46,251
Why don't you stop barking orders
and go help him.

495
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:50,387
Oh, well, that's not my job but my men's.

496
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,392
Hey, don't tell me you can't swim!

497
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:59,564
Oh! how could you become an officer
without knowing how. to swim?

499
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,100
Your hair looks a lot like corals
but can't ou swim?

501
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,802
A coral?

502
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,941
There is a sake bottle
and a sandal in the boat

504
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,343
The pooled water in the bottom
of the boat is seawater, I think.

506
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,213
This is...

507
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,316
A button at the bottom of the boat?!

508
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,585
Hey, if I remember right,
the dead body is...

510
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,556
Yes... the corpse was wearing
only one sandal,

512
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,025
and a button was missing from his shirt!

513
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,260
I see...

514
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,665
The murderer must've made Mr.
Aramaki drunk and put him on this boat.

516
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:38,236
Then wrapped him in the net, threw him
overboard and drowned him.

518
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,940
About the scratches on his body...

519
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,843
Perhaps he got them when he struggled
with the murderer on the boat.

521
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,046
But that seems somehow unnatural to me.

522
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:48,613
Huh?

523
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,716
If I were a murderer, .liwouldn't leave
evidence like this just lying around,

525
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,485
I would throw them into the sea...

526
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:57,755
Don't you know that you shouldn't throw
the garbage into the sea!

528
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,757
It's environmental destruction!!

529
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,628
Huh... Didn't I tell you that's only
if I were the murderer...

531
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,997
Oh, no, Conan! Are you the murderer?!

532
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,968
No, no... I was thinking from
the murderer's side...

534
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,238
Oh, which side? The good or the bad?

535
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:18,710
Dr. A asa...
please keep an eye on these kids!!

538
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,646
Hey, ulricer!

539
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,515
Can we start going?

540
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,483
Oh... Not yet...

541
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,588
Then hurry up and find out
his estimated time of death!!

543
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,892
Without that information,
we can't figure anything out either...

545
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,094
We are working on it, now...

546
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:40,397
Hey! Don't dump garbage into the seal!

547
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,300
A tin can...?

548
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:44,402
Oh my...

549
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,206
Ouch!

550
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,674
E... Are you all righ

551
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,411
Yeah... I just felt
something prick my hand.

553
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,880
Be careful!

554
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,683
There are many seashells
Iying around here!

556
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,251
S Seashells...

557
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:07,325
Um, sir! Were there scratches
on the victim's cell phone?

559
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,295
Huh? Oh, yeah, it was badly scratched...

560
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:11,496
Look!

561
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,566
Now I've got it! So, that's what happened.

562
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,504
Yell find it unlikely that the murderer
would bet on such a coincidence.

564
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,142
So, he must have used a trick of
some kind... What is his true intention?

612

The trick the killer used to
drown that man!!

614
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:06,743
What?!

615
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,780

616

617
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,454
That's why that remark was made...

618
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,160
No doubt about it!
That person s the killer!!
