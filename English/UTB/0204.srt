00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:05,137
Just as flowing water has no form.
And the breeze is invisible.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,939
Deductions take all shapes and styles,
in each and every case to be solved

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,773
Today, the case is solved.

6
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,476
A most unexpected killer,
unexpected motive and unexpected trick.

8
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,245
He sees through
the one and only truth.

10
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,980
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

12
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,282
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,451
We took a.summer trip
and arrived at Hotel Arimori,

16
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,219
Iocated in the mountains of Nagano

17
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,491
We ran into business man
Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto and

19
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,128
his wife, actress Chizuru Bizen there.

20
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,734
The following day, Ran, Mr. Arimori
and Shinobu went to the highlands;

22
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,671
while Mr. Shiromoto and Mr Miyabe
went out fishing to the lake

24
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,576
Night falls, and since Chizuru
had not come out of her room at all,

26
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:25,043
we went to her room to check on her...

27
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,817
Chizuru didn't commit suicide...

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,688
She was killed by someone....!!

29
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,229

Mr. Arimon?

41
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:52,872
Where are you?

42
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:54,740
Over here!

43
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,241
Huh?

00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,578

since they're so beautiful...

&O be

50
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,214
Oh...come on Mr. Arimorl...

51
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:08,320
Hello? Oh, Minaho...

52
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,589
WwW What?!

53
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,292
All right, okay,
I'll head back right away.

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,428
What's up?

56
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,797
Chizuru passed away

57
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,497
What?!

58
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:21,400
I'll just leave the van here.
Let's hurry back to the hotel.

60
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,369
QOkay!

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,439
8:20 P.M.
at the hotel

63
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:28,140
The victim is Chizuru Bizen,

64
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,408
an actress, 30 years old.

65
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,080
She was staying at this hotel together
with her husband Mr. Hidehiko Shiromoto.

67
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,615
Hmm and what is
the estimated time of death...?

69
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:41,887
Oh, the estimated time of death is
between 1:30pm to 2:30pm.

71
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:45,858
The cause of death seems to be
suffocation by strangulation of the neck.

73
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,261
You said that when
the corpse was found

75
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,597
the door was locked
using the door guard?

77
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,535
Yes, and we had no choice
but to break the door open...

79
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:02,007
The window was also locked from
the inside, so I'm sure it was suicide.

81
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,644
But, isn't Chizuru Bizen
a famous actress?

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,714
Did she have any
reason for committing suicide?

85
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,518
Well, to tell you the truth,
there was some hassle last night...

87
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,552
A hassle?

88
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,189
She was laid off from the part in a movie
that she was supposed to star in...

90
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,993
She seemed to be really shocked

91
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,496
I see...

92
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:25,030
Hey, you!

93
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,733
You can't o in there!

95
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:28,934
Oh8but...!

96
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,704
That kid not again...!

97
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,207
You just-keep still, understand!?

98
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,043
But, there are strange scratches here!

99
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,478
Scratches...?

100
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,381
That's the part that the metal part
of the door guard used to be...

102
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,016
There are strange scratches
on the metal on the floorpart too.

104
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,586
These scratches could've been made

105
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,023
when someone tried to create
a locked room from the outside!!

107
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,259
What...?! What do you mean?

108
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,829
In other words,
after the killer locked the window,

110
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:01,667
he probably used the screw driver
to remove the door guard from the wall.

112
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,004
Then he went out to
the corridor from the door,

114
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,139
which after he hooked
the metal part of the door guard on,

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,707
inserted his hand through
the space between the door

118
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,276
and put the screw back on

119
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,177
But, since

120
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,846
trying to screw the screw back on from
such a narrow space was too difficult,

122
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,881
the killer inadvertently
Ieft scratches in the vicinity.

124
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,486
The metal part probably
fell off in one blow at the door

126
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,322
because the screw wasn {
screwed on tightly enough.

128
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:29,728
Um, Chizuru moved this table from
the window and climbed on it, right?

130
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,896
Yeah, that's right.

131
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,198
Then...

132
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,731
Ugh!

133
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,001
Don't bother the officer!

134
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,804
Um, are there foot prints
on the soles of the legs too?

136
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,373
Of course!

137
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,741
Why don't you check your feet...!

138
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,277
Oh, wait! Chizuru had no shoes...

139
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,612
Barefoot!!

140
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:51,083
Were Chizuru's footprints on the table?!

141
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,085
Uh, no!!

142
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,322
What?! Which means that...

143
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,558
Someone carried Chizuru up
and hung her...

145
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,528
Which means that
this is homicide, not suicide...

147
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,732
Last night, Chizuru was arguing
with someone in the restaurant...

149
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,469
Darn, if only I had confirmed
who it was back then...

151
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,073
I wonder if there is no other evidence...

152
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,409
What's this...?

153
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,079
There's some white...and powdery...

154
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,649
Geez...this room sure IS hot...

155
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,418
The air conditioner!

156
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,254
It wasn't running
since we found the corpse...

158
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,191
Did the killer turn it off...?

159
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,234
I would like to ask you a few questions

160
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,737
about the victim, Chizuru Bizen

161
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,872
First of all, Mr. Shiromoto.

162
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:47,640
Yes...?

163
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,844
We hear you were on bad terms
regarding a divorce thatiwas pending...?

165
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:52,544
Hidehiko Shiromoto

166
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,646
Hidehiko Shiromoto
iE St TE E= (46)

168
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,814
the alimony she demanded
was such a huge sum so...

174
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:57,750
Hmm...

175
00:06:58,618 --> 00:06:59,685
Next, Mr. Miyabe,

176
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,789
I hear you wanted her to drop the star role
she was originally supposed to play?

178
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,525
I'm not the one who dropped her.
Kota Miyabe

180
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,326
I had no choice because
that's what the sponsor wanted...
Kota Miyabe

183
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,962
I see...

184
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,531
Now, I'd like to ask all of you

185
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,970
It is estimated that Chizuru died
between the hours of 1:30pm to 2:30pm.

187
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,440
I would like\to know what
you were doing during that time.

189
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,642
Just what do you mean?

190
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,678
It's as if you're checking on our alibis...

191
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,413
D.Don't tell me that Chizuru was...

192
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,815
Judging from
the circumstances at.the.scene

194
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,284
it is highly probable
that this is a homicide case.

196
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:33,919
N.No II

197
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,121
I hear that both
Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe

199
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,124
went to the lake
together to go fishing?

201
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,827
Yes yes, yes!

202
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,363
I left the hotel
at 10am in the morning

204
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,365
and was at the lake right through
until we returned at 7:00pm!

206
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,566
You too, Mr. Shiromoto...?

207
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,469
No, I forgotimy lunch...

208
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,572
so I went back to the hotel once
around 12:30 noon.

210
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,976
I had lunch with Mr. Mourns
and left the hotel at 1:30pm.

212
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,246
Did you see Chizuru then?

213
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,484
I went to check on her as soon as
I-got back to the hotel, but...

215
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,455
since she didn't answer the door
when If knocked, l.returned .to thé. lobby...

217
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:12,725
Which means that Mr. Miyabe,
you were all alone

219
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,260
while Mr. Shiromoto
was back here at the hotel?

221
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,730
Y. Yes of course...

222
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,933
I was eating lunch at the lakeside!

223
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,736
How: aboutyyou two?
Mr. Arimori and Shinobu?

225
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,640
We went with Conan and Ran to
the highlands at the top of the mountain.

227
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,444
We. left right after
Mr. Shiromoto and Mr. Miyabe left,

229
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,880
and arrived at the highlands
around 11.00am.

231
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,082
We were there all through

232
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:39,551
and started down at around 6:00pm.

233
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,088
We got back to the hotel around 7:00pm.

234
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,991
I hear only you, Mr. Arimoril,
remained at the highlands?

236
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,327
The engine of my van
wasn't functioning too well...

238
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,065
When you went to pick him up,
was Mr. Animori there?

240
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,332
Of course!

241
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,603
I was with her,
so there's no doubt about it.

243
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,072
How about you two,
Minaho and Honami?

245
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,642
We were cleaning the hotel
in the morning.

247
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,577
Since Mr. Shiromoto came back and

248
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,614
started eating lunch with Mr. Mourn,

249
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:10,149
we served them tea

250
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,885
and went to have lunch in the office.

251
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,121
After seeing Mr. Shiromoto off at 130pm,

252
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,558
we watched TV till 4.00pm

253
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,760
After that, we were in the kitchen

254
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,397
making preparations
for dinner until everyone returned

256
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,500
When you did the cleaning,
what did you do about Chizuru's room?

258
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,271
The manager had told us
not to disturb her sow...

261
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,206
we didn't go near her room.

262
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,875
Were you at the hotel
right through, Mr. Moun?

264
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,077
Yes, I was watching TV
in the lobby right through.

266
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:44,216
After Mr Jomoto went to check on
her at around 12:30 noon...

268
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,385
nobody used the stairs by the lobby.

269
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,654
Which means,

270
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:52,024
the killer must've entered the hotel
from the emergency exit.

272
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,226
Please describe the emergency exit.

273
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,796
There are emergency exits
at the end of the corridor on every floor.

275
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,733
The doors are auto-lockable,
but can be opened freely from the inside

277
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,402
In order to come in from outside,

278
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,737
you need to use
the master key to open the door.

280
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,942
WwW Which means
the killer as a personnel of the hotel!

282
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,512
No, because I had
the master key with me...

284
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,615
They, probably.had. made
a 'spare key"beforehand.

286
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,550
If so, the killers are...

287
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,952
those two!

288
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,351
Huh?!

289
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,488
We haven't done anything!!

290
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,893
Those two were watching TV
with me from 1:30pm to 4:00pm!

292
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,428
If so, then all three of you
are in this together!

294
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,130
Don't be ridiculous!

295
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:37,069
Either I, who couldn't get a hold
of the master key, am not the killer...

298
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,538
There is a way

299
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,540
to come in through the emergency exit
even without the master key...

301
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,476
No, there is a way

302
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,778
to come in through the emergency exit
even without the master key...

304
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,980
What?!

305
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,814
Huh?

306
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:54,319
For instance, Mr. Shiromoto, when you
went to check on Chizuru at 12:30pm...

308
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,422
the door can be opened
from the inside.

310
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,360
Then stick a pebble or something between
the door so that it won't close completely.

312
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,597
After making it look like
you returned to the lakeside,

314
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,101
you actually entered the hotel from
the emergency exit and killed Chizuru...

316
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,202
N.No...

317
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,238
He's pretty good...

318
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,106
As for Miyabe

319
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,775
if Mr. Shiromoto were his accomplice,

320
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,043
carrying out the murder
would've been possible.

322
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,112
What a thing to say, officer!

323
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,916
If you returned to the hotel
hidden in Mr. Shiromoto's car,

325
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,085
and went into the hotel from the door
that he had left opened...

327
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,021
That is enough!

328
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,124
You're treating us
as if we were the killers.

330
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,593
Uh, well, I don't mean...

331
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,062
What about you people?!

332
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,764
Just what do you mean?

333
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,968
There is a possibility that you people
have spares to the master keys...

335
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,702
You could've secretly come
down:from the mountain

337
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,838
Please don't say such silly things!

338
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,542
In order to return to this hotel
from the highlands and the lake...

340
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:55,147
it is necessary to cross the bridge over
the Tani River, that is under construction.

342
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,950
IV confirmed with
the workers there a while ago,

344
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,019
and was told that the only car
that crossed that bridge

346
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,488
in the afternoon
was Mr. Shiromoto's car.

348
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:04,957
In other words,

349
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,457
the people who were capable of
committing the crime are...

351
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,659
Mr. Shiromoto,

352
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,294
Mr:-Miyabe,

353
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,529
Minaho and Honami,

354
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,966
and you, Mr. Mouri.

355
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,168
Me too?!

356
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,770
It's exactly as Officer Mito says but...

357
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,273
Something's not right...

358
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:22,941
For instance...

359
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,544
The air conditioner that wasn't running...

360
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,181
The white powder
that was on Chizuru's skirt...

362
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,650
What on earth was it...

363
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,587
I see, maybe

364
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,996
This is similar to a runway...

365
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:50,769
What's that...?!

366
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,739
It looks like a mark that was made
by rope rubbing against the wall...

368
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,088
Officer.

369
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,692
Mr. Mouri told asked me to...

370
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:14,826
What...?

371
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:20,098
So, 1d like you all, Mr. Shiromoto,
Mr. Miyabe, Minaho, Honami,

373
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,101
and Mr. Mouri to come to the station
with me for more detailed questioning...

375
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,605
You, just who do you think
I am anyway?!

377
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:27,272
Ugh!

378
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:29,775
Siege : is overtaking mice.

379
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,411
What's the:matter; Mr:Mouri?!

380
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,582
Please wait! It's the beginning
of the Sleeping Kogoro!

382
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:42,254
What...?! So this is the rumored...!!

383
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,690
Please leave the rest up to me!

384
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,825
You mean you know who the killer is?

385
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,529
Yes! I know who the killer is,
as well as the trick that was used!

387
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:52,864
I he tric 7

388
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,634
The killer has wings

389
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,738
Magic wings which
makes what seems to be impossible

391
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,074
possible...!

392
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,710
Yes .the killer is

393
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:05,844
% oul!

394
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:14,052
Yes, the killer is you,
Mr. Mitsuhiko Arimoni!!

396
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,325
WwW .,What are you talking about?!

397
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:25,097
I was with Ran and the others up
in the highlands right through, you know?

399
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:28,900
That's right!
Mr. Arimori could never be the killer!

401
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:34,306
That's why I just said that
Mr. Arimori has magic wings...

403
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,441
What do you mean by magic wings...?

404
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,109
Hmm?

405
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,616
What was that...

406
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,586
That's the magic wings.

407
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,190
This was in the store room on the roof.

408
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,460
It's a hang-glider.

409
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,027
What?!

410
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,597
And, there were marks

411
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,933
of the wall of the roof being rubbed
against by a rope or something

413
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,702
right above the victim's room.

414
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,437
I see...!

415
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,806
Mr. Arimori used that hand-glider and...

416
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,643
flew from the highlands to the hotel,
then landed on the roof:

418
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,213
He went down to the veranda
of Chizuru's room using a rope.

420
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,848
After killing her,

421
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,185
he flew back to the highlands
with his hand glider...

423
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,588
That's impossible...

424
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,324
the only time I was away
from everybody is when

426
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,794
I went back to the car to get the lunches,
which took me only 4 to 5 minutes...

428
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,631
It would take at least 15 minutes
only to set the hand-glider up too...

430
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,867
Besides, judging from
the direction of the wind and the height,

432
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,570
I think it'd be impossible to go from
the hotel back to the highlands

434
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,438
Mr. Mourn...

435
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,774
It is indeed as you all say.

436
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,611
But, if only to strangle Chizuru,

437
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,613
4 to 5 minutes would be enough,

438
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,615
If she were near him!

439
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:51,817
What?!

440
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,252
W., What are you talking about?!
Chizuru was back at the hotel...

442
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,654
I get it!

443
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:57,355
The van!

444
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,356
Right.

445
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,360
Before leaving, Mr Arimori said he was
going to check if the doors were locked...

447
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,397
and let Shinobu and the others
go on ahead of him

449
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,866
He then, went over to Chizuru's room,

450
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,402
passed her out
with a stun gun or something,

452
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,471
Ioaded her into the car
with the hand glider

454
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,140
and headed off for the highlands.

455
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,343
Officer Mito,
when you went to check the room,

457
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,513
did you realize that
the air conditioner wasn't running?

459
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,247
Yes.

460
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:27,719
What you're saying is that Chizuru
was not in her room since before noon?

462
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,554
Exactly.

463
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,756
And at about 2:00pm,

464
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:36,094
after telling everybody that he was
going to getthe lunches, he left them,

466
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:40,031
hung Chizuru,
who was passed out in the van,

468
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,601
with a rope and killed her.

469
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,737
He stayed back at the highlands alone

470
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,806
saying that his van
wasn't functioning right.

472
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:50,775
He then assembled the hand-glider,

473
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,111
carried Chizuru on his back

474
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,213
and flew off the highlands.

475
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,518
The roof is brightly lit so

476
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,288
I don't think he had
any problem getting to his destination

478
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,924
After you landed on the roof

479
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,759
you went down using a rope,

480
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,496
into the room from the window
that you had left opened beforehand,

482
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,198
and hung the corpse.

483
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,635
After rigging the door guard
and closing the door,

485
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,204
You left the hotel
from the emergency exit...

487
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,139
Ridiculous!

488
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,276
So, how did I get back
to the highlands after that?!

490
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:28,947
Right! When Ran and I got to
the highlands Mr. Arimori was there!

492
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,349
Maybe he used
a motorbike or something?

494
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,052
The workers at the bridge
would see him, wouldn't they?

496
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,290
If he were to have flown off
from this hotel which is at a low position,

498
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,492
it wouldn't been impossible for him
to get back to the top of the! mountain!

500
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,195
That's why I've been telling you,
Mr. Arimori used magic

502
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,264
Magic that would
enable him to get back

504
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,166
to the highlands
without anyone noticing him!

506
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,002
Not your incomprehensible
+ remark again...

508
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,939
The seed of magic is your car, Shinobu.

509
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,606
What?!

510
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,374
Mr Arimori

511
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,810
who asked you to come to
the highlands for him on his cell phone,

513
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,581
hid in the trunk of your car!

515
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:08,153
Without, realizing it,
Shinobu was used

517
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,088
as a means of
transportation for Mr. Arimor.

519
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:12,089
When the car arrived in the highlands,

520
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,428
Mr. Arimori waited for Shinobu and Ran
to walk away from the car,

522
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,896
and snuck out of the trunk.

523
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:22,233
Then he appeared before the two ladies
as if he had always been there...

525
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:24,836
Mr. Arimorl...

526
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:25,503
That's...

527
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,006
That's no more
than plain assumption!

529
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,674
Do you have any proof?!

530
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:36,348
Yes... Yes, that's right All right.

531
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,217
Mr. Mouri the inspection officers
have informed us

533
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,653
the powder that was
on the victim's skirt

535
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,822
was the scale
of the Miyama White Butterfly!

537
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,925
So, there it is

538
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,695
It has been verified that the scales
of the Miyama White Butterfly

540
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,365
that exits only in the vicinity
of the top of the mountains,

542
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:57,102
was found on the skirt of the victim,
who had not set a foot out of her room.

544
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,536
According to Ran,

545
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:04,041
the butterfly stopped on
Mr. Arimori's shoulder and died, right...

547
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:07,012
The scales probably rubbed off
on his shirt at that time.

549
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,081
Unaware, the scale
rubbed off on Chizuru's skirt

551
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,384
when he carried her on his shoulder.

552
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,320
Why did you kill her?

553
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,392
To avenge my brother's death...

554
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:20,858
What?!

555
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,227
Revenge. .?

556
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,562
When my younger brother Teruhiko

557
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,931
was going to a university in Tokyo,

558
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,534
he met Chizuru who was just
starting her career as an actress...

560
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,973
Teruhiko instantly
fell in love with beautiful Chizuru...

562
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,443
To Chizuru...it may just
have been a playful love affair...

564
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,980
Rather, she was after
his money to begin with...

566
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,183
She needed a huge amount of cash
to get herself started...

568
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,954
Having acted in a drama,
she eventually started becoming popular.

570
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,690
That's when she started
staying away from Teruhiko.

572
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,030
In order to keep Chizuru
from parting from him any further,

574
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,232
he began spending
more and more money on her...

576
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,468
He even went as far as
to use this hotel, that was

578
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,504
the estate our father left us as collateral
for a mortgage without telling me...

580
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,041
What? Which means that this hotel is...?

581
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,243
Someone else owns it now.

582
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,413
I'm working here as manager
thanks to the owner's kindness...

584
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,549
And, what is your brother doing now...?

585
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,552
Teruhiko who was crushed with grief,

586
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,788
recklessly maneuvered
the hand-glider and...

588
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,463
My younger brother got too close
to the sun named Chizuru,

590
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,232
burned his wings and fell to his death.

591
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,633
He ls the wretched Icarus...

592
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,303
You did it because
of a grudge you had against her?

594
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:42,540
I invited Chizuru out
to the restaurant last night...

596
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,245
I just wanted hero say
one word of apology to my brother.

598
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,646
However...

599
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,383
I don't remember a thing!
What's with this picture!

601
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,685
How should I know who he is!

602
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:59,224
I am your ex boyfriend,
Teruhiko Arimorfs, older brother.

604
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:02,861
My brother died In grief...

605
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,964
W., What are you getting at?!

606
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:08,700
I went with him only because
he was really persistent!

608
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,404
He fell in love of his own choice
and died of his own choice!

610
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,406
It is not my intention
to blame you for anything at this point

612
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,276
My only wish is that
you visit my brother's grave

614
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,111
and say a word of apology to him!

615
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,980
Cut it out, won't you!

616
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:23,548
What did I do?!

617
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:24,949
It is none of my business!

618
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,087
That is when...

619
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,124
I decided to kill Chizuru...

620
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,560
I wonder if your younger brother
Isthappy about this?

622
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,232
Butterflies are said
to be the soul of the dead.

624
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:47,472
To me, it looks as though your
younger brother's soul tried to stop you,

626
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:52,210
and stopped
to rest on your shoulder...

Dad sure is late...

671
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,873
- I wonder where he's buying the stuff...

672
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:30,742
Over there...

673
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,108
Huh?

674
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,079
Hey girlie let's have tea together!
Hey, there cutie-pie!

676
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,355
Daaaaadd!!

677

Huh?

679
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:56,467
This Icarus sure Is helpless...

680
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:01,204
Because of the
mysterious name that the officer

682
00:24:01,205 --> 00:24:05,610
who was run over kept repeating
towards the hit-and-run criminal,

684
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,245
this case was named
the Shushiro case.

686
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:09,280
A grand investigation network

687
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,882
that had never been seen in the past
was carried out but...

689
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:14,085
Because the officer who
was thought to have the case...

691
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,053
had died...

692
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,788
the case stayed as Is .

693
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,890
And, 3 years ago the case expired...
