00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:22,988
A reckless chase of a. here wannabe
officer led to an unnecessary death...

275
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:23,689
Oh no...

276
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:24,856
Oh no.

277
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,226
We weren't just a hero-wannabe!

278
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,096
We were chasing him "ll the way
from the store.

280
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:33,065
We were doing really good
unti we cornered onfthe roof

282
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:38,471
It happened all of a sudden
There's no way we could stop him!

284
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:39,939
Right Conan!

285
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,075
Yeah He jumped off
the/building without any hesitation.

287
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:48,047
As if the planned"to do it
from the beginning...

289
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:50,983
I see...So...

290
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:54,870
You guys wore there when the robber
broke into the jewelry store. correct?

292
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:59,125
Yes! We saw Detective Takagi
walking into that store. so...

294
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:02,528
Wow, Takagl goes to a jewelry store I
)n his day off...

296
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,564
For...what kind of occasion...

297
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:07,666
Huh?

298
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,202
Ah, no, actually.
That was... for...

300
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:11,337
Hmm.

301
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:15,508
I didn't know you Wed jowelnias and stuff, «
Taka yl. It's surprising!

303
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,312
It- was for you! Ms. Sato!

304
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,349
So. did you find any jewelry you like? {

305
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,501
Huh! Actually...

306
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:28,637
The robber took it justfbefore he bought it!

307
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:30,523
Lidropped it on the floor and then

308
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:32,825
The robbor took it away

309
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:37,779
Yeah dHe pickedkit up
and put it in the pocket of his raincoat!

311
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,932
Then that thing 1s supposed"
be in his pocket still

313
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,534
Yeah but the thing is!

314
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:46,005
I went onathe truck And checked
his pocket before you guys came

316
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:49,074
But the broche was not the O at "ll!

317
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:50,810
Brocho. huh

318
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,345
It's a present for your mom, isn't it?

319
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:57,216
No. that's ....a presont for you!

320
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:59,985
Oh no. no way. Hahaha

321
00:12:59,986 --> 00:13:04,223
Well, perhaps,
the robber threw it away or dropped it.

323
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:07,693
@r. maybe it just popped out of his pocket
when he fell.on the container...!

325
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:12,064
In-cither case, I think you should forget
about that broche... Huhuhuh...

327
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:17,303
I ven if it's found. prosecutors will keep it
for a while since it's material evidence...

329
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:21,307
Who would want a jewelry
that has a bloody past anyway. right? €¢

331
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:24,276
That's true...sigh .

332
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,146
Well. I wouldn'timind at all...

334
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,081
Even if it's got someone's blood on it

335
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,683
you can just wipe it off
Jewelries have nothing to do with crime...

337
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:32,784
Yeah that's what I thought!

338
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:35,688
Oh, also
There're some other strange things!

340
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,956
Really?

341
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:38,824
The robber was wearing a helmet... 7

342
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,494
But there's no way 'he could bleed
that much on his heady

344
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:44,230
Unless he removed his helmet
while falling down

346
00:13:49,936 --> 00:13:50,970
seed.

348
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:52,705
And ono moro thing.

349
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,306
Dotective Takagr sad police
to the robber in the store.

351
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,741
When he said it...

352
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:59,178
He robber actually smiled...

353
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,614
As If he was whiting for
the police officers to come!

355
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:03,616
Smi ed?

356
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:05,150
Are ou sure?

358
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:10,856
If he did smile... then that means
he was well prepared forahis getaway...

360
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:14,393
Maybe there was somaothing
that supposedly granteed his life

362
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,729
even after jumping off the building... Yes?

363
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,985
So: removing his helmet while falling down
was actuallyta part of his escape plan?

365
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:26,872
I don't know. Anyway,
we have to identify the dead body first...

367
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:28,274
Sir. you can't come in!

368
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,308
HMM! ?

369
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,210
No. hetlooks-like someone that I know...

371
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,013
Yeah, he IS Mr Atomural

372
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:34,813
What?

373
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:39,385
I own a restaurant over there, and
he was one of the regu ar customers.

375
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:42,154
I think he s working
for Mr Nekota's company

377
00:14:42,155 --> 00:14:43,422
Nekota!?

378
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,391
Do you know him?

380
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:49,194
The robber fell on the moving truck...

381
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:51,063
which was carrying the furniture:of

382
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:55,434
Mr. Nekota. the man over there.

384
00:14:58,605 --> 00:14:59,738
Oh: Mr Atomurat!?

385
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:01,240
He's Mr. Atomura!

386
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:02,408
Why did you.../

388
00:15:03,743 --> 00:15:05,978
SO he is one of our staff, right.

390
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,113
Yes. . Untilillast week though

394
00:15:08,882 --> 00:15:09,949
\) «in
Untilillast week?

398
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,216
He had been working for me

400
00:15:11,217 --> 00:15:13,919
Since the company was established...

401
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,021
but we're facing
some financial difficulties nght now.

403
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:17,656
ISO-l. had to lbmke him leave unfortunately...

404
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,626
It was necess ry because
our-company needs to scale back...

406
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,596
But I didn't know
it was gonna end up like this...

408
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:27,232
So the fact you're moving today
1s Also for the scale back?

410
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:28,634
You got that right

411
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,738
This building's got a smaller room
but also a cheap rent. so...

413
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:35,507
Where was the previous office by the way?

414
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:37,576
It's the building

415
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:40,079
Right across this one. on the top floor...

420
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:44,383
It's rea close.

421
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:47,886
Then,
shall we go and see the previous office?

423
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:49,922
Ah, why do you need to?

424
00:15:50,423 --> 00:15:53,993
Leena: 1 RO oo OX.

426
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,262
Fem fio mel xo Om = Mine of doe

429
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,165
Hi, sir?

430
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:04,336
Have you met these officers before?

431
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:06,605
No. Why would I have?

432
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,708
Ws I've never done. something bad bofore!

433
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:15,781
This is Mr. Atomura's locker...

435
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:15,981
This is Mr. Atomura's locker...

437
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:16,582
This is Mr. Atomura's locker...

438
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:16,782
This is Mr. Atomura's locker...

440
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:17,449
This is Mr. Atomursfs locker...

442
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,484
And this is

443
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:21,320
the desk he was using before

444
00:16:21,354 --> 00:16:22,388
I see .

445
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:25,190
You got a lot of things in this office still.

448
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:26,692
Yes.

449
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,762
To make a clean start. we decided to buy
new lockers, desks and chairs.

451
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:32,598
So that'siwhy things are still here.

452
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:37,002
It seems there's nothing
that's related to the robbery...

454
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:39,338
There s nothing mm his desk too

455
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,607
But. it's kind of*strangc. I think

456
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:44,626
This iman wns fired week ago,
but a lot of his stuff Is still in this office.

458
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:45,044
Why is 11?

459
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:46,679
Why is it?

460
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,830
That

461
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:52,217
I didn't want the workers
to be upset over the dismissal

463
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:55,587
So I decided to keep it secret
until our new company gets stable

465
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:58,624
I told them he was on a business trip...

466
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,262
Ikasked him to comerand-get his stuff
after moving-theroffice.»secretly...

469
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,632
Isn't that the truck that the guy crashed?

470
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,716
Oheyeah. it is!

471
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:09,385
We, can-see the truck
imsfront-of this building.

Whatido\ ou think,

478
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:22,614
That's impossible

479
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:25,551
He was holding a bag of jewelries.
Remember?

481
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,887
Even the world class long jumpers
Can go 9 meters or so

483
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:32,191
A-normalisperson wouldneteeven

Below that office is his living space...

That office 1s four stories above
which is the 9th floor...

500
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,891
So this room is on the 5th floor .

501
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:07,559

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,065
Is that for a sports bicycle?

505

00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:50,536
My name Is Isaka
I'm living on the 6th floor...

00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:52,504
Three days ago. around 2 am midnight...

I woke up:hecause I heard this noise
from the window.

529
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,476
And when I looked atlit.

530
00:18:57,477 --> 00:19:01,113

I guess:a thin long stick. on the curtain! I

532
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:04,583
So I woke my husband up right away.

He chocked tho terraco.
Where I saw the shadow.

but nothing was there...

536
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:12,089
My husband said it was just a dream

537
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,827

540
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,633
Yeah.
It's room-605, just right above.

542
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:25,904
Then, did you hear the same noise
when there was the robbery over there?

545
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,740
Because I was watching Iv...

546
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:32,144
Honestly. I didn't even know about the
robbery until I heard the police car siren...

548
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,145

549
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:34,396

550
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:38,050
It ok if we start moving the stuff now?

551
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,587
Lod WOW wn YOO ERA
three more trips to move everything

554
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,655
Two or three more tips?

555
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,357
From the old office?

556
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,425
Ah yes .

557
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:49,962
We got a lot of stuff because
the whole 9th floor was our. office.

559
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,831
We got storage,
meeting room and: all that...

561
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:53,932
Hmm.

566
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:00,305
We got the pictures of the scene

567
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:03,308
nd the fake gun the robber
used to threaten people.

569
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,577
We also got the jewelrics back

570
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:08,512
Except-that broche.

571
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:11,083
So I think you can start moving now...

572
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:14,453
But you leave the cover on the container

573
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:15,587
You can start now

574
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,456
but once you're done

575
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:20,158
the police is gonna take the truck
forrarwhile. ok

577
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,260

We also had to wait for a while
in front of his office. you know...

654
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:22,820
Plus. he canceled us twice in a row...

656
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,159
We were actually supposed to do
the moving the day before yesterday

658

said he can't make it...
