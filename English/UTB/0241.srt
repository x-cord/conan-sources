1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,002
Even destiny serves
as a clue to deduction

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,571
and the light of truth pierces
throughsthe most mysterious case.

5
00:00:06,106 --> 00:00:07,506
The "Hope" in the case
comes with Tokyo approaching.

7
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,242
What us to be with the two police officers?

8
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,310
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,845
A child in appearance
with the 1. Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,481
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,448
On board the Shinkansen from Osaka,

14
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,919
we run into Officers Sato and Takagi
escortin Ta suspect

16
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,223
However, a bomb scare happens
inside the train.

18
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,525
Officer Sato heads for the location

19
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:09,695
Meanwhile,

20
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,465
the-suspectithe Officers arefescorting
decides he wants to go to a restroom.

22
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,400
Reluctantly, Officer Takagi takes him
to the john without his backup...

24
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,103
There,

25
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,738
the suspect tries to commit suicide!

26
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:19,772
However,

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,617
Escort on the Shinkansen" Part ll

28
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,390
Yes,

29
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,859
This is undisputedly a murder case!

30
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,061
Murder!?

31
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,562
Yes...

32
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:48,334
First, the culprit set up a bomb scare
in the train car at the back...

34
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,403
I was forced to go there.

35
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,472
In no way that Officer Takagi
will not suspect,

37
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,375
The culprit sent a message to Ogura,

38
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,110
telling him to go to the restroom
in the train car ahead of him.

40
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,648
Ogura was made to pretend to
commit suicide

42
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,517
with the knife and fake blood
hid in inside the toilet!

44
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:10,623
That way, Officer Takagi will remove
his handcuffs to call me.

46
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,894
When Officer Takagi left,
the culprit who was hiding...

48
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,031
Immediately went to the toilet

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,137
And, killed Ogura!

50
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:31,343
But, but... the knife was stabbed deep

51
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,346
I looked inside the john to check
before Ogura entered.

53
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,282
I didn't see any knife or fake blood.

54
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,983
Probably

55
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,553
the knife didn't have
any blade from the handle!

57
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,520
It must have been a fake knife!

58
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,559
The hiding place was probably...

59
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,429
The rack behind
this diaper-changing table.

61
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:53,566
There must have beemfake blood
and knife here with a memo.

63
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,403
With the table raised, it can't be found.

64
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,038
What memo?

65
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,741
A memo describing
a fake plan to dupe Ogura.

67
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,709
What!

68
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,978
The memo must have said,
I planted a bomb.

70
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,948
Use the fake blood and knife
and pretend to commit suicide.

72
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,816
When the cop is gone...

73
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,687
I will cut the handcuffs lose and
Iet you escape when the bomb explodes.

75
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,860
But, why did you call Sato
on 'the cell phone?

77
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,962
WwW, Well...

78
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:26,198
Right at that moment, we were
in a tunnel, and the cell phone didn't...

81
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,167
Yes,

82
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:33,739
There must have been a watch with the
memo, and the memo must have said.

84
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,444
Take action when the train enters
Shintanna Tunnel...

86
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,082
We've been framed...

87
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:50,422
But, with all this blood, the culprit must
have a lot of blood on him as well.

89
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,224
You're right...

90
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,395
People will notice if you go back
with blood all over you...

92
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,898
In Ran"s car...

93
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,466
Did you find somebody like that?

94
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,600
Oh, yes!

95
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:06,038
After Officer Takagi took
the suspect to the restroom,

97
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,007
I was watching the door.

98
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,677
But, only Officer Takagi returned...

99
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:20,886
the culprit left Car #3 and headed toward
Car #13, toward the head of the train.

101
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,489
That'll makes him hard to find!

102
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:25,790
What's this?

103
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,927
Something inside his bloody hand...

104
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,230
Something attaches...

105
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,535
So, that's'it... The culpritiused this for...

106
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,038
Ouch

107
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,508
I told! you to watch himl's

108
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,509
Oh, yes...

109
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:48,847
But, how could the culprit send
the message 'Go to the toilet?" to Ogura,

111
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,783
without Officer Takagi noticing?

112
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,186
Hey, Officer Takagi!

113
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:54,520
Y. Yes.

114
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,158
After I went to the back car
of the Shinkansen,

116
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,595
did you see anybody suspicious?

117
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,698
No one in particular .

118
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,302
After you left, I think two or three
passengers passed by our seats.

120
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,939
Who were they?
Do you remember their faces?

122
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,342
Well...it was just for a very short time...

123
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,076
I remember!

124
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:18,677
What!?

125
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,547
Only three passed by the aisle.

126
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:26,418
Two men were holding newspapers and
another man carried a can of coffee.

128
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,021
Those three, do you think
you can identified them?

130
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,456
Yes!

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,493
What!

132
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,061
Inside the: restroom,

133
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,862
a man was killed...

134
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,668
Then, why do we have to
be interrogated by police! Huh?

136
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:46,639
Well... because just before
the man left for the restroom,

138
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,809
you three passed by the seats.

139
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,046
We suspect that one of you had
signaled this man to go to the restroom.

141
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:56,982
If you don't mind,

142
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,919
we would like to know why
you had passed by his seat at that time

144
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:01,820
My seat was four rows behind you.
Tatsuro Ilwakuni

146
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,723
My seat was four rows behind you.
Tatsuro Ilwakuni
SE =EBB (47)

149
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:04,990
My seat was four rows behind you.
Tatsuro lwakuni

151
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:05,557
My seat was four rows behind you.

152
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:09,028
When I heard the noise
In the car behind me getting louder,

154
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:13,599
I moved to the car ahead of me because
I wanted to listen to the radio

157
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,134
I DUE.

158
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,568
How about you?

159
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,336
Well...

160
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:17,703
Well...
Norio Tokuyama

163
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:20,673
I bought a can of coffee from a vending
machine and was returning to my seat.
Norio Tokuyama

167
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,574
I bought a can of coffee from a vending
machine and was returning to my seat.

169
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:27,780
At that time, I heard that there was
a bomb In one of the restrooms...

171
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,849
I never thought that somebody got killed.

172
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,951
The next p

173
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,089
I got scared about the bomb
and moved to the train car ahead
Akira Akashi

176
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,924
I got scared about the bomb
and moved to the train car ahead

178
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,728
I have been told that Mr. Akashi
and Mr. llwakuni were both holding

180
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,297
newspapers in your hands
when you passed by...

182
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:45,864
Yes.

183
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,499
Yes, I did, too.

184
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:52,137
Talking about newspapers,
this guy was reading one, too. Right?

186
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,706
Well... yes...

187
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,710
Then, could all three of you
bring the newspapers?

189
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,078
What?

190
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:05,050
Also... don't forget to bring
the can of coffee Mr. Tokuyama.

192
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:13,225
So, all three of them boarded
the train at Shin Osaka Station...

194
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:17,463
and=beforesboarding, you bought
newspapers at the kiosk on the platform.

196
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,100
Mr. lwakuni had Keiba7

197
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,971
Tokuyama had the morning edition of
Maicho Shimbun and a can of coffee.

199
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,540
Mr. Akashi got Nichiuri Sports.

200
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,045
None of these newspapers have
the words "toilet" orÃ©restroom"

202
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,546
written in large letters.

203
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,217
None of them have holes
or traces of blood...

205
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,420
The same is true for the can.

206
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,192
There is no way a message
to go to the toilet can be sent.

208
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,963
What...? Wait...

209
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,565
This must be...

210
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:59,171
What!? A man stabbed himself
while sitting on the toilet!?

212
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,640
Isn't that supposed to be suicide?

213
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:04,476
Well... that was a hoax
to try to deceive us.

215
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,645
When we returned,
the knife had been removed.

217
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,349
The blade of the knife
was pointed the strange way.

219
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,550
Then...

220
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,253
Because it was hard to remove the knife,

221
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,522
he may have tried to stand up and
pull it out with both hands?

223
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:17,523
Ah...

224
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,558
He is right!

225
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,361
If he had pulled out the knife
standing up,

227
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:25,063
you'll never know
which way the knife will turn!!

229
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,334
You mean to tell me
that you suspect us just because of that!?

231
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,469
Well...

232
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,373
Anyway: ll'refuse to remain
after the train arrives in Tokyo!!

234
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,441
Me, too!

235
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,376
Same here!

236
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,013
Mr. Mouwurt...

237
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,414
What is it?

238
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,319
Do you remember what you bought at
the platform kiosk in Shin Osaka Station?

240
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,154
Well... Let's see...

241
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,356
There's "Keiba 7"

242
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,394
Nichiuri Sports" and canned coffee...

243
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,230
And I think, two packs of cigarettes.

244
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,832
What's that has to do with this?

245
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,202
Well... nothing...

246
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,040
My hunch is right.

247
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,947
The culprit said something strange...

248
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,949
That person

249
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,686
How he made Ogura
come to the restroom

251
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,955
How he killed him...

252
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,090
I got it all!

253
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:30,295
Even something that you missed!y ,~

254
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,407
Suicide, of course! It was suicide, alright!

255
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,913
If it is not murder,
we have nothing/totdo with it!

257
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:49,648
Well...

258
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,784
There's nothing more to talk about...!

259
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,354
Thank you very much for
boarding the Nozomi...

261
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,257
We are now arriving at
the terminal Tokyo Station.

263
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,191
It's time to leave, bye...

264
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,159
I'm leaving too, I need to pack my things

265
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,262
But... Wait...

266
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,830
We're in trouble...

267
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,433
getting our man killed on the train,

268
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,936
and if we let the killer go...

269
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:12,938
we're seriously in trouble.

270
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,475
Especially you, Takagi,
having been by his side...

272
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,377
You're really gonna get it!

273
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,914
Well, not to worry!

274
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,983
If you get fired, you can become...

275
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,919
* My assistant at the detective office...

276
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,798
Mr... Mour:...?

277
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,969
Well, just a fleeting thought...

278
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,106
make you my assistant... just

279
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:48,774
What's that?

280
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,777
Whether or not I will hire you as assistant

281
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:57,316
depends on whether you go through with
your job as police officer...

283
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,319
I need you to see the man behind you...

284
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,258
You fulfill your duty
and arrest the man as the murderer

286
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,560
Do you mean that...?

287
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,228
You found the murderer!?

288
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,997
The problem was...

289
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,433
how the culprit communicated
the message to go to the toilet

291
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,135
without Officer Takagi noticing.

292
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,772
This is where attention is directed to...

293
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,772
This is where attention is directed to...

294
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:25,911
When the three suspects
passed by Ogura...

296
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,647
Carrying newspapers and a can of coffee.

297
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,682
Do you get it, Officer Takagi?

298
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,519
There you see the characters
suggesting the toilet...

300
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,388
But where?!

301
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,255
Where can I find such characters?

302
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:42,427
There... can't you see that!

303
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,696
Tithe characters suggesting toilet...

304
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:54,606
The letters WC, meaning "water closet...
in there...

306
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,116
Officer Takagi!!

307
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,084
You mean to tell me...

308
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,555
The World Cup?!

310
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:11,523
1<o...

311
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:16,061
He carried the newspaper
to make the headline clear to see...

313
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,797
When he passed by Ogura's seat,

314
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,902
He pointed to the letters WC
to tell him to go to the toilet.

316
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,303
Isn't that night...

317
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,408
It. was the man carrying
this sports newspaper...

319
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,942
Mr. Akira Akashi?!

320
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,944
What?

321
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,283
You must be kidding...

322
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,520
Don't try to make me the culprit
just for carrying a sports newspaper...

324
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:42,954
You're right...

325
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:50,128
Associating the toilet with the letters WC
appears to be a bit unconvincing in logic.

327
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,599
That is why Mr. Akashi placed the bag
in the toilet cubicle in the bomb scare.

329
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,204
He made the train personnel report this
to the police:officer right in front of him

331
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:03,442
in order to emphasize
the word "toilet" to Ogura!

333
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:09,448
If he points to the letters W
and then points to the car ahead of him,

335
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,650
Without saying a single word,

336
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,885
Ogura will most certainly go to the toilet
in the car ahead of him...

338
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,089
Probably...

339
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,860
Mr. Akashi was watching Officer Takagi
buy the tickets at the station on that day...

341
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,032
Boarded the same Shinkansen train

342
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,401
and executed his plot to Kill...

344
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,674
Stop playing with me...

345
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,175
Oh! I'm sorry!

346
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,811
I thought you were asleep...

347
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:41,847
oc...

348
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,249
I have heard of you before,

349
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,586
but it was my first time seeing
Sleeping Kogoro" in action.

351
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,354
Sleeping Kogoro?!

352
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,523
You mean the famous detective?

353
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,325
Huh!

354
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,527
I don't care what kind of sleeper he is,

355
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:59,431
but there is no proof that I'm the killer

356
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,333
and you accuse me of the murder...

357
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,468
It is murder...

358
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:08,106
the knife we found
inside the toilet was very unnatural...

360
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,176
Did you hear what I said before?

361
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,578
He tried to pull out the knife but couldn't.

362
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,680
So, he stood up
and pulled it out with both hands.

364
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:19,985
Well, well... why do you have to stand up
to pull out the knife with both hands?

366
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:22,687
Are you fool?

367
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,056
You need to stand up to
reach for the knife with your left...

370
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,293
TOO.

371
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:33,064
certainly... Ogura was chained to
the handbar at that time

373
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,700
and could not have used both hands
unless he stood up...

375
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,870
What is strange... is that...

376
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:43,041
you have never seen the site of
the murder... why do you know?

378
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,177
J, Just my imagination!!

379
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,145
When the man stabbed himself,

380
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,781
I heard that the police officer went to
call the other officer...

382
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,785
Sol imagined that the handcuffs
were chained to the handbar .

384
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,287
Well...

385
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,756
how did you know that
the man had been in handcuffs?

387
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,592
When I pass by the seat of
this police officer

389
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,563
that man was sitting beside him
with both hands covered with cloth!!

391
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,298
Then...

392
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,533
how did you know that
the victim was the same man?

394
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,369
WwW .,Well just from
the course of developments...

396
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,541
Anyway, if you have so much to
complain about me, show me the proof!!

398
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,377
Did you find my fingerprints
on the weapon?

400
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,681
Do you see blood on my body?

401
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,884
Of course, there's no blood on you!

402
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,521
You have the victim hold the newspaper.

403
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,025
And then, you stabbed him
through the newspaper...

405
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:40,532
The proof is seen
in the bloody right hand of the victim.

407
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,869
A newspaper article was printed on
the palm of his right hand,

409
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,270
since he was grabbing
onto the newspaper.

411
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:49,808
So, I see... that way,
the killer won't get blood on his clothes.

413
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,877
What are you saying...

414
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,647
There is no hole or blood
on my newspaper!

416
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,949
That's why you bought two copies?

417
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,351
What!?

418
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:05,290
The same Nichiuri Sports that I bought
at the station, right, Conan?

420
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:06,358
See?

421
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,293
This is the same newspaper you have!

422
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,130
What proof is there
that I bought two copies?

424
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,967
Look. Look!
This newspaper looks strange!

426
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:25,143
Look, the newspaper that Uncle bought
and a newspaper that you bought...

428
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,846
They looks similar,
but the words are different!

430
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,650
You're right!

431
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,453
The headline on Father's copy says.
World Cup Hero Arrested,

433
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:39,791
but here, it say
World Cup Hero Interrogated.

435
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,396
That's the difference between newspapers
sold at stations and those sold elsewhere.

437
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,332
Unlike newspapers sold at convenience
stores or delivered to homes,

439
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,201
Newspapers sold at railway stations
are delivered late.

441
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,203
That's why, they can switch headlines
at the last minute.

443
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,439
Because this is big news,

444
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,275
the headlines for newspapers.sold
at stations had been replaced.

446
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,478
Then... The newspaper
that Mr Akashishad...?

448
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,747
He must have bought it
at a convenience store...

450
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,084
It must have been very convenient to. Â«
get Ogura to go to the toilet

452
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,422
He probably bought another
copy of the newspaper

454
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,625
while he waited for him to arrive
at the station...

456
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,660
To use to keep blood
for soiling his clothes...

458
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,730
He bought the same sports newspaper,

459
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:25,270
just in case people suspect him for not
having the newspaper after the murder.

461
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,473
No!! I just bought the same newspaper

462
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,209
because I found the difference
in headlines interesting.

464
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:37,147
Then show me the Nichirui Sports copy
that you bought at the station.

466
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:38,383
It. it's...

467
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:43,454
I bet it's been flushed away
in one of the toilets on the train.

469
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,325
We'll find out
when we check the septic tanks.

471
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,364
Thank you for boarding the Shinkansen...

472
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,468
Darn it!

473
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:06,044
I'm not gonna let you get away!

474
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,447
You...

475
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:10,315
You...

476
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,325
Now! You can't get away!!

477
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:23,328
That was fantastic, Officer Takagi!

478
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,397
Fast ball...that was the solution...

479
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,197
What did you say?

480
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,132
Oh... nothing...

481
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,368
Immediately after that,

482
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:35,807
Inspector Megure who had been waiting
in To + 0 Station arrested the killer...

484
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,642
and he was taken away
to the Police Agency...

486
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,814
The motive of the murder was
to seal the lips of the victim

488
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,382
regarding that drug trade route.

489
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,752
Ironically, the killer confessed,

490
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,322
and the route was uncovered and
destroyed successfully by the police

492
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,761
Thanks to this contribution, officers Sato
and Takagi managed not to get fired...

494
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,397
And Officer Takagi escaped the fate of
becoming Uncle's assistant...

541
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,593
A pay cut! We got a pay cut!

542
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,329
On top of the measly pay
we are getting in the first place...

544
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,831
Isn't that horrible?

545
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,865
Take it easy.

546
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:44,235
Actually, a pay cut affects
promotion, doesn't it?

549
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,870
True, true...

550
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,839
Don't take it too hard!

551
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,008
You're a girl and you can always find
a way out through marriage.

553
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,544
I'm not interested in marriage.

554
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,614
I want to work for peace
and security of the people of Tokyo.

556
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,651
Actually the problem is Takagi.

557
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:05,123
He's never gonna make it beyond the
post of deputy Inspector until retirement...

559
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:08,059
By the way...

560
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,093
Huh?

561
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,896
What's going on with him, Officer Takag:.
You like him?

563
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,164
What?

564
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,600
&x BB En

565
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:18,803
What?

566
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,706
& BB Uh

567
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,241
What?!

568
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,376
What's that surprise on your face?

569
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:31,015
As a veteran officer in the same section,
I must know about my colleagues.

571
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:32,817
VN EN... YES...

572
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,586
So...what do you feel about him?

573
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,722
Do you like him or not?

574
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,524
Are you in love?

575
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,758
Not... really...

576
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,595
I knew it!

577
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:47,799
He looked excited receiving
a ticket from you! Poor boy...

579
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,336
You shouldn't be teasing a boy like him.

580
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,637
You should find a right person.

581
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,739
Well... Okay...

582
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,608
Miwako... has fallen!

583
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:02,280
She's fallen for Operation Ticket Chase.

584
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:08,753
I'd better call the other half of
the pay cut pair about the good news.

586
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,089
You should find a right person

587
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,057
Huh!

588
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:19,030
Why should I be doing this...
this waste of time!

590
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:25,570
Thank you very much
for taking your time for coming here...

592
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:32,076
Don't take it too hard! You can make it up
with another successful arrest!

594
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,316
Officer Takagi!! What's with you!
Straighten up!

596
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,651
Straighten up...?

597
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,086
Were-going-after-thexcase-on 4th-St...!

598
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:43,554
Yes...

599
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,291
Officer-Satoiis~astenergeticras-ever...

600
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,427
Shezalso~got-a pay-cut.

601

Something-nice: must-have
happenedtto her...

603
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,735
Genta, what happened with you?

604
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:00,471
I'm afraid...

605
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,275
A killer is after me

606
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,354
Anyway explainjtoius!

607
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,823
Why would anyone want to kill you!?
