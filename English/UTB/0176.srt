1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,668
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,437
and the breeze is invisible

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,138
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,207
Today, those guys finally appear.

6
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,376
I'm going to expose
their black conspiracy.

8
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,944
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,880
A child in appearance
with the ll.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,882
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

13
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:04,123
Hey, did you see yesterday's game!
Twas really something, wasn't it?!

15
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,692
Yeah, you mean Hide's
over head kick,right?

17
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,061
He game's over...

18
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,265
That was Indeed a work of art!

19
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,500
Hide is the best!

20
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,536
It's time to wake up from your dream...

21
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,573
Let's celebrate our re-encounter .

22
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,777
With a rose, the flower that you like...

23
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,912
With color as red as that of blood

24
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,723
Yeah...Sherry...

25
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,686
Whew...what a terrible dream...

26
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:16,295
Re-Encounter with the Men in Black"
(Haibara's Story)

31
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,537
Here's the MO I borrowed!

32
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:29,742
Please tell Dr. Agasa that the game
was way more than we expected!

34
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,011
Yes... I'll tell him...

35
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,713
I didn't really care for the
boss character.though!

37
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,750
But, it was way better
than the previous game!

39
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,385
Wow, look, look!

40
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,121
See! It's snowing, it's snow!

41
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,055
What?!

42
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,056
No joke?!

43
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,127
Snow...

44
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,897
Let's celebrate our re-encounter.

45
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,668
With:a rose, the flower that you like...

46
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,771
With color as red as that of blood...

47
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,608
Sherry...

48
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,380
See, why don't look at the
snow by the window too, Al!

50
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,349
Don't touch me!

51
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,783
Huh?

52
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,552
Is something wrong?

53
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,724
I'm sick and tired of this place...

54
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,927
If I could, I\want to disappear
from here, right this minute...

56
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,332
it'll turn out that way in
time anyway,ll guess...

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,136
Huh?! Are you
changing schools, Al?!

60
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,806
Don't tell me that
someone Is bullying you?!

62
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,408
I'll get the guy so tell me who!

63
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,645
So, don't say that you're
going to go away!!

65
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,984
Only joke...Don't take me seriously...

66
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:45,818
Huh...?

68
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,854
was jus In 0 annoye
because I have a cold...

70
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,523
I didn't want to give it to you.

71
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,858
Oh, it's just a cold...

72
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,262
They say people get fussy
when they get sick so...

74
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,665
Come along, if you've got a cold you've
got to go to the infirmary to take a rest!

76
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,912
Here you go!!

77
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,213
I did it!

78
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,453
You're gonna get it, Mitsuhiko!

79
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,970
This is not where I belong...

80
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,175
I've got to get out of here fast,

81
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,377
so that I don't get those kids involved...

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,548
I'll bet you're thinking of
something stupid like that?

84
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,354
Don't worry.

85
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,557
It is a dream story for a body
to shrink with medicine.

87
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,961
Nobody would#believe it
nor even think of'it happening!

89
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:07,165
We've got to keep on acting like
children so that this won-tibe disclosed

91
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,437
ntil the time is right...

92
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,975
Don't worry!

95
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,478
If things start looking bad,
I'll do something about it for you!

97
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:26,252
Bye!

98
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,753
See you tomorrow!

99
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,554
Bye-bye!

100
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:29,455
Bye!

101
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:49,975
Shinichi...

102
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:50,276
Shinichi...

103
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,778
you don't know a thing.

104
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,082
They're not people that
ou can take on alone...

106
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,785
If we are ever off our guard,

107
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,421
that's it...they won't let us be...

108
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,525
Yes.... if...

109
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,127
Iike in my dream...

110
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,562
they are looking for us somewhere...

111
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,132
in this town...

112
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,046
What is it? Is something
wrong with that black Porsche?

114
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,819
Porsche 356A...

115
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,221
It's a classical car of 50 years ago...

116
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,124
The owner seems to be away.

117
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,294
I've only seen it on TV and in books,

118
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,531
but I guess there are people who
are really riding these cars around...

120
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,066
Gin...

121
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,370
Gin owns this...

122
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,011
?1 Gin...?]

123
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,779
Yes...

124
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,249
this car came out in my dream...

125
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,421
Hey, just what are you...?!

126
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:15,094
Oh, Doc? Willyyou bring-the following
things to the intersection of 4th street?!

128
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,696
I'll explain later! Hurry!!

129
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:25,804
Hey!

130
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,910
Did you bring the stuff?!

131
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,781
Y,Yeah... A wire
hanger and a wrench...

133
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,484
What are you going to
do with these things...?

135
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:43,722
H, Hey...

136
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,060
Old cars can be opened like this...

137
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,827
Shinichi?!

138
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,132
Just what are you going to do?!

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,268
I'm going to set a-wire tap
and transmitter up In the car.

141
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:59,938
But, you don't even know yet, if it's his...

142
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,077
Hmm? What's the matter?

143
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,514
OO... On the other side of the street...

144
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,382
On the other side of the street?

145
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,525
Gin... Vodka...

146
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,368
You idiot!!

147
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,575
Hmm...

148
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:40,612
The ground around the
car sure 1s messed up...

150
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,849
Maybe the passersby
were looking at your car,

152
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,784
ecause it's rare...

153
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,790
mF I11ioOoOocCcy... 1 Call LIHITITInK 101
myself, you German frog...

155
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,161
Bull's eye...

156
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,064
What a place to run into them...

157
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,134
I'm delighted... Gin!

158
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,310
I'm not letting them get away this time!!

159
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,694
Go straight...l want you to go after
them without getting too close...

161
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:29,795
No...

162
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,501
You won't be able to do a thing
even if you figure out where he is,

164
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:36,601
in our bodies now...

165
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,704
Do you have any idea,

166
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,441
what dangerous situation you are in now?

167
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,009
Shut up! Be quiet!!

168
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,211
Lephone...

169
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,682
Yeah, it's me...how's it going...?

170
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,253
What, he's hasn't come yet?

171
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,053
Phooey not big deal.

172
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,526
The target will come to Haido
City Hotel at 18:00 sharp...

174
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,463
Not even aware that it is going
to be his farewell party...

176
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,266
Target? Farewell party?

177
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,803
Anyway, we've got to shut him
up before he is arrested...

179
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,241
We can use that poison if needed...

180
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:17,843
The poison...?!

181
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,178
Don't goof, Pisco...

182
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:20,746
Pisco... .?

183
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:26,685
I've heard that code name before...
though I've never seen the person...

185
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,923
Haido City Hotel...

186
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,968
Reddish brown hair...?

187
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,338
Boss? What's up?

188
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,313
What is that...

189
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,416
It's probably a transmitter
and a wire tap...

191
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,617
Oh no, he's found it!!

192
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,218
W, What?!

193
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,462
I didn't think you'd
appear from your side...

195
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,332
I'm honored and welcome you...Sherry...

196
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,744
What're you going to do?
Things look really bad.

198
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,716
Your transmitter and wire tap have been
crushed, so we can't pursue them...

200
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,954
Moreover, the chewing gum that you
used to place them into their car...

202
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,322
IS In their hands...

203
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,591
If they ever check on that...

204
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,026
Don't worry!

205
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,527
I got rid of my teeth marks too,

206
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,797
and the most they can figure out
from my saliva is my blood type.

208
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,700
I wiped off all the
fingerprints in the car too.

210
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:53,404
Then, we should turn a corner and
pull away from them right away...

213
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:58,377
It's dangerous»to just vaguelyyfollow
the traces of their car like this...

215
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,646
Yeah...I'll stop pursuing them...

216
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,015
But, that doesn't mean
I'm going to run from them...

218
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,717
The Haido City Hotel...

219
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,821
They're planning to make a guy named
Pisco assassinate somebody there...

221
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:14,393
We've got to go to that hotel to
at least prevent the assassination...

223
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,995
My, how righteous...

224
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:18,997
Not for me

225
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,433
Besides, I'm not interested in
something abstract like righteousness...

227
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:27,639
I don't think we can do much anyway,
going to such a dangerous place...

229
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,742
Yeah...l don't intend
to take you along either.

231
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,146
It'll be too dangerous to take you along,

232
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,948
since they know what
you looke Mike, as a child.

234
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,019
Well, you just wait in the car with Doc!

235
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,890
If worse comes to worse, I'll at
Ieast try and get back the poison!

237
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,658
He poison...

238
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,627
Gin was saying,

239
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,563
We can use the poison if needed.

240
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,334
It's probably the APTX4869...

241
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,637
the one that shrunk our bodies...

242
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,439
the poison in question...

243
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,111
Yeah, right, Sherry...the chick
who betrayed the organization.

245
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,848
She should be headed that way soon...

246
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,486
If you don't know what she looks like
her up on the organization's data base.

248
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,823
After I check on whether she left anything

249
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,691
more than the wire tap and
transmitter that found,

251
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,693
I'll join you.

252
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,064
Yeah...I'm sure...she'll come...

253
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,101
because I mentioned the poison...

254
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,338
Its up to you whether you want to
take advantage of the dopey detective,

256
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,240
though...

257
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,178
Anyway, as soon as you find the chick,
how me what she looks like...

259
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,315
Yeah...No problem...

260
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,652
if she's gone from neck down...

261
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,175
Ghadsnlnl thought
you weren't interested?

263
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,144
I had no choice .

264
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,513
Because I'm the one
who made the poison.

266
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,549
I don't want you calling
me a killer anymore...

268
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,417
Be careful...

269
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,386
It's easy for them to tell too

270
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,655
the one who set the transmitter
will show up here too...

272
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,391
If they find out that you're involved...

273
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:27,893
Il be fine...

274
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,795
You got rid of the evidence, didn't you?

276
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,163
a simple prank or...

277
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:35,200
something done:by someone who
has a grudge against,the organization...

279
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:38,170
Are you sure it's this hall?

280
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,840
Yeah...Gin said that
it was a farewell partyO...

282
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,845
The guy called Pisco and-his target
are also supposed to come-here too.

284
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,614
That's enough talking already...

285
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,782
Here we go...

286
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:10,335
Damn...l know it's a farewell party, but
get a load of all the people in black...

288
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,138
Each and everyone of
them look suspicious...

290
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:15,807
Sherry...

291
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:24,916
Sherry...

292
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,087
Sherry...

293
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:33,925
A. Agh...

294
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,330
What's the matter
Iittle girl? Are you lost?

296
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,468
Uh-huh... we're looking
for them together...

298
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,036
Let's go, Hana!

299
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,178
Hey, what the hell is the matter
with you? It's not like you...

301
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,814
You're the one who said you
wanted to come along, right?

303
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,385
I saw asterrible dream...

304
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,286
A dream?

305
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,322
Gin found me on my
way back from school.

307
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,058
I was cornered into a back alley and...

308
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,128
You were the first one to get shot...

309
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,531
And with the dry sound
of the pistol going off,

311
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,166
people were killed one after the other...

312
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,036
Yes...just because they
were all involved with me...

314
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:26,845
Maybe I should've been executed
by them right there and then...

316
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,454
Do you know? You wear that
and nobody can tell who you are!

318
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,796
Oh my, then are you supposed to be
Superman without your glasses?

320
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,432
ThoughOI:can't fly!

321
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,602
Well, I guess it's better than nothing...

322
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,103
hank:wyou...

323
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,906
You've seriously got bad personality...

324
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:04,516
But, boss...l wonder if
she's really going to come?

326
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,385
She's that kind of ch

327
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,488
She'll try and stop the
poison from being used...

329
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,625
unaware that we will
e waiting for her...

331
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,928
What if she doesn't come?

332
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,733
At least I know that she's hiding
In the Beika Town vicinity...

334
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:27,038
If we find a clue as to where she lives,
hunting her down is no problem,

336
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,476
because traitors cannot
cover their smell up...

338
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,382
Indeed a farewell party for a master...

339
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,483

could he be a member

446

out when he's nabbed.

is after the life of that politician...

Now, can anyone tell me where
and when this film was taken?

482
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,704
Hey, that politician is leaving!

483
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,238
What?!

484
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,373
Hey, hurry up and look for him!!

485
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:42,774
Yes, sir!

486
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,010
Damn, where the hell
Is he?'Where'd he go?!

488
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,147
This is one of Dire
Sakamaki's major films!

490
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,350
The one that received various awards

491
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,553
the filming of "The Rainbow
Colored Handkerchief".

493
00:20:55,721 --> 00:21:00,358
This is an important slide of the time
the director's hair was still fluffy.

495
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:04,929
How is it?

496
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,198
No, we can't find him yet!

497
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,600
Look closer!

498
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,067
Yes, sir!

499
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,271
Let's go on to the next picture.

500
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:19,277
This looks to be a snap shot of lunch
they are having in between filming...

502
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,846
Although I'm pretty
sure you're all familiar.

504
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,582
Director Sakamaki used to love soba!

505
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,118
Since the filming of the "Rainbow
Colored Handkerchief" was in Shinshu,

507
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,887
everyday at lunch time,

508
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:33,725
he would go here and there to try out
one soba restaurant after another.

510
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,627
By the time filming ended,

511
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,363
it is said that-herused
to say gregariously that...

513
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,031
All the soba shops in
Shinshu are mine."

515
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,567
Let's go on to the next slide!
Let's roll it,one after the other.

517
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:43,268
Huh? A flash?!

518
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,771
Oh, I know how precious the picture is,

519
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,772
but it won't come out if
you use a flash unit!

521
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:52,544
What's that?

522
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,712
What was that sound?!

523
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:55,579
Above?!

524
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,083

Hey, what's up?!

527
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,588
What was that sound?!

528
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,123
Hurry, turn the lights on!!

529
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,595
