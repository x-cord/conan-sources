1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,635
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,437
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,272
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,011
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,146
A child in appearance with the I.Q. an adult,

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,115
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

9
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,312
It's the bottom of the ninth, the score's
3 & 2 with Chunichi leading by a point

11
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:57,316
ace relief pitcher Komatsu is on the mound
with 2 outs & runner, Oh, on 2nd base...

13
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,598
Yeah

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,069
I shot him 4 times. I'm sure he's dead.

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,541
Saizo Kano the Mastermind in the shadows
IS now drifting like seaweed in the sea

17
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,412
Probably the current in this area is strong

18
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,683
Before the body floats up,
it'll be food for it'll be food for the fishes

20
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:35,421
but why'd we have to kill him?

21
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,555
You fool!

22
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,957
Do you think
we could let that coward go,

24
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,027
he said we should turn ourselves in
becaause we killed one lousy bank clerk!

26
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,964
Besides, the police had him indentified

27
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,499
Never mind him,
now what re we going to do?

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,967
That money's hot

30
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,568
He's right

31
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,039
The serial numbers of three hundred million
of the four have been recorded, right?

33
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,440
Don't worry

34
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:58,110
we already pulled off the big job.

35
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:02,381
All we have to do now is
wait until the right time

37
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,452
Here!

38
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,123
This is our farewell gift to you

39
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,126
No rud es. OK?

41
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,930
Boss...

44
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:28,441
0.9,

00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,977
Record! Record!

52

What? *

53
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,881
This answer to the quiz, I'm positive it's
record!! *

55

Read this, here!

61
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,624
Huh?

62
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,027
Special announcement?

63
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,361
Let's see?

64
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:55,167
Something important most people
In Japan had during the Showa era...?

66
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,303
Do you:still have it?

67
00:03:57,304 --> 00:04:02,842
It's something we almost never see now
The first 10 people...

69
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,977
The next part! Read the next part!

70
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,179
Good grief, don't bother me.

71
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,851
Who bringsthe correct item will win an
WM all expensesgpaid trip to the Ogasawara
Dolphin Tour?

74
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,320
See, let's give a try, come on.

75
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,990
There's still time, let's take a record
down there! Come on!

77
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,593
Conan, you want to see the dolphins too,
don't you?

79
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,595
Don't you, Conan

80
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,331
Eh...!1? Oh, sure...

81
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,266
Come on, you don't mind do you?

82
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,735
#Werdonitthave anything to do
this long weekend anyway

84
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,237
Forget it!

85
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,906
# Therstour sounds boring

86
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:37,376
Besides...your-answer:s wrong!

87
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,514
Ifsitewas records, they wouldn'tdhave
written "people in Japan

89
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,116
Alright then, what's the right answer?

90
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,251
You fool!

91
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:49,188
Samurai spirit", that's what modern Japanese
have lost! No doubt about it!!

93
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,057
How in the world are you going to take
bring something like that down there?

95
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:56,528
Besides, I've never had samurai spirit,
and I doubt I ever will!

97
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,132
Alright then, maybe it's a yoyo or
bell bottom pants,

99
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,334
how about that mushroom tea?

100
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,602
Designer brands...family computers?

101
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,872
Yeah, I know what it is-how about that
frilled lizard

103
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,075
It was pretty popular back then!

104
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,143
What, is it anyway?

105
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:12,745
Excuse me

106
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,948
I think...the answer is...

107
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,085
You're right!

108
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,222
Right this way to the cruiser

109
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,490
Alright

110
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,826
We did it! You were right Conan

111
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,094
I was just lucky ,

112
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,430
Next contestant, step this way!

113
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,034
We sure wererlucky

115
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,036
Hey, put that away right now,

116
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,903
the others in the back will see it

117
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,439
You're so stingy, sir

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,508
Hahaha, don't worny.

119
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,843
It's not something they pull out of
their pockets so readily.

121
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:48,647
You're kidding...it's now a rubik cube?

122
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,982
Wrong!

123
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,050
Really?

124
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,251
He was right

125
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,054
Next contestant

126
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,389
Wait!

127
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,725
Wow, this is real fancy

128
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,261
I'm so excited!

129
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,530
Congratulations!

130
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,399

131
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,001

00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,210
there's 1 more opening on the tour

136
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,278
Gee...we just made it, huh!

137
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,547
How lucky!

138
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,415
That's right the maximum number for
the tour was 10

140
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,552
But this sure is a.huge ship for such a
small group

142

Party of 3, are you 1 family?

152
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,006
Yes...sort of

153
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,675
So I'll put you in a twin room
room number is 110.

155
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,877
May I ask you a question?

156
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:56,348
Mr. Masaru Furukawa, the man who planned
this tour, is he on board this ship?

158
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,683
Excuse me?

159
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,620
I wanted to thank him for giving me the
opportunity to sail on this fantastic ship!

161
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,557
The thing is...none ofgus crew members
have met him either

163
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,659
You haven't met him?

164
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,860
) No!

165
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,997
The reservation for the cruise as well as
the method for selecting the passengers

167
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,600
everything, was done by phone

168
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,536
charter fee was also directly transferred
through the bank

170
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:22,007
I'm sure he'll be waiting for the ship at
Ogasawara, though

172
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,243
Yes...l see

173
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,511

I please have your name?

175
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,715

A former detective with the Metroplitan
Police Department

179
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,391
Now an awe inspiring
well known private detective!

181
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,927
Isn't that right?

182
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:45,664
Police Superintendent Samezaki!

183
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,734
Don't call me that, I'm not a Police

Why, is that you Ran?

193
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,746
You sure have grown up
to be quite a beauty!

195
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,015
But what brings you here?

196
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,485
I just got a hankering to see the ocean

197
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,955
Remember? Today's a special day!

198
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,224
A special day?

199
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,892
Hahaha

200
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:18,964
I'don't blame you for forgetting, after
all, you left the force 10 years ago

202
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,366
hahaha

203
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,101
By the way,

how's that gorgeous wife of yours?

205
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,972
Don't tell me you two are still separated

206
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,475
As a matter of fact, we are.

207
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,744
Nevermind that,
don't mention that woman

209
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,412
Dad!

210
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,880
H...excuse me.

211
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:36,815

Oh...sorry...it was my mistake

220
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,760
A seal?

222
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,497
You dropped this

223
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,966
Oh...thank you!

224
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,168
Thank YOU very much!

225
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,771
Eh?? Oh, of course

226
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:04,308
Huh? You picked up his seal,
so why'd you thank him?

228
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,111
Never mind, it's nothing.

229
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,579

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,240
he's the last one

251
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,709
Alright, we can set out then, can't we.

252
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,112
We're already behind schecule

253
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:43,916
No, we can't go yet!
Remember the first passenger, the old man?

255
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,385
Well we left to go get something
he forgot, he hasnit.come back yet!

257
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:52,324
Really? That old man was just here

258
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,393
he said he wanted to take a short nap
before dinner

260
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:57,129
so he didn't want to be disturbed

261
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,531
Are you sure?
When'd he get back anyway?

263
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,666
Well, at any rate,

264
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,268
we have the 10 passengers.
The contest's over,

266
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,737
regretably,
we have to the other contestants.

268
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,206
Alright! I'll go!

269
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,142

272
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,013
Wait just a minu

273
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,481
Excuse me,

274
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,750
but haven't we met somewhere before?

275
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,985
N...no...you must be mistaken,

276
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,286
N...no...you must be mistaken,

I've never seen you before today
Minoru Ebina

281
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,823
I've never seen you before today

282
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,964
Hahaha did you find someone on the
Police wanted list?

284
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,765
Eh, Superintendent Samezaki!

285
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,970
Thanks to you people, Mr. Mourn,
I'm certain we'll have a safe journey

287
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,638
Huh?!" .

288
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,574
After all, he's a former-police
officer and you're a private investigator.

290
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,644
There're 3 of you on board!

291
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,446
3 of us?

292
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,048
There's someone else besides us?

293
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:55,254
Yes! Another private investigator,
although he "doesnét look it

295
00:10:55,955 --> 00:11:00,459
Thank you all for joining us today on
the S.S. Symphony,

297
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,394

298

we are scheduled to arrive in
Ogasawara tomorrow morning,

00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,133

301
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:41,033
I'm on top of the world!

302
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,970
She said she wanted to that once
in her lifetime

304
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,105
She's been watching too many movies.

305
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,441
What's she going to do if we really sink,
waa a omen.

307
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,976
Hahahaha

308
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,345
Don't get so upset,

322
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,992
The sea certainly is wonderful

323
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,861
Itris'mltsmakes you forget
all the unpleasant things!

325
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,797
You're right...the sea does do that

326
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:16,335
It hides everything

00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,635

and...even corpses

332
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,846
D..did you say...corpses?

333
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,514
Oh, I'm sorry,

334
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,383
I shouldn't have said
such a horrible thing.

336
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:36,188
It just slipped out...you see, my father
drowned a while back

338
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,523
I'm sorry to hear that

339
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:43,662
We've all got to be grateful to this
Mr. Furukawa got sponsoring this tour

341
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,797
I know who he is!

342
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,999
Eh?!

343
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,201
Remember that seal I picked up?

344
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:51,135
That's when I saw it

345
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,871
The name Furukawa was on it

346
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,873
Conan, you saw it too, didn't you!

347
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,207
Yes!

348
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,144
So that's why you thanked him back then

349
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,746
That's right!

350
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,481
So you see!

351
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:06,418
That man with the seal is Mr. Furukawa!

352
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:11,823
I'm sure he intends to reveal his identity
during dinner and surprise everyone.

354
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,425
That's strange

356
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:18,563
I asked him his name but
I'm positive he said it was Kameda

358
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,965
You re kidding

359
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,702
Hey Mouri! They're announcing dinner!!

360
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,704
Alright, we'll be there!

361
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,576
Wow, so you're the infamous

362
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,178
Sleeping Kogoro

363
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,713
That's right

364
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,049
What an honor

365
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,119
Phew...I'm going back to my room to
rest for a bit

367
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,255
You stilliget sea sick, huh?

368
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,658
May I pour you more wine?

369
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,794
Yes, thank you'll

370
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:52,597
This ship is so huge and
there're so few passengers on board,

372
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,199
it seems like such a waste

373
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,735
I agree with you!

374
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,337
Countingjthe 2 passengers
resting in"'their rooms,

376
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,473
there's only 11 of you on board

377
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,341
That's)if you include me!

378
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,743
The 2 passengers you're talking about 1s

379
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,379
that the other private investigator
and the old man?

381
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,279
Yes!

382
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,084
I passed.that old man in the corridor

383
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:15,887
He seems to be the quiet type,
what does he do?

385
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,758
Wells iteseems
he's a marine researcher and

387
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,196
uh... His name is... Saizo Kano

388
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,464
What!!

389
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,265
Saizo Kano?!

390
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,640
Where is his room?

391
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,843
His room number's... 101

392
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,378
Saizo Kano...?

393
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,980
I've heard that name somewhere before

394
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,182
You idiot! How could you forget!!

395
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,985
Many years ago,
you and I both were after him

397
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,921
he was the mastermind
behind the 400 million yen heist

399
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:50,956
he's Saizo Kano
the Mastermind in the shadows!!

401
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,156
He's Saizo Kano

Huh?

411
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,515
You have the master key, don't you!

412
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,783
Yes!

413
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,521
Listen, if it is him,

414
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,589
he may have a gun

415
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,794
as soon as you open the door,
get out of the way!

417
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:30,128
Yes sir.

418
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,265
Don't worry! Please calm down

419
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,139
I've...unlocked it

420
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,340
Let's go!

421
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,750
What is this?

422
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:55,086
It is strange...
It looks like no one's beenO*inside

424
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,690
Are you sure this is the room?

425
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,959
Yes! There's no mistake!

426
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,160
Rats!

427
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,995
I'll look on the lower deck!

428
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,398
Mouri, you check the upper!

429
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,934
Yes sir!

430
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,673
Hello?

431
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,475
Where are you?

432
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,211
I know you're in here!

433
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,880
I read the letter!

434
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,418
Hello!

436
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,290
If he's not in the room

437
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,227
then...he could be on the deck

438
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,830
Huh? Who's in the room next door, 1027?

439
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,832
It's the other private investigator's room.

440
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,302
He hasn't been out of his room since he
boarded the ship

442
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,906
That sounds pretty suspicious

443
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,509
Excuse me sir, may I come in?

444
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,478
Sir...7

445
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,380
Here, let me do it

446
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,318
Hey, you! I know you're in there!

447
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,854
Answer me! Hey!

448
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,257
Guess we have no other choice

449
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,992
Will you unlock this door too?

450
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,326
Be quiet!

451
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,928
What's this all about?
Keep the noise down!

453
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,866
Eh...? Good grief... Mr. Mouri

454
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,735
what are all of you doing here?

455
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,804
That's what I'dvlike to ask you

456
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:22,874
Mastermind in the shadows?

457
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,176
Now that you mention it,

458
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,380
I remember my dad telling me about it
a long time ago

460
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,416
His real name's Saizo Kano

461
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:38,623
he was the mastermind behind
the 400 million yen heist 20 years ago

463
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,826
The plan was perfectly calculated
nothing went wrong

465
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,229
The job went off without a hitch

466
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,097
and they escaped the police so smoothly

467
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,900
He was called "Mastermind in the shado

468
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,771
He changed partners with every job.
He was a loner.

470
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,641
His trademark was he never hurt anyone
during the crime

472
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:00,111
But then during the robbery 20 years ago,

473
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,247
he killed his first victim

474
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:06,451
And since that incident,
he was never heard of again

476
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:09,654
You mean that fellow was sleeping
in the room next to mine?

478
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,457
Yup...but when we got there, he was
Iong gone

480
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,726
Mr. Samezaki's looking for him now

481
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,594
That's real strange,

482
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,264
I'm sure the reports said he was dead

483
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,533
They found his clothes washed up
on some beach,

485
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,768
there were bullet holes
In them and blood stains too

487
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,602
My father told me

488
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,137
He's not dead!

489
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:31,276
That coat was planted to fool the police

490
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:36,348
You can't kill Kano off that easily,
kid he's no fool

492
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,616
I had a feeling that about this time,

493
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,220
he and his partners were out there
somewhere counting their money,

495
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:46,358
can't believe he'd be on the same ship

496
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,095
But... the statute of limitations on
that case ran out 5 years ago

498
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,695
even if you caught up
with them you can't do a thing

500
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:53,964
Idiot! Did you forget,

501
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,368
the statue of limitations
for murder is 15 years

503
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,838
But in a civil case, the statute of
Iimitations is 20 years!

505
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,640
If you're ordered to return the money,
you have to!

507
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,509
That's right... unfortunately,

508
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,445
the statute of limitations has run out for
Kano"s arrest

510
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,915
but his 3 partners can still be arrested.

511
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,053
If we can find Kano and make
him tell us where the others are

513
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,989
we can get the money back somehow

514
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:23,060
There's a possibility his partners are
on this ship too.

516
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,529
Then when we get to Ogasawara,

517
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,133
Iet's notify the police and
get them to help us search the ship

519
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,268
After all, we're out at sea,

520
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,537
they can't get away so easily

521
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,339
You fool! There's no time!

522
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,943
Like I said, today's a special day

523
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,278
Huh?

524
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,481
Tomorrow's the 20th anniversay
of that robbery!

526
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,918
At exactly midnight tonight,
the statute of limitations will run out

528
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,354
they'll be free men so nobody can
touch them after that!

530
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,690
You mean...in just 2 hours

531
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,760
The statute limitations on the crime will
run out completely

533
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,163
Hey! Is that you, Hatton?

534
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,633
Hi, Ran, long time no see!

535
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,967
What's going on?

536
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,370
I didn't know you were on this ship too

537
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,639
Yeah,
I was sleeping peacefully in my cabin

539
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,507
when this old guy came banging
on my door

541
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,776
Is Kazuha with you too?

542
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,445
Why bring her name up

543
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,314
she's not my girlfriend or anything!

544
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,583
We're not as close as you two!

545
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,852
H...who're you talking abou

546
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:22,854
Oh..uh... ll mean

547
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,256
you and your dad, you're so close

548
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,392
You don't know what you're talking about!

549
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,195
Did you find him, Mr. Samezaki?

550
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,464
That shadow man you were talking about

551
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:35,533
No, your father and I were just leaving
to continue the search!

553
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,003
Alright then
we'll be in the restaurant downstairs!

555
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,472
Hey, wait a minute!

556
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,740
We've got to help them

557
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,476
What did you say!

558
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,844
Are you telling me to wait all by myself

559
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:49,012
when there's a dangerous man
Iurking somewhere on board...?

561
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,882
Well..no, uh hahaha

562
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,084
Alright then dad...I'll just wait for you

564
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:56,688
I'll be waiting

565
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,293
I'll be waiting, dad!!

566
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,564
Is something wrong, sir?

567
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,501
Oh..no, it's nothing

568
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,903
Alright then,

569
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:14,305
Iet's start from the top deck and
work our way down

571
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,174
Sure
