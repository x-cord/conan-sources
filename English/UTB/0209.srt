1
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,586
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,588
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,624
Today we take a slow drive
along a mountain path.

6
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,325
At the bottom of the:valley
is the smell of murder.

8
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,094
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,929
A child in appearance
with the IQ of an adult,

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,298
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

13
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,350
Mt. Ryujin in West Tama County

14
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,354
Tsuzura Ori Pass

15
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,056
Wow! Some hill this is!

16
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,126
We've come so far up.

17
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,595
We've still got a long way to go.

18
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,398
We've only come about half way

19
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,700
Oh no! You've gotta be kidding, me!

20
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:16,335
What's Up]?

21
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,371
Oh, man...

22
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:22,541
with all that right and left swinging.
My head's spinning...

24
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,478
Ah come on, what a sissy .

25
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:30,182
Ha, ha, ha, this place
called Tsuzura Ori Pass,

27
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,853
has a succession of 99 curves,
big and small in all...

29
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:38,424
Ugh! I'feel nhusented
just listening to you...

31
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,527
Huh where is Mitsuhiko?

32
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:45,631
Mitsuhiko's reading.a book in the car.

33
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,499
What

34
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,335
Mitsuhiko!

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,804
It feels just greatTout here!

36
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,274
No thanks, I'm reading the best part now!

37
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,744
Really, I-tell you!

38
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,213
Um, Doc, Al didn't cme along again.

39
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:06,452
Uh:oh Al was saying
she had something to do...

41
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,756
Doc, I'll bet you that...

42
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,957
This was what happened

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,261
I'm not interested in camps

44
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,530
snuff snuff snuff .

45
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,866
You're really good, Genta.
That's just like her!

47
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,400
Ha, ha, ha bull's eye!

48
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,371
What's that?

50
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,180
Oh no!

51
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,082
Doc! Get the police and an ambulance!

52
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:36,715
Okay!

53
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,596
GREAT FALL FROM MT. RYUJIN

54
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,804
You said you were resting
at the scenic spot there,

56
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:03,642
when you witnessed the car go over
the cliff, so you came running over, right?

59
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,613
A dent...

60
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,515
If so

61
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,784
I'd like to ask you once again...

62
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:15,554
Did you notice something else suspicious,
Iike a car or a person?

64
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,090
No, nothing at all...

65
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:19,825
- - - a.
I...

67
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh...l see

68
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,296
Um, officer...

69
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,064
Hmm?

70
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,599
What is it, sonny?

71
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,536
MAydl.go>and take 1 look At
whatéthe men.are doing above?

73
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,205
No no. it's not something
for a child to watch!

75
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,040
I think they're almost
nished up there anyway...

77
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,443
It should be okay.

78
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,878
But.

79
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,746
But, sonny,

80
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:44,617
make sure you don't get in the
way of their work when you watch them!

82
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:46,318
Yes, sir!

83
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,324
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

84
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,727
don't we have to go too?

85
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:55,294
Huh?!

86
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,764
Conan's going to go off
on his own like always you know!

88
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,167
Oh... who cares,

89
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,468
Iet him do what he pleases...

90
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,071
We've go something better here!

91
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,107
Something better?

92
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,415
Okay, here!

93
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,516
Okay!

94
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:22,087
Uh...16.33 meters.

96
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,557
LN ended...

97
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,691
there...

98
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,725
It is a piece of polish that rubbed off!

99
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,128
Really?!

100
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,466
Look, it's dark blue!

101
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,135
Dark blue...

102
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,670
W-Which means...

103
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,403
Yeah!

105
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,341
so that's what happened!

106
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,646
We came all the way
out here to have a picnic and

108
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,415
get messed up in an accident like this

109
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,016
It's no accident...

110
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,018
Huh?

111
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,387
What do you mean, "it's no accident"?

112
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,893
Didn't the officer there ask you
if you saw any other cars?

114
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:01,894
Yeah

115
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:07,165
That car fell over because it was
pushed from behind by another car.

117
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,667
What?!

118
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,569
That car had a dent in the rear,

119
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,638
an indication of it
having been hit from behind.

121
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:13,939
Besides,

122
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,143
the paint that seemed to have rubbed off
from the other car was also found.

124
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,478
Moreover,

125
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,048
the car that hit from behind
most likely did so deliberately.

127
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,151
T-then it's homicide

128
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,119
Yeah .

129
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,389
Don't we have to
cooperate with the police

131
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,293
It'll be fine, after all
they've got so much evidence.

133
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:38,597
But, all they've got Is
rubbed off paint and a dent in the rear...

135
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,468
The Japanese police
is usually very efficient.

137
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,970
So long as a piece of
rubbed off paint is found,

139
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,306
from the color and substance they
can figure out the model of the car too.

141
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,907
Then all they have to do is

142
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,176
go asking around for details
to get to the one who did it.

147
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,249
Mitsuhiko,

148
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,951
what do you mean by something better?

149
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,521
Shh! Quiet! Conan will hear you!

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,194
This is it, Genta!

151
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,231
What is this?

152
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,866
It's a code!

153
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:14,767
A codes?!

154
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,301
Shh!

155
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,940
I picked it up near the site
of the accident just a while ago.

158
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,345
Then, shouldn't you have told
the police about it?

160
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,748
But. what we saw was
just an accident, wasn't it?

162
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,418
It's hard to believe that
a code has anything to do with it.

164
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,219
Right.

165
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,557
Codes are usually used for figuring out
where treasures are hidden, arenst they?

167
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,958
Right, exactly!

168
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,494
Treasure, eh

169
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,431
So, take a good.look at this!

170
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:49,935
See, on the vepy top. in the(square,
the equation 100-1 is written.

172
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,938
Okay Genta, what is 100-17

173
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,739
Huh 2!

174
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,710
Nnnn .nine...ninety-nine?

175
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,278
Right

176
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:05,284
Is there something that crosses your mind
when you think of the number 397

178
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:05,918
Huh

179
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,321
99...99...

181
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,390
Ah!»

182
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,691
911! Ambulance!

183
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,892
Nope!

184
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:19,298
Whatever gave you
the idea of calling 311 at this point?!

186
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,067
First aid bandage then?

187
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,035
I got it!

188
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,437
The Tsuzura Ori.Pass, right?!

189
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,639
Doc just explained that there is a
succession of 99 hairpin curves,

191
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,575
didn't he?!

192
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,543
Correct!

193
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,445
Which means that this code indicates

194
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:37,416
a place somewhere
in the Tsuzura Ori Pass area.

196
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,952
And, did you figure out
where it is, Mitsuhiko?

198
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,590
No, but this code sure looks familiar

199
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,992
Where did you see it, Mitsuhiko?

200
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:48,961
Hmm.

201
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,195
Hey you guys!

203
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,133
What's with all the racket?

204
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,734
Um, ites nothing!

205
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,403
Right, right,
we're not talking about any codes.

208
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,371
Codes?!

209
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,742
Oh. uh, well, the novel that
I was reading you see...

211
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,813
Some codes came out...
They're too easy for you, Conan, so...

213
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,683
On, for children's stuff...

214
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,555
Good gracious...

215
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,361
Okay then, you guys,

216
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,663
Doc and I are going fishing,

217
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,432
don't forget to chop the firewood.

218
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,832
Okay!

219
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:28,901
Bye.

220
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,504
Here goes!

221
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,308
Mitsuhiko, did you: really figure it out?!

222
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,976
It was in the book that I was reading!

223
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,112
Really!?

224
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,513
This!

225
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,016
What is this?

226
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,118
The keybOard of a computer?

227
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,152
Yes.

228
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,255
Numbers are written in
numerical order from thestop left,

230
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,992
and they correspond to
thessan eshinagana keys!

232
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,093
For instance,

233
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,562
1 and 4 equals the hiragana "ta.

234
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,997
2 and 7 equals "to" and so forth.

235
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,632
All right!

236
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,100
Let's try it!

237
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,838
Genta please read the number codes.

238
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,272
Okay!

239
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,741
0 and 4,

240
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,676
3 and 2

241
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,644
0 and 4 ecuals..-"u'.

243
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,580
2 and 3 equals "se".

244
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,782
3 and 8 equals tsu...

245
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,617
A right turn"?

247
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,821
What is this mark supposed to mean?

249
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,926
Maybe this is the shape of the road?

250
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,896
Right! You're probably right!

251
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,898
That's why the first code
can be deciphered as

253
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,766
Turn right at the intersection!

254
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,302
You're fantastic, Mitsuhiko!

255
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,371
Let's continue!

256
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,672
I'll write it down!

257
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,117
There, it's done!

258
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,385
Please read it

259
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,688
I'll follow along on the map.

260
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,422
Okay!

261
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,126
Turn right at the intersection
after passing Tsuzura @ri Pass.

263
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,128
Turn right at the forked road,

264
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,464
then turn left at the next fork.

265
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:07,432
Cross two bridges,

266
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,735
turn left after the 2nd bridge and jackpot!

267
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,838
Okay, it's over here!

268
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,376
The pension house is over here,
SO it's pretty close!

270
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,478
Let's go check it out!

271
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,246
Maybe we'll find the treasure!

272
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,715
I'm sure Conan will be vexed.

273
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,392
We:re here.

274
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,297
Hey, are you guys upstairs?!

275
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,399
We've had a big catch!

277
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,502
Hmm?

278
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,273
Hey, badsnews.

279
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,009
The kids-are-nowhere in sight!

280
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,044
What?!

282
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:53,912
2928101014

283
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:02,921
Hey, Mitsuhiko...

284
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,724
Are we there yet

285
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:09,861
We've only got a little:more\to- go,
so hang in there, Génta.

287
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,066
We're cr sing the2nd bridge now.

288
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,101
After we turn right at the next fork,
wed get there)!

290
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,272
We've still got that much more to go.

291
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,140
Hang in there, Genta!

292
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,776
If we find the treasure, you'll get a
Iuxurious serving of eels over rice!!

294
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,079
Eels over rice...

295
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,216
Okay. if we find the treasure,
Nill eat all the eels over rice Il can eat!

297
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:35,087
Let's go, Mitsuhiko,
for 100,000 eels over rice!

299
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,793
Shoot! This could be

300
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,763
Hmm?! Did you figure it out?

301
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,099
Doc, call the police right away!

302
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,000
What?!

303
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:52,270
They went to the hideout of the one
who pushed the car over just a while ago!

305
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:53,772
What?!

306
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:58,476
So this was the code they were
talking about in the car a while ago...

308
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,077
Darn!

309
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,656
We did it! We've finally come, Genta!

310
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,990
It's over there!

311
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,330
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

312
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,565
are you sure this is the right place?

313
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,101
It doesn't look like it has
anything to do with a treasure, does it?

315
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,803
What a thing to say!

316
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,241
We came exactly where the code said
to go, so it s gotta be right!

318
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:34,513
Besides, it's places like this
where treasures are usuallyshidden.

320
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,049
Okay, let's go inside then!

321
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,125
Yes, thank you!

322
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,863
The police will rush over
to the site immediately!

324
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,099
Let's hurry on over too!

325
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,633
Okay!

326
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,103
It seems that nobody is in...

327
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:03,041
Hey, Mitsuhiko, where's the treasure?!

329
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,683
The building farthest beyond...

330
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:12,718
Huh?!

331
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,319
Look!

332
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,823
That building over there is the only one
capable,of being locked.

334
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,524
Mm sure I's there!

335
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,225
Yep!

336
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,960
Let's check it out!

337
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,471
T-this is...

338
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,739
Wow!

339
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,146
Wow, look at all-those
foreign'.car models!

341
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,782
Hey, Mitsuhiko,

342
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,885
there's no treasure anywhere, though...

343
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,088
Hmm... strange...

344
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,723
Hey, you two...

345
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,659
There's something funny about this 'car...

346
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,727
See...

347
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,363
It"has no license plate.

348
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,931
You're right...

349
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
Hey, Mitsuhiko.

350
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,536
There's hone on this one too!

351
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,673
Maybe they're all stolen cars...

352
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:09,741
Huh!

353
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,778
I'm sure they're planning.to
sell them off to some foreign ountry

355
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,816
We've come to
the hideout of car smugglers!

357
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,351
Exactly!

358
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,695
You're the brats that were
at the site of the the accident...

360
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,332
Phooey!

361
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,034
Who cares!

362
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,404
Where's the guy with
the mustache and the other kid?

364
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,006
Just who are you referring to?

365
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,876
Don't you play dumb with me!

366
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,078
What was that sound?

367
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,814
The sound of gunfire!

368
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,614
What?!

369
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,750
Hurry up will you, Doc?

370
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:52,918
I know!

371
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,826
I'll ask you once more.

372
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:04,229
Where's the guy with 4
the mustache and the other kid?

374
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,732
I-I have no idea what you're talking about

375
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,834
What?!

376
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,969
Hey, Mitsuhiko...

377
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,304
Mitsuhiko...

378
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,140
No, I can't get Conan and
Doc involved in something

380
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,043
I got mixed up in
because of my own actions!

382
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,612
He's right

383
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,813
Yeah...

384
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,450
Oh... you must really:want to die.

385
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,927
It's me.

386
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,597
Sorry, I've only got 5 for now. I

387
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:42,367
Sada chickened out
and rode off with one

389
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,303
Yeah, I took: care .of that.

390
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,541
I hit him from behind at the ridge,
and he fell head first all the way down.

392
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,644
I'm no goof

393
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,480
I'll scrap the car
before the police get to it.

395
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,884
Once it's. scrapped, there's no proof.

396
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,055
That's

397
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:13,031
Hey, what's with you guys?

398
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,599
What's with you?!

399
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,135
Swinging a rifle around towards children!

400
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,336
Doc!

401
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,072
You're the one who was
at the scene of the accident...

403
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,875
Phooey. there couldn't be better timing...
You saved me time looking for you!

405
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,343
No use, mister.

406
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,612
See, you hear it, don't you?

407
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,382
That police car is headed here:

408
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,082
What?!

409
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,386
They're coming here

410
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,555
to arrest you, mister!

411
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:38,723
What?!

412
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,995
All ri ht!

413
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,266
Hey, hey, officers...

414
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,973
Before we hear you out,
give us that gun of yours.

416
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,409
Oh, you mean this gun?

417
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:03,647
. Ijwas only trying to scare the kids
because they trespassed on my]property.

419
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,150
See...

420
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,520
By the way, is that your car?

421
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,690
Yeah, that's right. Anything wrong?

422
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:16,728
Well. a car happengd to go ove 7
he cliff at Tsuzura Ori Pass...

424
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,998
and it seems that a car
of the same model as yours

426
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,200
pushed that car over from behind.

427
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,704
Your car has a dent too.
And it looks like it struck something...

429
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,075
What?!
Are you suspecting me of something?!

431
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,044
There are several hundreds of cars
Iike this, aren't there?!

433
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,512
Just how many of those
hundreds do you think

435
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,315
happened to be:
at the scene of.the accident?

437
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,251
Andwhere were you.
May-l ask, at that time?

439
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:44,789
Sorry...that was an accident...

440
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,358
Since the scenery was so beautiful.

441
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,060
I took my eyes off the road...

442
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,663
And the next thing I knew, crash!

443
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,098
He's lying, officer!

444
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,200
Shut up, stay out of this, brat!

445
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,301
No, I'm not shutting up!

446
00:18:56,302 --> 00:19:00,704
You just said on the phone, that you
struck the car and pushed it over the cliff!

448
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,173
I heard you say so too!

449
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,508
Me too!

450
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,680
Hey}officer. are you going to
believe what those brats say?!

452
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,549
Just how do you think it's
possible for me to push a car

454
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,718
over a cliff by crashing into it from
behind at a sharp bend like that?

456
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:14,586
You did exactly that!

457
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,022
You succeeded perfectly!

458
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,825
Old man! Quit your gibberish!

459
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,594
Do have proof, or what? Proof!

460
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,462
Of course there's proof.

461
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,432
In the foreground of the curve
where that car fell over,

463
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,568
there were two pairs of tire marks,

464
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:34,039
that were left behind
when the car was hit from behind.

466
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,076
In other words, you collided twice!

467
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,045
So what?!

468
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,747
I wasn't looking at the road
and I collided twice!

470
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,785
Well, there is a possibility too, however...

471
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:52,457
Do you know the space between
the tires of the car that fell over?

473
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,760
Yes, 1633 meters.

474
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:01,933
And, at what speed
were you going at on that road?

476
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:05,537
Just about 30 kilos!

477
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,206
Well, I guess so...

478
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,810
The fact that you were
going at 30 kilos means

480
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,181
you were going at about
83 meters per second

482
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:22,253
In order to leave skid marks
at a spacing of 1633 meters.

484
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,489
It would take you
approximately 2 seconds.

486
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,126
After colliding into the car in question,
the first time, for a period of 2 seconds,

488
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,395
you never steered
to avoid another collision,

490
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,262
nor did you step on the brakes.

491
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,065
Rather, you collided again!

492
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,535
If this is not called colliding deliberately,
what else would you call it!

494
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,606
So...if you have anything more
you want to say,

496
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,642
we'll hear you out at the station.

497
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,243
Darn!

498
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,113
Mm, officer...

499
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,947
Huh?

500
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:53,451
There are luxurious cars without
Iicense plates in the'building*beyond.

502
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,820
I'm sure those cars are all stolen!

503
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,290
Good work, all of you!

504
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,393
But- listen.

505
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,195
Don't ever do something
dangerous like this again!

507
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,531
Y-y-yes sin!

Darn I just don't seem to have
the knack for chopping firewood.

554
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,335
Darn, darn it!

555
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,538
Hey, we need more firewood!

556
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:58,243
Hey, Conan, why don t you
help us a bit on this side too?

558
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,711
No way!

559
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,015
Its your own fault for loafing around
without chopping firewood

561
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,783
Iike you should've been, serves you right.

562
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,853
Yes, yes, all right,

563
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,154
One "yes" Is enough!

564
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,089
Yes!

565
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,560
I hope they learn their lesson and
quit doing dangerous things

567
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,597
How disappointing though...

568
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,266
What is?

569
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:25,903
Conan deciphered that code
in no time at all!

571
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,972
You were fantastic too, Mitsuhiko!

572
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,809
Not only did you figure out the,code,
you also were right about the smugglers

574
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:36,047
Oh. I just thought so
because it was in the book I was reading!

576
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,018
Wow, just great.
Maybe! should look through it too.

578
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,288
Oh, I've got just the thing for you, Genta!

579
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,357
Children's Lunch Murder Case
is theititle of it

581
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,892
What a funny title!

582
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:51,195
I would rather have eels over nice
than a children's lunch

584
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,332
Hey. haven't you guys learned
your lesson or what?!

586
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,836
How nice and bitter!

587
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,139
This is indeed what you call
the world of 'Wabi Sabi'!

589
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,540
Huh

590
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,343
I wonder what's up?
Why is he+looking around like that?

592
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:09,079
Are you saying that the master
is afraid of a monster?

594
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,283
I wonder if there really is such
a thing as a monster?

596
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,420
D-don't be ridiculous!
No way should such a thing exists!

598
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,425
R-Ryozo has...
