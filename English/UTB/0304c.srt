3
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,745
What! False bomb again!

4
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:30,716
Did you check all of them?
Is there no real bomb?

6
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,717
No, sir.

7
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:37,256
We have checked all the
¢ red trains that go through the city.

9
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,825
But all the suspicious
ones have been

11
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,494
false'or pranks...

12
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:46,599
I see, the bomber's probably trying
to throw off our investigation.

14
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:50,036
Anyway, be patient
and continue your investigations!

16
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,003
Yes, Sir.

17
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,772
Director Matsumoto.

18
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,706
What is it?

19
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:57,176
\ Report from the Ozaki team, sir.
They are at the ballparks.

21
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,911
And, what did you get?

22
00:02:58,912 --> 00:02:59,245
Yeas, Sir.

23
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:03,983
Tihey have finished
checking all the major ballparks

25
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,218
in the city but
nothing came up so far.

27
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:11,690
They say they will continue
investigation covering smaller ballparks.

29
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:16,896
We don't have to check the
ballpark anymore. I guess.

31
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,699
All right.
Stop: all the red trains in the city.

33
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,235
Get all the investigators
out of the ballparks

35
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,604
and dispatch them to all the
stations to conduct investigations.

37
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,942
We still have five more hours till the first
explosion expected to go off at noon

39
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,313
He can outfox us .and
try setting up a bomb from now

41
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:34,947
Right sir.

42
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,222
Five more hours

43
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:49,562
I wanted to.say we
have only five hours left for us.

45
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,030
Yes...

46
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,043
I'm sleepy...

RX ~~
Isnrt it strange?

54
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,420
From this-note, you would think that
he .expected somebodyitorcome:

56
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:16,288
-_- « Fr
come looking for it to the ballpark

61
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,723
but nothing happened.

62
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:26,165
He thought nobody would come: It's off
season and no big game is scheduled

64
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,333
Oh yeah?§

65
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:33,772
If he wanted toe play pranks on the police.
He could have set a false trap or two

67
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,341
At any rate,

68
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,576
we can't keep those
kids with us anymore.

70
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,579
Yousre right.

71
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:44,583
Oh, by the way: how is Shiratori,
did you ask thow he is?

73
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,684
Yes. I didh

74
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,120
Yumi is taking care of Shiratori.

75
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,991
And she told me that the
operatiOn was successful.

77
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:55,027
They are waiting for him to
regain consciousness.

79
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,396
That's good I'm relieved.

81
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:57,596
That's. good. I'm relieved.

82
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:05,371
Takagi, make sure Miwako
stays out of dangerous situations.

84
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:10,776
If the bomber is the same bomber
that killed Matsuda with a bomb,

86
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,045
who knows what she might do

87
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:17,149
and there will be no one but you
who will be able to save her!

89
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,552
Wha? Wh...why me?

90
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:24,757
You're so much like Mr Matsuda.

91
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:29,929
But that's only because I
happened to be disguised like him.

93
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,733
Of course, he's five to ten times
better in looks or attitude

95
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,802
Te... Ten times. is" it.

96
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,441
But something about you reminds
me of him, it may be your heart,

98
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,843
feelings or whatever,
something resembles Matsuda

100
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:49,814
I guess Miwako },
came to realizejthat lately.

102
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,551
Takagt!

103
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,156
What were you thinking over so seriously?
What were you thinking over so seriously?

105
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,559
Oh, did you find out
where the bomb is?

107
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,494
No. I didn't.

108
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,429
Then what?

109
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,765
It's something unimportant.

110
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,001
Okay, for now

111
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,378
I'll continue investigation.
You send the kids home.

113
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,215
Then you return to the MPD
to get some sleep

115
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,117
and stay there to help
Inspector Megure.

117
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,754
Oh. but I can keep investigating...

118
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,257
Don't be silly.

119
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:32,658
A detective who is
unsteady from lack of sleep

121
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,225
will only :get'in the way
of the investigation, got it?

123
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,996
Y-yes.

124
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,035
Oh. no. You won't.

125
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:48,807
You will not take anyone with you.
Not anymore.

127
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,075
Never!

128
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,886
Taking a test right after new year holidays makes
me feelzlike=I'm livingsa gray life of a prep.

130

131
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,490
Yeah...

132
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,259
New year days are
meant-for everyone: to enjoy!

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,228
So, yousenjoyed-yourself; didn't you?

135
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,330
Sure. I didn't-want to regret not
doingiwhat-! wanted to do.

137
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,735
Well, only thing I can depend on is...

138
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,439
Isn't it a... is that a...

139
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,908
Your wrong!

140
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,244
Here!

141
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,682
Why!
It's the photo of Kyogoku

143
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,485
Yaeah;
This photo gives me energy.

145
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:38,424
Even if my test results aren't
good. I won't gen depressed.

147
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:43,429
As long as I have Makoto's love a
don't need to score 100 on my test.

149
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,032
Oh4noO% I'm so ashamed of
myself for being so bold!

151
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,500
Sure, sure, sure...

161
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:15,461
OK, kids. Ill take you home.
Tell me where you live, will you?

163
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:19,465
OP» Are you taking us back home?

164
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,668
We may be able to
solve this code in a moment...

166
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,371
You haven't slept for a long time.

167
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:30,876
I can't keep you,
school kids, witfYme any longer.

169
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:38,150
Say! Where's Detective Sato?

170
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,419
She's investigating on the case.

171
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:45,591
I see, Detective Sato
told you to send us home.

173
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,327
You do everything she tells
you to do, don't you!

175
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:53,332
I have to. She's two years
older and my senior as well.

177
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,135
And you think you'll do
fine after marrying her too?

179
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,169
Marry her?

180
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,841
I won't be,
Cuz she just dumped me the other day.

182
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,044
Sato-san...

183
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:06,845
Yes?

184
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,516
You said you have
something to say to me.

186
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:11,483
Oh. That...

187
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,284
Oh. That...

188
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,024
Sa..Sato-san...

189
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,330
Let's forget the date,
the date we were gonna have.

191
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,332
I'm cursed

192
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,135
Cursed?

193
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,442
All the people that I care dearly for,
seem to disappear from me.

195
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:45,784
My father, the PE. teacher in school,
myasenior in the baseball club, and...

197
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,422
him too...

198
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,023
him too...

199
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,831
I don't want to have to go
through that kind of pain anymore.

201
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,366
Sato...

202
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:06,738
We have been good friends and police
officer I want us to stay that way

204
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,976
SS. Satoh-san...

205
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,713
Yes. Takagi?

206
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,557
You're right. We are not
well-matched in the first place.

208
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:30,329
Yeah, you deserve a prettier cuter girl.

209
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,964
Yeah? Do I?

210
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,335
See?
I'm not getting married.

212
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,837
So you gave her up

213
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,906
What a chicken!

214
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,407
No guts at all.

215
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,211
I don't want to give her up. but...

216
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,279
But what?

217
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,582
But.

218
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:57,055
Detective Matsuda risked his life
to save the people in the hospital,

220
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,424
buts can"tibe his equal

221
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,259
Right?

222
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,860
W.Where did you learn that?

223
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,896
Detective Takagi
A head! Look ahead!

225
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,699
We heard about it from the
Iady on the mini-patrol car.

227
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,600
You mean Yumi?

228
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,837
She told us in detail.

229
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,740
Then, Detective Matsuda

230
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:19,177
decided at that time to riskhis life to tell
us where the other bomb was planted.

You can't listen to it
7 tell it without tears.

239
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,164
Yeah.

240
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,900
Oh, yeah?

241
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,137
He has good rea Gn to give up. I guess.

242
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:51,243
The memory of one
who's gone is sealed

244
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,446
and will be kept in the
heart for a life time.

help me in my difficulties.

Help, Shinichi! I have trouble solving
this derivative, integral problem...

259
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,690
Be honest about it.

260
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,659
No, you're wrong.
I looked at Shinichi's desk because...

262
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,794
Because Keep on!

263

284
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,740
You mean that it's not a red train?

287
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:32,577
Wes-kind«of notiraghtt

288
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,815
Now: wait.
If it's like the case 3 years before,

290
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:42,654
the first bomb is set in a place
that's rather easy for the police to find

292
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:47,025
Think simple. the simpler the better

293
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,862
Something that reminds you of red

294
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,699
the post and! fire truck...

296
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,201
Red-demon. little fed riding hood...

298
00:13:56,202 --> 00:14:00,806
Tomato, strawberries,
watermelon, apple,

301
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,042
cherries, hot chili pepper,
red salmon and red lobsters. I

303
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:09,314
Red... climb... steel...box

304
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,183
Genta, all your ideas are food

305
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,020
I've use up my brain. now I'mihungrys

306
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,656
I'm, kinda thirsty...

307
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,960
Well, then we can go
andstop at Some parking area <

309
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,264
Red, . ou sa .
There's another red over there.

311
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,667
There, you see.

312
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:30,001
Yeah.

313
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:39,978
I, I see, red. climb up-box of steel...

314
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,131
is something already happening?

315
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,565
W.What is it?

316
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,300
There's smoke coming out

318
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:06,204
won eri. a om > was
set up here after all?

320
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:13,779
I'll go ask what happened, so
youikids wait in the ca J okay!

322
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:22,754
We scheduled to bring you a special
on Toto Towers mascot Toto today but,

324
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,092
ddue to an accident, we have
inevitably changed the schedule.

326
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:31,129
Excuse me,
what on earth has happened?

328
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,831
Oh, you see the thing is.

329
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:36,101
What?
The bomb is inside Toto Tower?

331
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,336
Yes. I'm pretty sure.

332
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,139
Just what do you meany
Tell me about it in detail. will you!

334
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,344
Yes. just before"! got
here there was a small explosion,

336
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,613
and the elevator
seems to have stopped.

338
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,581
What!

339
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,451
It's most likely that the suspect thinking
that the police located the bomb,

341
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,721
used a remote control
to set off the explosion...

343
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,060
The control board of the
Ferris Wheel suddenly exploded

345
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,062
and the Ferris Wheel couldn't be stopped!

346
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,133
It's the-same as back then...

347
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,605
I'll go over to the elevator that had
stopped and check things out

349
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:18,410
No! That bomb has been set to
Iure officers there, it's a'trap!

351
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,379
What, a trap?

352
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:26,318
I'll be there in 5 minutes so wait
there until I get there! Understand?

354
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,752
O. Okay...

355
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,155
Hey. we have trouble!

356
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,125
It seems that a girl's
been trapped in the

358
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,628
elevator that stopped because
of the explosion a while ago!

360
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,762
What-did you say!

361
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,867
Officer Sato. a child is in the elevator...

362
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:46,338
Calm down! We've still got two hours to
go before the predicted time of bombing!

364
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:50,842
But, I'd better go and check things
out as soon as possible

366
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:55,780
Don't worry! I'll work something
out, so you just stay there!

368
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,415
B.But...

369
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,553
Understand? Don't make MiwaKo get
into dangerous situations. okay.

371
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,823
I'll rescue that girl. I promise!

372
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,324
But...

373
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,560
She's bound to do reckless things...

374
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:14,733
Understand, this is an order!
You stay there until I get there!

376
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,268
Understand. Officer Takagi!

377
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,238
Hey. Officer Takagi?
Can you hear me?

379
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,641
\ Officer Takagi. answer me!

380
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,243

Please Officer Takagi. don-t.go!

382
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,586
I refuse

I'm going to check .
How things*are inside.

385
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,296
O.Officer Takag!?

386
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:56,007
I'm going to go inside the tower/now,
so you all stay still and wait here, okay!

388
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,176
Understand?

390
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,745
Yvesssir... »

392
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,651
I wonder if Officer
Takagi is going to be okay...

394
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,621
Ail, take careO "everybody, okay.

395
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,355
What?

396
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,825
Hey, Conan!

397
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,795
What, are you going too, Conan?

399
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,464
I'm just going to go
check how things are.

401
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:24,269
You guys keep watch and make sure
nobody suspicious comes near this car!

403
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,203
But...

404
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,708
We"ll.be in big troubl )iffanbomb
IS set up on this cayagain, right?

406
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,644
But. I know you,
the detective squad will be able to

408
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,980
take care of things even
if I'm not around. right?

410
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,448
WwW. Well, I guess...

411
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,016
Leave it to us...

412
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,150
See you!

413
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,653
Be careful, okay, Conan.

414
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,530
According to he.
report from Officer Takag.,

416
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,065
about 15 Minutes ago.

417
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:58,703
There was a small explosion near
the special observatory area

419
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:03,208
It seems that one elevator of
this observatory is stalled

421
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,577
Only it hasn't been confirmed whether

422
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:10,115
this explosion was due
to a bomb or an accident.

424
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:15,387
It much too resembles the case of
3 years ago to be an accident.

426
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,688
True...

427
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,524
There's probably no doubt-about it

428
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,861
Emergency, emergency,

429
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,163
He dquarters to all stations.

430
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,798
There is 2 high possibility that a bomb

431
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,067
x has been.set at
Toto Towers in Minato Ward.

433
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:34,806
Head to the site on the double and
block off the entrance 10 Tote Tower.

435
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,176
- Secureanievacuation site for the
citizens in the vicinity. I repeat!

438
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,745

452
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,706
Oh, the one at the very end!

453
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,741
Thank you

454
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,412
Akemi, you'll be fine.
Don't be afraid. Come on out.

456
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,716
This is the elevator
that the girl is trap in?

458
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,684
Yes, sir

459
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,920
It came down from the tep floor

460
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:25,924
and stopped just before
reaching the observatory.

462
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,793
Akemi!
What are you doing. Akemi!

464
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:32,797
Hurry and come out!
Come over here!

00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:37,902
Only one child W81 mm 3
elevator but she's so scared that

468
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,070
she won't listen to her mother
telling her to come out

470
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,075
this space is too small for
an adult to get through

472
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,077
Will you carry me up then!

473
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,079
I can make it inside, can't I?

474
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,049
Cc, Conan...

1.I'm sorry...

533
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:49,060
By the way, are you sure there's
no bomb in that elevator?

535
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:52,563
No, there's nothing that looks like

536
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,332
a bomb here in the elevator...

537
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,969

All the wires seem

$0 I think with the
emergency stop

554
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:24,629
we are in the middle of the obse vatory
and roof of the tower building.

556
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,195
Okay then

557
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:30,268
I guess I'll have to climb to the ceiling
and wait for the rescue I; wad

559
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,403
No, don't climb up to the ceiling!

560
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,204
The mercury lever will operate!

561
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,541
The mercury lever?

562
00:24:37,743 --> 00:24:39,444
Mercuny lever! #

563
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,980
Even a slight shake can
make the mercury inside roll,

565
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:45,783
and once the mercury
touches the circuit that-s-it...

567
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,288
Conan. what's a mercury lever?

568
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:52,790
It's a part of the trigger
device of the bomb.

570
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,926
It's a bomb big enough that

571
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,962
IS capable of not
only blowing up this elevator

573
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,897
but the entire Toto Tower as well.
