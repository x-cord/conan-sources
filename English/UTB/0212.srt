1
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:20,686
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,488
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,156
The Youth Detective Squad»

6
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,558
Beware of evil hunters.

7
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,260
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,262
A child in appearance
with the IQ of an adult,

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,364
no case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan

12
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,851
MUSHROOMS, A BEAR AND THE
YOUTH DETECTIVE SQUAD" PART I

14
00:01:58,852 --> 00:01:59,085
if!» AA.

15
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:10,696
Listening everyone?
We are going mushroom picking

17
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,566
However. you are not! free
to pick all you want.

19
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,102
Adults get to pic sup to three
and children up to two!

21
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,605
We'll cook the mushrooms
you-picked"back=at theOinn.

23
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,507
Okay!

24
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,579
Oh, and pass the two wire fences
is the hunting grounds,

26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,147
so don't ever go inside!

27
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,180
Hunting grounds?

28
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,617
Bears appear!

29
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,519
B Bears?

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,090
But. don't you worry! There is
none on this side so rest assured.

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,162
Hey, come on, what a place
to go mushroom hunting.

37
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,165
I tell you!

38
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,436
At first he made it sound like there were
Ioads of mushrooms growing everywhere

40
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,438
There's nothing around, darn!

41
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,839
There, there!

42
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,142
It's all your fault, Genta.

43
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,611
You're the one who said let's go
mushroom picking, right?!

45
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,414
I really wanted to go apple picking

46
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:06,619
But mushrooms are the thing
to eat¥during autumn!

48
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,855
And besides, mushrooms are way
more expensive than apples, right.

50
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,926
Oh, but an apple is the forbidden fruit,
the fruit of knowledge,

52
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,530
that taught right from wrong
that Adam and Eve ate,

54
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,332
and was banned from
the Garden of Eden by God.

56
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,471
I think apples are way
more mystical than mushrooms.

58
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:29,442
If it's the fruit of wisdom it'd do
you good to eat a whole lot of it, Genta!

60
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,976
Shut up!!

61
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,611
The Old Testament eh!

62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,249
Although the saying that the fruit was
an apple is just popular belief.

64
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,361
Hmm, what's up, Mitsuhiko?

65
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,763
What's with that look on your face?

66
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:56,902
Huh! What look on my face!
I was just looking at her.

68
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,438
You mean Al?

69
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,142
Yes...
Although she's very blunt sometimes,

71
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,111
I think she's actually very
sophisticated and diverse?

73
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,179
As well as very
much of an adult.

75
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,349
Don't you think there's
this mysterious air about her?

77
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,653
Oh, but that doesn't mean that
I have special feelings for her

79
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,988
or anything like that you know...

80
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:22,261
Hey. Mitsuhiko, take itsfrom me,
stay away from hen!

82
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,867
She's not one you can handle...

83
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,975
Hey... look, look...

84
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,312
It might be a Mushroom!

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,449
Oh, that's a poisonous
« Mushroom called agar-agar.

87
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,786
I can't take this anymore!!

88
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,957
How the hell do we look for
mushrooms without any hints!

90
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,326
There are hints!

91
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,662
Look around carefully!

92
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:00,132
See the pine needles that are yellow green!

93
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:04,670
Mushrooms get their nutrition by sticking
onto the root of Japanese Red Pines,

95
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,273
¥so they are slightly weakened and
the needles change color;like that.

97
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,841
So, that's the 'place to look

98
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,777
Moreover, for mushrooms to grow,

99
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,581
good sunshine, good drainage of
water and ventilation is a must.

101
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,818
If you check out the area
with those things in mind...

103
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,156
See, you got what you want!

104
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:33,365
What a fine mushroom this is!

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,466
It sure looks delicious!

106
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,569
That's our first pick of the day.

107
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,072
Please look, everyone!

108
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,411
There are red pines with
yellow green needles over there too!

110
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,979
Oh, really?

111
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:50,282
Okay: I'm going to find sone too.

112
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:57,623
Yellow green needles...
Under...red pine trees.

114
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,129
I've found a mushroom too!

115
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,066
Ex, WO OO

116
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,270
Picking mushrooms does resemble
treasure hunting in a way,

118
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,372
and is quite a lot of fun.

119
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:14,640
You can say that again!

120
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,946
Hey, where's Genta

121
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,283
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen him around for a while...

123
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:28,921
Il Mm sure he's off somewhere using
the men's room or something.

125
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,725
Well, he was gulping down
a lot of mineral water so...

127
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:36,295
He'll be in big trouble
if he gets lost in a forest like this!

129
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,265
Let's go back and check!

130
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,099
Okay!

131
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,439
Genta went pass the first wired fence?!

132
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,108
RR. Really?

133
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,477
Yeah! No doubt about it!

134
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,181
Theysoil is still new and
the spacing is narrow.

136
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,218
It's proof that a child went over the fence

137
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:03,722
Besides:-there a lot of red pines
with yellow green needles

139
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,991
that I mentioned on the other side
of the fence too...

141
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:11,263
Good gracious ..Genta's Youth Detective
badge is under repair right now so

143
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,166
I can't use the tracing glasses either...

144
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:19,371
I've no choice
I:llggo look for him so you all stay here...

146
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,775
You're going off on your own again,

147
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,510
and planning to get the
credit all for yourself, aren't you?!!

149
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,546
Well go look for him together with you.
Because we're worried about him tool

151
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,916
B But on the other side of the fence

152
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,385
How about this?

153
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,156
Ill go as a pair with Mitsuhiko.

154
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,995
You go with Ayumi
Let's split up and loo «for him!

156
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:50,135
In the meantime Genta may come back
here, so Dr. Agasa, will youlwait here?

158
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,940
Well, it's more effective than looking 1
around for him alone, isn't it?

160
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,242
W Well, I guess so

161
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,880
But, be careful, Al
Two fences,down is the hunting area.

163
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:06,285
It's not unusual that people picking
mountain vegetables} are-mistaken \

165
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,854
for animals and shot by hunters, in Japan.

166
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,324
Oh, thank you.
So, you're worried about me

168
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,496
Anyway .
Let's all meetihenre in an hour.

170
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,633
If we can't find him, let's have the people
at the inn help us search for him.

172
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,801
Let's get started

173
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,444
Hey, let's get tot!

174
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,013
Let's go!

175
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,850
Oh...
O; Okay!

177
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,920
Hey:Genta!

178
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,856
Where are:you. Answer me!

179
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,061
Pp darn!

180
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,563
I wonder-where.on earth he is.
That Genta...

182
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:55,868
Genta
Genta; where are you?!

184
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,572
Uh, may I ask you a question?

185
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,944
Is there something
between Conan and you?

187
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,448
Something?

188
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,585
Well, you two are always sneaking off

189
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,488
and talking in an adult
Iike manner with each other...

191
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,892
You seem to understand
each other realy well

193
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,827
You both have. sort of,
a world of your own...

195
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,531
Oh, don't let it bother you,

196
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,500
because it's not something
all that romantic.

198
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,101
B But

199
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,271
Come on, let's go!!!

200
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,940
Uh, wait

201
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,710
What was that sound...?

202
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,380
It came from beyondyr
the two wired fences, didn't it...

204
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,582
The wired fence is torn-apart...

205
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:48,320
He.could've gone in beyond from here

206
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,623
I.It can't be .
The hunting grounds is beyond here!

208
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:56,462
If he got beyond-the first: fence,
and got lost in the forest in between,

210
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,698
he wouldn't be-able to tell
whether the hunting grounds is

212
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,100
beyond these red pine bushes, would he?

213
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,736
Oh, wait for me

214
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:13,612
Genta?!
Come on. You worried us out of ourewits.

216
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,319
B.8.818 Bear...

217
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,687
No sweat!

218
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:28,226
It's still a cub!
It doesn't even seem to be a year old yet.

220
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,195
How cute.

221
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,697
I...l guess so.

222
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,265
But, we've got to be careful,

223
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,133
because I'm sure the mother bear
IS somewhere nearby.

225
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,536
What!! What!! What!!

226
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,439
S, Sound of gun fire?!

227
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,141
Don't tell me that the mother of this cub
was shot by a hunter...

229
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,379
Oh no! Don't run that way.

230
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,284
There! It's a hunter!

231
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:56,053
L<hope he doesn't think that we're prey

232
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,858
Hey! We're people!!

233
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,796
This Is

234
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,332
This wound

235
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,134
Is a rifle wound ..7!

236
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,435
It can't be?!

237
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,672
Hey! Don't shoot, please!

238
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,074
We're people.

239
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,882
Don't you see? That hunter is after us!

240
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,419
He thinks that we've witnessed a murder
and he wants to shut us up!!

242
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,787
What!!

243
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,231
Genta, that's enough!!

244
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,635
Do you have any idea of how worried
we Were about-you I

246
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,604
1.1 mM really sorry...

247
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:48,073
I was trying to pick mushrooms
for everybody,

249
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,942
and before I knew it I went on in beyond...

250
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,043
Of all things!!

251
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,279
Well, well, either way,
you came back safely.

253
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,050
And, did-you contact Ai and Mitsuhiko?

254
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,653
Well'. I've been trying-to contact them
for a while now.

256
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,455
But I'm not getting any response...

257
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:07,426

267
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,199
Hey. hey!
The response from Mitsuhiko's badge

269
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,668
Seems to be
coming from the hunting area here!

271
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,269
What?

272
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:22,307
Strange, after all they should know that
they are not supposed to go inside.

274
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:28,180
Ghads, let'sffind them while it's still bright
and go backt o the inn-befor Sit gets.dark!

276
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,652
Hey, hey, I can't make up here!

277
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,687
Talk about helpless.

278
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,959
What's up.
Coming to a place with children?

280
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,228
What's up,
coming to a place with children?
& Kiyoshi Yasaka

284
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:49,001
Two children seem to have got lost
in here, so we're looking for them

286
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,937
Did you see a boy and girl
somewhere around here. mister

289
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,246
Hey! Here's Mitsuhiko's Youth
Detective Squad badge!!

291
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,416
Really?

292
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,752
But...the two are...
nowhere in sight...

294
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,356
Blood stains!

295
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:15,560
Hey! What are these big footprints?!

296
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,462
It's the footprints of a bear

297
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,266
What! which means that
they were both eaten by a bear?!

299
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,768
I don't think so.

300
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:25,537
Bears are basically afraidiof humans,

301
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,206
and besides they don't
take human's to be .beasts of prey

303
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,276
But, that's true
when it'"comes to that¥centain bear!!

O Oh, no

326
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,329
I see! So the rumor about the bear
was true after all...

328
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,999
My having come all this. way was worth it!!

We:don't even know whether
they were attacked, by the bear yet!

00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,248
At any rate,
Iet us help you look for the children.

343
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,185
Yeah! After all we know this mountain
better than you do!

345
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,654
Sorry, girlie.

346
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,624
Hey, Mitsuhiko!

00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,026
Ail;

348
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,663
It's Conan and the others!

349
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,566
See! On the other side of the forest!

350
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,174
Hey!

351
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,042
Wait!!

352
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,377
The hunter we saw a while ago
Is with them tool!

354
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,246
What?! But, why?

355
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,149
Probably to block our path of escape,

356
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,451
since we witnessed him
committing the murder.

358
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,555
If we go out carelessly
we'll be shot to death!

360
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,824
And, he'll probably justify himself saying
that he thought we were the bear.

362
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,898
Hey. All

363
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,300
Where are you, Mitsuhiko!

364
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,803
Answer us if you re around somewhere!

365
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,075
Another piece of potato chip
on the ground!

367
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:15,413
It's not stale yet, and
I'm sure the two left it behind as a trail!

369
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:19,317
They're.trying to showtus
the road they took.

371
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:25,423
Hey! Shouldn't we look for Ai's badge
using Conan s glasses?

373
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,327
Can't do, because her badge
is on my desk at home.

375
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,832
I was testing whether
the transmission*function of your badge

377
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,568
that is under repairgis working well, so...

378
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,769
Oh, no...

379
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,638
Hey, Doc.

380
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,175
Can you verbally describe the place

381
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,243
where I found Mitsuhikosbadge
a while ago. can't you?

383
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,613
Yeah, because it was near the place
the wired fence was torn apart.

385
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,349
Then, tell the person at the inn where it is,

386
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,386
and have the police check
that area together with you!

388
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,887
What? The police?!

389
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,825
Don't: ou think it's strange
that a trail of their path is left behind,

391
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,228
and yet we can't catch up with them
no matter how hard we try?

393
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,365
Aren't they running from the bear?

394
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,602
No. there were blood stains
around the area

396
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,304
where Mitsuhiko's badge was found...

397
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,607
There was a brand new bullet mark
on a tree nearby too.

399
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,411
Maybe it's not the bear that the two
are running from, but rather...

401
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,381
Hey, don't tell me that.!

402
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,183
Could it be Mitsuhiko and Al?

403
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,255
H,Hey! What's with you!

404
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,893
Shoots, it got away...

405
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,094
A rabbit?

406
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,599
Are you guys out of your mind?
What if it were the two kids ys.

408
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,003
I've got eyes good enough to
distinguish a prey from the kids.

410
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,007
Don't you worry even if
that bear Jubei comes out.

412
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,776
I ll get him with the swiftness
you just saw...

414
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,146
# That flimsy shot:of yours
wouldn't even skim by him!

416
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:55,947
What?!

417
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,085
If you treasure your life,
don't shoot even if Jubei appears!

419
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,890
The minute he senses the smell of
humans, he'll sneak soundlessly up to you.

421
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,560
A bullet shot will not kill him.
He is a monster of over 2 meters!

423
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,862
I'm the only one who can hunt him down!

424
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:17,068
Because I'm the one
who got one of his;eyes 20 years ago...

426
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,971
What's with that old man, anyway...?

427
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,774
He's a well know hunter in this area.

428
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,843
I hear that heused to. be a hunter

429
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,379
in the mountains of the
Tohoku region in the past...

431
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:33,084
But, since he ran into Jubei here,
he's decided to stick around it seems...

433
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,488
He was a hunter?

434
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,924
Yeah, the boss ofga group of hunters

435
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,493
I guess we don't have!to worry about
when the bear shows up then

437
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,162
Doc, will you make the call

438
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,563
Oh, all right...

439
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,104
Just as I thought.

440
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:57,342
That hunter was going to fire at us
the minute we showed. 'up in front of him.

442
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:03,048
B.But what if we shout out loud
and wait in the middle of the'road?

444
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,251
They've got little Ayumi
on their side you know

446
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:10,454
He may be thinking of taking her hostage pg
and killing everybody off.

448
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,491
After all. he's already murdered someone.

449
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:14,726
OO. Oh no...

450
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,963
Judging from how he looked
when he fired at us,

452
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:22,233
it seems that he came into the mountains
with a hunter that he had a grudge against

454
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,235
and shot him to death...

455
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:28,173
But, don't you have to submit papers
before you're allowed to hunt?

457
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:31,009
If the corpse is found,
wouldn't he be the prime suspect,

459
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,144
being that he came in together
with the one he killed?

461
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,247
Not really. You"can submit
the papers way before you come.

463
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,883
Then, you're allowed
to come and hunt anytime

465
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,919
between the duration of the permit.

466
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,822
You don't need to report
when you're coming.

468
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,191
In other words,

469
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,693
if you make the person that
you're planning to kill submit the papers,

471
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,062
and you go on and make
yourself a fake alibi,

473
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,231
even if the corpse is found, chances are,

474
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,834
the officers will think that some hunter
had mistakenly fired at him...

476
00:18:56,167 --> 00:19:00,372
WwW. Which means that
since we saw what happened...

478
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,308
Yes his plan went down the drain.

479
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,945
He's probably dying to kill us.

480
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,981
T.Then maybe we shouldn't have made
ajtrail with potato chips,

482
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,217
to let them know where we are,

483
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,252
but rather escape through the woods...

484
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,823
No! Moving.on our own in a forest
we are not familiar with is dangerous.

486
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,693
We have no way of
getting out of these mountains

488
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,295
without joining Dr. Agasa anyway

489
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,601
we'll be fine! If you dropped your badge
near the corpse

491
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,337
I'm sure that Conan will notice
something is wrong

493
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,207
Yes, I'm sure he will

494
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,114
Come on, we've got to think while walking
if we want.to<save ourselves

496
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:47,018
We've got to figure out a way to let Conan
alone know the predicament we're in...

498
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,588
Not only for ourselves do
we have to be careful,

500
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,526
Iso for this bear cub... th
some reason is coming along with us.

502
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,461
Y We don't want to endanger it; do. we!

503
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:57,562
N No.

504
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,299
I'll bet'a bear did this

505
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,968
The bear peeled off the outer wood
with its nails

507
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,404
and ate the sweet wood on the inside!

508
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,474
The space between the nails is wide
and it's pretty high too.

510
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,743
It:s'a pretty big one.

511
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,045
It's Jubel!

512
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:14,945
Huh?

513
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,482
Look,

514
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:21,886
she's bitten the tree together with the cub
that she gave binth to this winter

516
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,358
B.Birth to? Isn't Jubei a male?

517
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,493
You mean-you don't know???

518
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,329
It has been said:since the days of old

519
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,566
that the god who resides in the mountains
IS a Jealous goddess.

521
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,135
In order to. complete hunting safely,

522
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,404
it is necessary to avoid
the envy'ofimountain goddess,

524
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:42,507
% that's why the bear'has a male's name

525
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,544
She was named after the superb,
one-eyed 'swordsman, Yagyu Jubei

527
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,182
Yiou mean it's a female bear
that:is der 2 meters in height.

529
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,253
L-sure gotta-get a-look at this one.

530
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,324
All do anything to get to see it

531
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,259
Huh?

532
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:04,162
Is there anything on my face, mister?!

533
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:10,802
Oh, no, it's just that you talk so much
Iike one of my friends that I...

535
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,740
Um. is that friend of yours here
in the*mountains today, by any chance?

537
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,708
Huh

538
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:22,480
Because when you took your.camera .out
a while ago I saw a shotgun!

540
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,483
The bullet of that,gun splits
into 9 directions and flies#doesn't. it?

542
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,854
But the one you fired a while ago
was a one-direction gun...

544
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,991
I've heard that there is no hunter
that carries two types of 'bullets

546
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:33,892
when hunting...

547
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,997
My friend forgot to take his extra bullet
and went intotthe mountains without it.

549
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,101
I thought I'd give it to him if I ran into him,
and brought it along with me

551
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,336
But, will he be okay?

552
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,073
Your friend's still in there alone, isn't he?

553
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,808
He'll be fine!

554
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,411
He's been here many times,

555
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,414
and we always hunt
apart from each other anyway.

557
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,220
Do you sense something, Ayumi?

558
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,557
Oh, no, it's nothing

559
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,592
Hey, they're starting off!

560
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,793
Y,Yeah...

561
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,297
Hey, Ayumi!

562
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,332
Wait for me...

Without a.doubt...

617
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,806

among the three!!

619
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,745
