00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,871
stars and snow sparkle for the two

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,772
Valentine's Day is coming up soon!

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,474
Would you like a case with chocolates?

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:10,409
He sees through the oner:and only truth,

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,211
a child in appearance with
the I.Q. of an adult,

8
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,814
no case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan.

11
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:00,353
Bloody Valentine Part 1

12
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,454
Bloody Valentine Part 1

13
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,323
Valentine's my foot.

14
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,458
Nonsense @

15
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,996
Everybody's just fallen for
the tactics of the candy industry!

17
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,865
But, I think people on the
receiving end are ven happy!

19
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,468
Chocolate is good, besides!

20
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,005
I'll bet you're all sulky
because you're not going to get any.

22
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,207
Yeah you're so right!

23
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:25,077
With a body like this, all I'll be getting are
those for kids type chocolate anywa

25
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,614
Well, he's right...

26
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:31,617
Japan's the only country where
people are lightheartedly getting

28
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,486
all carried away over chocolate candies...

29
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,857
not even aware that St. Valentine, the one
Valentine s Day is actually in memory of,

31
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,160
was killed after being tortured...

32
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,596
Is, is that true?

33
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,364
But, my mother told me .

34
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,201
That Valentine's Day is a day when
girls create precious memories

36
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:52,238
after getting the power of love
from the chocolates

38
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,374
She explained that is why
chocolates are bitter and sweet.

40
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,511
Did you, buy chocolate, then, Ayumi?

41
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,311
No...

42
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,314
Father sai Kit was still too early for me
todo something like that...

44
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,118
Well, I guess it's too early for you
o be talking about love...

46
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,386
Andy

47
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,656
What did the detective agency girl
say she'd do? ?

49
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,658
OhOyou mean Ran?

50
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:17,063
She said that we'd be going to
a mountain lodge called Suito,

52
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,765
but*she didn't mention about chocolate...

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:20,933
op goo

54
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,971
Well, I sure hope it doesn't turn out to be
arbitter memory like Bloody Valentine...

56
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,240
Hey, hey,

57
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,943
Bloody Valentine... That's Al€Capone.

58
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,246
He made the 7 members of
the Muran family that he antagonize

60
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,783
all stand in front of the garage
and shot them to death

62
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,454
on February 14th, 1929...

63
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,856
Capone...

64
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,859
Come to think of it, he said

65
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,931
he was raised in the town
where Capone was

67
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,534
Conan, hurry; or we'll leave you behind!

68
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,869
Oh, yeah!

69
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,081
Why the hell do we have to go to a lodge

70
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,817
way out in the remote mountains
to make candy?

72
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,221
We're training ourselves to become
good wives, get it!

74
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,557
You can do all you like of things
Iike that at home!

76
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,759
Oh well, easy does it, okay...

77
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,497
I heard nothing about
making candy, though...

79
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:28,200
I was told that I'd get to see
a lot of cute mountain animals...

81
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,835
Oh, you mean you don't know?

82
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,038
Suito Mountain Lodge is famous for
being able to make chocolate

84
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,808
that will make your love come true!

85
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,775
What!

86
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,745
Which means that you're going to
hand make the chocolate,

88
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,781
and give it to Mr. Kyogyoku,
then finally confess your feelings to him?

90
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,051
Y,Yes, that's what I plan on doing...

91
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,655
What's the matter, Sonoko?

92
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,326
Makoto, ™ hasn't called recent! ¥£%.

93
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,064
Even if I call him, his phone is
always set at voice message...

95
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,399
0000

96
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,403
I guess I goofed... «

97
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,941
I told him that I'm making chocolate for
somebody I really like, over the phone.

99
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,143
I went all out with this
I love you a whole lot strategy

101
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,479
that I didn't get to do
when I gave him the sweater...

103
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,747
I'm sure that's itor:

104
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:18,884
I should've told him straight
that the chocolate was for him...

106
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,753
Everything will be just fine!

107
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,756
If you send him the chocolate
m sure that Mr. Kyogyoku...

109
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,959
You're so strong, Ran .

110
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,893
Huh?

111
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,364
Just one week of not talking to
him makes me this sad...

113
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,699
But, as for you and Shinichi,

114
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,834
this kind of thing has been
going on all this time, right...

116
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,038
Yeah, well, you see,
e gotten used to it...

118
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,510
And besides, who cares about
whether he's around or not...

120
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,786
Hello, we've come to make chocolate!

121
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,121
How do you do?!

122
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,592

154
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,417
and that reputation stands to this day!

155
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:29,088
My husband who was the previous owner
also passed away 4 yearns ago,

157
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,891
and thanks to a succession of
spook scandals

159
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,228
the number of guests
ecreased drastically...

161
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,497
A spook scandal?

162
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:44,103
Well, I advise you all not to go outside
alone because a snowstorm is coming!

164
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:50,709
That is, if you don't want the spook
that lives here to give you a strange gift...

166
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,612
A strange gift ?

167
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,148
Chocolate

168
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,451
This mountain is pretty intricate,

169
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,955
and there are many people
who get into trouble here.

171
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,691
The weird thing is,
every year during thisseason,

173
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,960
chocolate is left

174
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,163
near the corpse that is found.

He's a journalist...

233
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,414
He went.out to get films and pictures
that would serve as evidence of

235
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,384
a case he has been pursuing
from about 5 years ago!

Since I'm a photographer,

00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,190
I used to accompany him too,
In the beginning

240
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,659
because he insisted
he saw it in the forest

243
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,998
it was the s,. snow woman?!

245
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,003
He's pursuing an animal
that actually existed!

247
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,939
Well, I guess it's not much
different from the snow woman

with a hunter's rifle like that...

Oh, you mean this rifle?

275

00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,659
Oh, good boy, good boy!

293
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,561
Oh, it's a dog...

294
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,431
Don't tell me that the journalist
who just went out...

296
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:36,835
mistook that.unleashed dog for a wolf?

297
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,370
No way!

298
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,974
It was 10:00 at night
when he saw the wolf...

300
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,775
Then, the more so...

301
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,980
Saburo is put in his cage after it gets dark.

302
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,115
Oh, I see...

304
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,854
Okay, so shall we start making
chocolate whileygranny's out!

307
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,122
Oh, okay, yes!

308
00:10:57,724 --> 00:10:58,524
Huh?

309
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,393
That granny's not the one
who's g ing to teach?

311
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,996
She didibefore, but...

312
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,466
We're the ones who teach the guests now!

313
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,271
It's our way of thanking her for putting us
up here every time at this timewof year.!...

315
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:12,971
Oh...

316
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:17,109
But, granny does do the finishing touches
on the chocbolatésfeven now, though!

318
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,243
Nam a
0000

320
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,214
I guess that thing about
Iove what-nuts is something

322
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,715
you can't really look forward to then...

323
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,250
Oh, shut up!

324
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,488
Okay, only three more days
to Valentine's Day!!

326
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,589
Let's givelt our best shot!!

327
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,990
Let's give it our best shot!!

329
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,534
Granny's husband died in an avalanche...

330
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:43,368
Yes...

331
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,271
4 years ago, on February the 14th...

332
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,875
It seems that he was buried
under the snow for a week

334
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,777
until Saburo dug him out...

335
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,782
The other one was never dug out after all...

336
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,251
Huh? Another one...

337
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:00,919
Y brother...

338
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,255
Is whereabouts have been
nknown ever since...

342
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:11,997
The police say that he's probably
buried under the snow...

344
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,601
But I can't help feeling that he's still alive...

345
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,937
That's why I come here every year!

346
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,474
And besides I visit
the previous owner's grave too!

348
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:26,678
I'm sorry for talking about
something so glum...

350
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,913
Oh no, not at all

351
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,984
can we help with something?

352
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,487
No, no, guys stay out!

353
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,789
You'll get hurt like Mr. Nigaki did!

354
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,725
1.I'm sorry.

355
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:42,728
There...

356
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,396
Okay!

357
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,865
All right, I'm almost done!!

358
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,267
Oh, how: lovely!

359
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,737
Pretty good, pretty good!

360
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,404
Very true!

361
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,717
Okay, so why don't we all take a picture
together with the chocolate!

363
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,351
Okay!

364
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,794
The blizzand is getting stronger...

365
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,997
I wonder if Mr. Nigaki is okay...

366
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,902
Uh, sorry, but we'll go check on Mr Nigaki

367
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:24,970
So, wait here okay?!

368
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,004
Kay...

369
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,074
Huh? Where are you going...

370
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,409
We'll be right back!

371
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,417
Mr. Nigaki, where are you?!

372
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,052
Mr. Nigaki!!

373
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:40,952
Mr Nigaki!!

374
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:41,420
Mr. Nigaki!!

375
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,365
What?!

376
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,068
Mr. Nigakigissnowhere in sight?!

377
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,906
Yeah, we split up to search for him, but

378
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,975
The blizzard's getting worse!

379
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,312
Anyway, let's go search for him
before the visibility becomes zero.

381
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,981
Conan, wait here in the lodge.

382
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:11,917
All right!

383
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,855
Like I'd do that...

384
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,590
Let's go, Saburo!

386
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,912
Yoshitaka!!

387
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:41,847
Mr. Nigaki!!

388
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,115
Mr. Nigaki!!

389
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:43,648
Mr. Nigaki!!

390
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,249
Mr. Nigaki!!

391
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,318
Where are you?!

392
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,886
Mr. Nigaki!

393
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,822
Where are you, Mr. Nigaki?!!

394
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,625
Hey!! Answer me!!

395
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,160
Where are you?!

396
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:55,494
Mr. Nigaki!!

397
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:56,461
Mr. Nigaki!!

398
00:14:59,031 --> 00:14:59,531
What?

399
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,500
The sound of a rifle?!

400
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,436
Ooks bad...

401
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,973
Maybe he got to it first?

402
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,108
Who are you?

404
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:12,477
I'm a guest staying at
Suito Moutain Lodge...

Hey, Saburo?!

420
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,998
MM. Mr. Nigaki?

421
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:34,866
Mr. Nigaki?!

422

No good, he's not breathing...

423
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,609
He was beaten to death...

424
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,813
What's this?

425
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:51,950

chocolate?!

427

O ooeol

429
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,394
The blizzard's getting worst!!

430
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,663
Hey, what are you going to do?

431
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,866
If we keep on searching
the mountain like this,

433
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,468
We Ill end up dead ourselves.

434
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,405
B,But, we can't just leave Mr. Nigaki*and...

435
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:14,539
Huh?

436
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:15,340
Huh?

437
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,374
A dog?!

438
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,876
In a remote mountain like this?

439
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,011
Could it be Saburo?

440
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,415
It can't be,
because he should be back at the lodge!

442
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,051
D.,Don't tell me it's Conan?!

443
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,391
C Conan?!

444
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,595
Just what are you doing here?!

445
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,730
I told you to stay at the lodge, didn't I ?!

446
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,732
L,I'm sorry...

447
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,668
But, Ms. Konakawa said a while ago that...

448
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:48,006
when.the previous owner of the lodge
gotycaught in an avalanche,

450
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,209
Saburo dug him out!

451
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,078
» Pa ~
Ih, 1 CO...

453
00:16:53,446 --> 00:17:00,285
That's why I thought that maybe Saburo
would be able to find Mr. Nigaki too!

455
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,488
Since Mr. Nigaki had come to
the lodge many times

457
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,625
I was sure that Saburo would
be familiar with his smell too!

459
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,861
And? Did you find Mr. Nigaki?

460
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,029
Yep...ll found him...

461
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,867
But, he's already cold...

462
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:16,801
What!!

463
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,810
This isn't happening is it, Yoshitaka...

464
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:27,646
Yoshitaka?!

465
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:28,847
Stay away!!

466
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,714
Look!

467
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,783
His face is smeared with blood...

468
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:36,454
And this fat blood stained branch
that is on the ground right beside him...

470
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,258
This is undoubtedly a homicide case...

471
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,661
Now that we know it's a murder,

472
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,930
we can't mess this site up anymore...

473
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,865
Murder...

474
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,599
h no...

475
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,535
Hey, what's with that
g shot attitude of your...

477
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,671
You're not a police detective
or something, are you...

479
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,341
ah...You're right about m
not being a police detective anymore...

481
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,810
But, I am an ex-officer and now detective,
Kogoro Mouri!

483
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:00,745
What?!!

484
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,481
M,Mouri, don't tell me that you re that...

485
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,083
Renown detective?!

486
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,687
Then, do you know who the killer is ?

487
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,357
Because his body is frozen from this cold

488
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,960
making¢it impossible
to figure out the estimated time of death.

490
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:18,430
Moreover, the wind has
blown away the footprints...

492
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,132
the only thing that may be left as a clue 1s

493
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:25,503
that Mr Nigaki's blood may have
stained the killer s clothes...

495
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:30,241
I'm pretty sure
he was killed in the day time...

497
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,579
The reason why the blood on Mr. Nigaki s
face is wiped off part way us,

499
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,716
that it had been wiped off
when something rubbed against it

501
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:41,720
And the fact that he is still wearing
his goggles goes to show that

503
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:46,024
he was killed when it was still bright,
and the blizzard hadn't come yet!

505
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:51,529
It would be too dangerous to move along
insthis'blizzard with these goggles on...

507
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,733
I see... . Just as would be
expected of a renown detective...

509
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,736
Fuh, it's no big deal"

510
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,405
This is a mere first step
n any investigation...

512
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,440
I wonder about that...

513
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,975
Ot you again...

514
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,746
Take a good look inside his goggles!

515
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,716
His left contact lens is out of place!

516
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,983
You idiot!

517
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,754
That's probably because
he killer punched him...

519
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,124
But, he's not wearing
contact lens in his right eye,

521
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,593
nor is it inside his goggles!

522
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,261
T, True.

523
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,296
Oh, I get it!

524
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,600
The right one probably fell to the ground
when he was punched,

526
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,804
and at the same time his sunglasses moved
out of place, so the killer fixed it for him!

529
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,570
I OTT...

530
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:34,172
(3) - -
I OTC...

532
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,308
hat a meticulous killer...

533
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,110
Hey, this is no time to be convinced...

534
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,914
Uh- could it"be that
the killer deliberately made him wear it?

536
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,915
Huh?

537
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,583
That's right

538
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,720
But, why do something like that?

539
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,923
Come to think of it,
I found something strange!

541
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,125
See, this chocolate!

542
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,529
I found it on his stomach!

543
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:57,996
Hmm...

544
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,266
Yoshi is written on it...

545
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:02,600
Huh?

546
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:06,137
H.Hey, isn't that the chocolate
you made today, Ako?

548
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:10,108
WwW, Why?
Why is my chocolate over here. ?

550
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,212
Aren't you the one who
put it near the corpse?

552
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,081
Ako couldn't have done it!

553
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:20,251
The chocolate was in the kitchen
until we all left the lodge...

555
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:24,556
She was with us right through after that...

556
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,759
Then, who put the chocolate over here...

557
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,695
robably the killer...

558
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,631
The corpse has been touched here there
and everywhere too it seems...

560
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,901
It's pretty likely that
the killer brought it here

562
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,570
to make it look like
Ako committed the crime!

564
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,339
At any rate, let s talk this over
after returning to the lodge

566
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,008
and contacting the police...

567
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,511
The police are not going to be
able to get here for a while.

569
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:47,278
Huh?

570
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,114
Hey, Mr. Sakami,

571
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,882
I'm surprised that you found this place...

572
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:53,651
I heard the dog barkin

573
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,587
Never mind that.

574
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,123
Just what do you mean by
the police can't come here?

576
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,558
The tunnel located partway along the road

577
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,595
that leads from the foot of
the mountain to the lodge

579
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,198
has been blocked off by an avalanche
that occurred about 30 minutes ago!

581
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:09,934
I'm pretty sure it's going to take
at least a day

583
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,870
before they can open up the road again

584
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:12,737
Oh no!

585
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,671
Seriously?!

586
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,874
T, Then, what is it?

587
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,310
Are you saying that we're going to have to
spend the night at the lodge tonight?

589
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:24,449
When the one who killed
Nigaki may be among us?!

591
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,853
I don't give a hoot?

592
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,189
That's more thrilling besides...

593
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:34,459
If you don't want to spend
the night over at the lodge,

595
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,030
why don't you spend the entire night
beside your big brother who was killed?

597
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:44,502
But, by day break you may have
turned into Snow Woman though...

599
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,712
The remains of the blood stain
hat was wiped off...

601
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,382
Sunglasses that were replaced on him

602
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:01,786
d...Ako s chocolate.

603
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:08,326
Why did the killer go out of the way to
bring Ako's chocolate out of the kitchen?!

605
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,597
Why on earth?!

before I met all of you here,

657
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,731
I ran Into a queer guy in the woods...
