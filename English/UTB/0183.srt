00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,002
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,670
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,606
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved

5
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,608
today's point is a shopping receipt

6
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,275
A small piece of paper-says a lot.

7
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,211
He sees through the one and only truth

8
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,880
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,682
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

12
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,718
Whoopee, whoopee,

13
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,319
how's about it, Mitsuhiko!

14
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,121
Yaiba Kick!!

15
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,255
Whaaaa!!

16
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,125
Damn, I'm beat!!

17
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,460
It's my turn next, my turn!!

18
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,529
How long are you guys going to
keep this up?

20
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,131
There, Ayumi! Go for it!

21
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,266
I'm not going to lose! There!

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,334
Oh....No, no.

23
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,469
Yaiba Punch!

24
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,536
Yaaaaah...

25
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,742

An ice cream cone after a battle
IS delicious!!

32
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,488
You can say that again!
You should've played too, Conan.

34
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:36,822
Yeah, maybe next time.

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,359
It sure Is crowded, isn't it?

36
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,428
It's already past 16:00,

37
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,430
so they're all here to buy things
for making dinner.

39
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:47,833
Dinner...l wonder what it is today.

40
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,302
I hope it's eels over rice...

41
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,170
Right!

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,172
Why don't we play
a menu deduction game?

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,107
A menu deduction game?!

45
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,775
What's that?

46
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,311
Well, it goes like this.

47
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,381
We deduce what the shoppers
are having for dinner

49
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,317
by looking at the receipts
they leave:behind.

51
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,120
Okay, here goes.

53
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,656
Potatoes, onions,

54
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,458
Keiran' six pack...

55
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,326
What's a "keiran?"

56
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,396
Eggs..meggs of a hen.

57
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:18,230
AOh...

58
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,031
Uh, next...

59
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,834
Ground beef, and bread crumbs

60
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:22,635
and the answer is?

61
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,637
I got it! It's croquette!!

62
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,706
But you also need flour to make it,
don't you?

64
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,443
Maybe she's already got the flour.

65
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,444
Oh, I see...

66
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,712

Chicken thighs, ketchup, green peas,
tomato, lettuce and celery...

72
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,789
Chicken rice!

73
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,991
With vegetable salad.

74
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,993
Okay, next it's my turn!

77
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,897
Okay, here goes!

78
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:52,832
Uh...

79
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:59,905
potatoes, onions, beef, flour, sugar

80
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:00,906
the answer is...

81
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,976
Um... meat with potatoes... no...

82
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,178
Cream stew or gratin...?

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,516
But, then it should be
salt and pepper, not sugar...

85
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,285
Maybe the sugar is going to be used for
something else?

87
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,355
The person doesn't have to be
buying ingredients

89
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,224
only for tonight's dinner, right?

90
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,093
I see, that's true

91
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,361
Then, here's the next one!

92
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,165
Pe... Peli. 1 . ? Petite knife,

93
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:31,770
cutting board, grater, handy.gloves,

94
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,773
Food# case... dustpan...

95
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,576
Isn't that the receipt for
a different section?

97
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,912
What is this thing called petite knife?

98
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,248
It's a small knife.

99
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,650
Something like a knife for cutting fruit.

100
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:46,652
What're handy gloves?

101
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,522
Gloves used when cooking?

102
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,259
Do you wear gloves when cooking?

103
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,693
Oh, I get it.

104
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,430
That person probably just moved in,
and is going to start cooking from tonight!

106
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,100
That's why the shopper bought a knife
and cutting board too!

108
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,302
The grater's going to be used for
grating onions!

111
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,438
they're deductions are pretty good.

112
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,508
The dustpan's going to be used for
cleaning!

114
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,043
Obviously

115
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,579
I wonder if she's a young woman?

116
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,915
It could also be a man...

117
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,051
Uh...the third one is...

118
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,720
Oh, it's Kamen Yaiba color ball!!

119
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,723
Huh, then maybe there's a child?

120
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,391
The fourth one is...

121
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,663
Size #2 batteries, handle light...

122
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,731
What's a handle light?

123
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,135
I think it's light that you attach to
the handle of a bicycle?

125
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,138
The items are not all food, are they...

126
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,607
The fifth one is...

127
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,075
This one is of another store.

128
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,545
Drugstore Satoshi Kobayashi...

129
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,147
The drugstore:-next door!

130
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,617
The name of the drugstore
changedarecently, right?

132
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,951
Never mind<athat,

133
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,353
what's onsthe shopping list?

134
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,689
Hmm...C...Chro...chrOnin...?

135
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,425
Chroninr.!

136
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,427
Genta, show me that!

137
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,028
The receipt of the food products section
that you read at the beginning too.

139
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,698
WwW WhatOs with you, Conan...

140
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,765
Hurry, give it to me!

141
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,067
Aaah...

142
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,237
What's wrong, Conan?

143
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,838
He's right...chronin...

144
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,343
What on earth is that thing called
chronin??

146
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,746
It's a colorless or whitish crystalline
substance

148
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,083
usually used to sterilize or
disinfect the skin...

150
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,152
There is another way
this substance is used...

152
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,355
Another way...?

153
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,092
Chronin is deadly toxic...

154
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,493
What!!!

155
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,028
D,Did you say...toxic?!

157
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,233
well, it's usually used to make
mole balls to get rid of moles...

159
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,703
The ingredients for making
those mole balls are

161
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:48,374
on this receipt,
potatoes, onions, beef, flour, and sugar.

163
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,910
Then maybe the shopper bought them
to get rid of moles?

165
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,245
Genta...

166
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,781
Do you think that there are moles
in a city like this?

168
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,182
Oh, that's true

169
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,718
Maybe we see mice sometimes but...

170
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:03,455
Then maybe it's going to be used
to disinfect the skin after all.

172
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:07,059
The potatoes and onions are going to
be used to make stew or gratin.

174
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,398
Well...l uess so...

176
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,603
Conan...

177
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,739
If it bothers you so much,

178
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,275
why don't you ask the employees here?

179
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,678
Eah, you're right...

180
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:27,946
hag v3%,

181
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,550
15:20...
It was bought only an hour ago...

184
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,220
The person in charge is Masako Aral.

185
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,389
Thank you for waiting.

186
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,259
I remember that person very well.

187
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,593
All right!

188
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,796
He was about 20 years old.

189
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,598
At first I thought what he wanted
was out of stock

191
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,534
so I told him it'll come in tomorrow.

192
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,203
But, he insisted he needed it today so...

193
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,739
How did he act?

194
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,011
Hmm...well he seemed sort of jittery
and didn't look all that calm.

196
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,281
Do you remember his face?!

197
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,415
The color of his hair?!

198
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,417
Was he fat like me?!

199
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,420
Huh? ¢

200
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,422
Please tell us!!

201
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,424
Hey...

202
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,335
Height about 170 centimeters...

203
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,271
Brown hair and wearing glasses.

204
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,675
Skinny and wearing a blackish top...

205
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:38,951
The point is
why this man bought chronin...

207
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,553
a If he used it to disinfect his

208
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,424
it bothers me that
e didn't seem calm

210
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,896
Um, what happens if
humans eat the mole balls?

212
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,300
It won't kill the person,
but probably numb the body

214
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:56,969
making it unable to move...

215
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,303
Unable to moveg

216
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,571
I got it!

217
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,041
The guy was trying to
make mole balls after all!

219
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,778
He was going to make
somebody eat them

221
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,513
and then, kidnap the person!!

222
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,380
Kidnap?!

223
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,851
If so, it's understandable
why he bought the ingredients

225
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,255
to make mole balls despite no moles!

226
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,190
Anyway,

227
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,125
Let's search the identity of this man.

229
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,866
I wonder, I don't remember
because there are a lot of shoppers...

232
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,137
This is the one!

233
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,007
Petite knife, 1980 yen.

234
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:39,478
Although it's small,
it's enough to cut potatoes and onions.

236
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,148
The cutting board is plastic
and is also the smallest one around.

238
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,417
The grater is also plastic.

239
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:51,490
Everything looks like something a man
who doesn't usually cook, rushed to buy.

241
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,893
Hey...these are the glove for 120 yen.

242
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,766
Very thin gloves made of-polyethylene

243
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:04,903
If these are used to make mole balls,
no fingerprints would be left behind

246
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,243
Disposables.

247
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,646
But, it's more than enough to
carry around-the:mole balls!

249
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,718
This has got the longest
and thinnest handle.

251
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:24,456
But, what does a dustpan have to do with
the sales floor mole balls?

253
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,326
I can't tell... either...

254
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:34,132
Maybe a guyssomething like that
bought it.

256
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,401
Do you have any idea who he is?

257
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,403
No...

258
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,073
Did you know that this pole...

259
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,475
glows in the dark!

260
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,811
It's made with fluorescent paint.

261
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,481
What does this have to do with
the mole balls?

263
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,818
We didn't notice anybody like that
buying it, did we?

265
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,821
And, we were playing right behind too...

266
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,159
This handle light

267
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,295
I remember it well

268
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,831
because it's a new item
that just came out only three days ago.

270
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:06,899
See.

272
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,903
this is an important piece of evidence!

273
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,504
Was the person who bought it

274
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:16,174
about 170 centimeters

275
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:21,246
and ah skinny, wearing a blackish top,
with brown hair and glasses?

277
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,382
Oh, you really are knowledgeable.

278
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,517
He also bought batteries.

279
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,387
But, I have no idea of
who or where he lives

281
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,858
Okay, we'll buy that

283
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,832
Are you going togput that-on
your bicycle too, Conan?

285
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,133
(:56

286
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,968
If so, you've got to buy batteries too.

288
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:44,702
I'm not going to use it.

289
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,306
We'll use it as a clue to finding the man.

290
00:11:48,006 --> 00:11:52,311
But, how, without even knowing
his name or address

293
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,446
No, we've got a clue.

294
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,248
The sixth receipt.

295
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,185
We havenOt looked at
the sixth receipt yet!

297
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,520
I ¢s*a receipt from a convenience store.

298
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:08,060
Utopia, Beikacho Park Branch.
A vinyl umbrella was bought at 14:50.

300
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,895
14:50'?

301
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,898
That's about the time
we were at the Beika Library.

303
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:17,101
Yeah, and there was a sudden
pour of shower.

305
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,638
200 meters from this shop,

306
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,974
there is a bus stop for
the Beika Station bus.

308
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,643
The man probably rode the Beika Station.

309
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,311
I think

310
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,248
this guy walked from his residence
and headed for Beika station

312
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,518
But, since it suddenly began to pour,

313
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,656
he went into. thisgstore and
bought himself and umbrella.

315
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,104
Judging from the fact that he bought
a knife and cutting board,

317
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,639
he probably doesn't live with his family,

318
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,941
but rather alone
in an apartment or a condo.

320
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,076
I see, living alone...

321
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:02,614
It's most likely that
he frequents the convenience store!

323
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,683
Maybe we'll be able to find out
who he is or where he lives!!

325
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,152
Okay, let's go to that store!!

326
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,757
The man remarked that
he had to have the chronin by today

328
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,228
If the plans to make the mole balls
by today and make someone eat it...

330
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,764
We've got to hurry.
We have no time to lose!!

332
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:50,796
This way!!

333
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:58,637
Keep

338
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,471
Hmm...

339
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,076
Brown hair, wearing glasses,
about.20 years old,

341
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:06,745
about 170 meters tall:-and a male...

342
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,948
We have a lot of'customesrs like that...

343
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,152
He bought a large vinyl umbrella
at about 14:50...

345
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,822
Oh, maybe-it could be him.

346
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,223
Do you know him?!

347
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,493
He comes here every so often...

348
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,096
Do you know his name or address?!

349
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,630
No...

350
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,233
But, I think he lives nearby,

351
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,035
because he comes here
wearing sandals most of the time.

353
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,174
We couldn't find out who or where
he lives:after all, could we..2

355
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,310
We've got no choice
but to split up and look for him.

357
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,177
What?!

358
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,912
But, how?

359
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,847
The bicycle!

360
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,515
Bicycle?!

361
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,717
The man didn't go shopping
with his bicycle

363
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,520
because it wasn't equipped
with a basket to carry his things in.

365
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:55,360
And, I'm positive that the guy's bicycle
has a new type handle light on it!

367
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,428
I see!

368
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,663
So, we're going to look for a bicycle that
doesn't have a basket and

370
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,500
has a new type handle light attached to it
parked in the apartments nearby!

372
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,367
Uh-huh!

373
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,436
Take this, Genta

374
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,637
so you don't make a mistake!!

375
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,105
Aye!

376
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,309
For you, Ayumi and Mitsuhiko.

377
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,377
Ugh!

378
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,111
Okay!

379
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,313
Listen, like I said before,

380
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,850
the man's house is near here
opposite the bus stop.

382
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,352
He lives some distance away that

383
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,120
it is too much trouble to go back home
to get his umbrella.

385
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,589
If you find him, report so,
» Using your badges!!!

387
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:26,925
See you.

388
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,393
Huh?-Conan!

389
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,128
That way's.the bus stop!

390
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,732
Where on earth is he going?

391
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,335
I'm sure Conan has something in mind.

392
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,471
Let's go ahead and look for the guy!

393
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,577
He probably went to buy
the handle light today,

395
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,512
Because he's planning to use
his bicycle tonight!

397
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,915
We've got to be ready for that too!

398
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,653
But, I wonder what he's going to use
the dustpan and pole for?

402
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,318
I found it!!

403
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,324
Ah-ah-testing microphone,
testing microphone.

405
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,459
Youth Detective Squad
Youth Detective Squad,

407
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,127
the bicycle in question has been found!!

408
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,296
Report the scene on the double!!

409
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,698
Good work, Genta!!

410
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,102
Genta!!

411
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:45,904
So, you've found it!!

412
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,572
Only Conan's not here yet?!

415
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,912
You went back to get your skateboard?!

416
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,449
0, he lives here...

417
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,919
But, I wonder which room he lives in.

418
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,922
Let's hide and watch.

419
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,323
He should be coming out.

420
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,324
Aye!!

421
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,839
Somebody's come out!!

422
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,615
About 170 meters tall, skinny,
wearing a blackish top,

424
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,050
brown hair and glasses...

425
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,451
Is it him?!

426
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:33,985
Wait.

427
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:38,790
It's definitely him!!

428
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:45,931
Okay!

429
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,201
Me too!

430
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:50,935
Same here!

431
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:51,736
Me too!!

432
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:52,938
Ghads!

433
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,475
Hang on tight!

434
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:06,217
Conan, he's pulling away from us.

435
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,086
At this rate, we'll lose him!

436
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,488
Can't you speed up a bit more?!

437
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,156
You guys are too heavy!!

438
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,693
Aaaagh!!

439
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,534
He's gone...

440
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,803
We've lost him after all.

441
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,739
Aa aa [_ a
Ne Jur ult 1nicioc...winuiy nwnicais...

443
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,010
It's most likely that he went into
one of the houses nearby...

445
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,212
Should we check
one house after another?

447
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,079
Huh?!

448
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,016
I don't want to go in this alley.

449
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:41,886
There's a house with a large yard,
with a big dog that barks a lot here.

451
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:42,754
1111

452
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,089
Maybe?!!

453
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,626
Did you know this pole glows in the dark!

454
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,764
This dustpan has the longest
and thinnest dustpan handle.

456
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,966
Bow-wow!

457
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,502
Bow-wow! Bow-wow!

458
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:36,975
Don't.

459
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,916
What you are about to do,
IS a crime, you know.

461
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,253
Bow-wow

462
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,457
No use trying to flee!

463
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,459
Your name is Murakami, isn't it?!

464
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,327
We know where you live too!!

465
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,131
Bow-wow

466
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,681
Well, Mr. Murakami,
are you still going to run?

468
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,360
Genta, take off your shoes!!

469
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:29,894
Huh?!

470
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:31,896
The shoe!

471
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,639
Aaagh!

472
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:44,242
'Sh u

473
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,451
bow-wow!

474
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:02,927
My shoe...

475
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,669
After this, the neighbors call the police,
who arrive in no time.

477
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,038
Murakami is arrested...

00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:52,303
To think that he was going to give
the mole balls to the dog.

522
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:56,641
I heard from the officer of
Beikacho police station over the phone

524
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,378
that the guy was saying he was going to
Kill that dog one of these days,

526
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,381
everyday when he went out for a walk
along his favorite path,

528
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,683
that dog would bark ferociously at him.

529
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,153
That dog really does bark a lot.

530
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,690
He learned of making mole balls
in a book, and yesterday afternoon,

532
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,093
when he passed in front of the house,

533
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,930
he happened to find out that the entire
family was out on an over night trip.

535
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,132
He suddenly decided to
carry out his plan.

537
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,534
He was going to feed the dog
the mole balls,

539
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,604
and after it became immobile he was
going to hit it with the stick and kill it.

541
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,741
The menu game that we decided to play

542
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,110
ended up saving that dog's life, didn't it?

543
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,113
Let's play it again!

544
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,248
I brought the receipts!!

545
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,850
Don't pick things like that up!!

546
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,485
Okay, here goes!

547
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,621
Sashimi, Mayonnaise, cup noodles...

548
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,967
eel sick...

549
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,582
That sound just now was one of gun fire!!

550
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,592
Hmm?! What is it?
