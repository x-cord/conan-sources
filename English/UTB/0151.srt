1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,870
Inspiration flashes piercing
through to the truth.

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,404
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

4
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,373
Today's episode has the smallest cast ever.

5
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,208
Stay right there for a sudden
reversal of circumstances.

7
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,043
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,845
A child in appearance with
the IQ of an adult,

10
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,348
no case is left unsolved when Detective
Conan comes to the scene.

12
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:55,481
A car that is rigged with an explosive
explodes at the parental home

14
00:01:55,482 --> 00:02:00,086
of Megumi Sakihara, a person who Pops
used to tutor in his school days.

16
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:03,589
The victim who passes away in the incident
turns out;to be Megumi's younger sister,

18
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,126
Hiromi, who was reversing the car out of
the garage for Megumi

20
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,029
because she was supposedly not
good at it.

22
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,701
The suspect turns up to be a man named
Hiromasa Trakahashi.

24
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,772
He agrees to carrying out an exchange
murder with Megumi's husband

26
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:24,876
Kazuo Sakihara. However, he inadvertently
ills Hiromi instead of Megumi.

28
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,916
Both men confess to their crime,
and it looks at first glance

30
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,085
that the case has
een solved. However...

32
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:39,658
She's easily reversing that big car out
of that super narrow parking lot...

35
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,566
This case haspnot yet ended!!

36
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,672
The Car Explosion Case" Part ll

37
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,977
ConanOwhat's up?!

38
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,812
Hey! Is anything wrong?

39
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,781
Oh, it's nothing.

40
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,518
I think Megumi came here.to buy:.us
some cake or something.

42
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,653
Let's hurry and go to Megumi's house!

43
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:12,324
Ghads, what's with that kid anyway?

44
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,161
It's too early to tell Pops about this...

45
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,763
I've got to get more corroborative proof...

46
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:25,671
I, uh...l just don't know what to say .

47
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:32,178
Thank you very much I'm fine, so please
don't worry yourself over me.

49
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,245
O,Oh...

50
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,216
Please have some tea before it gets cold.

51
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,452
Thank you.

52
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,553
I'll have some too.

53
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,655
How about some cake, Conan

54
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,391
Huh. Oh, okay!

55
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,894
May I goat athe restroom first?

56
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,141
Over there. .!

58
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:28,534
Sakihara had a phone exclusively
for himself upstairs and

60
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,604
took all his calls with that phone.

62
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,730
What's that...

63
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:02,201
That's the remains of masking tape
being peeled off!

65
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,235
That's the remains of masking tape
being peeled off!

67
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,604
Just as I thought...

68
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,409
So, "it" was set up there after all.

69
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,950
I'll bet you're relieved that Megumi looked
way better than you thoughtishe would, TN

71
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,652
right, Dad.

72
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,489
Yeah! I'll guess she'll dookay.

73
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,893
I've got some place to stop by
when we get to Beika Station,

75
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,261
so you can both leave me and go home.

76
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,498
All right, but remember, don't be too late.

77
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,021
Here's a window...

78
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,425
I see... If it's from that window.

79
00:05:59,426 --> 00:05:59,725
I see... If it's from that window...

80
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,198
Just as I thought...!

81
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:13,105
Okay! I've got the overall picture!
Now, all I need is proof!

83
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,177
I'm back!

84
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,216
Pops!

85
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,921
Something bothers me about the case.

86
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:29,722
What...

87
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,025
Because, remember Megumi
reversed her car out of

89
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:36,061
the narrow parking space of the
supermarket today, right?

91
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,697
Then why did She have her younger sister
back her car out for her

93
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,532
when the incident happened...?

94
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:47,706
Besides on the wall near the telephone of
the upstairs study of Megumi's house,

96
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:50,042
it looked like masking tape was peeled off.

97
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,378
That means that something was
stuck on there, right?

99
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,946
Masking tape?...

100
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,321
Did you know that there was a window
way inside the garage

102
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,956
where the incident occurred, Pops?

103
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,192
It seems that the window cracked from the
impact of the explosion and

105
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,528
a wooden board was placed over it.

106
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,064
But, with a window like that over there,
it's good because you can get

108
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,799
a good view of the car
from inside the house .

110
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,069
What are you trying to get at...?

111
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:22,908
Are you insinuating that Megumi has
something to do with thi'case'?!

113
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,512
I don't know... But.

114
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,881
Don't be ridiculous!

115
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:34,853
I know her best because she used to
be my student!!

117
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:40,192
You knew her as a high school student,
right, Pops?

119
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,699
Megumi could've changed
after growing up

121
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,667
Don't you dare get cheeky with me!!

122
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:54,139
She hasn't changed a bit!! She's the way
she always used to be!!

124
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,875
You want to believe so, don't you, Pops.

125
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:57,976
What?!

126
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,380
But, actually she's already...

127
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:05,084
Shut up and go on upstairs!!

128
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,121
I'm going to go take a bath.

129
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:19,264
Ghads! How dare that brat
talk to me like that!

131
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,504
A secret window?

132
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,207
Yes, Hiromi and I call it that.

It seems that Dad actually wanted to use
his as a door, though...

140
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,854
When I was little and getting into
things in the garage,

00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,289

Sakihara and Takahashi?

The record of the testimonies of
Sakihara and Takahashi?

152
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,739
Yes. I'd like to take a quick look, and
eview the results...

154
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,409
Dideianything new.come up.in later
Investigations?

156
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,882
Hmm...According to one
of Hiromi's friends. .the late" Hiromi seems to

158
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,585
have taken two boyfriends away from
Megumi, in her younger days.

160
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,793
Well, I guess you could say that she
was very carefree...

162
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:24,430
It seems that Hiromi was only fooling
around for the fun of it...

164
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,801
But, it seems that-when Megumi
decided to marry Sakihara,

166
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,303
although jokinglyashe warnedsHiromi
saying thatOif she did"it again,

168
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,639
she would make her pay for it...

169
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,217
Pops'll probably come up with some sort of
circumstantial evidence in his investigation.

171
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:49,822
But, when it comes to concrete evidence...

172
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,337
I see! Maybe!!

173
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:10,175
Inspector about what I asked you over
the phone a while ago...

175
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,945
Yeah. I confirmed with Takahashi,

176
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,783
but the only time he saw her face was
at that supermarket.

178
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,987
That's the first and last
time he ever appeared before Megumi!

180
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,390
And, how was Takahashi
dressed at that time?

182
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,494
Uh he was wearing a
jacket and sunglasses.

184
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,562
Just as I thought!

185
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,266
Mr. Mouri, what are you up to anyway?

186
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,369
Thank you very much, Inspector.
Goodbye.

188
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,438
H,Hey, Mr. Moun?!

189
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,810
Okay! So, now I've got proof!!

190
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,851
Huh? What do you mean?!
Hey, Dad?!

192
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,053
He hung up.

193
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:28,320
He hung up.

194
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,889
What's the matter, Ran?

195
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,661
Dad's in Akihabara now, and says he's
going to Megumi's house from now.

197
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:41,832
He said that he is the only one who can
persuade her...l wonder what he means?

199
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,938
Ran, let's go to Megumi's house too!

200
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:51,109
Ghadsnn."
Why'd you guys have to come too...

202
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,447
I'm sorry, but I was really concerned
over your call so...

204
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,921
Sorry to keep you waiting

205
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,957
Thank you very much.

206
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,896
And, what is it you wanted to
talk to me about?

208
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:16,534
I... I came here today to
you to turn yourself in.

210
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,472
H,Hey , Dad

211
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,683
After finding out that your husband and
your younger sister were having an affair,

213
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:38,856
as an exchange murder was being planned
between your husband and Takahashi,

215
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,193
you decided to use all this,

216
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,630
to kill your younger sister that
you haveralways hated,

218
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:48,800
and send your husband to jail
on charges of murder, isn't that right?

220
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:53,071
D...Dad! What a thing to say!

221
00:12:54,207 --> 00:13:01,480
Two months ago, you bought a wire-tap and
automatic recorder at a shop in Akihabara.

223
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,850
You asked the sales person to give you the
details on how to use the machines

225
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:11,957
These are the same modular-type wire tap
and automatic recorder that youfbought!

227
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:17,095
I didn't want to do it, but when I went
to the restroom a while ago,

229
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,965
I checked out the upstairs study.

230
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,635
You..rigged a wire-tap to your
husband's study and

232
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:27,606
bugged his conversations with Takahashi.

233
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:31,376
The remains of masking tape
being peeled off from the wall is proof.

235
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,616
You were probably planning to listen to the
conversation between

237
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,018
your husband and
your younger sister at first, weren't you?

239
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,690
But, along the way, you found out something
awesomely terrible.

241
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:50,462
That is, your husband had agreed to an
exchange murder with a complete stranger

243
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,433
and that he had already killed
the wife of that man...

245
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:58,970
The time came when it was your turn to be
killed by that man Takahashi.

247
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:03,207
You found out that he was planning to ng your
car with an explosive,

249
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,877
but was undecided because if he does
so in front of your house

251
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,947
your husband Kazuo, may turn up
as a suspect to

253
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,750
Therefore, you deliberately
tell your husband

255
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:15,220
that you are driving over to Hiromi's,

256
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,824
because her car just happens to
be at the service station for a safety check,

258
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,860
and the garage is open yyy.

259
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:26,565
Your husband, then goes out
to a pay phone

261
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,167
and tells Takahashi all that you told him

262
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,970
Although you didn't listen
to their phone conversation,

264
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,274
almost positive that Takahashi was going
to carry out his murder plan,

266
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,677
you went over to Hiromi's...

267
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,144
And; afte telling Hiromi that," ou were not
good at reversing,

269
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,913
And, after telling Hiromi that you were not
good at reversing,
Megumi's Residence

274
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,948
And, after telling Hiromi that you were not
good at reversing,

276
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,984
you made her back the car out of
the garage for you.

278
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:50,722
Just as you had expected,
your younger sister died.

280
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:58,597
But, at that time, just one thing that you
ildn't expect happened...

282
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,501
I happened to come and see you!!

283
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,436
You were surprised and...

284
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,005
wait, Mr Mount!

285
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,907
Okay!

286
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,810
You wanted her to back out right away

287
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:16,381
because you didn't want me
to see through your plan.

289
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,258
I did buy the wire-tap as you say.

290
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,428
I set it up behind the desk after suspecting

291
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,131
my husband of having an affair
with someone.

293
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,301
But, I thought it over right away
and immediately disposed of it...

295
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,937
Therefore, I didn't actually use it!

296
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,807
Did you know that the person he was having
an affair with was your younger sister?...

298
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,109
I didn't know at all.

299
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:57,989
Let's presume, this is just¥a'presumption
now, that I did act as you had deduced,

301
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,259
what 'charges am I guilty for?

302
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:08,433
Takahashi is the one who rigged
the explosive onto the car,

304
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,069
and the person who made him
Mo it, is my husband.

306
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,341
All 1 did, if anything is make my younger
sister get into a car

308
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,577
that was maybe rigged
with an explosive.

310
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:22,948
I'm not an accomplice in a crime, nor did
urge anyone to commit murder'forme.

312
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,884
Isn't that right, Mr. Moun?

313
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,924
Just as expected of a student in the law
department, and a daughter of a lawyer.

315
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,128
Just as you say...

316
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,831
If all you did was get your younger
sister to ride the car,

318
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,900
you wouldn't be found guilty of anything.

319
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,734
Why then...

320
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,735
However!

321
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:48,139
In the case that you made your
sister get in the car despite knowing that

323
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,345
an explosive was rigged to the car, or if
the possibility that you knew,was very high.

325
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,114
You will be charged with homicide!

326
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,486
You mentioned back then that.

327
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,656
You had to look for something and went
into the closet alone.

329
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:07,726
Then, you were watching the
garage from the window!!

331
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:11,663
And, just as expected, Takahashi
came into the garage

333
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,531
to set the explosive onto the car

334
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:20,238
After you confirmed all that, you asked
your sister to back the car out!!

336
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:25,043
In other words, there was a very high
possibility that the explosive was

338
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,047
being rigged to the car, and still
made your sister ride it!!

340
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,551
Do you have any proof that I was watching
the garage through the closet?

342
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,187
If you do, please show it to me right now

343
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,589
Right this minutel!

344
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,129
You've got proof, Pops.

345
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,100
Remember! The sketch)of the man that
Megumi said she saw,

347
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,969
that was drawn by police officer Honjo.

348
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:59,678
Megumi, where did you say
you saw his face?

350
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,147
A. At the supermarket near my house.

351
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:07,319
Huh? Strange. The officer mentioned
that Takahashi was

353
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,622
wearing a jacket and sunglasses
back then.

355
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:14,159
But, wh 1s the man in the sketch not
wearing sunglasses?

357
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,500
Megumi, isn't it true that you didn't even
notice Takahashi was

359
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,136
watching you at the supermarket?

360
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:30,108
You found out only after you
Iistened to the conversation between

362
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,011
Kazuo and Takahashi
that you tapped, right?

364
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,113
Then where did she see his face?

365
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,681
From the closet!!

366
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,086
She saw him from the secret
window of the closet!

368
00:18:56,035 --> 00:19:02,607
Megumi... you were watching Takahashi's
face from the closet of your parental home!

370
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:07,545
The face of Takahashi who was
setting up the explosive!

372
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,815
H...How can you be so sure?...

373
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:16,054
That day, Takahashi who didn't want
anybody to notice him,

375
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,823
was wearing sunglasses until
he entered the garage.

377
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,127
Of course, he were his sunglasses
when coming out too.

379
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:27,432
However! There was just one time
he had to take off his sunglasses!

381
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:33,104
It was when he was setting the explosive
onto the car!

383
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,845
Because nobody would even dream of
doing a dangerous job

385
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,783
Iike setting up an explosive
onto a car while wearing sunglasses.

388
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,923
In other words, this sketch of Takahashi
without his sunglasses is proof that

390
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:57,729
you witnessed Takahashi rigging the
explosive to the car in the garage!!

395
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:15,447
Just as you say,
I...happened to hear them...

397
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:20,318
E...was planning to kill me and use the
insurance money that I was covered with

399
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,687
together with the inheritance money
my parents left for me

401
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,824
to open a new boutique
that Hiromi was to own...

403
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,297
Ah. .l remember the good old days...

404
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,740
I was really... happy in those days.

405
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:48,079
I kept hoping that I could go back to those
ood old days all this time...

407
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,419
But...

408
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,055
15years ago.

409
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:02,060
There was something very important that
I was supposed to have taught you...

411
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,998
Something more important than studying...

412
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,904
But, maybe I can't really teach you much

413
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,839
since I'm separated with my wife
and all now.

415
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,975
True!

416
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,714
But, it's never too lat
Repent for the crime that

418
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,616
you have committed and
study all over again.

420
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,218
This time: the study of life!

421
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,990
Will you watch over me... then again?

422
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,626
Sure! By all means!

was solved, but...

467
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:10,855
This case must've reall come
as a shock to Pops.

472

Agh! A concert? Of course I'll go.

473
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:31,009
If for you,
I'll go and cheer for you or tutor.

475

I'll do
anything you wish! Yes!

477

I guess we've got nothing to worry about...

478
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:40,285
Really! It takes Pops no time at all to get
back on his feet.

480
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:47,291
It bothers me! I met him somewhere, but

481
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,093
can't remember where...

482
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,063

484
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,036
I don't remember buying this

485
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:02,206
The old»man who disappeared!
The man wearing sunglasses!

487
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:06,110
Something... Something smells fishy!!
