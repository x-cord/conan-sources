00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,003
What makes you think

293
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,272
we» can COUHUOH
that costume wearing freak?!

295
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,140
Time after time!

296
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:17,249
Only 28 minutes and 30 seconds
promised time...

298
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,491
Residing in Ekoda...

299
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,893
27 years old... single

300
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,028
police officer Yoichi Sensul...

301
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,031
I'm going to borrow your
name and face for a while.

303
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,034
Excuse me!

304
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,274
Kid, Kid...

305
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,178
L-Look at the number of onlookers...

306
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:46,979
Owner, how was it inside?

B-But...

326
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,222
I wonder if everything is okay
on the amusement park side...

328
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,058
I hear that since it will not make it
in time for the opening,

330
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,494
unless the construction for moving
the clock tower is started tomorrow,

332
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,229
purchase of the clock tower
may be cancelled...

334
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,264
M-Moreover,

335
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,899
if the Kid ever steals the precious stones

336
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,901
that are embedded
in the short hand of the clock,

338
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,335
and if he finds out
that the stones are...

340
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,303
Shh!

341
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,840
We're the only ones who know now

342
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,209
that I have already sold off
the diamonds

344
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,510
and switched them for fake ones...

345
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,379
B-Besides

346
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,649
the price of it has jumped high, now that
everyone knows the Thief Kid is after it

348
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,850
and there won't be
a better time to sell it...

350
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,452
Whether they find out
about the whole thing

352
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,687
after the clock tower
IS moved to its new location

354
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,988
is none of my business...

355
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,890
Besides, it would never be stolen!

356
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,793
How could he ever steal
that enormous clock tower...

358
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,428
In front of all these people...

359
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,331
no matter how great a phantom:thief .

360
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,400
He is appearing at unexpected moments
Din- "\
Ieaving no trace behind...

363
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,835
Don't you dare come here, Thief Kid!

364
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,505
Give it to him, Dad!

365
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,407
Hey! Hey, Aoko!

who remembers something
so old that happened in the past...

401

What?!

402
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,730

Thief Kid-like character while on patrol?!

Duck soup!

422
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,770
Without Hakuba around, it's so easy /
that it's no fun after all...

Here they come...Beniko.

that helicopter...

428
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,117
He emits the same transparent
vibe that Kaito emits...

430
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,819
He has the cunning of the devil,

431
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,390
and possesses a keen eye that
sees through the hearts of people...

433
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,794
Who is he?!

434
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,403

00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,255

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,856
Nab him!

460
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,492
T-This can't be happening?!

461
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,830
WW-What?! You found the Thief Kid

No, there's no,mistake about it!

467
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,608
After he answered
his name, age and birth date,

469
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:41,279
I remembered.»was told to ask for
his driver's license,number, and whalah!

471
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:43,882
His driver's license number. A

Yes, sir!

473
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,786
The boy who was sent over
by headquarters had informed me that...

475
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,589
if the thief is an expert at disguising
himself.as another, he would

477
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,727
probably remember what others
would usually not be able to recall...

479
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,362
A boy, you said?

480
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,699
I repeat!

481
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,668
Please close off the entrance and exit
of the clock 'tower immediately!

483
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,238
Please don't open them
until we instruct you to do so...

485
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:10,809
He's no more than a mole in a hole
that cannot move now...

487
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,145
D group, Nakamura and Kawada...!

488
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,948
We've lost sight of him
near the 3rd floor toilet...

490
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,286
ase calm down, I'm sure
he is still somewhere near you...

492
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,826
The ventilation hole that is
beyond that toilet...

494
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,228
Aren't the screws removed?

495
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,231
It's been removed...

496
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,901
It's been removed!

497
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,337
Then, he's in there!
Please resume pursuing him!

499
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,141
There he is!! It's him!

500

Hey ..Hey... Hey...

The inspector sure is sharp today...

502
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,882
Or, is someone helping the inspector out?

503
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,351
But, who could it be?!

504
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,654
Sgt SNNnet Fmt Net net Sug

505
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,322
So, it's you after all!

506
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,659
Just what do you think you're doing,
bringing a kid to a place like this...

508
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,728
I'm the commander of this site!

509
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,631
And, besides you don't belong
in this section!

511
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,934
Well...I'm very sorry...

512
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,604
I promised that I'd let him board
the chopper this once...

514
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,807
So, I thought I may as well bring him
ng while I was at it... Huh...?! H

516
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:20,145
Inspector! I hate to be rude, but
we've got no time to debate with you...

518
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,282
If you want to arrest the thief,
please follow my orders...

520
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,551
wW-What?ls

521
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,621
He's thrown off after being identified
before having the chance

523
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:34,326
to execute his plan...
His plan is not going as he expected...

525
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,062
There is no better chance
to capture him, but now!

527
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:38,964
W-Who are you?!

528
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,899

531
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,509
A detective...

On... know him. I know him!

534
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:08,326
A high school detective who solves
mysterious cases one after the other...

536
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,429
Then, you're also in the wrong section!

537
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,999
We're after a thief!

538
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,335
Inspector! He's just a high school student
and belongs to no section...

540
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,506
At any rate! This 1s a job
for the police to handle!

542
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,443
Outsiders just stay put in
that chopper of yours! Understand?!

544
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:26,711
Inspector Nakamori!

545

discovered the Thief Kid disguised as
a police officer inside the ventilation duct!

549
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,618
They are still pursuing him!

550
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,419
What?!

551
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,288
Nakamura of the D group here!

552
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,857
It seems that our target is trying to exit
from the ventilation duct!

554
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:40,392
W-What should we do?!

555
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,660
Don't panic...

556
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,663
Your target is already caught
in your grasp!

558
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,198
Please tell me your present location!

559
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:48,400
Well.)

560
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,870
since I was moving along in the dark,
I'm not so sure of where I am now...

562
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,438
I know that I went up one flight of stairs

563
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,906
rom the 3rd floor and
that this is the 4th floor...

565
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:56,741
No problem!

566
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,544
The exits of all the 28 ventilation tunnels

567
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,379
there are within the building have
osed off!

569
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,948
Please just keep on pursuing him...

570
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,317
There is no escape route
anymore...

572
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,453
The officers who are blocking off
the exits of the ventilation tunnels

574
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,721
Nn the 4th floor should
get ready to arrest him...

576
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:13,358
How dare he... giving out orders
n his own again...

578
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:15,827
This is Nakamura of D group!

579
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,863
I lost sight of him near the exit of the
ventilation duct!

581
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:19,931
What is your present location?!

583
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,466
Tio 15...

584
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,134
The corridor to the east on the 4th floor!

585
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,572
The target has gotten rid of
IS disguise as an officer

587
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,207
UL, RN
and is fleeing down the stairs!

589
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,442
Tn oN
Please send a support
team over right away...

592
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,776
(Iv 1%

594
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,078
T-T-Thief Kid...

595
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,714
Great work, officer!

596
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,986
Okay! He panicked
and got rid of his disguise as an officer!

598
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,623
Don't let him get away!

599
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,294
But, why does that boy
have so much information

601
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,963
as to the structure of this clock tower?

602
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:57,502
Of course! Because I sent him the data!

603
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,572
You idiot!

604
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,674
Strange...

605
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,511
For him to remove his disguise
as an officer in the space

607
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,012
that is surrounded by officers

608
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,150
is like a hermit crab disposing of its shell
and roaming within the sea...

610
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,552
o me, that ls incomprehensible...

611
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,881
I-It's time, Inspector Nakamori...

612
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:56,995
Inspector!

613
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,931
Smoke has burst forth from
the foothold at the construction site!

615
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:00,999
W-What?!

616
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,129
I-Inspector Nakamori!
The hands of the clock ..are gone?!

618
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,831
What?! They're gone?

619
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,809
Wow!! The Thief Kid 1s really something!

620
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,411
Thief Kid...

621
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,147
I hate you Thief Kid!

622
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:57,956
Is anything wrong?

623
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,024
It's swaying?

624
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,527
Yeah, you mean this chopper is swaying?

625
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,162
No. Ins ector!

626
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,302
In-Inspector, where are you headed?

627
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,838
I'm going to go up and
check the engine room of the clock!

629
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,809
Could)you please...bring the chopper
closer to the clock tower...

631
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,512
Darn! What the heck is going on anyway?

632
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,016
Anything new?!

633
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,017
N-No

634
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,586
W-What the...

635
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,422
H-Hey, what happened?!

636
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,660
A police officer appeared
from the ventilation duct and...

638
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,028
W-What?!

639
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:40,265
After spraying something strange at us...

640
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,834
H... He went out from there...

641
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,435
It can't be...

642
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,641
If, If so, he should be clearly visible

644
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,876
T-Thief Kid!

645
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,247
Thief Kid!

646
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,351
It, It's me! Nakamori! I've found the Kid!

647
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,352
It, It's me! Nakamori! I've found the Kid!

648
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:01,719
He ls...

649
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,791
Inspector Nakamori...

650
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:12,829
My apologies that I have no time now to
be playing with all of you...

652
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,599
W-What...!

653
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:21,239
Besides, it seems that you have a joker
who is pretty sharp on your side too...

655
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,839
On our side?!

656
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,543
And, if you're going to summon anybody,
I'd like you to do so after

658
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,879
you have deciphered the code
that has been carved into the...

660
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,913
middle of the face of the clock

661
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,515
Code?

662
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,319
Yes, I'd like you to decipher
before callingranyone...

664
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:42,026
T-The face of the clock is swaying?!

665
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,262
What is the meaning of this Shinichi?

666
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,964
He»is lighting up the face of the clock
together with the curtain of smoke...

668
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,567
The light is turned off, and
the face of the clock is covered with

670
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,703
a gigantic screen that has been
set up beforehand.

672
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,440
And projected on the screen
IS a film of the hand of the clock

674
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,343
The film is being projected from a
projector that has been assembled onto

676
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,344
a foothold at the construction site...

677
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,047
But, it's so easy to figure that trick out...

678
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,817
That trick...

679
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,052
Is fake!

680
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:13,324
He syprobably behind he screen
right now removing the diamonds

682
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,093
that are embedded in the
short hand of the clock...

684
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,862
I'm going to borrow this for a while.

685
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:29,474
Hey! Who is it?!

686
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:34,045
Darn

687
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,082
With the chopper at such close range...
I can't possibly fly using my hand glider...

689
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,288
What shall I do...? What now?!

691
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,989
H-Hey, Shinichi!

692
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:48,126
Don't worry! I won't hit anyone...

693
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,029
No! That's not the point. Shinichi!

694
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,868
Now: for the finale of your magic show...

695
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,070
Lets watch the leader
of the troupe appear...
