After school. on :the way home

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,285
we saw Datective 11kag
walking into"a jewelry: store

18
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,690
We followed him and went
inside the jewelry store out of curiosity

20
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,459
Surprisingly. we bumped
Io apewel tobber inside the store!

22
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,731
Detective Takagi and we chased the robber

23
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,201
But he.jumped off
the roof of a building and died!

25
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,073
Do you know him?

26
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,207
Yeas

27
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,010
The robber fell on the moving truck...

28
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,246
which was carrying.the stuff
that belonged to

30
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:30,482
Mr. Nekota. the man over there.

31
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,886
Have you met these off cers before?
Just curious.

33
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,221
o. Why would I have?

34
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,257
I've never done anything bad before!

35
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,193
Hm mm .

36
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,863
Below that office is his living space...

37
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,699
That office is four stories above
which is the 9th floor...

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,801
So this room is on the 5th floor

40
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,537
What is this?

41
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,305
It's astrange helmet. isn't it?

43
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,842
Is that for a sports bicycle?

44
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:01,046
Ah, es
I was Into triathlon when I was. young...

47
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,551
Wham ls tho bedroom...

48
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,854
I found it!

49
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,390
It's here!

50
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,093
It my deduction is correct.

51
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,161
Then, probably...

52
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,129
Then, probably...

53
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:21,099
It's wet!

54
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,086
Just as I thought, it wasn't a suicide!

55
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,672
Mr. Atomura was murdered

56
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:30,809
by Mr. Nekota.
} who disguised the murder as a suicide...

58
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,217
Taking advantage of the time lag
and the gap between the buildings

60
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:45,290
(1£ RF)
Jewel Robber Suicide (Part ll)

62
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,293
Anyhow...

63
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,996
It's a concrotd fact that Takagi bumped
into this robber in the jewelry store

65
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,464
and chased him

66
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,867
Chased him up to the roof of the building...

67
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,172
But Takaci just let him jump off
the building-and die right in front of him!

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,274
Right .

70
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,543
It seems more than
just a coincidence though.

72
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,712
He robber crashed onto a moving truck

73
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,348
which was helping
the office transfer of the company.

76
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,284
Nae? Taal - TVR, rofl SN
he uscd to work for but was hired recently

78
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,253
Yot, it seems there s no doubt
ibout that suicide.

80
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,520
Yet: it seems there's no doubt
about that suicide.

82
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,058
Then...

83
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,295
I guess that's it for;today

84
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,915
Sorry, Mr. Nekota, we need you
to come down to the station later.

86
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,201
What? Why do I need to?

87
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,903
Well, we need to ask you some questions
because you were Mr Atomura's boss...

89
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:35,941

90
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,210
whether he had) financial problems.
Ind all that.

93
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,913

For me...?

109
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,022

the scene of the suicide

114
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,876

Hm? yeah...

122
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,435
I'm wondering why you said that.

123
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,837
Well. you know... I got a schedule and...

125
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,173
We're not talking about that!

126
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,175

Was actunlly a detective.

136
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,585
That's what the question means!

137
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,828
Yeah. I mean. why not!?

138
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,429

00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,013
You didn't know about the situation,

148
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,182
and neither ever mot Takagi before.

149
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,518
It's something that
you knew that 'he was a detective...

151
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,055
That was robabl. the atmos here

Who the hell are those kids?"

thin long stick on the curtoan

00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,234
then how did I vanish,
after ljumpingroff'the building!?

270
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,936
It's impossible!

271
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,771
There's no way I could've done it!

272
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,943
Unless I have supernatural powers
LO use teleporntationyorssometthwng

274
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,612
Huhuhuh

275
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,446
you can

276
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
What?

277
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,128
0 CO RUM o 0 & ERLE)

278
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,896
Just like that!

279
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,665
C. Conan!?

280
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,601
How did you get here!?

281
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,871
I just used thi Yrope
I 'borrowed from the moving people!

283
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:43,658
Rope?

284
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,113
First of all. you measure the length

285
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,716
from the balcony of the old office
to the one in this room.

287
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,319
Next. you get a rope twice the lengths

288
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,122
and put it through the handrail of
the balcony in the old office

290
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,624
and then tie both-ends~to make a'locop!

291
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,659
After-that.

292
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,329
You connect a little loop to
the ropeiso't can-carry your body.

294
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,598
You throw the rope-with the little loop

295
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:10,001
from the balcony to the roof of
the building opposite.

297
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,569
Then all is set!

298
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,456
All you need to do is
to rob the jewe ry shop and pretend

300
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:17,676
that you are being chased up
to the roof of the building...

302
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,545
There,
you cover the rope with the long raincoat.

304
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,048
With the little loop around your waist,
and then...

306
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,750
jump off the roof

307
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:33,675
[his brings you straight down
to this balcony.

309
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,731
After which you can put Um rope away
by untying the knot)

311
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,036
I 888

312
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,305
Im actually surprised that
you are not hurt at all.

314
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,674
The impact must've been violent
when you landed on the balcony...

316
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,576
Just like the robber.

317
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,478
I was wearing a helmet.

318
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,279
Ind also... right before the impact.

319
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,148
I blew. up 1 soccer ball with
this ball=cjection belt Doc invented

321
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:57,582
DN es 0 a oll
this ballejcction. belt Doc invented

324
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:58,283
I blow up 1 soccer ball with
this ball-ejection-beltiOoc invented.

326
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,685
In order to 1absort) the impact

327
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,420
That's why I'm totally fine!

328
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,343
In Mr: :Nekota's case

329
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:10,762
he set the bed mattresses in the balcony

330
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,398
in order to absorb the impact...

331
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,987
Mattresses?

332
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,791
Yeah, they were wet
when I checked them a little while ago!

335
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,264
I seal

336
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,133
+: Because they were
exposed to the rain. right?

338
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,736
The, Mrs. Isaka saw and
heard the shadow:and noise that night...

340
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:55,874
because you were rehearsing this trick...

341
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,408
Wait a minute!

342
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,476
Therc was a dead"body
on the moving truck

344
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,046
when you guys looked down right
after the robber jumped off.

346
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:02,814
Right?

347
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,016
How would you explain thus? ma

348
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,452
He was on the moving truck
from the beginning

350
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,287
hates

351
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,755
The truck was parked
in the back of this building

353
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:14,359
in order to move things
out of the old office above.

355
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,129
That was when
you put him on the truck...

357
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,799
Probably...

358
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,768
You told Mr Atomura to help move.
Or something like that

361
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,686
Then you pushed him over
the window of our-old office.» 1

364
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,824
Yeah. I remember you said...

365
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,460
the whole 9th floor was
your old office. so

367
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,331
SO It was-possible to drop him on the truck 3
even if it'was-parked in the back.

369
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,099
Well, whatfabout the noise!?

370
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,302
Well, someone would hear the noise...

371
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,771
if.-a person falls on the truck. right

373
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,474
Because there 1s water supply- work
around here

375
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,944
and it doesn't end until .eveningieveryday...

376
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,585
It's likely that the the water supply
work shut off the noise...

378
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,688
m sure there was to the truck
when the body fell.

380
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,791
So some movers may haves
noticed something...

382
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,826
Yes.and that's why you told ovenybody

383
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,428
including the driver to
come up to the office. rights

385
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,764
Because you wanted to te I them,
which things gofirst and stuff...

387
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,333
The moving people told me that

388
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,252
they had to wait
for a while in the doorway...

390
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,606
That was probably when you pushed
Mr. Atomura over the window.

392
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,774
INA threw the rope 10 the-other building.

393
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,077
And them, you closed tho blinds!

394
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:44,082
So that nobody would see the trick
when it came in to the office!

399
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,052
to sum it uu»).

400
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,087
First of all,

401
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,656
you told the movers including
the driver to come up to the old office;

403
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,925
whichywas on the top floor of this building.

404
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,361
Then, while you kept them
waiting in the doorway...

406
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,630
You pushed Mr Atomurn
over onto the moving truck

408
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,266
which wns parked
in the back of this building.

410
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,619
Next, you threw the rope to the roof
of the opposite building.

412
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,441
And then, while the movers were moving
the stuff from the old to the new office

414
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,911
DIN (
you robbed the jewelry store!

417
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,213
Then Detective Takagi chased you

419
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,548
up to the roof of the new, office building.

420
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,919
All of these were done just
to make this incident look like

422
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,923
tho robber committod suicide
after beingschased by a detective!

425
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,190
You got that night!

427
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:26,424
You got that right!

428
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,294
Also. when he jumped off.

429
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,829
He dropped the bag with the jewelries

430
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,432
and the spare helmet which
he left on the roof beforehand.

432
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,336
AS these things hit the truck,
the peoplc would notice that

434
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,705
something fell on the truck!

435
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:46,210
That's probably:why
the helmet wasn't on Mrs/Atomura's.head!

437
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:48,746
$0 the robber smiledwhen [told-him

438
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,249
that I was from the police.

439
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,488
Because he needed someone to chase him

440
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,527
and witness the suicide on the roof...

441
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,195
Yeah...

442
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,663
If you weren't there,

443
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:09,867
he would've probably waited until ether
police officer came to the jewelry shop...

445
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,170
As a matter of fact,

446
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,972
this trick could not be done
without your luck.

448
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,056
Don't ou think?

449
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,809
Until you jumped off the building.

450
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,013
Surprisingly no neighbors or passersby
actually saw the rope or the dead body

452
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,115
Well,

454
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,986
I guess il was the sloppiness of your plan
that mando I possiblo to solve van for kids.

456
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,555
It wasn't just his luck that
people went blind!

458
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,789
What?

459
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,025
7 It was because of this-weathen!

461
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,795
Youjmean the rain!?

462
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,513
I get it!

464
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:39,147
I get it!

465
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:40,565
Nine (ve raining.

466
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,734
People put up-their umbrella
ind stay away: from balcony.

468
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,635
As long as people hold,their umbrella,

469
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,604
they won't see what's» above their head *

470
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,672
Likewise.

471
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,441
As long as. people stay away frombalcony, ~\
they won't see what's below

473
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,643
Plus.

474
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,779
The mover used the backstreet
when they moved the truck

476
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,031
and there were not
many passersby on that strect...

478
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:59,017
Under this cireumstiance

479
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,586
you would have been the unluckiest
person to make people see those things

481
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,554
That's true...

482
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,424
Yeah but still

483
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,394
it was a coincidence that
he took action on a rainy day.

485
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,628
Right?

487
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,397
It wasn'ta coincidencec!

488
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,300
You canceled moving twice and
postponed it to today.

490
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,868
Right Mr. Nekota?

491
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,106
Now. all we need is evidence...

492
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:26,110
That, I think isssomewhere
In this room or around this building

494
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,929
I'm pretty sure!

496
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,299
Because Mr. Nekota showed; up
1t the scene of thesuicide soon

498
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,718
alter the robber jumped-off...

499
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:41,225
So it must be somewhere. around here!

500
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,165
The thing I was going to buy

501
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,566
the broche...

503
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,088
Now, it's whether you hid them
or dumped them...

505
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,275
Then-hinge» wre somewhere
in the same place altogether

507
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,112
since you-didn't have enough time
to go far...

509
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,883
We'll probably find the raincoat
with that broche, as well.as the helmet.

512
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,220
with yoursfiggerprints and hair on.it...

513
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,522
Mr. Nekota...

514
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,260
Think it's time you confess

515
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,676
I don't understand...

516
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,045
Why did you have to take that broche?

517
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:36,848
Redemption...

518
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,784
Redemption?

519
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,855
My company was heavily in the red...

520
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:47,492
It was necessary tg fire those
who were close to their retirement age

522
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,262
and those who were on a decline work-wise

523
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,301
He happened to be one of those peop e...

524
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,570
Sorry ?

525
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,873
I will spill the secret if you fire me

526
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,142
The things this company has been hiding...

527
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,993
You know
about the deceptive food labeling .

529
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,445
All I'm asking is for

530
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,149
you to let me stay in this company
intil my retirement age...

532

a hfe in which I can afford a broche
Iike this for my wife's birthday...

534
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,722
Well,

535
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,525
my wife might ask me to buy her jewe ry
that is more expensive than this.

537
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:21,826
After my retirement age...

538
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,493
But for now.

539
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,530
You don't need to worry about that,
President...

541
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,082
That's why you killed him

542
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,584
Yes...

543
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,971
I thought I would be in a morass
if I let him keep blackmailing me »

545
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,674
But. wh that broche?

548
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,095
I was thinking of givving it
to his wife on her birthday.

553
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:46,634
saying it was a present that
he left withpme before his death...

it's true that he'd been working very hard
since the company was established

564
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:58,563
nd not only have I made such person
a criminal but also killed him.

566
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,400
I just wanted to run. away
from the sense of guilt.

568
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,603
So I impulsively took the broche.

571
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,301
The brocheo wast supposed to help me flce.
