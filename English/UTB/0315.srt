thanks to the telephone
call last night but,

38
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,515
Is Seizan Sensei's slump that bad?

39
00:02:13,516 --> 00:02:17,085
YesOmhe hasn't drawn
one picture these three months.

41
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,821
By'?

42
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:23,392
Of course maybe it has to do with
his.age since he's already 70,

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,528
it seems that he can't
come 'up with anything creative

46
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:30,499
and because of pressure from this
his: fingers have begun to shake.

48
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,734
That sounds troublesome.

49
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:37,239
He hasn't been eating very much
Iately and 1s emotionally unstable

51
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,510
He has sudden spurts of anger, while at
other times he goes completely-silent.

53
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:44,780
He finally: went on to attempt suicide...

A Place in the Sun

55
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:04,166
I asked you to come today in hopes that
Sensei would feel at least a bit refreshed

57
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:07,769
I'm sorry to have-called you
knowing how: busy you-are.

59
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,240
Oh no. don't be If: can be of help to
Sensei:who 1s my drinking friend,

61
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:13,375
Ir'couldn't;be-happier:

62
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:16,778
He would never turn down an
offer that comes prepared

64
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,114
with. Japanese sake and ha
hot spring. would he?

66
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:19,982
You're right!

67
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,350
Just what was that?

68
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:25,370
But. Sensei sure is a lucky man,

69
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,857
because he has a kind
hearted disciple like you.

71
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,927
I'm-what I am: thanks to Sensei.

72
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,497
Oh. it's a bush warbler!

73
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,733
They reside in this bamboo forest.

74
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:43,272
Hear them from this side.
Oh. he's,

76
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,912
Seizan Sense!

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,437
Good friends who travelfgreat distances
just to see you arefas precious as gold °

79
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,123
Thanks for stopping by on the way

80
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:06,628
When I saw the name of the station,
your face flashed through my mind. so

82
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,131
I'm glad to see that
you seem to be very well.

84
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:13,201
The older I get the more
filled with energy I am.

86
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,039
I was just sketching the
bamboos around here now too

88
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,346
He doesn't look the:least bit pressured.

89
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:25,981
Can-t.you tell?

90
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:29,618
He's putting On an act because he
doesn't want you to see his wretched self!

92
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:31,186
An act?

93
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:37,492
Did you just see that?

94
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,796
That's called the flight of a
bush warbler from valley to valley.

96
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:43,865
That's they're cry of alarm.

97
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:48,302
I'm sorry. Please forgive them
because they'll fly away in time

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,775
This bamboo forest is a
sacred place for the

101
00:04:53,776 --> 00:04:56,411
bush warbler and is not to be infiltrated

102
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:00,215
Let's leave them so as
not to intrude on them

104
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,688
Oh. welcome back. Seizan Sensei.

105
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,158
We've got guests: Please
make them something good to eat.

107
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:10,859
Yes.

108
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:12,728
Who is she?

109
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:17,566
She is:Noriko Yamamoto. who comes
herefdaily to take care of/Sensei...

111
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,334
Is that so.

112
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:21,169
Mother!

113
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,575
Look. look. I'm good. aren't I!

115

I.I'm very sorry!

118
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,881
My mother came down with a sudden

119
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,584
fever and couldn't take
care.of him so. that's why...

121
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:40,489
No excuses!
I told you never to bring your child here!

123
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,958
Yes, But; just today...

124
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,229
No! Make him go home!
Don't ever bring him before me again!

126
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,064
Mother...

127
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,067
Go home,
right this minute! Understand!

131
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:11,753
By the way, is that a new piece of work?
Fantastic mountain

133
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:14,556
This is Mt*Fujiethat I drew recently

134
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,491
because a
certain company asked me for it.

136
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,927
Mr. Kuroki, don't you draw?

137
00:06:19,928 --> 00:06:22,731
It's been a while since you've
become Sensei's disciple. isn't it?

139
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:23,899
Sort of.

140
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:28,336
I saw it some time ago.
But he's pretty good.

142
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:31,306
Unlike the Sensei's it's colorful.

143
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,508
Yes, mine are pictures in-color.

144
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,114
Come to think of it, youlknow the contest
that Sensei 'serves:asta judge for?

146
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,349
Isn't it about time it: starts?

147
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,419
You knowtivery well,
don't you?

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,521
+ The day after tomorrow is the deadline.

150
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,925
Why don't you make
an entry Mr. Kuroki?

152
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:54,196
I think you'll do pretty good,
don't you think so too, Sensei

154
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,131
I don't think so.

155
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:01,236
1. his teacher Seizan
Hayakawa will be laughed at.

157
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:04,973
Kuroki's skill is way
from being able to enter the contest.

159
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,045
But. Sense:...

160
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:12,714
Mr. Mouri, it's just as Sensei says!

161
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:16,418
I haven't gone through
enough training yet

163
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:20,655
Right; Ran,
would you please be my model?

165
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,224
As part of training for me?

166
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,764
Oh, Mr. Kuroki, one minute,
Sensei, could you draw us a picture?

168
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:30,799
Mr. Mourn!

169
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,304
When you were in Tokyo you used to
draw a lot for us to enhance gaiety.

171
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:37,772
No, I don't think so, not tonight...

172
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,344
Please don't let him.-Mr Moun!
Sensei has already drunk liquor...

174
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:45,180
He used to drink and
draw for us in the past too.

176
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:49,851
Please: Sense
Please!

178
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:05,200
No good!

179
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,944
I.I'm sorry, I got carried away
and I got kind of pushy

181
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,113
No. don't be. It's just that I've lately

182
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:20,448
gotten very weak
when it comes to drinking

184
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:25,854
Sensei! Why don't we go
fishing out at sea tomorrow!

186
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,023
Of course with Mr. Mouri and the others.

187
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:32,861
That sounds great!
Do let us accompany you, Sensei!

189
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:37,332
I haven't gone fishing in a long time...

190
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,001
I wonder if we can fish
when it's raining like this?

192
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:42,571
According to the weather forecast,
the rain is supposed to stop by sunrise

194
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:43,939
and it's said that
tomorrow will be a hot day.

196
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,210
Well, as for tonight,
I guess I'll go hit the sack already.

198
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,545
Good night. Sense.

199
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:52,279
Good night.

200
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:57,986
Dad. T at:s'rude.
You shouldn't do it!

202
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,254
Mr Mourn

203
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,657
Please take get me wrong,
Mr. Kuroki.

205
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:05,427
I want to confirm with my own
eyes whether he, as you say,

207
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:08,529
cannot draw because
his fingers are shaking

209
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,898
That's why I put on that act...

210
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,467
Il see

211
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:16,238
«a\O) Shy

214
00:09:16,872 --> 00:09:20,207
So this is your work-place.

215
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:24,212
Oh, how cute. Is this your work?

216
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,014
It's still incomplete, though.

217
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:28,516
What beautiful colors.

218
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:32,153
It's drawnubysmixingkthis
powdered paint with hide glue.

220
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:36,391
This white one is called
Paris white, right?

222
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,627
You're knowledgeable, aren't you.

223
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:41,830
It's made by crushing the shell of oysters
and making them into powder.

225
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:43,698
Oysters?

226
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,469
Huh? That picture...

227
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:00,148
It's a bush warbler.

228
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,384
G.Good morning!

229
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,553
Oh, Mrs. Yamamoto...
What's wrong? You look pale.

231
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:10,792
I haven't had much sleep having
to look after my mother...

233
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,628
I'm going to go call the doctor
and ask him to come here.

235
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,365
Mr. Mourn!

236
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,402
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

237
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:25,840
Sensei hasn't come out of his room yet,
SO please go ahead to the harbor.

239
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:28,409
I see. all right.

240
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,114
You mean Sensei isn't going to comer

241
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,418
He says he wants to stay home and relax.

242
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,587
Sensei, I'll switch over to
Mr Mouriinow.

244
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,089
Yes.

245
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,393
I'm sorry. but ll don't think I'll go today.

246
00:10:45,494 --> 00:10:49,064
Are you all righty Sensei?
Maybe you should see how things go...

248
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,399
Okay: we'll see you by sundown.

249
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,705
Yes; you can expect good catch!

250
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,808
Please let's not stimulate
him too much for now.

252
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,231
Octapus!

253
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,048
That's amazing!

254
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:08,883
Fish!

255
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:09,718
You did it!

256
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:10,552
Rubb boosts...

257
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:11,486
That's bad...

258
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:19,861
Yes, this is Kuroki,
You mean, Sensei? He left a note?

260
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:25,633
Yes. I can't draw anymore,
Thanks for everything.

262
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:28,737
Hello. please come back right away.

264
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:33,141
It seems she found it when she went
to clean up at the'usual time

267
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:38,279
Please call the police immediately
and have them search for-him.

270
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:42,417
You heard him; didn't you?
Well head back right away!

272
00:11:55,097 --> 00:11:56,998
S.Seizan Sense!

273
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,832
Is it suicide?

275
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,135
Who are you?

277
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,371
I'm a private detective
called Kogoro Mourn.

279
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,606
You mean you're theifamous!

280
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,409
I'm Ohmatsu from the local: police station.

281
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:13,348
We found a death note too.
So it's probably undoubtedly suicide...

283
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:19,120
He tied a rope to the bamboo. jumped
off from the rock and committed suicide.

285
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:23,992
The estimated time of his death is
thought to be between 11:00 to 13:00.

287
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:29,964
He tied.the.rope to the bamboo
justtwhen we were fishing.

289
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:34,669
I wonder why the bamboos
were all cut down...

291
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,237
Water wasn't accumulated so...

292
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:39,808
therbamboo was cut this 3.
Morning after the rain stopped.

294
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:43,010
So what! Go away!

295
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,452
Bush warbler?

296
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:58,393
It's too early to decide
this Is a suicide.

298
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,919
So this is Seizan Sensei's atelier

299
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:20,731
Seizan Sensei confined himself in here
and was drawing all the while after that.

301
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,205
Bamboo Diary?

302
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,841
I wonder what this is...

303
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,416
The record off the growth.of bamboos.

304
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:44,656
I see. maybe

305
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,897
Tihere are expensive drawings
here. stop scampering around!

307
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,098
Look at this!

308
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,635
This is a sketch of Ran...
What about this?

310
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,842
What?
I see...

312
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,579
Oh. I was just thinkingrtheisame thing.

313
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:12,050
Mr. Mourisl've finished most
of the questioning,

315
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,219
so I'm heading back to the station now...

316
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,123
Please wait Isnt it too soon to
decide that this is a suicide?

318
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,592
What do you mean?

319
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,863
Sensei was:.saying.yesterday.

320
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,534
This bamboo forest is a sacred place

321
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,202
for the bush warbler
and is not to be infiltrated.

323
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,207
I wonder if Sensei who loved the
bamboo forest would do such a thing

325
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,243
as pollute the bamboo forest
with his corpse?

327
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:43,548
One more-thing! Last night Sense
confinedrhimself to the

329
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,185
atelier after/dinner and was
drawing this right through

331
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:52,523
He was probably/planning to give it to
us as*a=gift at the time,we leave here.

333
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,427
If so. I wonder if he
would commit. suicide...

335
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,897
WwW. Which means!

336
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,000
Ashomicide under the
pretense of suicide!

338
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,103
Sensei-saidsthat .,"The bush warbler's
flightifrom valley to valley

340
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,672
means that«the bush warbler's are
crying] atrsound of the of alarm

342
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,844
Mrs Yamamoto, just before
we met you this morning

344
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,712
we heard the cry of the bush warbler!

345
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:19,617
And. you ran off with a pale face.

346
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,188
I'll bet you were at the
bamboo forest then?

348
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,557
N.No!

349
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:30,261
What's that?

350
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,999
Conan!

351
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:41,472
But. his estimated time of death is
between 11:00 a.m. to 13:00

353
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,443
She has an alibi during that time.

354
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,712
W. What!

355
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,514
I was at the city hospital.

356
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:55,320
I was told that I should take my mother
to a large hospital, so I took her there.

358
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,958
What's the matter. Conan?

359
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,827
Oh, Mr. Kuroki's
painting is completed!

361
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,731
Mr. Kuroki must've stayed up
Iast night and completed..it.

363
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,170
Ran. Pops says to bring-that
painting and the sketch.

366
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,771
what time?

367
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,906
Right now!

368
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:21,012
I see, you were by your
mother's side, I understand.

370
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,949
You seem to have a definite alibi...

371
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,987
Which means it's most likelyathat
Sensei committed suicide then.

373
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,923
I guess I'll be going then.

374
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,799
Officer Ohmatsu, please wait.

375
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,170
Seizan Sensei
did not commit suicide!

377
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,205
What?

378
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,174
The motive of the killer

379
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,011
WwW 10 committed this homicide and
made it look like a suicide

381
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,547
can be found in the
pictures that Ran has brought here!

383
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:04,689
Mr. Kuroki, you were planning to enter
the contest with this painting.

385
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,026
Which deadline is tomorrow, right?
But Seizan Sensei wouldn't let you.

387
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:12,096
Therefore: you decided to kill him.

388
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,533
Mi:Mr. Mouri, what a thing
to say out of the blue...

390
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,103
You invited me to come here saying
that Sensei was in a grave slump.

392
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,272
And wanted me to come to cheer
him up. but that was a lie!

394
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,809
Sensei was not in a slump nor did he
have any reason to commit suicide.

396
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:31,049
Sensei was not in a slump nor did
he have any reason to commit suicide

398
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,951
B.-But his:fingers were shaking...

399
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,987
-I "guess that's true.

400
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,323
But that painting of Mt. Fuji that
was in the guest room.

402
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,325
How do you explain that?

403
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,930
Sensei said: I just finished
drawing-in-a-few-days ago.

405
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:54,038
That's probably what you completed
using Sensei's rough draft

407
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,808
No. not only that.

408
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,544
Weren't you the one who was drawing

409
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,480
all of Sensei"s paintings
these past few years?

411
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,651
OO. Oh no!

412
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:11,589
So. having you enter the contest a
Nd going. independent was

414
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,460
totally absurd as far as
Sensei was concerned.

416
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:21,799
Last night you suddenly asked Ran to
be your model and diverted my attention.

419
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:29,774
I see! He knew that you would try to
test Sensei and ask him to draw!

421
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,345
Right. and after seeing
Sensei's condition. Mr. Kuroki,

423
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:38,049
I believed what you said that

424
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,618
It's not surprising that Sense
would commit suicide.

426
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,824
By the way: M mKuroki
early this morning

428
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,027
you carried Sensei's body to the bamboo
forest where he was found. didn't you?

430
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,899
No! You talked to Sensei
onthe phone, didn't you.

432
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,568
That's an entry level trick!

433
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:00,805
You. recorded Sensei' s voice beforehand

434
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:05,943
and set the voice that
you,edited on the answer phone

436
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:10,681
B.But like I've kept telling you
time and again. I have an alibi

438
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,784
You mean. you-were at-sea with us?

439
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,457
Ran, please show Mr. Ohmatsu
the sketchbook Conan gave you.

441
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,691
41TH!
Here you go

444
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,730
Bamboos grow way faster
than we imagine them too.

447
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,832
Very true.

449
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,203
Please show us how much they
have grown in a period of 3 days.

451
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,605
About 2 meters.

452
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,444
Bamboos grow greatly at once. when
Iike this morning$there is rain,

454
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,548
then it clears and the temperature rises.

455
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:48,452
Mr. Kuroki, you took advantage
of this and killed Sensei!

457
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,856
This morning you carried Sense!

458
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,358
Who you put to sleep with sleeping
pills to the bamboo forest

460
00:19:57,145 --> 00:20:01,365
You made Sensei sit in front of a bamboo

461
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,768
ou chose and put a
rope around his neck.

463
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,671
Then cut the bamboo
that was around Sensei

465
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,479
You made sure that a lot
of sun would shine

467
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,916
on the bamboo that you
tied the rope onto

469
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:23,120
The cry of the bush warblers flying from
valley to valley we heard this morning.

471
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,556
Was the cry of warning aimed
at you. Mr. Kuroki.

473
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,927
The bamboo that was showered
with a lot of sunshine grew rapidly

475
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,698
and eventually suspended Sensei in air.

476
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:41,172
This is how Sensei died while we were
our fishing with you Mr. Kuroki

478
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,343
The white sawdust on your
tabi is the evidence!

480
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:54,085
T.This is Paris white,
Just-what kind of evidence isithis?

482
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,154
No. that's not Paris White

483
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:04,161
Please take a<good look.
That's sawdust that fell on

485
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,930
when you cut the bamboo with the saw!

488
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,339
I'm sorry. it's just as 'yoursay

490
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:22,847
I've been drawing on behalf of
Senseifsince a few: years ago

492
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,952
But I wanted to at least once

493
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,637
and sign my name on
givéhap pail ind HathkaSensehe.sun

495
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:32,890
and sgn Mm ; name on
them instead of the Sensei"s.

497
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,161
I wanted somebody to look at them

Really? Let me see. let me see!

550
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,270
What's that supposed to be?

551
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,941
You fool!
Don't you know of realism?

553

Don't compare me with a brat like him!

00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,037
I'm just telling you the truth.

00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,033
