1
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:03,769
Even destiny serves
as.a:clue to.deduction

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,538
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:07,807
Conan; Kogoro-and Officer Yamamura

6
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,575
The briefcase is the link
over time and space.

8
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:11,444
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,279
A child in appearance
with the ll.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,514
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,150
To answer a client's call to solve
the mystery of the briefcase,

15
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,755
we headed to the inn Aoiya Ryokan
with Detective Yamamura.

17
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,727
A man wearing a red jacket was
found dead in the Toshin Forest.

19
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,262
Strangely, the man was wearing
a sweater in the middle of summer.

21
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,164
Car keys and cigarettes
were found on him,

23
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,201
but without
his driver's license or matches.

25
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:21,073
The briefcase in question was entrusted
to the innkeeper five years ago

27
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,808
by a long-haired man
wearing a red jacket.

29
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:30,016
The man who is posing to be Kogoro
finally came to get it...

31
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:37,223
The case contained five-year-old sports
newspaper and a bundle of long hair!

33
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,630
Kogoro impersonator" Part II

34
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,132
Nn... you mean... this

35
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,335
Yes It must be murder!!

36
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:54,173
And the culprit knew where
the "CLOSED FOR CLEANING" sign is...

38
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:58,744
The culprit is among the employees...

39
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:02,214
From left, "Eiji Urakawa," "Yoshiro Onda"
and "Masao Jimbo."

41
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,116
The culprit is probably...

42
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,586
a person with ties to the long-haired man
who committed suicide four years ago!

44
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:12,491
And probably the long-haired man
didn't commit suicide at all...

46
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,362
Someone must have tampered with
the body for some special purpose...!

48
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,964
But who? And why...?

49
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:23,803
Mr. Yamamura!

50
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,704
I found a cell phone.

51
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:26,405
Huh?

52
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,674
It was in the jacket of the victim.

53
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,012
I found one phone number
in its memory bank.

55
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,346
Would you like to try?

56
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,981
Yes, yes... Of course!

57
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,727
Tatsuo! Is that your.

58
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,930
What happened to that
gold mine of yours?

60
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,698
Let me know when you
get your hands on it!

62
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,066
Oh, yes,

63
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,702
I got a call from your landlord

64
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,405
He says he won't extend the contract
and he'll have to evict you

66
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,739
if you don't pay the rent.

67
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:03,642
Hey, are you listening to me?

68
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,510
Uh...

69
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,345
Oh, got a customer!

70
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,646
Call me back later!

71
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,316
He hung up.

72
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,752
He mentioned something
about a gold mine...

74
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,957
And he said that the contract can't be
extended unless the rent is paid...

76
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,290
Extend!?

77
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:20,893
Anyway,

78
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,096
we found that the name of the victim
is" Tratsuo Morn.

80
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,564
It's one step forward in solving the case

81
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,031
Huh?

82
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:28,534
How did you know
his last name is "Morn"?

84
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,902
We only heard his first name is
Tatsuoffiover the phone

86
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:30,936
Look!

87
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,571
The phone has aname label on it!

88
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,173
Phooey!

89
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,277
Using a name label like a little kid...
How immature!

91
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,446
Sorry for being immature!

92
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,047
II have one on mine, too!

93
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:42,615
What!?

94
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,284
You're okay 'cause you're still a kid!

95
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,052
What!?

96
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,254
Wait.

97
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,955
That means the murderer is...

98
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,757
Uh... Officer...

99
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,961
Can you give me more details about
what the long haired man had on him?

101
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:56,929
Huh?

102
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,564
You already asked that before.

103
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,501
That he had receipt for milk and bun
he bought 4 years ago!

105
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,203
Well... see...

106
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,572
Then, would you like to see the photos?

107
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,573
Photos?

108
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:11,143
I came to the inn today
to ask about these photos.

110
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,713
This is the front and back of the
crushed milk package...

112
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,185
The crushed bun and cigarettes

113
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,555
The convenience:store; eceipt
found in his wallet...

115
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,724
The July 10 date of the receipt...

116
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,427
it is the date of the tour
the employees went, right?

118
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,828
Uh... yes.

119
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,265
Yes! That was it!!

120
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,100
Now I see it!

121
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,168
What the culprit wanted!

122
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,071
Hey, Officer...

123
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:39,972
What?

124
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,809
Did you, by any chance, find a dead body
in the Kashiragami Forest

126
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,512
after the employee trip of this
in four years ago?

128
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,381
Yes, we found one,

129
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,183
near the fallen Jizo statue

130
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,253
Was the person who found it...
By any chance...

132
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:57,590
Why... why did you know that?!

133
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,192
I knew it.

134
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,826
He must be the one!

135
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,933
And, the sports newspapers there is
the map where something is hidden.

137
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,201
What I need now is proof...

138
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,037
If I'm right,

139
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,406
There must be some here...

140
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,542
On that shogi board and...

141
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:17,843
And the table...

142
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,478
Traces of the culprit...

143
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,620
Yes!

144
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,687
I found it!

145
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,521
Hey. kid!

146
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,123
You're not allowed to go in there!

147
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,493
I've been asked by Uncle Kogorou!

148
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,463
I was told to look at the table and
the board very closely...

150
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,332
Detective: Mouri told: your.

151
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,302
Yes, and...

152
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,338
I was also told to take a close look
at the light in this room.

154
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,338
The light?

155
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,277
He says it is the key
in running down the culprit!

157
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,316
Anyway, the estimated time of death

158
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:01,620
is between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. today!

159
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,189
That time, the culprit placed the
CLOSED FOR CLEANING sign

161
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,192
and collected long hairs in the bathroom.

162
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,894
He took it to the room...

163
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,730
And tried to divert our attention
by making...

165
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,666
it look like a curse of
the long-haired man!

167
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:21,640
If only the employees of the inn
know where the sign is,

169
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,575
we have just about found the culprit!

170
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,146
I want all of the employees here now!

171
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,015
We want to interview each one
about the early evening hours today...

173
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,718
Wait, officer.

174
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:36,021
Can't employees be excluded

175
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:41,160
who have never seen:or heard about
the man who died 4 years ago?

177
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:41,994
What?

178
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:49,201
Weren't you all here when the man
deposited the case five years ago?

180
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,336
Well...

181
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:53,939
I received the case
from the man in his room...

183
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,543
He was hired four years ago in spring...

184
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,212
And I just told the employees-that

185
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:05,651
I have asked Detective Mouri to come to
check the case left with me 5 years ago...

187
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,088
I never mentioned it came from
the long-haired man...

189
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,422
I see.

190
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:16,161
So, the relationship between
the case and the long-haired man...

192
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,897
was not known by others... Master!

193
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,301
Hey... not me I didn't kill...

194
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,704
If I am the one,
I won't keep it for five years.

196
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,239
I would have pried it open.

197
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:30,075
And isn't it puzzling?

198
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:34,713
Such an important case contained
only old:newspaper...

200
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:39,051
The culprit probably took away
something wrapped in newspaper and...

202
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,887
has already gone far away from here...

203
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,426
Unless this newspaper has some
special meaning...

205
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,161
You're right.

206
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,028
Hey!

207
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,765
What does "Front- 3 mean?

208
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,665
Huh?

209
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,567
See that?

210
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:59,605
I see "Front-5" written before the name
of the tournament champion Akagimaru.

212
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:06,245
That means he ranked No. 5 among
the "East - Maegashira" wrestlers.

214
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,980
What's "Maegashira"?

215
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,383
Doesdit have to do with
Kashiragami Forest?

217
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,652
What relation, dummy!

218
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,754
How about with the fallen Jizo statue?

219
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,890
Absolutely not!

220
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,825
Maegashiratvis...

221
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,629
A sumo wrestler ranking behind the
grand champion Yokozuna,

223
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,331
champion Ozeki, and the sekiwake
and komusubi ranks...

225
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,436
No. 5 means he ranks No. 5 among
the Maegashira wrestlers.

227
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,571
Okay...

228
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,641
Then, Akagimaru must have won
the tournament

230
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,243
when he wasn't especially strong
because he was very cautious!

232
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,212
Cautious?

233
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,147
Because. look!

234
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,783
Akagimaru fell in the hole only once!

235
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,819
Huh?

236
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,889
This means that the sumo wrestler
fell in a hole, right?

238
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,860
It says "push-down" below
that black circle...

240
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,764
That's not a hole!
It's a symbol for loss!

242
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,167
It means that he lost the match
on the 8th day of the tournament!

244
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:06,572
So, it doesn't mean he took
eight steps and fell in a hole!

246
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:11,276
Anyway, I want you to call
all the employees for questioning.

248
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,346
Of course, we won't make any exceptions!

249
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,952
So, you don't have anyone In particular

250
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,654
who can corroborate
what you were doing during those hours.

253
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:24,590
11<o .

254
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,757
Okay.

255
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,292
Next, please.

256
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,594
Excuse me.

257
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,762
Will it be long?

258
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,233
I want to start cleaning up.

259
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,768
I have to prepare for breakfast
tomorrow morning.

261
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,871
Can't I leave early?

262
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:42,007
0... That's not possible

263
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,944
So, I've questioned every oneiof'them=s. 8

264
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:52,284
Most of you don't have alibi as to
your whereabouts between 4 and Sp m

266
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,219
Of course!

267
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,989
My employees work without interruption.

268
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,360
I don't have in my employ anybody
monitoring and clocking others at work!

270
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:03,729
I'm impressed...

271
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,130
Officer Yamamura!

274
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,468
Did you see Conan and my father
somewhere?

276
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,635
No...

277
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,440
Yes, Yamamura speaking.

278
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,210
What! Mr. Mourn...

279
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:22,114
Yes... yes... All right.

280
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,651
Excuse me... my father...?

281
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,351
Well...um...

282
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,757
He went to ask neighbors
around the area

284
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,926
and was taken under police custody
for suspicious behavior.

286
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,594
He's at a police station.

287
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,562
What!!

288
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,464
Looks like Conan is with him.

289
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,201
Anyway, I will go to
pick him up at the station.

291
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,337
So, stay here and wait in this room!

292
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,339
Okay...

293
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,908
Um... How about us?

294
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,946
Uh... You can all go to sleep now...

295
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,883
We will hold a more thorough
Investigation on a later date!

297
00:11:59,118 --> 00:11:59,885
Bye!!

298
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:11,823
Rocks...

299
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,492
It can't be...

300
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,529
What?

301
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,634
I guess you've been looking for this,
Mr. Jimbo...

303
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,903
or should I say...

304
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:29,975
the man behind the 100 million yen
blackmail case!

306
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,376
What!?

307
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:36,648
I found as soon as we checked through
the serial numbers of the bills.

309
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,088
The money was extorted from a candy
manufacturer by two men five yearss ago.

311
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:48,260
One of them being you, and the other...

312
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:53,298
The long-haired man who had
the briefcase kept by the innkeeper.

314
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:58,270
And the sports paper pointed
to the location of the money.

316
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:03,207
Akagimaru who made the headlines
was East Maegashira No. 5!

318
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,079
Maegashira, literally meaning front head,
was the key suggesting

320
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,848
the fallen statue in the forest.

321
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,820
Walk east five steps from the statue...

322
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:21,460
You take 8 steps from there according to
Akagimaru's win/loss record.

324
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:27,299
If you dig the spot there, you're
expected to find a pot filled with money!!

326
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,901
Right? Mr. Moun?

328
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:35,540
The long-haired man put
the newspaper inside the case...

330
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:40,545
and gave it to the innkeeper for storage.
He did it because he was aware...

332
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:46,251
That you might kill him to get
the entire fortune.

334
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:50,622
Well, it was quite natural for him
to notice that.

336
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,793
He probably was responsible for
carrying the money.

338
00:14:54,794 --> 00:15:01,333
And he was told meet in this forest,
a well known suicide spot...

340
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:06,805
This is corroborated by the fact that
he included a memo in the briefcase.

342
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:13,011
A message damning him if he should Kill
and come to take the money alone.

344
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,614
Sure enough,

345
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:19,618
you killed him in this forest,
making it look like suicide...

347
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:22,320
and appeared in the inn
with confidence...

349
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,724
Hiding your face with a hat,
glasses andrbeard...

351
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:30,529
However, what you got was
a memo cursing you to death...

353
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:38,003
You couldn't give up and decided to
Investigate by working for the inn.

355
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,941
Time passed, and the body of
the long-haired man was found.

357
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:48,246
This led to your discovery that
the innkeeper kept the case for 5 years

359
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,049
and has requested me
to conduct an investigation.

361
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,988
You hired the man to pose as me
and get the case before I do.

363
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,858
You intended to get what was inside,

364
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,263
but found it contained only
old sports newspaper...

366
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:10,068
The man who expected to get his share
of the money right there got angry.

368
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,905
Threatening you to tell the real Kogorou
Mouri to arrive later everything

370
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,341
if he doesn't get his money.

371
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:23,181
You had no choice but to kill him and
Ieft the mystery for me to solve.

373
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,954
The best proof is the fact that you have
come here to find the money.

375
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,889
Let's go to the police station.

376
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,392
What are you talking about?

377
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,829
I was just inspired by the newspaper
and came here.

379
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,266
I thought that I may be able to help
the investigation if I find something.

381
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,635
Get off it...

382
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,374
In fact, the long-haired man died
four years ago on July 10.

384
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,010
At that time, I was on the empoyee's trip.

385
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,715
No! He was not killed four years ago.

386
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,751
That was in fall five years ago!

387
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:03,054
Immediately after he deposited
the briefcase at the inn!

389
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:09,794
You planted the milk, cigarettes, bun and
the convenience store receipt later!!

391
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,431
You did it to mislead us
regarding time of death

393
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,500
and to make sure you have an alibi!

394
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:22,073
The milk package and receipt came
from another suicide case you found

396
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,175
after the employee trip 4 years ago!

397
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,979
That is why the long-haired man was
wearing a sweather

399
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,749
and had cigarettes
but not lighter or matches!

401
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,818
You removed
the driver's license from him

403
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,620
because the license was soon to expire.

404
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:41,660
Your alibi will not work if the body had
driver's license that expired a year earlier.

406
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:46,932
You placed the bundle of hair
In the newspaper because...

408
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,134
you wanted to direct
police attention to the fact

410
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,637
that the person who killed the impostor is
Iinked to the long-haired man,

412
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,374
and make the police think you're not
a suspect because of the receipt.

414
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,877
We know everything you planned!

415
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:04,382
Then, how do you know that the milk
package and receipt were placed later?

417
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,183
Huh?

418
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:10,322
The man may have actually had them
with him, right?

420
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,824
Well, that's

421
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,926
The straw!

422
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,296
The milk package did not have
a straw attached to it.

424
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:23,768
That is proof that milk was refilled
In the package,

426
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,539
the lid sealed with glue again
and placed beside the body.

428
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:33,778
No one puts an opened package of milk
inside a knapsack.

430
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,448
Y-yes, yes... That's right!

431
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,517
Then, did you see it?

432
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,854
Did you see me kill the long-haired man?

433
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,823
Certainly,

434
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:49,894
it happened too long ago to determine
whether you committed that murder...

436
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:54,733
However, we have proof that you killed
the man who posed as me!

438
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,467
What?!

439
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:59,270
To carry a body and hang it
from a high place,

441
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,508
the person carrying it
must reach as high as the ceiling.

443
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:08,980
What the killer used to reach that high
was the shogi board and the desk.

445
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,584
Of course, he had to take off his socks
in order not to ship.

447
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,653
I heard from the forensics people.

448
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,490
There are footprints found on them.

449
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,927
What will happen if we checked
the prints against yours?

451
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,266
I did use them as a stool!

452
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,368
When I changed the light bulbs
in the room.

454
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,874
If you check the light bulb,
my fingerprints should be there...

456
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,111
Yes, surprisingly,
we found your fingerprints!

458
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,281
Under a thick layer of dust!

459
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:48,086
They probably were there for
a long period of time!

461
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:55,627
Still, your footprints were there,
suggesting that you were the killer!

463
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:59,364
I've never heard of an inn
that does not wipe desks

465
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:03,268
until a thick layer of dust
collects on the light bulb!

467
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,502
Mr. Jimbo,

468
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,938
Iet us all stop this...

469
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,940
Let's not tamper with time...

470
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,144
Why?

471
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,979
Why did you know it was me...?

472
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,682
You told us.

473
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:23,088
In the lobby, when you delivered
my daughter's cell phone.

475
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:29,027
That time, you gave it to me
without hesitation although

477
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,429
Officer Yamamura was there,
someone you had never met before.

479
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,299
You told me, " Is this your daughter's?

480
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,835
What about that?

481
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:41,706
I saw the name seal that said RAN
MOURI pasted on the cell phone...

483
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:44,342
Yes, that's right.

484
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,012
You knew me the moment you saw me.

485
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,783
That I am the real Kogorou Mouri.

I can only recall up
Conan tried to drag me into the forest.

534
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:45,797
I was astounded when you phoned me
instructions to go to the forest

536
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,466
for a sleuth performance!

537
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,267
Dad,

538
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:54,038
why did the people at the inn call me
Miss Echigo?

540
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:56,374
Never mind.

541
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:57,675
Huh?

Oh! You don't need to do that...

552
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,332
What a coincidence!

553
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,203
We were just on our way back there!

554
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,504

It was impossible. for people at the party
to shoot when the shot was heard...
