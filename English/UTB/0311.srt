While we were there,

00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,061
we get a call from Vodka...

00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,566
Yoh, what's up?

00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,202
You're there, aren't you?

00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,638
I know you're there at the villa!!

Hey!!

00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,781
Oh, sorry...

61
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,584
It's so dark in here that I was having
trouble picking up the phone...

63
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,219
Hey. hey, hey?!

65
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,322
I pretended to be Mr. Itakura

66
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,924
and talked Vodka into

67
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,259
making me promise
to meet him at the coin locker

00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,562
Iocated in the basement of the
Kenbashi Subway Station at 4 o'clock.

71
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,299
All right, he fell for it!

72
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,204
But on our way there.

73
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,339
Doc's car went flat on'a mountain path

74
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,878
So. we got a car that
was passing through to give us a lift,

76
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:02,497
and was somehow able to
make it to Tokyo,

78
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:03,248
but...

79
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,170
Strange...

80
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:11,156
There's something fishy about them...

81
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,592
Don't tell me that...

82
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,228
Don't tell me that...

83
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:17,729

We're almost there, you guys...

90
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,212
Your destination. Kenbashi Station...

91
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,498
But, isn't that place still
under construction?

93
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,584
The train won't come
even if you go there you know...

95
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,620
We live near the station...

96
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,223
Oh- how convenient

97
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,340
Ha. ha, ha...

98
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,558
I guess so...

99
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,795
Hey. Shinichi, are you really going to go?

100
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:51,496
Yeah...

101
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:56,752
I've come up with something
I gotta do before that though...

103
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,670
Hey!

104
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:04,776
I don't know what you're up to, but
will you cut out talking secret in my car...

106
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,246
Oh. I'm so sorry...

107
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,982
Hey! I told you not to smoke!

108
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,584
Oh, that's right...
Sorry, sorry,

110
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,770
I'll throw it away right away

111
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:18,323
Hey!
Don't throw litter out of the window!

113
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,993
Throw it away in the ashtray...

114
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:28,165
Hey. hey, you got loose change mixed
with cigarette butts and ash!

116
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,104
No matter how rich you are, you'll be
punished for doing something like this...

118
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,006
I guess it can't be helped...

119
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,375
Because these two people...

120
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,443
are robbers...

121
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,114
WwW. What?!

122
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,124
Just what do you mean. Shinichi?

123
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:55,877
This car is probably...not his

124
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,432
They probably abandoned the car they
made their getaway with in the mountains

126
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,151
and stole this car from somebody who
happen to pass by...

128
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,004
The legal owner of this car
probably doesn't smoke,

130
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,808
so the owner was probably using the
ashtray as a place to put his loose change

132
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,744
so he could pay highway
tolls with ease...

134
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,615
He put his cigarette butt inside
the ashtray without realizing this,

136
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,500
so even after he did

137
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,453
he probably kept using it as an ashtray...

138
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,254
Gulp

139
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,756
Until they gave us a lift, that is...

140
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,992
N, No way, sonny...

141
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,063
I put the coins in there to spite him
because I hate smokers...

143
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:35,901
There's still other evidence that
this car is not his...

145
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,104
You drove from where you could judge
your position from the driver's seat

147
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,674
because you're not used to driving cars
with steering wheels on the left, right?

149
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,044
That's why you were driving
near the center line

151
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,713
and got honked at time and again...

152
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,549
When you backed the car up

153
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,752
you looked to the left where
Iooking behind was more difficult.

155
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,855
And that's probably the same reason

156
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,224
why you were having trouble shifting
gears with your right hand...

158
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,393
Moreover. when turning the curve

159
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,862
you turned on the wipers
instead of the blinker, right?

161
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,201
You forgot that foreign cars
with the steering wheel on the left,

163
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,504
have blinkers and wipers on the
opposite side as that of Japanese cars

165
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,807
There's still more...

166
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,643
When we first got into this car...

167
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,881
If you opened the left door,
I could've got in right away, but,

169
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,018
I was wondering why you let me in
from the door on the side of the road

171
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,454
But, I figured out why
at the checkpoint after

173
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,023
what Officer Yamamura said...

174
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,793
that the seat that you're
sitting on right now

176
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,611
IS stained with the
blood of the other robber,

178
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:43,185
the man whowas shot in the leg
and sitting there till a while ago

180
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,204
And that other man is

181
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,006
probably in the trunk...

182
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,711
He's probably hiding there
SO you could get through the checkpoint...

184
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,198
T.Then why did they give us a lift...7?

185
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,151
Of course if they were
just some ordinary car thieves,

187
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:01,386
they wouldn't have done so

188
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,457
But, they did so to help them
get through the checkpoint

190
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,677
They can throw the police off guard into
thinking that it's a family trip or something

192
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:12,264
if a boy and an old man
are with them, right?

194
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,802
That's how I figured out who they were

195
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,140
The only people who would give us a lift
despite stealing somebody else's car...

197
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,678
had to be the jewelry shop
robbers on the run

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,661
Oh~ You're pretty smart,
sonny, aren't you...

201
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,397
I'm not all that sure if being

202
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,132
too smart at your age

203
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,634
Is all that great...

204
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,637
SS. Shinichi...

205
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:58,777
Well! Now that you know,
we've got no choice...

207
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,747
We're going to need you to stick around
with us a while longer then...

209
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,541
So...

210
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,127
The problem now is, where
we get rid of this old man and kid...

212
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,963
Uh-huh

213
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,999
How about Kenbashi Station
that's under construction that

215
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,235
they wanted to go to?

216
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,770
There's nobody there and besides.

217
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,624
The construction workers won't be
coming uni a er ay rea...

219
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:31,576
By the way. sonny,

220
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:35,947
why didn't you tell the police
about us at the checkpoint?

222
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,383
You already knew by then, didn't you,

223
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,019
that we were the jewelry shop robbers...?

224
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,972
I didn't want to lose time...

225
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,093
If I turned you into the police at that time.

226
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,696
We would have to go through questioning
too because we were riding the same car

228
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,266
Then, I would be late
for my important appointment...

230
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,835
Besides, we could catch
you anytime anyway...

233
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,288
You sound pretty confident,
don't you, sonny...

235
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,123
I like people like you...

236
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,845
Talk as cheeky as you
Iike while you can...

238
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,047
Even if you cry "Help!"
I'm not going to forgive you

240
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,533
Don't you forget that...

242
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,622
H. Hey?!

243
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:20,859
He won't be getting up for a while
because I fired an anesthetic needle into him...

245
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,394
A. Anesthetic needle?!

246
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,462
Hang on!!

247
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,079
You brat. what a thing to do!

248
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,714
Cut it out...

249
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,816
You may have been able to deceive
the jewelry shop

251
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,418
with a dingy model gun like that,

252
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,286
but you can't fool me...

253
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,821
What the...

254
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,623
Who are you, anyway?!

255
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,159
Conan Edogawa...

256
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,694
a detective...

257
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,596
Detective...?

258
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,464
Oh, right,

259
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:00,999
be careful over there

260
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:01,666
Huh

261
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,668
It's a ball firing belt

262
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,937
Gas is inside a special rubber

263
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,572
and it turns into a soccer ball!

264
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,275
But this rubber is very elastic...

265
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,411
When you move the dial to maximum
H.Hey...

267
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,081
it inflates a large as an ad balloon...

268
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,755
I'll be on my way then

269
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,824
So. call the police. will you, Doc

270
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,860
And tell them that
we caught the jewelry shop robbers!

272
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,764
Hey, hey, are you really going
to the place of the deal?

274
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,399
Don't worry!

275
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,502
Since this is one station away
from Kenbashi Station,

277
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:41,673
even if the police were to come,
they won't call off the deal...

279
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,944
No. that's not what I'm worried about...

280
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,112
See you, then!

281
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,016
If something comes up
I'll contact you with the detective badge.

283
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,185
SO don't come near
Kenbash Station till then!!

285
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,888
H.Hey. Shinichi?!

286
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,128
It's almost time...

287
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,564
Are all the men in position?

288
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,302
Okay, don't let one mouse get through!

289
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,156
Hey. Itakura...

290
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,495
Tsk...ltakura,

291
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,930
that rat's not here yet...

292
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,310
Whew

293
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,446
Hmm?

296
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,717
A- check...?

297
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,258
This is the same amount
we paid ltakura...

299
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,432
This is the system software that
we asked ltakura to make.

301
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,601
What an idiot...

302
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,603
He gives back the money we paid him,

303
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,239
and went chicken leaving
just the stuff behind...

305
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,907
Spit!

306
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,310
Okay. I got him!!

307
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,079
Yeah, it's me...

308
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,783
That Itakura should be
somewhere nearby...

310
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,885
Go get him and bring him here!

311
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:43,922
What?

312
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,808
The only ones who entered the station
are a drunkard and a kid?!

314
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,094
It can't be! Look for him!!

315
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,701
Just what are you up to...?

316
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,837
B...Boss...

317
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,038
Gin!!

318
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,541
The deal's supposed to
be midnight tomorrow...

320
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,846
He complained that
tomorrow wasn't good for him,

322
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,547
so the time was changed...

324
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,221
So. you exchanged e-mails with him and
he used you to his advantage...

326
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,624
I'm the one who set the time...

327
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,194
He received the e-mail at his villa

328
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,997
and said that there was a black-out

329
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,899
so I talked to him directly on the phone...

330
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,938
I.1 couldn't get rid of him but

331
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,674
got a hold of what we were after...

332
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,310
and besides. he's got a
pretty badaheart?...

334
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,945
Heh. heh. heh...

335
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,882
He'll croak over soon either way...

336
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,649
Hey...

337
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,785
why do you think this was
stuck on with tape?

339
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,720
Huh 2!

340
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,090
To get your fingerprints...

341
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,827
You can't take off the tape
with gloves on, you see...

343
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:56,794
Huh

344
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,265
And...

345
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,967
if the one you're waiting
for doesn't show up,

347
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,170
you get irritated and light cigarettes...

348
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,409
If the saliva on this is checked,

349
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,646
they'd even be able to find
ut your blood type...

351
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,016
B.Boss...

352
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,218
Oo...

353
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,688
he's even trying to track down
the location of the base of our operations

355
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,889
Look...

356
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,275
There's a communicator on the inside
of the CD case...

358
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:30,228
He sure is some sly fox...

359
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,864
T, That Itakura...

360
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,100
No. it's not Itakura...

361
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,205
In a place where there is a
drastic difference in temperature,

363
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,808
the sympathetic nerves are stimulated
and a great load is placed on the heart...

365
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,945
I don't think a guy
with heart problems will go out

367
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,914
of he way to a villa
in the mountains in the blizzard...

369
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,582
Then...Then,

370
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,485
who was the guy that
I talked to on the phone...

372
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,790
Probably some wiz that
he hired or something...but

374
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,859
he made one mistake...

375
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:02,694
Huh

376
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,662
This case...

377
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:09,017
The fingerprints seem to have
been wiped off, but it's still warm...

379
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,235
» hich means...

380
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,370
Yeah...

381
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:16,140
he should still be
hiding somewhere nearby...

383
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,478
R.Rats...

384
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,701
If things keep up as is, they'll find me...
What now?

386
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,536
What can I do?!

387
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,211
Heh. heh...

388
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,013
The only place left is there...

389
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:59,150
A sly fox is no more
than agcornered rat now...

391
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,353
Cut out your blabbering...

392
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,451
Oh. boss...

393
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,454
There's nobody here...

394
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,857
So. what now?

395
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,469
H, boss...

396
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,175
Oh, boss?

397
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:11,589
There's no way a grown adult
could hide in a place like this...

399
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,126
evermind...

400
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,595
we'll change our appearance
and get out of here

402
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,931
He may have called the police...

403
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,232
Huh

404
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,735
You mean the guy who ltakura hired?

405
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,337
Yeah...

406
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,307
Be careful, there's no next chance...

407
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,945
It seems that some rat is
snooping around us...

409
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,850
A fox detective...

410
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,187
What now?

411
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,722
Should I go after them!

412
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,424
No, it's too early yet

413
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,260
They may be lying in wait
after pretending to leave...

415
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,562
But what is it...?

416
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,132
What are those guys
trying to do anyway...?

418
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,003
Ail said that they made her
make queer drugs.

420
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,372
But Mr. Itakura is a system engineer...

421
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,041
He has nothing to do with drugs...

422
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,880
A software that he abandoned making
for the sake of mankind...

424
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,565
What on earth...

425
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,053
what on earth...is it about...

426
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,968
Well~good work Dr. Agasa!

427
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,469
Huh?

428
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,104
Yes. well, I guess...

429
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,906
I'm sure you're tired,

430
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,409
but I'm going to have to ask you to come
to the station with me for questioning!

432
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:39,010
Oh...

433
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,444
Inspector! Excuse me...

434
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,014
Oh...
I'll see you later, then...

436
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,714
What is it, Officer Chiba...?

437
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:48,118
About the wound of the suspect...

438
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,192
Shinichi...what's up...

439
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,495
Shinichi...

495

Just™ at are you doing

497
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,219
WwW. What. well...
And. what are you doing here yourself?

499
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,589
Both Doctor and you didn't come back
even after morning came,

501
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,893
so I used your spare pursuit glasses
and came Iookin- for both of ou!

503
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,461
It.It's morning?!

504
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,065
Little lady. did you find your friend?

505
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,232
Yes...

506
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,636
Okay then: you're getting in the
way of work so out you go

508
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:19,537
Ac h!

510
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,957
Hey. wait Shinichi?!

511
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,322
I see...

512
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:41,459
I fainted in there because
ff lack of oxygen...

514
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:42,560
And?

515
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,197
Just what are you doing
in a place like this

517
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:51,502
O.,Oh...1 didn't get to sleep.
So I was sort of taking a snooze...

519
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,806
Do you think that's
answering my question?

521
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,376
Oh. well, what's the difference?

522
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,845
Let's hurry home and get some grub

523
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,346
I'm starved

525
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:02,646
I'm starved...

526
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,447
Hey!

527
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,583
Wheres Doc?!

528
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:09,019
Doc's fine! He's at the police. station!

529
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,521
Now for the next news

530
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:15,576
Yesterday at about 5 p.m: the body of
a man was found at Hotel New-Beika...

532
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,262
The body was identified to
as that of computer graphic designer,

534
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,264
Mr. Taku Itakura, age 45...

535
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,034
Don't tell me...

536
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:26,504
Huh

537
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,942
Hey. what's up?

538
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:32,910
Huh

539
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,680
