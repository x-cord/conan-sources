Deduction flows with the
rhythm of the wind

Dark stains are rinsed
clean and exposed

Crime scene shown
on the camera

00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,809
Conan's solution will
take off the mask.

10
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,961
He sees through the

(Bqe;

27
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:32,775
V4 YY!

34
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,485
Ran and I accompanied Pops on the
job to go see a pro wrestling match

36
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:02,287
The main event of the day was

37
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,574
the title match between Jr. Heavy
weight champion Wolf Face and

39
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:12,430
young ace, Hyota Nagase.
However. just before the match...

41
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,567
Hey. Nagase!

42
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,070
Hurry up-and come out!

43
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,343
Mr. Nagase was killed in
the waiting room

45
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,747
Coincidentally, the scene
of the crime was video taped

47
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,783
T. This is!

48
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,519
Wolf Face!

€37)
Soiled Mask Hero"
Part 2

54
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:46,932
Is it true that wrestler
Nagase was killed?

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,799
Tell us!

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,469
What happened
to the police announcement!

59
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:54,540
All right then, from the
person on the right,

61
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:59,444
please give me your name
and where you were around 7:20 pm

63
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,646
Y.Yeah...

64
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:08,086
At around 720 I was watching
the match Mr. Kiba was fighting

66
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,989
Because he gets angry if I don't
watch his match closely

68
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,492
Is there anyone else who
was watching with you?

70
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,494
No. I was alone.

71
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,065
Well, someone in the audience
may have remembered seeing me

73
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,569
but they, were all absorbed in
watchinglthe match...

75
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:28,774
S. Same here, I was watching
Mr. Kiba's match alone too

77
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,643
Oh. my name is Hiroyuki Sakuma!

78
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:36,949
But, right after Mr. Kiba's match I came
to this room to get Mr. Nagase!

80
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,851
Because his match
was right afterwards.

82
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,853
Are you sure?

83
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:47,559
T's true! I heard this man-say+
Nagase. hurry up and come out!

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,829
But, it's after the time
the murder was committed...

87
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,901
Then, next you, the one
wearing the wolf mask!

89
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,403
I'd like you to remove
your mask and talk to us

91
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:03,942
Inspector, he doesn't speak Japanese.
Because Wolf Face is Mexican

93
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:08,313
And besides. he cant take off his mask
in front of Woiien and children

95
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,815
It's okay. Sakumafl

97
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,489
They already know who I am.

98
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,397
You're the one with the handsome face,
but super weak wrestler Noriharu Ogami

100
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:29,334
N.No way!

101
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:34,039
Dd gy
I saw you in the. Tohto:Sports
Newspaper-thisimorning:too

104
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,509
Seeli-Here's a picture
of you'and 'Wolf side by side!

106
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,879
Oh. that's Sakuma!

107
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:45,217
He plays Wolf Face in my place to
deceive all the reporters who come to the

109
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,821
the gym and the match grounds trying to
reveal the identity of Wolf Face!

111
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,557
Oh I see...

112
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:57,129
But the mask that you just removed
and.thegmask'in the picture

114
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,697
Iook somewhat slightly different...

115
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,967
That's the mask I use
when I eat! It's made of thinner

117
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,469
material with less decorations on it.

118
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,372
And the opening of the mouth part is
made larger to make eating easier!

120
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,707
Fl see..,.

121
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:13,979
B, But what#a shock to find out that the
identity of Wolf Face is wrestler Ogami

123
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,220
Aren't you the: one who lost to Wolf
Face at Mascara Contra Mascara.

125
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,689
And vanished soon after the match!

126
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,524
Leonardo Ross!

127
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,625
Oh. yes!

128
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,361
MM. Mascara?

129
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,197
Mascara Contra Mascara!

130
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:36,600
It's a match in which you fight to
remove your opponent's mask!

132
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,371
Well. what a surprise

133
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,807
I thought that you resigned. .

134
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,943
I'm more surprised that you know
so much about Pro Wrestling...

136
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,213
Leo had his mind set on
resigning when he lost to me,

138
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,283
but Mr. Kiba convinced him otherwise

139
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,252
And he debuted once again in Japan

140
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,954
wearing a Wolf Face mask
with a different color

142
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,225
Then, he gathered popularity as
Wolf Face's shadow

144
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,829
He was supposed to be the

145
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,897
Jr. Heavyweight
challenger after Nagase.

147
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,068
But, who would've foreseen that
anything like this would'happen...

149
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,373
And?
Where were you all around 7.207

151
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,342
Since it was just before
I go out to fight the match,

153
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:21,480
I was doing warm-up exercises in the
waiting room of the foreign wrestlers,

155
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:25,951
All the other foreign wrestlers had
gone to see Mr. Kiba's match

157
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,422
And, were you watching
Mr. Kiba's match too?

159
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:31,323
Yes .

160
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,828
Which means all four
of you don't have an alibi...

162
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,864
No. Mr. Inspector!

163
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,701
This murder couldn't have been
committed without Wolf Face's mask!

165
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,740
Which means that the killer is
one of the two who had

167
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,008
free access in and out of the
foreigners' waiting room

169
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,544
Oh, no, Wolf Face's masks are
kept inside a bag and

171
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:58,183
hidden in the toilet of the restroom only
authorized personnel have access to,

173
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,752
SO that we can wear the mask in secret...

174
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,955
If not, people will suspect
me for being Wolf Face.

176
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,092
Because theysll see me going in
and out of the foreigners' waiting room

178
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,060
"SEQ...

179
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:13,331
Of course we handed the bag
over to the forensic officers already.

181
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:19,037
Darn. only if the victim left a
dying message or something.

183
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,641
What's up. Ram?

184
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,544
Remember I said a while ago that the

185
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,946
skills used in pro wrestling is
popular in our Karate.club?

187
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,850
The name of the technique
resembles "Dying Message.

189
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:36,354
Maybe you're talking about
Diving Body Attack?

192
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,590
The one that Mill Mascaras used to do!

193
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,358
Huh? Oh, well.

194
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,296
Then, what about
Bruiser Brody's Flying Knee Drop

196
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,865
or Funk's Pinning Toe Hold

197
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,068
If I remember correctly, I think it was
the technique of a Japanese wrestler...

199
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,537
Oh. then it must be Mr. Taketds!

200
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,347
Well. putting that aside.

201
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,484
Well, weire staying here a while
Ionger and continuing investigations,

203
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,554
so I want the rest of you to go to another
room with Officer Takagi and wait there.

205
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,392
Please say something!

206
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,130
Hey=Ran, take that
brat with" you and go outside too!

208
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,332
Okay!

210
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,767
I'm sorry. Officer Takag:...

211
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,702
No problem...

212
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,743
Wow, check out the
number of press people here

214
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,248
dd A).
It's the wrestler-that did
the bloody match.

217
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,750
Arelyou all right. Mr! Kayama??

218
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,287
You look like a mummy.

219
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,957
O. Oh. it's you. nothing to it.

220
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:47,626
Qfwéw

222
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,112
By the way. is it true
that Nagase was stabbed?

225
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:52,681
Y.Yeah...

226
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,408
Um. Officer Takagi...

227
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,345
I have two things I want to ask you...

228
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,347
What is it?

229
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,017
Uh, you know the mask man.

230
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,520
Yeah, that's right!

231
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,323
I heard that they're all that
way in the beginning

233
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,892
and all masks are more or less that way.

234
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,894
The same goes for Wolf Face's mask!

236
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,565
Hey. Conan, where are you going?

238
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,567
I forgot something!

239
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,038
What do you want?

240
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,307
I forgot something.

241
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,143
Now, where did I put it...

242
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,154
Inspector! We got a report
from the forensic officer!

244
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,488
Oh, okay!

245
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,693
The blood on the mask that was found

246
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,861
in the restroom was determined
to be that of the victim's

248
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:01,399
and the remnants of hair and eyebrows
that were found on the inside

250
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,935
inside of the mask
were the same as those

252
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,437
found on the other Wolf Face masks.

253
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:13,077
Which means that the mask was worn
only by its original owner Mr. Ogam.

255
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,948
And what about the victim's nails?

256
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,418
Although a thorough investigation
was made, nothing was found...

258
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,657
Strange. if he tried to tear the mask off

259
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,527
the killer's skin or something should've
been found left on his nails

261
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:32,163
Just as I thought...

262
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:34,499
There's no mistake about it!

263
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,104
It's the one who couldn't become a wolf!

264
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,794
At any rate, Mr. Inspector!

265
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:49,547
It is an undeniable fact that only the hair
an eye DOTrows OO wires er gam

267
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:55,202
were found on the inside of the mask of
Wolf Face that the killer was wearing!

269
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:59,924
We have no choice but to
judge him to be the killer!

271
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,362
But, even Mr Ogami knew that the
TV station had set awdeo camera

273
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:09,200
up in this room where the
murder was committed. right?

275
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,903
Why would he go out of his way to wear
his mask and commit the crime,

277
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,406
knowing that it would draw
suspicion to himself?

279
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:19,244
That's probably exactly
what he was after.

281
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:24,282
He probably figured everyone would
think so, and used it to his advantage

283
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:32,524
Well, I think that if we call Ogami back
here again he'll confess what he did!

285
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,027
Because he doesn't seem to be
such a bad person to begin with.

287
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,731
Theres something
strange about-this mask!

291
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,702
See, look in the back of the mask
that the killer was wearing!

294
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,238
In theaback?

295
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,678
The design of the mask is different
from the one that

297
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,779
Mr. Ogami was wearing a while ago.

298
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,816
Design?

299
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,851
You're right.

300
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:04,055
The other maskihad more fur in the back.

301
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,192
The mask in this video doesn't have it.

302
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,692
Ikl}

304
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,260
You mean this mask is imitation?

305
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:14,032
Probably a replica or something
that was sold at stores for fans.

307
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,301
Oh. no. don't think so.

308
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,469
Wrong!

309
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:22,540
This mask, is the one that was around
when Wolf.Face made his debut!

311
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,579
Mr. Ogami said that the old
masks were also in the bag.

313
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:31,950
So the killer probably just
happened to pick this old mask.

315
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:37,489
Hey. I thought I tolafyou to keep
an eye on the four suspects?

317
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:43,628
Oh, well, Ran asked me to come check
because Conan didn't come back so

319
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,033
Which means that the design of the mask
has nothing to do with the murder?

321
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:50,401
No. probably not...

322
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,403
So. he says.

323
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,472
So. that's...

324
00:12:56,107 --> 00:12:59,210
What was that "Huh?" for. eh sonny

325
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,678
You fool!

326
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,479
You fool!

327
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:07,652
All you ever come up with are
ideas that confuse the investigation!

329
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:09,354
Understands?

330
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,890
I guess you're right! +

331
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,630
No. wait, "see...

332
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,834
So that's what.it was!

333
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,403
I wonder if you could cooperate with me.

334
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,206
After you change this room
according to my directions

336
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:32,577
can you bring the four suspects who are
waiting in the other room here.

338
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,045
Don't tell me that.

339
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,733
So. shall we peel off
the mask of the killer

341
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:44,389
wolf that stabbed Mr. Nagase
to death in this room. inspector.

343
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,892
Look!

345
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:50,928
The four are going in again.

346
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,733
Just a while ago.
Kogoro Mouri also went inside too

348
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,437
Maybe the Sleeping Kogoro's deduction *
performance is about to begin.

350
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,272
We can't miss this!

351
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,510
Please let us interview you!

352
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,077
You're putting on a deduction
performance. aren't you?

354
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,847
Let us in!

355
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,916
O:Officer Chiba. don't let anybody in!

356
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,319
Conan is)still inside!

357
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,356
Just what is it with you officers?

359
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,358
Summoning us like this again...

360
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:24,062
Don't tell us you've
figured out who the killer is?

362
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,064
Y.Yeah, well sort of...

363
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,967
No. not just yet.

364
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,803
Hey. hey!
You just said a while ago that.

366
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,672
But, we'll soon find out.

367
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,710
All I need you to do
is to disguise yourself

369
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,446
1s Wolf like the killer did and
me walking toward mm

371
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,984
First, let's start with you,
Mr..Ogami, who is Wolf Face himself.

373
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,653
Please wear that mask you are holding.

374
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,189
Please do as you are told.

375
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,891
Y.Yes sir.

376
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,964
Please come towards me.

377
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,301
Come a little more...

378
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,787
Closer...

379
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,010
Uh. what next?

380
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,645
Okay. that's fine.

381
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:19,117
Next, Mr Sakuma! Please take the mask
from Mr. Ogami and do the samesthing

383
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,618
Oh. yes sir...

384
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,994
I. Inspector, do you notice any
difference between the two

386
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,030
No. not at all.

387
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:46,544
Okay?

389
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,121
Then. finally you. Mr. Ushigome.

390
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,189
Yeah.

391
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,125
I wear this and walk towards you. right?

393
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,932
M.Mr. Mourn,
I'm sure you have your reasons

395
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,669
But unless you tell me where
and how to look carefully

397
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,104
I don't have the slightest idea...

398
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,485
Are you okay. mister!

399
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:29,220
It's me.

401
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:29,420
ts. we.

403
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:34,158
O.Oh. it's you, sonny. I'm fine .

404
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,097
Will this do. Mr: Detective?

405
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:43,701
Yes, I more or less thought it would come
out this way. but now I'm positive.

407
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:51,109
That Mr. Ushigome, you're the
one who killed Mr Nagase!

409
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,415
WwW. What?

410
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:03,087
It. It's the same, as the killer who
was in the video he kept looking around!

412
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,522
Looking around?

413
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,476
Yes, you'll find out when you wear itmbut
a wrestler's mask makes for narrower

415
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,131
vision than is actually thought to be!
Unless you're used to wearing it,

417
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:13,731
vision than is actually thought to be!
Unless you're used to wearing it,

419
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:19,203
you tend to look around, trying to make
out the situation of the surroundings

421
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,874
or trip over.things that are at your
feet. because.it is a blind spot

423
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,143
In other words.

424
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,730
Mr. Ogami who is used to
wearing the mask of Wolf Face

426
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,850
Mr. Rossi who is used to
wearing the mask of Nega Wolf

428
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:36,887
and, Mr. Sakuma who usually
pitches in for Mr. Ogami

430
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,458
have all been ruled out as suspects...

431
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:45,530
You're the only one who's not
used to wearing the mask!

433
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:51,803
You mean I'm branded killer just
because I looked around and tripped!

435
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,606
The evidence is right there on tape!

436
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:00,545
Remember what Conan
said about behind the mask a while ago

438
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,281
Do you see that extra something?

439
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:07,785
T:. There are four strings sticking
out from behind the mask!

441
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,353
I get it!

442
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:14,559
The killer was wearing the thin mask worn
when having meals under, another mask!

444
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,863
That way. the hair and eyebrows of the
killer won't stick to the inside

446
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,566
of the mask on the top that
the blood splatters onto!

448
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:27,905
I see, that's why although the
victim tore half the mask off.

450
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,242
No remnants of skin of the «killer were
found in the nails of the victim

452
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,745
Isn't this the mask for meals
that you're talking about?

454
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:39,050
It was sticking out of
our pocket when you fell.

456
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:44,622
Oh-no that's the mask I keep in
order to scare the young wrestlers

458
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,958
and not the one that the
killer was wearing

460
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,127
It's strange.

461
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:55,366
Wolf Face's mask is black and white,
but there's a red spot by the right eye

463
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,634
Oh. I get it!

464
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,101
Oh. I cet it!

465
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,404
The right eye part of
the mask that you were

467
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,540
wearing on top got ripped so the
blood splattered on here"

469
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,275
Y.You brat.

470
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,644
Okay. that's it!

471
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,346
We'll hear you out at the station.

472
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,579
Be quite!

474
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,083
Hey. Mr Ushigome!

475
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,651
I'm telling you to be quite!

476
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:22,160
I killed the betrayer
who wanted to transfer

478
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,430
) the Bankoku Pro Wrestling Tean

479
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,000
Cool it, Mr. Ushigome

480
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,801
That's not all}!

481
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,175
I was going to take the mask
away from you by framing you up.

483
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,011
A young wrestler
with no name. as the Killer!

485
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,980
So that I become Wolf Face!

486
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,716
Didn't you hear a
strange sound just now?

488
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,323
R.Right, .as long as
I get to wear this mask I can become...

490
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,425
You can never become Wolf!

491
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,596
You may be able to
hide your face with the mask,

493
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,882
but you can't hide your
heart that's full of soot

495
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,267
and rotten to the gut,
having no respect for pro wrestling

497
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,176
C.Conan!

498
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,183
Brat. what do you know about me!

499
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,451
Stop it!

500
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,740
Shi. Shining Wizard...

501
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,077
Right, that's it!
That's the name of the technique!

503
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,647
I'm glad,
I finally came up with the name

505
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,387
And then after that

506
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,357
the killer Ushigome

507
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,493
was slapped once in the cheek
by a speechless Mr. Kiba

509
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,000
He was then escorted from the
white mat to a dimly lit hell

But, things are going to get
rough for you from now on...

560
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,464
The mass media is going to bash
you from now on saying things like

562
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,666
you're a murderous pro
wrestling team and stuff...

564
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,868
we'll be fine

565
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,674
We, wrestlers are tough.
We're used to being bashed and hit.

567

So. I'll see you all then.

568
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,347
I wish you luck.

569
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:08,252
Yes, they're the toughest
guys around

571
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:12,490
It's no problem for them to
overcome difficulties like this

573
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,895
And. so long as Wolf
Face keeps on winning

575
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,882
his identity will stay undercover...

576
