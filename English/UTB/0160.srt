Once he gets going. nothing can stop him.

00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,472
Today we solve the mystery of the legend

00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,641
the trick & the evidence
iS beyond your: imagination.

7
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,376
The one & only truth is brought into light

he's got tho brains of an adult.

11
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:54,447
We came to an old temple
with 15 story pagoda while on vacation.

13
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:01,620
But development of the tourist attraction Has
brought trouble with the tour-company.

15
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:06,826
And the next morning. the president
of the tour company,

17
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:10,129
Hideaki Oda was found
hanging from the pagoda.

19
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,033
Exactly like the legend
surrounding the pagodn...

21
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,203
It's tie curse!

If my theory is correct .

25
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,246
Oda didn't commit suicide!

26
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,215
He was murdered!

27
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:35,221
The killer is the one who said what
he did hack then!

Eh!?

39
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:04,150
How about it Mr.- Mourn!
Is it Mr. Oda's tie pin?

41
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:10,256
Yes. Most likely! Diamond lie pins
aren't very common!

43
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:15,194

how about doing a
thorough search!

66
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,214
Now we know Mr. Oda wasn't robbed!

67
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:40,419
His tie pin probably fell when he
hung himself.

69
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:45,524
But Mr Mouri! The pagoda's
over 10 meters from here!

71
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,696
Don't you think it's a bit too far to.fall?

72
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,966
It could have happened like this!

73
00:03:54,301 --> 00:04:01,640
Mr. (we: was deciding whether to kill himself
hore or not! And he didn't realize it fell off!

75
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,011
But tie pins don't fall off so easily!

76
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:06,946
Excuse me!

77
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,883
Y There was grass stains on
Mr. OQdn's elbow.

79
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,152
So what?

80
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,855
Wasnst?the tie pin found here?

81
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:19,191
That's itl" So the stain's from the
grass around here!!

83
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:24,663
Mr. Mouri I'm positive Mr. Oda
struggled with someone here and fell!

85
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:31,036
And another thing. when they were taking
{ns MOC Coding, 0 DO wks O xo ar ail,

87
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,306
and Mr. Oda's feet didn't
reach the railing.

89
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:40,312
Hey men! When you were lowering the
body. did his feet reach the railing?

91
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,749
No sir! It was about 50 centimeters short!!

92
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,918
HoO can.it bell

93
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,653
If he stood on the railing and the rope
didn't reach his neck,

95
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,990
he couldn't have committed suicide!

96
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,194
Mr. Mouri! How do you explain this?

97
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:59,665
Don't worry about it.
It doesn't mean a thing.

99
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,800
Eh?! What do you mean?

100
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:07,673
After a lot of deliberation. Mr. Oda
climbed the pagodn to kill hillself!

102
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:12,811
The rope may have been 50 centimeters
short, but there was no turning back!

104
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:17,049
The otis (JO Jue) 80 (wo
and put it over his head!!

106
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,787
Bul there are so many circumstances
indicating it was murder!

108
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:25,324
Alright, let's just say for the time
being tht it was murder!

110
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:31,629
The killer would have to carry the
hefty, unconscious Mr Oda

112
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,569
up the narrow stairway wide enough for one
and the killer would have to drag the body!

114
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:43,209
But there was no indication of this
on either the body or the pagoda!

116
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,915
And how would the killer hang Mr. Oda
with a rope 50 centimeters too short?

118
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,784
Yes that's true!

119
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,121
The murder theory is beginning
to sound far fetched...

121
00:05:56,488 --> 00:06:03,829
That's right! Unless it was suicide, there's no
wy he could have hung from the pagoda!

123
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,535
It looks like, ou're showing
everyone how foolish you re!

125
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:14,039
You're nothing but a mere human. you'll
neverghe 1ble to solve the mysteries

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,140
of heaven's wrath

128
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,977
Give up and leave this place at once!

129
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:24,016
W's (rue, there are many
unanswered questions.

131
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,752
But there's not enough evidence to prove
this was a murder made to look like suicide.

133
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,623
But... this is definitely murder!

134
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:36,629
The problem is. how did the killer
hang him from the roof of the pagoda?

136
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:42,234
Unless I can solve this trick. this
case will be classified as suicide!!

138
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,240
This was the end tied to the railing...

139
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,510
Why did the killer use
a knot like his to tie it?

141
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,348
ON MUN ASR

142
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,387

finally starting:to-clear!!

144
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,358
Using this method} litt possible to
tie the rope to the railing!!

146
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,529
Hey kid! You're nol supposed "0
touch the things around here!

148
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,064
I'm sorry!

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,003
If my theory is correét. that
thing should be around here!

151
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,575
There it is!

152
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,984
NO doubt about it. with thissmethod
Mr Odn's death

154
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,819
can BO made to look like suicide!!

155

But now for the evidence!

160
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,387
I've got to find proof he:s the murderer!

161
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:17,162
This was a strange suicide
but it's settled now!!

163
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:21,633
Are you sure? Something about it
still bothers me...

165
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,936
Why are you so stubborn!

166
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,606
Alright then. go ahead and write down
on your report, death by curse.

You scared me

194
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,702

What! ? Really?

203
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:52,491
Yes. Mr. Oda gave me the deed
to hold on to,

205
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:56,161
I think it's best if
I gave It back to you now .

207

Isn't that wonderful, Tankai?

208

Mr. Kajimura, you are a very
understanding man!

210
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,869
I was wrong about you!

211
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:06,071
That's very flattering...

212
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,308
As for the deed. I'm sure it was just
a misundestanding between you two.

214
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:16,281
In lieu of Mr. Oda's last act of generosity.
I will recite a prayer for him!

216
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:20,986
Now that my mind lis at ease. I can go back

Iake the rope up to the 5th tier of the pagoda
and drape it over the edge of the roof.

270
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,332
Then you pass it through the railing,
until it reaches the ground and tie it

272
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:52,303
to the scrap metal left
on the old unused well!

274
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:58,877
And to make one side of the scrap metal
easier to drop, it is placed top 1 steel rod!

276
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,049
Here ou are!

277
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:11,523
Now. Detective Yokomizo.
Pull hard on that string!!

279
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,376
It, ites hanging?!
Just hke Mr. Od was. I!

281
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:36,314
What do you think? This is
the identity of your so called curse!

283
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,921
The rope was charred because it rubbed
on the edge of the roof, causing friction!

285
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:48,393
Although the rope was Brand new.
It was frayed because of the friction!

287
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,965
And since we found the tie pin
over there in the grass,

289
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,702
I assume that's where it happened!

290
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,139
But how did the killer get the
rope around Mr. Odn's neck?

292
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,242
Mr. Oda would have put up a fight,

293
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:08,113
but examination of the body
showed no such marks!

295
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,416
Yes. that's a very good question!

296
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,418
Let me explain things in
the order it happened...

298
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:19,291
First. the killer called Mr. Oda to
meet him here...

300
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,495
Then. when he saw the opportunity.
He put the noose around Mr Oda's neck .

302
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:28,233
And pulled the string at the same time,
dropping the scrap metal into the well.

304
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:37,876
Before Mr. Oda is pulled up. the
rope around his neck would come off!

306
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:43,749
So the killer grabbed his legs
causing him to fall!

308
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,552
Since It was dark. even a
slim man would be able to topple

310
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,289
a large man like Mr. Oda
who's caught off guard!!

312
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,528
The grass stains
on his elbow got there at that time

314
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,165
This is when the tie pin also fell.

315
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,136
Mr. Oda had no time to undo the rope.
He was pulled up

317
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,041
I'll positive Mr. Oda was tripped!

318
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,547
If he wasn't. there'd be no way he would
get dirt on the heels of his shoes!!

320
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,315
I get itl!

321
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,953
Wait a minute Mr Mouri!

322
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,423
Are you saying more than one killer
was involved?

324
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,396
It seems you've come across
that dilemma. eh. Detective Yokomizo!

326
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,233
After all, Mr. Oda is a heavy 100
kilograms!

328
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:39,271
If the killer tried to tie
the rope te the railing lone...

330
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:44,643
He wouldn't be able to wind the
rope around his hand. only squeeze it!

332
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:49,047
The moment the rope was cut, it would
be pulled out of his hand!

334
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,252
It's not possible to tie the rope
to the r1iling by himself!!

336
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,454
Oh but it is possible!

337
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,256
Even if the killer was alone!

338
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,828
Thales ridiculous]
Exactly how was it done?

340
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:08,733
The killer used a "yoroi
knot on the railing!

342
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,403
A "yoroi" knot?

343
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,207
It forms a loop on the rope.

344
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:21,680
I've given instructions to the officer
on the pagodn.-have him start.

346
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:25,650
Hey! Cut the rope and tie it to the railing!

347
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,385
Yessir!

348
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,257
First he needs to pull the
yoroi" loop. in.

350
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,760
Then, pass.a stick into the loop
making a stopper.

352
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:42,300
Then he cuts the rope on the: outside.
Pulls the cut end through the loop and tie it.

354
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,669
The stick is pulled and the
ruse is complete!

356
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:49,074
Detective Yokomnzo! The rope
Is tied to the railing

358
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,643
It's possible to do it alone

359
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,081
All that's left is to collect
the rope that has fallen...

361
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,284
and throw it into the old well!

362
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:08,693
And this. ends my explanation of how
a legend was used to cover up a murder.

364
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,329
The only mistake the killer made was.

365
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:17,302
The 50 centimeters difference between
Mr. Oda"s feet and the railing...

367
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:22,974
because that's what made me suspect
it wasnst suicide!

369
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,645
The only one capable of rigging
Il of this is...

371
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,714
Someone who Is familiar with the temple....!

372
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:35,754
Hold on there'll Are you insinuating
one of us is the killer?

374
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:43,228
That's right! The m TN responsible
for this charade ls Mr. Kwjlmura!

376
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,133
Mr. Mouri, you can't be serious!

377
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:51,569
I don't know very much about thisyitembplel

378
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,607
You are the general.manager
of Mei-Harm "och.

380
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,909
But you are alsoran
executive of Od Tours!

382
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,980
It's ea8y for you to get the blueprint to this
place, just say it's for the construction.

384
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:07,285
You calculated the height of the pagoda
the distance to the well and it's depth

386
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,156
And wasn't it you who (old
the construction workers

388
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,092
to put the scrap metal near the well?

389
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,895
So you could use it in your scheme.

390
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,332
Yes. I may have given the orders!

391
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,702
But if I did. it was due. lo, some work
related matter!

393
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:29,441
Mr Mouri. you too are. aware that I was on
a business trip Inst night. I wasn't even hersal

395
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:35,113
Then how did you know about Shunka
and Mr. Odsrs argument last night?

397
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,684
When you came here today. you said...

398
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:48,760
But last night. when you threatened! to take
him to court, he seemed very) upset.

400
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:54,332
Shunkai came back last night
right after you left!

402
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,168
But hod you know about that?

403
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:05,176
Th, that's... I had a call...Mr. Oda called
me on my cellular 1t the hotel in Tokyo...

405
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,845
No. you're lying!

406
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,915
You heard their-conversation
right hero on these grounds!

408
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,453
When you calledOMr. Oda to meét
you here so you could kill him!

410
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,822
Enough of this foolishness!

411
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,425
All you have are accusations!
Show me some: proof!

413
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,993
Proof that I was
here last nigh"!

415
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:28,133
You have the evidence on
you! Irrefutable evidence!!!

417
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,102
Are you sure, Mr. Mouri...?

418
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:35,006
Yes. look inside his wallet

419
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,275
May 17?

420
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,880

Weta TO OTE Re CRVQRT&!

00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,290
It should be stuck betw @n

tell us how did the receipt Mr. Oda
got:'endup in your wallet...?

453
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:30,528
I'm pretty sure after you killed Mr. Oda,

454
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:38,503
you saw his wallet lying in the grass so
you kept the money as cash earned.

456
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:43,608
But you didn't notice the receipt
stuck Gt den the bills)!

458

If you ¢ eck the receipt. you'll find
Mr Oda's fingerprints on itl!

460
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,622
What have you got to say. Mr. Kajimura!
Are you still going to deny it?

462
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:04,829
How stupid... what a-silly thing to
get caught by...

464
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,698
What was your motive?

465
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,601
Taxes

466
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,338
when the companygbegan
having financial difficulties,

468
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,441
Mr Odd told me to file a fake
financial report...

470
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,578
sure, I profitted from the-scheme too.

471

tke the fall for everything...

475
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,323
So you killed him...

476
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:36,594
Yes... before he chopped me
