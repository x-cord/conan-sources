00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:04,737
Just as flowing water has no form,
& the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,006
deductions take all shapes & styles in
each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,343
Kogoro's always messing things<up
butsthis time HE'S in a mess, big time!

7
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,944
He sees through the one & only truth.

8
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:14,080
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,349
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

KOGORO MOURI THE SUSPECT-PART I

and kumquats

17
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,205
Oh I just love summer fruits!
And they're so ripe.

19
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:31,350
Na, Na.

20
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,689
An, why you...

21
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,227
YOU suggested we spend a night at a
hotel since we were coming to Karuizawa

23
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,362
to get away from
the heat in the city, hah!

25
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,765
How come you're the only one
who brought swimming trunks!

27
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,235
The whole idea was so he could
Iook at girls in the pool, I bet

29
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,304
Hey come back,
I'm not through listening...

31
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,040
Too bad!

32
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,842
I'm not lending this to any dirty old man!

33
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,046
Besides, mom bought this for me!

34
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,583
Hey, wait! Wait up!

35
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,653
You can't blame me,
I've been so busy working lately,

37
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:11,524
the stress has been building up!

38
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,261
But I've been letting you sleep haven't I?

39
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,466
Don't you think
you're being unfair to mom?

41
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,803
You can't tell what she's doing
about now either!

43
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:27,940
She could be going after
some young guy,

45
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,984
MM, Mom?!

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,556
I don't believe it...
what are you doing here...

48
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,200
I just told you.

49
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,636
I came to Karuizawa with a lawyer
colleague 10 do some sightseeing, that's all

51
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,640
Then what about that neck tie
you were buying just now?

53
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,477
Oh that... .uh,
a friend asked me to buy one...

55
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,780
and I asked him to help me choose one,

56
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,148
isn't that right?

57
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:09,915
Norihumi Saku

58
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,084
Really? I didn't know that.
Norihumi Saku

61
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,020
I thought you were buying it for me
Norihumi Saku

63
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,754
This is no joking matter, Saku!

64
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,595
You're not a little kid,
can't you choose one on your own?

66
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,963
Well excuse me!

67
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,431
Good grief...

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,165
Very interesting.

69
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,503
Why Ritsuko!

70
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,003
The great Queen herself is
reduced to a mere commoner

00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,973
The great Queen herself is
reduced to a mere commoner
Ritsuko Usui

75
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,108
when it comes to her husband, I see!
Ritsuko Usui

77
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,244
Did she say Queen?

78
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,046
Didn't you know?

79
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:45,184
She reigns so mightily in court,
no one dares approach!

81
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,120
She's such an eloquent speaker,
even judges are left in awe...

83
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,590
That's why she's been nicknamed
Queen of the legal circle

85
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,061
Will you stop saying that?
You're the only ones who call me that

I don't know about that,
Kenzo Shiozawa
Tg [. - :

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,066
I heard some prosecutors say that when
they're in court up against Ms Kisaki,
Kenzo Shiozawa
Uh TO

100
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,903
I heard some prosecutors say that when
they're in court up against Ms Kisaki,

102
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,106
they feel like traitors defying their Queen!

103
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,177
I think I understand how that feels...

104
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,381
But now the #1 female lawyer is you,

105
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,650
after you got a ruling in
the second trial reversed

107
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,554
& took that famous case
all the way to the High Court

109
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,056
Anyone could have won that case

110
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,458
Let me apologize then

111
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:26,692
I was the lawyer In first trial
and I guess I wasn't good enough

113
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,994
I was the lawyer in first trial
and: guess I wasn't good enough
Yuji Mikasa

117
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,530
that's why I lost the case
that anyone could have won
Yuji Mikasa
Attorney

121
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,331
that's why I lost the case
that anyone could have won

123
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,134
No, Ill...that's not what I meant...

124
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,536
What I really meant was that

125
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,106
winning a case like that doesn't put me
even close to Queen Eri's class!

127
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,608
Enough already

128
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,312
You two may be separated
but I still envy you,

130
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,647
a female lawyer who never loses

131
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,550
and a private detective who always
solves his cases, what a couple!

133
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,751
Oh no

134
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:58,224
I'm just an worthless man who is ever
so proud to be married to a grand lady

136
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,192
You're right...

137
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,829
Tihenstha emust-mean I'm a stupid woman

138
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,299
who's picked a woman chasing
private detective,

140
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,635
a low-life who looks for the dirt
In other people's lives

142
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,037
asatheman to share her life-with

143
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,508
Good grief, how can you say that...

144
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,578
everytime Mr. Mouri solves a case,

145
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,981
Dr. gn o em
you Cu Ou earicein ee newspaper
& put it in your scrapbook!

148
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,383
No, I don't!

149
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,518
Dad does that too!

150
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:31,056
Late at night, he sneaks & reads all
articles on the cases mom is working on!

152
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:33,792
Right, dad?!

153
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,127
Don't tell her you idiot!!

154
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,663
Come on now
here we are, all in Karuizawa!

156
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's just call a truce for tonight
fhave a-good time!

158
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,872
Well, if Eri doesn't object [I'll oblige...

159
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:51,010
I I don't mind ..not one bit...

160
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,746
What is this? What's going on?

161
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,282
Could it be? They're still in love?

162
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,417
No way...

163
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:10,429
I'd like to hear Ritsuko's sweet voice
pleading my case in court too...

165
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,497
Mr. Mouri, are you drunk?

166
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,638
Dad!

167
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,841
Oh Ritsuko,
your little hands are soooo cute

169
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,778
You're my type

170
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:31,950
Mom, wait!

171
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,355
What a drunkard...

172
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,558
Wait a minute!!

173
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:44,229
Mom, you know that dad always gets
Iike that when he's drunk

175
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:48,233
Besides, you were with a man
today yourself...

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,170
you looked so happy, choosing that tie...

178
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,708
You're right...
I shouldn't have bought thisfthing...

180
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,445
I let my guard down for.one moment
and now I'm so mad

182
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,046
I think I might explode...

184
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,650
I don't believe it, you mean...
that tie's...

186
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:09,722
Yes, that's right...
tomorrow's our.wedding anniversary...

188
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,126
I felt sorry for you and I thought
maybe it was time for me to forgive him

190
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,662
so I figured I'd give him a present...

191
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,664
but I'm glad I didn't...

192
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,534
Then I'll take that!

193
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,602
Hey wait

194
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,873
I'll give it to him for you!!

196
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,341
come right back here!!

197
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:31,910
Ir...

199
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,853
I, 1 think I'll give it to him myself...

200
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:43,922
Good grief!!

202
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,527
Did everybody leave?

203
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,062
Dad too?

204
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:50,729
Uh huh!

205
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:54,066
He said he was going back to the room
to sleep because he felt drunk...

208
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,971
I think dad's in his room!
Good luck!

210
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,472
Oh, all right!

211
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,217
Yes...

212
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,753
why, Ms. Kisaki...

213
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,024
I know it's late and I apologize
but is my husband here?

215
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,427
No, he's not, why?

216
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,760
Alll «AE.
SCC.

218
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,029
Is something wrong?

220
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:30,903
I can't find dad, he's not in our room
or in the other 3 people's rooms

222
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,336
vs *%

223
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:38,610
Maybe he's wandering around outside,
he likes to feel the night air...

227
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,915
I'm sorry we disturbed you
we'll go look outside

229
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,451
Excuse us

230
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,320
Let's go find him!!

231
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,455
Yes, let's go!

232
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,363
Forgive me Ms Kisaki,

233
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:03,601
but I've finally discovered that I'll never
be like you, no matter how hard I try...

235
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,805
the only way I can ever rise above you...

236
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,377
is you've got to fall a few notches

237
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:26,024
If you thought there was something
between your beloved husband and me,

239
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,595
your ability to think clearly would be
affected and your work would suffer,

241
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,364
then you'd be forced to
relinquish your title as #1 to me...

243
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,299
Ritsuko Usui!!

244
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,471
Good grief, are they back again?

245
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,274
How persistent...

246
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,946
h...What can I do for yo

247
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,423
Eh? Mr. Mouri's still not back?
Are you sure about that?

249
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,224
Yes...

250
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,593
We've looked everywhere,

251
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,563
the hotel grounds, the roof,
the stairways, everywhere...

253
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,566
It's already 2 AM...

254
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,768
That's strange...

255
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,439
He left with Miss Usui because he said
they were staying on the same floor...

257
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,808
Nam a
I OTC.

259
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,443
So that leaves...

260
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,816
Ritsuko's room is the only one
we haven't checked...

262
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,320
Hey? This wasn't here
when we came here earlier...

264
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:29,521
earlier...

265
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,457
We came here earlier to ask
but she said he wasn't with her...

267
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,459
Of course he wouldn't be

268
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,663
I doubt those two:.would...

269
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,932
Mom, what are you doing?!

270
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,533
Sh!! Be quiet...

271
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,541
I don't believe it!

272
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:53,678
There's no mistake!
That's his cellular phone!

274
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,814
It can't be...

275
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,782
Mikasa!

276
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,351
I hate to ask but could you go to the front
desk and borrow their master key?!

278
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,419
You bet!

279
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:09,294
Ladies first...

280
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,431
Look, the door chain's on

281
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,437
What's the matter?

282
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,907
H, hey, that's...

283
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,743
Isn't that Ritsuko?!

284
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,947
Bell boy! Get the chain cutter, quick!!

285
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,983
Huh? Oh...

286
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:32,985
Stand back!

287
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,520
There's no time to waste!

288
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,524
Ritsuko?!

289
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,827
Ritsuko?!

290
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,331
Come on! What's wrong?
Wake up!

292
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,799
Stop!

293
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,070
I don't feel a pulse...

294
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,573
Th, that's impossible...

295
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,207
What happened?

296
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,811
Boy, what's all the racket about!!

297
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,015
What's going on here?

298
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,150
ID, dad!

299
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,618
K, Kogoro...

301
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:19,731
740,

303
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,538
Wh, why are you here...?

304
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,675
The chain was on the door

305
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,077
Ritsuk0's body was on the floor...

306
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,147
And only 1 other person was in

307
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,882
this locked room...

308
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,752
Hey now! What's going on here...

309
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,320
Don't step on that

310
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,924
That telephone cord on the floor
IS probably the weapon!

312
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,625
M, murder weapon?!

313
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,226
Look, over there!

314
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,563
See the thin marking around her neck?

315
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:57,335
I see...you're saying she was strangled
with the telephone cord™.

317
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,505
H, hey! Whyss Miss Usui lying on the...

318
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,842
Eh? Did you say strangled...

319
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,379
By who?

320
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,014
You're the one who could've done it!!

321
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,749
Why'd you kill her...

322
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,552
Now just hold on!!

323
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,153
I'm sure this 1s some kind of mistake!

324
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:17,789
My father would never kill anyone,
would he,

326
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,291
mom?!

327
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,894
Penal code #499 .

328
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,231
A person charged with murder
will be sentenced to life

330
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,767
or a minimum sentence of 3 years...

331
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,104
the death penalty!!

332
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,305
What?

333
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,372
MM mom?!

334
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,243
Ran! Why are you standing around?
Call-the police at once!

336
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,912
He's got to be kidding...

337
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,853
Hmm...let me get this straight

338
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:52,657
Your husband was missing,
you thought he might be in this room

340
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,926
so you called him on his cellular...

341
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,598
- and as you suspected,
you heardghis cellular ringing in this room

343
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,735
when you used the master key
tofunlock the door,

345
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,271
you found the chain was on

346
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,608
and you could see the victim lying on the
floor in the space between the door...

348

351
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:11,576
When you broke down the door
and entered the room,

00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,012
you found the victim was already dead,

you found the victim was already dead,
Keiji Yamamura

374
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,681
you found the victim was already dead,

375
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,885
and your husband was asleep
on this bed...right?

377
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,353
Yes...

378
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,957
Then I'm sorry to tell you this
but your husband is the murderer...

380
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,592
That's not fair!

381
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,863
Just wait a minute! Dad,
don't just stand there say something!

383
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,734
Hey? I know you...
arentyou Xogoro Mourn?

385
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,602
Uh, yes

386
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,641
With a famous private detective
Iike you on the scene,

388
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,043
this case's good as solved!

389
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,113
Why don't you tell me your thoughts
regarding this murder?

391
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,614
Yes dear .

392
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,552
Why don't you tell him
all about what happened here...

394
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,290
while: youswere snoring up a storm...
Mr. Famous Private Detective...

396
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,425
Eh? He's your husband?!

397
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,893
You're married to Kogoro Mourn?!

398
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,830
But, then, that means .

399
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,098
Then, then YOU'RE the murderer?!

400
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,433
I don't believe it,

401
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,838
what's going to happen withThe Sleeping
Kogoro's Mystery Solving Show 7?!

403
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,706
What do I care!!

404
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,242
Detective Yamamura!

405
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,112
Shall we take Mr. Mourn
down to the station for questioning?

407
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,915
I suppose...if Mr. Mouri doesn't mind...

408
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,383
Dad...

409
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,790
Aw rats... really wanted to see him
solve the case in his sleep...

411
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,794
I guess you'll be
his pre-indictment lawyer then?

413
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,196
Pre-indictment lawyer?

414
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,999
It s a system where a lawyer
can be present with the suspect

416
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,001
so he gets treated fairly by the police

417
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,870
Sorry, but I pass

418
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:50,208
I'm not taking a case
when I know the suspect's guilty!!

420
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,613
I'm not going to spoil my perfect record

421
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,718
I wasn't going to ask you anyway!!

422
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,888
And don't you show up at the police
station either, or you'll be sorry!!

424
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,892
DD. dad!

425
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,493
MM, mom!!!

426
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,162
Alright then, I'll take care of it,

427
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,633
besides, I don't think Mr. Mouri did it...

428
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,069
Let's go then...

429
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,372
Thank you very much!

430
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,575
How could you...

431
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,712
Mikasa, will you
and Shiozawa leave the room?

433
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,049
I have something to say to the detective

434
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,918
Sure, no problem...

435
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,185
What are you going to say

436
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,393
Excuse me, Detective...

437
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,193
Yes?

438
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,596
Would you mind lending me your gloves?

439
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:47,132
Did you say gloves?

441
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,136
Mom, what are you going to do...

442
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,805
There are 3 things that don't add up

443
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,409
the first is the telephone cord
used to strangle the victim...

445
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,545
if he killed while he was drunk
and without pre-meditation

447
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,847
he would have ripped the cord
out of the jack

449
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,283
but the telephone is still neatly in place...

450
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,753
and there s no indication the cord was
forcibly removed from either end...

452
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,757
The second thing is his cellular phone...

453
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:17,562
I have a feeling it was
deliberately left near the door

455
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,564
so we could hear it ringing from outside...

456
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,634
And the third thing is his hands .

457
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,570
Only about 40 minutes had passed

458
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,906
since the time we last spoke
to her then found her body

460
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,309
If he had strangled her with the cord

461
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,179
there should still
have been marks on his hands

463
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,449
unless of course, he wore leather gloves
or something of that sort.

465
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,085
But we found nothing like that here...

466
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,421
Yes I see what you mean,
it is strange...

468
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:47,125
Mom, are you saying the reason you
didn't go with dad to the station was

470
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,860
you wanted to check things out here...!

471
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,228
Of course=silly™.

472
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,298
I've known him-much=longer than you!

473
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,834
Sure, I wasiangryavfirst

474
00:18:55,835 --> 00:19:00,105
but I know better than anyone
that he isn't capable of murder

476
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,242
Then when dad said he didn't want
you to show up at the station,

478
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,945
what he really meant was he wanted you
to find the evidence that would clear him...

480
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,581
I wouldn't know...

481
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,718
maybe he said that because
he really didn't want to see me

483
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:14,919
what's this...

484
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:19,457
There's a memo pad on the desk...
and a page has been ripped out...

486
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,828
Maybe it's this? Is this the page?

487
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:29,733
It's kind of wrinkled
but it has, some writing on it, see?

489
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,036
Jig;

490
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,405
Hmm...yes, it is her writing...

491
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,142
Hayashi...? And is that the number 2?

492
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:44,449
It could pertain to Hayashi a lawyer who
she'll be teaming up with on her next case

494
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,920
He's been wanting to contact her
to discuss that-certain case

496
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,088
What case is that?

497
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,358
It's the case everyone's talking about,
regarding a company polluting the water

499
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,229
they approached us at first

500
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,999
but neither Shiozawa nor I
wanted to handle it

502
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,301
and Saku's a criminal lawyer

503
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,905
so Ritsuko and Mikasa ended up with it...

504
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:11,309
They lost the first trial
but were able to win the second...

506
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,512
She asked me to introduce
another lawyer to replace Mikasa

508
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:19,384
because she wanted to win the case
and I thought of Mr. Hayashi .

510
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,921
But ll hadn't told her about him vet

511
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,056
it's strange though...

512
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,194
I don't think I told him
the name of this hotel...

514
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:33,031
He said Mr. Shiozawa told him...

515
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:38,368
Oh. I'm sorry, I'm the one who connected
the call from Mr. Hayashi to this room

517
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,139
Who told you you could come In here!!

518
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,610
I uh something was bothering me so I
thought I'd better tell you about it...

520
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,445
So what's bothering you?

521
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,916
Actually, Mr. Hayashi called twice...

522
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,419
the first time he called,
he got through, but...

524
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,489
The second time he called, there was no
answer and the call came back to the desk,

526
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,891
I thought it was strange
so I came up to the room to check...

528
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,560
I checked twice...

529
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:04,929
You checked twice?!

530
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,533
Yes...the first time, I rang the doorbell
and there was no answer

532
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,469
so I told Mr. Hayashi
she might be resting, but...

534
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:15,473
Mr. Hayashi said
she might just be taking a bath

536
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,276
so he asked me to check again...

537
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:24,682
and there was a do not disturb sign
on the door and a note

539
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,284
door and a:'note...

540
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,019
Yes... it said...

541
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:32,824
I'm very sorry please tell him
I'll repay the money

543
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,760
the writing was very distorted

544
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,831
And did you give
Mr. Hayashi the message?

546
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,066
Did you?!

548
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,034
Allcbv

549
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,271
but he sounded very confused, he said
he was calling just to change the time

551
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,374
of their meeting the next day from 2 to 4

553
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,044
I don't understand...

554
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,213
the note we found
In the waste basket was

556
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:58,683
probably the memo regarding
her meeting at 2 with him...

559
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,552
« hat's right...

560
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:04,422
but the note on the door was
about something totally different!

562
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:09,360
If she was killed
before the second call, then...

564
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:16,034
that means the killer put the sign
and the note on the door!

566
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:20,704
But why would the killer do
something so stupid...

568
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:24,475
it would only be leading us to conclude
Kogoro didn't commit the crime!
