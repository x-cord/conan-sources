Huh

5
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,283

6
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,779

Hey! Answer me!!

69
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:57,382
Escape? We're trapped!!
Hey, hey, if so, how are we going to

71
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,603
What?

72
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,501
Aware that they were
without Mr. Itakura being

74
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:39,631
were watching this villa
Yeah, or maybe they

76
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:35,660
failed to open the e-mail!
They found out. They found out that we

78
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,555
You're there, aren't you?

79
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,685
Vodka

80
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,382
Hey, what's up?

81
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:18,910
Please record your message after the tone.

82
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,103
To the phone right now
I can't come

00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,885
Shinichi

85
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,216
Shinichi

86
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:49,380
happened to Mr. Itakura-and come here!!
What now? They may think that something

88
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:43,875
using this computer.

89
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,906
Found out that the mail failed to be opened
Yeah:--Not only that, maybe they even

91
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,736
the mail wasn't opened...
So, don't tell me that they found out

93
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,833
opened immediately, it would disappear!
Darn, It was set so that if it wasn't

95
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,727
The mail disappeared...

96
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,558
Darn

97
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,089
Hey it's counting down really fast!

98
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,285
Password?!

99
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:17,182
Okay. if I open this...
Here it is! The mail!

101
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,509
Show:your-dirty rat selves!

102
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,006
Come on, you guys in black!

103
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:03,902
'Yeah...

104
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,801
SShinichi... it's almost time.

105
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,929
Without having to see them
sO he gets-to sever all ties with them

107
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,392
and the check,
and find the software

109
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,589
Iook for Mr. Itakura
they'll eventually come here to

111
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:48,486
they are about to send here,
And as for the e-mail that

113
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,714
in a place like this
would be left so carelessly

115
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,812
the software that they wanted
Because they wouldn't think that

117
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:37,075
that very reason!
He left it here just for

119
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,905
But, how dangerous...

120
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,168
I, II see...

121
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,999
whenever they wanted to
so that his friends could come in

123
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,629
was hidden somewhere
Which means that the key

125
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:21,626
5 years called: me from my villa.
A friend that! haven't seen in

127
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,721
Remember it was written in the diary?

128
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,551
It was hidden behind those stairs

129
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,949
Where did you get that key?!

130
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:09,247
Huh

131
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,843
make it inside...

132
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,906
So, now how do we

133
00:18:59,171 --> 00:18:59,604
hew... we've finally arriv

134
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:59,170
Whew... we've finally arrived

135
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,497
what the hell is the punishment?!
What is the punishment,

137
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,858
by force. they will be punished
If people try to bend things out of line

139
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:43,054
the stream of time...
People cannot go against

141
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,884
Don't rush things...

142
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:34,179
Making-zombies, that's ridiculous
Ha, ha... no way

144
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,575
Al was trying to make was...
don't tell me that the drug

146
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,639
hey. VoL...

148
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,070
What does it mean anyway:...?

149
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:22,300
Against the stream of-time."
since we are trying to raise the dead

151
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,493
God and the Devil,
We can be both of

153
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:13,858
Yeah

154
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,891
are the last words in the diary
The thing that bothers 'me though.

156
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,585
The jewelry robber who is on the run
but all they're broadcasting is about

158
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,481
the radio all this time,
I've been listening to

160
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,445
That's still okay too

161
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,976
on TV or radio
has already been aired

163
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,173
about Mr. Itakura being killed
The problem is. whether the news

165
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,970
down the drain
they'll be throwing everything

167
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,434
the software is completed
If they upset him before

169
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,197
That's true...

170
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,596
had been moved 5 centimeters
he is bothered that the pen on his desk

172
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:41,358
with a character who'is so jittery that
They would never break a promise

174
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:36,554
not to snoop around him anymore!
Mr. Itakura made them promise

176
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,650
We'll be fine!

177
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,647
In 'ambush or something...
What if they're waiting

179
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,810
Will it be okay though?

180
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,709
His acquaintances and so forth
his house, villa, the addresses of

182
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,339
that Mr. Itakura could be hiding like,
He was asking the man for places

184
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,203
Iook for Mr. Itakura
that came to ask him to

186
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,634
the game company
Pops asked the man from

188
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:12,264
that Mr. ltakurars villa is in Gunma
It's amazing how you found out

190
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:03,788
at midnight!!
They're going to be sending

192
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,185
the e-mail that
Then, weire going to receive

194
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,582
system software in question
and get a hold of that

196
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,046
Mr Itakuraes villa right now
We're going to

198
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,843
What else?

199
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,507
And, so what now?

200
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,869
Um going to go to bed

201
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,333
Sounds silly...

202
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,564
@h. that-s some value!!!

203
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,095
An ad balloon
it can become as large as

205
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:35,260
gas that's puts in,
Depending on the amount of

207
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,258
However:lit is very elastic!!

208
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:28,854
On...

209
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,620
for 10 seconds
it can only maintain its form

211
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,984
it leaves. the belt
air leak-once

213
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,349
Because, of the nature of rubber

214
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,748
Because of the nature of rubber

215
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,247
No. maybe just one or two...

216
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,878
of-culprits with this!!
I'd be able to catch a load

218
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,741
WwW. Wow!!

219
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:15,106
There! One soccer ball to go!!!

Andypush the button
But whén you adjust<the dial

222
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,898
No it doesn't...

223
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,230
on first glance...
It looks like any ordinary belt

225
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,426
Fire a ball anywhere belt!!

226
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,290

Where a witch-or something appears?

Some kind of fantasy story
Are you reading

239
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,763
What is that?

241
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,693
AAI?!

242
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:26,057
Against the stream of time
we're trying to raise the dead

244
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,453
Since

245
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,684
We can be both of God and the Devil

246
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,314

We can be both of God and the Devil

259
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,969
She laughed and replied in English

260
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,766
Just who the hell do you think you are?
so I taunted her saying,

262
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,796
tone of voice of the woman
I couldn't stand the overbearing

264
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:53,759
Yes...

265
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,657

Hmm?

292
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:32,003
Escape abroad before seeing that e-mail
I guess Mr. Itakura was planning to

294
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,997
arriving 3 hours from new at 09:00
which means the e-mail should be

because my vision started weakening,

316
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,990
that software not only
I abandoned making

318
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,620

And that they stop snooping

they deposit the payment

341

that I was developing at a high price
that she wanted to the buy the software

343
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,484
Her request was,

344
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,281
as if she were a queen.
A stuck up woman who talked

346
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,012
a woman answered the phone
To my surprise,

348
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,906
and call them instead
I decided not to notify the police

350
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,470
on what to do for a while,
January 23rd, although I was deliberating

352

Tell no one or you're dead.
It probably means .

354
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,894
Written with blood
The red words were probably

356
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,625
phone number was written
Along with a mysterious

358
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,356
OK was written in red...

359
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,853
there was a memo from the intruder
wan \

361
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,984

January 8th, I-got an-answer

364
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,544
go along with their demand.
I wrote that I would y

366
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:21,707
to the intruder in the desk...
I inserted a*message addressed

368
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,635
free myself from this terror,
January#6th, in order to

370
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,532

Ifirthis keeps up

Hey.Conan

746
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,760

747
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,288
Shuichi Akai...

748
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,883
If he were deeply involved with Au...

749
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,343
who killed the street slasher...
If he were the one

751
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:46,405
Ai reacted the street slasheer...
during the James kidnap case,

753
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,399
And besides...

754
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:38,664
they would never goof like that...
If the F.B.l. had that area covered.

756
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:33,459
Making it looks as if he killed himself
Somebody killed that street slasher

758
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,319
really belongs to the F B.17...
But, I wonder if he .
