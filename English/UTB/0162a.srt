Once he gets going, nothing can stop him

00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,173
Today's episode is a special,

00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,975
It's the start of Conan & Shinichi's era
the very first mystery

7
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,509
The one and only truth is
brought into the light

He looks like an child but he's got
the brains of an adult

00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,081

Look, that's the one!
That's the plane we're riding!

21
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,260
Wow. it's so big

22
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:13,866
Boeing 747! It's a jumbo jet
total length, 70.7 meters!

24
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,903
Rats! Why's a famous private
detective like Kogoro Mouri have to

26
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,940
babysit a bunch of kids on
his trip to Okinawa...

28
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,908
You have your nerve...

29
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:27,947
Last night you were saying, "Wait for
me my little beach angel

31
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,382
I didn't know these brats
were coming:along...

33
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:34,186
Good grief! Doctor Agasa entered a
contest on the internet

35
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:37,089
& won this trip to Okinawa. that's why
we're able to go!

37
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,860
Just be grateful you can go along!

38
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,495
Yeah yeah

39
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:47,333
I don't see that lucky prof es
anywhere. do you?

41
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,467
Now that you mention it...

42
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,236
The professor's not coming

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,742
I just called him & he said he came
down with a cold & won't be able to go

45
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,876
What?!

46
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:03,582
But I don't think it's too bad!
He asked me to buy a lot of gifts...

48
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,284
What about An?

49
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,654
She said she'll pass because she's
taking care of the professor

51
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,456
Oh. I see...

52
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,326
then let's buy her a lot of souveniers!

53
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,210
Wow, the houses are
getting smaller and smaller!

55
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,446
Conan. look look!

56
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,948
Are you sleeping?

57
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,519
Shh... he was up all night reading

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,728
Huh?! What're you smilling about?

59
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,966
I'm just thinking about
the plane ride last year...

61
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,771
Shinichi fell asleep right after
we took off too...

63
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:02,708
Oh, I remember that's when I won a
trip at the neighborhood drawing &

65
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,779
while I was gone. you & that kid
detective ran off to Los Angeles...

67
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,651
How many times do I have to tell you!
We just went to visit his parents!

69
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:17,823
Kids just in high school don't go off on
overseas trips, at least not:normal kids...

71
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,962
Well that's because his parents sent
me a ticket too!

73
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:29,135
He didn't try anything funny. did he?

74
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,737
What do you mean, anything funny?

75
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,474
Well, uh... you know... I mean...
How do I say this...

77
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:40,546

the newspaper company over there said
they'd pay a lot of

money for these negatives!

00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,614

if they were of somebody else!

You've got to be kidding!

129
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:07,633
I already faxed 2 copies of the pictures
over there & got it confirmed!

131

It doesn't matter, just remember,

Could you do me a favor?

IS getting some medicine

165
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,819
Did you drink the motion sickness
pills I gave you?

168
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,591
That's strange... I gave some to
Noboru too & it seems to be working...

170
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,194
How about if we switch seats?

Maybe sitting by the window will make
you feel better

Let's see...

175
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,641
Here, the medicine's for her!

00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,810
Here you are

177
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,878
Thank you.

178
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,213
Here, your pills.

179
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,185
I just noticed, where'd Kazuhiro go?

180
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,754
He got up awhile ago & went somewhere

181
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:14,460
I wonder if he didn't feel good &
ent to the toilet...

183
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,403
Hey. you in there! Hey!

184
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,872
Excuse me... is something the matter?

185
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:31,043
I've been knocking a long time but
whoever's inside doesn't answer!

187
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,014
Excuse me? Hello?

188
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,649
Excuse me...

189
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,086
Are you feeling ill

190
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:54,266
What was that scream?

191
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,468
It came from the rear...

192
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,037
Ladies & gentlemen. may I have
your attention please...

194
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,106
a passenger has become seriously ill,

195
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:06,278
If there is a doctor or nurse on board.

196
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,314
Please contact the nearest
cabin attendant...

198
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,182
Excuse me...

199
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,150
Yes?

200
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:16,488
Megure of the Metropolitan Police
Department... is someone really ill?

202
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,057
Uh. the truth is...

203
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,794
I went for a look!
Somebody's dead!

205
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:22,827
Really?!

206
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,264
Yeah. inside the toilet in back!

207
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:29,134
Hey, come on-wake up!
Something terrible has happened...

209
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,803
I don't believe it...

210
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,539
Where is hel?

211
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,943
Why. Ran, is that you?! Taking a
trip on the long weekend?

213
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,815
Er, uh... well... Never mind me.
I just heard someone was dead!

215
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,718
Calm down. we're about to look
into that now...

217
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,091
No one has touched the; body have.ithey?

218
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,695
Well actually... a strange young boy
has been hanging around...

220
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,831
A strange young boy?

221
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:03,235
Cause. of death is probably suffocation due
to damage to the cervical pith!

223
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,773
The murder weapon is probably something
with a sharp point like an ice pick!

225
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,543
Before the victim was stabbed.

226
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,380
There's a possibility he was forced to inhale
something knocking him unconscious...!

228
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,317
Who would do such a thing...?

229
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,786
We don't know that yet!

230
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,157
But don't worry...

231
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:25,457
But don't worry...

232
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,260
the killer is still flying over the
Pacific Ocean

234
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,496
inside this huge metal can...

235
00:10:31,498 --> 00:10:33,332
the killer won't get away!

236
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,767
Hey! Who the heck are you?!

237
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,671
That's right...

238
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,441
This is the beginning...

239
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,946
Shinichi Kudo! I'm a detective!

240
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:51,316
This was Shinichi's first case...

241
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,689
Ku, Kudo...

242
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,691
You couldn't be Yusakuls...

243
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,594
It's been a long time, Inspector Megure...

244
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,697
Ooohh, you're his son Shinichi!

245
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,233
You're the splitting image of your
father when he was a boy!!

247
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,871
The last time I saw;you you were in
the 6th grade!

249
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,075
Ou certainly have grown...

250
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,846
But that's beside the point!

251
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,749
I'm sure you just became a high school
st»udentjdidn't you!!

253
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,651
You shouldn't be
disturbing the crime scene!!

255
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,621
Excuse me! Could you borrow someone's
camera & bring it here?

257
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,790
I'd like to photograph the crime scene!

258
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:36,228
Um, er... if it's photos. that boy
already took some...

260
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:36,962
He what?!

261
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,568
About 60 of them... I borrowed a camera
from one of the passengers...

263
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:43,601
Also...

264
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,269
Yes?

265
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:49,341
We did as he asked & kept a close eye
on what he did, but...

267
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:53,512
We didn't notice him hide or wipe any thing
or do anything the least bit suspicious...

269
00:11:55,915 --> 00:12:01,153
But... if an amateur handles the body,
the stiffened muscles could be damaged

271
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,789
throwing the estimated time of death off...

272
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,393
Based on the condition of the death spots &
the fact that the jaw had started stiffening...

274
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,963
He was dead about 1 or 2 hours!

275
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,765
3 things struck me as odd!

276
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:19,037
#1 a few drops of blood had flown onto
the wall the victim was leaning on

278
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:23,408
but the clothing pressed against it
wasn't stained...

280
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:30,816
#2- the scratch like marks to the lower
right of the fatal wound...

282
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:36,922
#3- and the inside of his left pants
pocket was soaked!

284
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,726
But the victim's hands were dry .

285
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,162
Even if he stuck his wet hands into the
pockets, they wouldn't get as wet as that...

287
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:49,101
Which means, someone for some reason
wet it deliberately!

289
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,106
Listen you! You just keep out of this!

290
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,308
Let the police handle the rest!!

291
00:12:56,309 --> 00:13:01,580
Excuse me, please go & wake that
fellow who's sleeping next to my seat!

293
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,281
He's withthe police too

294
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,383
Yessir!

295
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:08,320
Come here!
What do you mean, [I'm a detective],

297
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,422
you're just a high school student!

298
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,557
I didn't have a choice did I?

299
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:16,161
They wouldn't have let me examine the
body if I didn't say that!

301
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,264
The thing is! You shouldn't go off
Iike that without telling me!

303
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,167
I was worried that you were the victim!

304
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:26,438
I have no interest in waking a girl who
Iooks like a fool when she's asleep!!

306
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,374
What do you mean, looks like a fool!

307
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,976
Like this...

308
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,779
Inspector!

309
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,581
You're late Takagi!

310
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,717
A murder?

311
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,718
Yes...

312
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,221
Cause of death is suffocation
due to damage to the cervical pith...

314
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:47,693
The murder weapon is something that
Iooks like an ice pick with a pointed tip...

316
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,729
Judging from rigor mortis & the
death spots of the body,

318
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,465
he's probably been dead ahout 1-2 hours...

319
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,202
Un... %! An empty bottle & handkerchief!

320
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:01,873
It seems the killer carried this
handkerchief soaked in something

322
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,176
Iike chloroform in this bottle

323
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:09,047
& used it to knock the victim out just
before killing him!

326
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:15,954
Excuse me, I'd like to save the evidence,
may I have a plastic bag or something...

328
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,223
Uh... is something wrong?

329
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,496
It's just amazing, you're doin
the same things that young boy did...

331
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,164
What boy

332
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,802
You know, he was standing in the doorway.
The one in the black sweater...

334
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,273
Who is he?

335
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,776
He's the son of a friend of mind... gm

336
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,946
whenever I got to a deadend on a case,
I'd go to my friend.

338
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,547
Who's a mystery writer, for advice...

339
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:48,019
when he was little, he'd come to the crime
scene with his father & wander around but

341
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:53,125
who'dve thought.he/dracquire enough
to expertly analyze a crime scene...

343
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,428
Gee, he's going to be a great help!!

344
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,765
You fool! He's a civilian!

345
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,101
He's just a kid in high school
who thinks he's a great detective

347
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,904
because he's read a lot of
mysteries & medical books!

349
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,607
At any rate. find us some witnesses!

350
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,276
There are 4 suspects

351
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:16,782
There were 4 others. excluding the victim,
who were in the toilet at that time!

353
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,317
My seat is in the rear of the cabin!

354
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:24,756
I'd been watching but no one came to
the smoking section in the back.

356
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,525
That you can be sure of

357
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:30,762
You were watching it?
Were you up-+all*night?

359
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,932
Well, uh... I couldn't sleep...

360
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,001
Why, for heaven's sake?!

361
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:38,937
I thought you fell asleep as soon as
we got on the plane!

363
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,740
Uh. er! Is that so?

364
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,277
Oh boy, you're like a baby, going
to bed early &

366
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,479
getting up in the middle of the night...

367
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:54,820
Aw nuts... how can I sleep with you
sleeping so soundly next to me like that...

369
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:58,256
I'm not all that mature yet...

370
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,294
Alright then. how about telling us
who those 4 are!

372
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,895
Un, sure...

373
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:08,500
Let's see... the 4 are...

374
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,740
This girl &...the girl next to her...
and across the aisle.

376
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,542
The man in this seat and...

377
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,479
this man in the front seat, these 4!!

378
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,082
Their seats are close by

379
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,683
Yes...

380
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,285
Wait just a minute!

381
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,221
What's going on?

382
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,527
Ka. Kazuhiro! Kazuhiro!

383
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:40,799
Why... why...

384
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,736
Tsugumi

385
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,572
why was Kazuhiro killed?!

386
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,708
That's what we're trying to find out...

387
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,310
Maybe that negative is responsible?

388
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,345
Negatives?

389
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:57,015
He was bragging about it...

390
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,885
he said he was going to sell it to a
newspaper company & make a lot of money...

392
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,120
Don't tell me they're gone?!

394
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,557
he didn't have them on him §

395
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:07,325
That can't be...

396
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:13,198
So that means the killer is someone who
knew about the negatives. isn't that right!

398
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,002
Everyone in this business knew about it!

399
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,338
He offered to sell them to a lot
of newspaper companies!

401
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,443
Hey officers... Ohtaka was stabbed once
in the back of the head. wasnHhej?

403
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,144
That's right...

404
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:30,482
Then the killer's a pro! Those 2 are
just camerawomen...

406
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,585
you're barking up
the wrong tree, suspecting them

408
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:38,790
No... with a little medical knowledge.
Anesthetic & a murder weapon

410
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:43,128
anyone could have done it!
Even a woman!

412
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:51,770
Now then. why don't the 4 of you tell us
what you saw when you went to the toilet...

414
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,272
I went to the toilet because I
wasn't feeling well...

416
00:17:55,273 --> 00:18:00,245
but when I got back to my seat
Kazuhiro was still there in his seat!

418
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:05,317
I called the stewardess later
to bring me some medicine

420
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:09,254
That's why I remember it well

421
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,488
Is that true?

422
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:14,559
Yes... he was asleep when I saw him

423
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,996
Yes, I saw her from across the aisle!

424
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:20,832
It looked like she was asking for
ome medicine...!

426
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,868
I went to the toilet right after that,

427
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,372
I was in there for about 5 minutes, I guess

428
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,274
You said across the aisle...

429
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,877
but isn't your seat facing the same
disl Mas the victim's?

431
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:38,116
I get restless thaving to sit still for long
periods of time, so I was walking around

433
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,387
Then when did the victim leave his seat?

434
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:47,258
When I brought the water & pills.
He was already gone...

436
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,896
I don't think it took me more than a
minute to bring them to her...

438
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:55,934
I went to the toilet after Tsugumi
got her medicine

440
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,037
& I guess it was 20 minutes later that

441
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:04,275
I noticed Kazuhiro still hadn't came
back so I went to check...

443
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,612
but he was still alive then.

444
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:14,685
Well, I knocked on this door & asked if he
was alright & he knocked back

446
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,521
Are . ou, surer!

447
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,757
But how did you know it was him?

448
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,158
It had to be!

449
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,996
I opened the other 3
doors & they were unoccupied!!

451
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,932
So he's the only one left...

452
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,135
When did you go to the toilets?

455
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,676
he said, "Unfortunately, don't remember"

456
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,112
I guess it's only natural...

457
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,548
What's wrong?

458
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,785
That man's cologne is so strong...

459
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,521
Oh come on, how much longer are you
going to keep asking

461
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,954
those meaningless questions?

462
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:53,525
Whoever has the weapon is
the killer. righ «

464
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:59,397
Then ..wouldn't it be quicker to do a
search of their things & their bodies?

466
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:05,370
This has nothing to do with me though
since I was asleep & didn't go to the toilet!

468
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,606
You're lying! I saw you leave your seat!!

469
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,674
What?!

470
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,743
Your seat is directly behind the
victim's isn't it!!

472
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,646
What are you talking about?

473
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,948
Remember. I told you when I went to
the toilet,

475
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,884
the victim was still asleep in his seat...

476
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:23,922
Well, I'm positive this man's
eat was empty...!

478
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:29,661
Hey old man. don't lie! You 4 were
the ones who went to the toilet

480
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,663
HE just said so!!

481
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,964
Right. kid?!

482
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,400
Yes... well...

483
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,836
What's the matter. Don't be vague...

484
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:42,774
Now that I think about it. I think
I was distracted for a second...

486
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,846
At any rate, you 5 are considered
suspects so we will search your luggage

488
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,781
& you will undergo a body
check in the toilet!

490
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:59,891
What?! You didn't find the weapon on
them or their luggage?!

492
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:04,262
No! None of them had anything
Iike an icepick!

494
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,531
To be on the safe side, we're searching
places in the plane that

496
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,534
it could be hidden In...

497
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:12,203
Hey! You're positive these people were
the only ones

499
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,439
who went to the toilet. aren't you...

500
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:19,077
Shinichi, answer him
Shinichi!

502
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,517
This is getting interesting!

503
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,687
If they can't find the weapon in the
plane. that means

505
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,357
the killer still has it somewhere!

506
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,860
I'll bet that's the killer's trump card...

507
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:41,166
Il find it... I'll get that trump card...!!

508
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:45,203
Before this huge metal bird
rests its wings!!
