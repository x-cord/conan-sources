Oh, I didn't know.

00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,442
We're terribly sorry.

38
00:02:56,443 --> 00:03:02,781
It's no problem. But it's.true, this place
may be boring for tourists.

40
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,317
That's not true!

41
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:11,257
You-don't see sights like this living
in the city. It cleanses the soul for me.

but very admirable

Count me out!

48
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:25,438
Yqu're very rude dad?Let's go!

49
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,842
This temple was built 400 years ago.

50
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,912
400 years ago? It's very. old.

51
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:37,283
Because of it's ace, there are many
REE Troll SEE Tero,!

53
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:40,820
For example, there is an old
well near the pagoda

55
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:45,424
which had been listed until
the middle of the Edo period.

57
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,426
Why did they stop using it?

58
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,696
It suddenly went dry.

59
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,466
Legend says that a young woman who was

60
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,135
heartbrokenfcried for
3 days in front of the well.

62
00:03:56,136 --> 00:04:00,840
When her tears ran dry. the water from
the well filled her eyes And:it was: used: up.

64
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,809
Hahaha. what*rubbish...

66
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:20,259
There's a frightening legend
behind this pagoda.

68
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,795
What kind of legend?

69
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,566
In the beginninc of the Edo period
there was a young monk

71
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:32,204
who the head priest picked to become
the successor of this temple, but...

73
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:36,408
He fell in love with a girl
from the villnge, broke his vows,

75
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,744
Ieft the temple and ran
away to get married.

78
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,817
perhaps it was a curse. the monk
was taken away by the goshawk.

80
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,888
The monk was later found dead.
Hanging from the pagoda...

82
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,289
How awful.

83
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,759
Tihere'sfmore. in the middle
of the Edo period...

85
00:04:54,327 --> 00:05:00,499
A misguided priest sold the temple's
furnishings and used the money for liquor.

87
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,636
But one day he disappeared...

88
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:09,308
A few daysllater, he was found
dead hanging from the pagoda.

90
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,756
Since then. it's been said that whoever
breaks the vows of the temple will be cursed.

92
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,891
Hey. stop making thosed spoo « fac s.

But tourists are the temple's...

112
00:05:57,257 --> 00:06:01,826
Nonsense! Don't forget there are those who
will desecrate this temple for that very reason!

114
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:03,362

Uh: is:something wrong?

119
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,487
The truth is, a tour company took control
of- this property and

121
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:32,558
they/ve decided to build
an amusement park here

123
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,829
Then this area's going to change?

124
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,433
Yes, the head priest is opposing
it, saying he was tricked

126
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,902
He has become bitter even toward
tourists as you saw

128
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,606
He has some nerve!
Scaring people like that!

130
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,641

Mr. Mouril This way. hurry!

271
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,846
Hold it. I want an explanation!

272
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,449
The ffightening curse has come true!

273
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,292
What curse... he's just reciting the matins!!

274
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,994
What curse..'he's just reciting the matins!!
Matins-moerning prayer

276
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,597
No. there! Over there!

277
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,540
Mr. Odal!

278
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,944
It's the curse!!!

279
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,124
The crime lab is done
with their investigation...

281
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,595
so the body will be lowered now

282
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,264
How does it look?
Belet
Shizuoka Pr

285
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,733
The victim was found with the
rope tied to the railing,
Shizuoka Pr

288
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,534
The victimrwas found with the
rope. tied to the railing.

290
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:27,606
The other end was swung over the
edge of the roof and around the neck.

292
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:32,878
He has been tentatively identified as
HideakFOch. manager of a tour company.

294
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,149
A private investigator who knows him
I's going up thereto make a positve ID.

296
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,418
Private investiga or? What's the name?

297
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,887
It's me. Detective Yokomizo.

298
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:48,159
WAH RE adMe. Mourilall's been
along timell Why ares ou here?

300
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,162
It just turned out this way

301
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,899
To come straight to the point.
What do you think about this case?

303
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,835
From the evidence. it looks
Iike suicide but .

305
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,541
Well, the circumstances are strange
but it's definitely not murder!

307
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:06,278
What makes you say that

308
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:09,047
be able to carry him all the way up there!

309
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,150
And even If the killer
managed to carry him up

311
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,922
the width of the stairwell is very narrow,
just enough for 1 adult to pass!

313
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,791
It's possible to drag him up but.

314
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,061
His clothes would get torn
and the body would get bruised!

316
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:26,465
And I didn't notice any of those
things just now!

318
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:32,337
I see! You've deducted so much already!
But why did he pick such a place...

320
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:37,142
A.little more, more... that's it, STOP!

321
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,142
A_little more, more... that's it, STOP

322
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:48,386
This is a new mark...
wonder how it got here?

324
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,725
Huh!? Te rope's new but
it's frayed in some places...

326
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,393
What is it?

327
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,197
How're we going to get him down?
He doesn't reach the railing!

329
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,002
That's not possible. right? If his feel doesn't
reach the railing, (he cant commit suicide)

331
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:08,006
Hey you kid! What are you
doing here! Get down!

333
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:13,879
Uh: I was lookifg Tt the-toilet:
and} got lost...it's not herg, is it

335
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,082
That's strange...l wonder where it is

336
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,752
Who was that kid?
Beats me.,

338
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:26,625
According to the crime lab there
wasn't much dust inside the pagoda

340
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,628
so they couldn't find the victim's foot prints)

341
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:35,233
And we had the.town:doctor dO an autopsy.
He didn't find any external injuries.

343
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,170
The cause of death w s determined to be
suffocation due to pressure on.the neck.

345
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:42,507
Meaning the direct cause of death
Wks [on Inestinge ling.) oo

347
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,579
The estimated time of death is
somewhere between 3 and 4 AM.

349
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,918
Mr Oda was using a suite in- his
hotel as hist office;and home but

351
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:57,455
the front clerk said he saw Mr. Oda
Ieave the hotel at about:2:30 AM

353
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,594
Judging by the time, I think it's safe
to assume he came straight here.

355
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,931
Any will?
We haven't found one yet!

357
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,399
Mr. Odal

358
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,839
Mr. Oda! Why did you kill yourself?

359
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,242
You should have waited, just a little longer...

360
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,311
Excuse me, who are you?

361
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,383
I am employed as the general manager
of Hotel Oda. My name is Kajimura.

363
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:29,387
It seems you weren't here last night?

364
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,389
No I had a sudden business trip...

365
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,861
Do you know of any reason why
he would commit suicide?

367
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,799
The truth 1s. the purpose of.my
business trip was to raise funds...

369
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,539
If I failed, the checks the firm
wrote this month would bounce

371
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:53,211
wasn't the only one... Mr. Oda was also
very worried about that...

373
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,282
But he was carrying so much
money on him last night.

375
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:02,120
Mr. Oda had a lot of pride, he never
showed his weaknesses to anyone

377
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,656
and of course. he always
put on 1 bold front

379
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:12,063
But last night, when he was threatened
to be taken to court by the temple,

381
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,065
he seemed very concerned.

382
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,733
Look at this]

383
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:18,870
He doesn't have his wallet!

384
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,538
Wallet?

385
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,608
There was no wallet in his possession.

386
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:28,146
Isn't that strance? He didn't
change his clothes

388
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,949
but the wallet he had
with him last night is gone!

390
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,154
Who carries a lot of money on them
when they're committing suicide!

392
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,192
Don't wander around the scene,
Hm alwaysitelling you that!

394
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,262
Uh, but his tie pin's gone tool

395
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,403
Are you alright? You mustn't
interfere with the police work.

397
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,673
Mr Mouri, about the tie pin,
what's he talking about?

399
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:57,409
Mr Oda had it on last night.

400
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,748
The huge 5 carat diamond tie pin
IS indeed missing!

402
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:09,020
Which means he could have been robbed!

403
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:13,291
Even if he was robbed. he was on
his way to commit suicide,

405
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:16,560
he probably gave up his
valuables very easily)

407
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:21,232
So it doesn't refute the suicide theory at all! £

408
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:27,238
If he was strangled. he would struggle
trying to get free and scratch

410
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,977
his own throat with his fingernails!
But there are no traces of that!

412
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:37,147
And even if this was a murder,
how would the killer,

414
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:41,353
hang the victim from the top
of the pagoda

416
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:45,022
Aside from suicide? it is
physically:impossible!!

418
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,628
If there was a killer, though
it'd be that curse.

420
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,697
It's a curse!

421
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,435
Heavempunished the unbelieverl"!

422
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,306
I am Detective Yokomizo of thee
Shizuoka Prefecturall Police.

424
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,308
May I ask who you are?

425
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:08,980
Humph! Can't you tell by looking?! I am
Tankai, the head priest of this temple

427
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,249
Hm his son. Shunkan

428
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,052
I am Okabe, the sexton.

429
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:20,525
Can you all tell me where
you were between 3 and 4 AM?

431
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,396
What is the meaning of this!?
Wasn't this Ya suicide?

433
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:27,065
No. we haven't.reached a decision.

434
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:31,403
And since some of Mr..Oda's
valuables;are:missing...

436
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:36,941
What did you say!? Are you accusing us
men serving Buddha, of thievery?!

438
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:42,213
Oh. no. we just need your
alibis for our records...

440
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,952
You'd probably be happy if I said
I was meeting with that no good liar

442
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,222
but I was in the main hall
chanting at that time!!

444
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,627
Chanting!? You were chanting
at that time of night?

446
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:00,365
I had a premonition that the
curse would come true!!

448
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:04,102
I see. curse: yoursay?

449
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,237
And what about:you:sShunkai?

450
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:09,908
I was asleep! Although I got up at 51

451
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:13,912
Then Mr. Okabe came with the
news that Mr. Och was dead!

453
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:19,517
I was so shocked I called
Mr. Mouri right away!

455
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:24,122
I see...why did you call Mr. Mouri
first and not the police?

457
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:30,462
This man's Oda's spy! He was the
one who introduced me to Oda!

459
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:36,668
Tankai! Oda told me he wanted to help
the temple by increasing tourists!

461
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,337
He lied to me too!

462
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,005
You too?

463
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:45,677
It seems the head priest here was deceived
and got the deed to the temple taken.

465
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:49,481
So there are 3 people
who hated Mr. Oda!

467
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,151
So what if we did hate him?

468
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:58,289
That private investigator said there's no way
that suicide theory can be disproved

470
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,560
And in a suicide, there is no killer, is there?

471
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:06,631
Well, we haven't concluded it as a suicide...

472
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,767
« Then make a decision and
get off of this property!

474
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:14,372
I can no longer tolerate having these sacred
grounds trampled by those who are impure!

476
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:19,711
Mr. Oda's wallet and tie pin
are .indeed. missing

478
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:23,581
but from how things look, suicide
seems to be thewronly answer!

480
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:27,585
But something isn't right!

481
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,459
His elbow's dirty.

482
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,598
It's grass. did he fall
and hit his elbow?

485
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:48,272
There's dirt on both heels!

486
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,608
Why is there dirt there?!

487
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,144
Wait a minute!

488
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,214
If you look closely. you can see °
this rope's, Charred!

490
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,883
Maybe!

493
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,559
There it is! The tie pin!

494
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,695
There's no mistake! This is where
it really happened!

496
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,770
WW" theory is correct...
Mr. Oda didn't commit suicide!

498
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:20,972
He was murdered]

499
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:28,179
And the killer as the person
who said what he did, it's him!
