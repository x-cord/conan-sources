1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,235
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,703
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,771
deductions take all shapes and styles
In each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,178
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,412
A child in appearance wtih the I.Q. of an adult,

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,681
no case is left unsolved
when Detective Conan comes to the scene.

10
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,915
MURDER ON THE 5.5. SYMPHONY
20 YEAR VENDETTA

13
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:56,682
- J At, TN

15
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:03,155
I would never have thought Hattori.
That. you were interested in dolphins!

17
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,291
Rolwins (dolphins)?

18
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:09,962
Yes, didn't you come here after
reading the ad in the newspaper?

20
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:14,900
Nope! No way! I'm here
because I got a strange letter!

22
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,501
A strange letter.

23
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:19,839
Yeah, about a week ago...
I received a letter saying

25
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,775
someone wanted to hire me
so I was to go to Ogasawara...

27
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,947
There was 100,000 yen
in there for my fee...

29
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,148
100,000 yen?

30
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,084
That's right, but you know
it was pretty weird,

32
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:36,222
all the bills were the old design,
and there was no return address.

34
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,456
What about a name?

35
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,359
Masaru Furukawa was written.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,494
Furukawa?!

37
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,162
Oh, so you know who he is?

39
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,997
What are you talking about,

40
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,868
«<P»
Furukawa is the name of the man
who planned this whole tour!

43
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,836
Is that so? I had no idea.

44
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,173
The letter told me I'd be able to get
aboard if I showed the bill at the gate

46
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,274
that's all...

47
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,944
So Heiji, you were invited on board
to work as a private investigator...

49
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,648
I've never taken a job
where I got paid first so

51
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:06,251
I intended to return the money
personally, that's why I got on board...

53
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,988
Besides, I was pretty interested in
what kind of case it was...

55
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,489
But what a coincedence!

56
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,757
Here we are, all on the same ship!

57
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:16,195
Actually, I called you when
I got to Haneda Airport

59
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,499
I thought I'd ask Kudo... I mean
r. Mouri to come with me...

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,069
But...no one answered the phone...

62
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,805
We must have just left

63
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,974
Butlhere we are anyway...
That's why they say

65
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,212
monkeys will attract monkeys and private
investigators will attract their lot too, huh!

67
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,780
Right, kiddo!

68
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,584
So you're the other private investigator?

69
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,920
You're awfully young...

70
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:41,921
That ll am!

71
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:45,157
And so, have you found that
so called Saizo Kano fellow?

73
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,493
No, I think they're still looking for him

74
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:49,528
Here...

75
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:50,129
Here...

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,433
You want to use this?

77
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,470
Thanks, I appreciate it...

78
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:58,737
No problem, just ask...

79
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,310
Hey, why don't we all play some poker?
We can go to the lounge over there

81
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,512
Good idea, but what about cards?

82
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:10,116
Don't worry, I brought a deck with me.

83
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,284
How about you fellows?

84
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,720
You look like you need
some entertainment.

86
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,023
Find him?

87
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,325
No...he isn't anywhere!

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,962
Ats... where'd he disappear to

89
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:26,665
We have less than a hour...

90
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,400
Mourl...

91
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,268
Yes!

92
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,604
I'm not giving up...

93
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,641
not on this case, not until
the very last second...

95
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,043
I swear!!

96
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,414
Superintendent Samezaki!

97
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,116
Let's search one more time!!

98
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,484
Yes, you're right,

99
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,354
Iet's go over the ship one more time
Mouri, from top to bottom!

101
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:49,221
Ro er!

103
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:50,756
Tada!

104
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,025
Full house

105
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,795
Good grief, you won again...

106
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,497
Alright! Alright!
After the next game,

108
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,833
whoever has the lowest score will
change places with Mr. Kujirai.

110
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,869
Excuse me,

111
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,838
do you know what time it is?

112
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,507
Yes, it's 11:55 pm.

113
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:12,311
You've been asking
the time so many times,

115
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,346
are you expecting something?

116
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,450
It's just that tomorrow's...
a very special day...

118
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,153
There, 2 pairs, aces & nines

119
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,790
I'm the loser...

120
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,225
Alright, Mr. Kujira's turn up next.

121
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,329
Alright now girlie, be gentle with me.

122
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,305
Hey, when you said tomorrow's
a special day, did you mean

124
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,740
The anniversary of your girlfriend's death?

126
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,677
Your cocktail

127
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:46,912
It's a Bloody Mary, isn't it?

128
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,917
Don't tell me it's the day a Princess
you adored passed away...

130
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,853
Oh..no...nothing like that

131
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,225
Dad!

132
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,492
Did you find him?

133
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,929
He's nowhere to be found...

134
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,032
Where's the former
superintendent of Police?

136
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,169
He says he'll search until time's up...

137
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,771
Would you like something to drink?

138
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:14,439
Water...

139
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,007
Yes sir...

140
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,210
I guess... I'll be calling it quits soon...

141
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,846
That's it for me too

142
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,947
Yeah, me too...

143
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:26,685
Alright then, after we're done, I'll fix the
cards and bring them to your room later.

145
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,188
I'd appreciate that...

146
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,624
How much us my bar tab?

147
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,758
Let's see...
you had 2 martinis...

149
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,993
I'll pay my bill too

150
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,262
Oh..no...my wallet's...

151
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,431
Could this be yours?

152
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,933
Yes it is...that's mine

153
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,569
It was on the floor in the
corridor so I picked it up!

155
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,239
Oh come on. I haven't taken anything!

156
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:51,010
S..sorry...but I just want to be sure...

157
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,415
Are you quitting too, Mr. Kujirai?

158
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,951
Oh no, I'm just going to
the restroom, let's take a break...

160
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,220
I'll be back soon.

161
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,481
Time's run out...

162
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,718
we can't touch that case now...

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,258
But then since I retired 2 years ago,
I have no authority anyway

165
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,794
Superintendent...

166
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,963
Can I still eta drink?

168
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,999
Sure, no problem.

169
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,068
Give me a beer.

170
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,336
Yes, Sir.

171
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,478
You did your best, sir.

172
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,914
Mourt...

173
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,917
Come on Mouri, let's drink up!!

174
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,086
Alright! I'm with you all the way!

175
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,321
Ahahaha, the drinks are on me!

176
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,989
Gee, that's generous of you!

177
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,027
I realize it was his case but isn't
he taking it a little too personal?

179
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,235
What was that sound?!

180
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,038
It came from outside...the upper deck!

181
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,206
A gunshot!?

182
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,941
Mouri! What time is it?!

183
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,209
12:08 am!

184
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,220
The flag!!

185
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,689
The flag's burning...

186
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,592
Hey, what was that?

187
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,494
It sounded like fireworks...

188
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:52,531
Hey Kudo, do you think
this just some prank?

190
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,067
CL Look at that, Hatto

191
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,235
What?!

192
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,103
What is this??

193
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,706
Something's written on it!

194
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,642
Don't touch the knife!

195
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,678
Who're you talking to! I'm no amateur!

196
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,815
Excuse me, go get me a plastic bag.

197
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:10,716
Yes, sir!

198
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,653
Do you always carry those things around?

199
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,388
Old habits are hard to break!

200
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,924
What's written on it?

201
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,361
Poseidon, the God of the Sea

202
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:26,031
gave me life, thusmy
shadow is resurrected.

204
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,366
Oh... no..."

205
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:29,668
Mr. Kujirai?

206
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,904
E...he's alive...

207
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,505
I knew it...the guys's...

208
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:36,608
he's...

209
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,412
Alive!!

210
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,015
What is that?

211
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,985
Captain! Explosion on the stern!

212
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,854
Stop all engines! Extinguish the flames!

213
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,122
Stop all engines!

214
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,991
Hat happened?!

215
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,027
There was an explosion
at the stern this time!

217
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:55,527
What?!

218
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,596
What's on fire?

219
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,067
This is the box the emergency
escape ladder is kept it.

221
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,070
But why... would anyone do this...

222
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,440
A body!

223
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,243
Somebody's being burned!!

224
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,118
It's burnt to a crisp...

225
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,824
It's so bad we determine the time
of death or identify the victim.

227
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,627
Uh...it's possible the victim is Saizo Kano,

228
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,564
the man who disappeared from
the ship what do you think...

230
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,901
We can't say for sure until we do
a thorough investigation

232
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:38,470
I think it could be Mr. Kanie.

233
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,104
Huh?

234
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,706
There, look.

235
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,207
The wristwatch he's wearing.

236
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:49,147
When I asked him for the time, I'm
pretty sure that was the watch he had on...

238
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,082
Now that you mention it...

239
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:56,355
although it's badly burned, that
Iooks like the sweater he was wearing...

241
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,825
Those slacks look like
the ones he was wearing.

243
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,260
How awful...

244
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,262
why would anyone kill Mr. Kanie...

245
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,298
It's pretty funny though...

246
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,033
Funny?

247
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,003
Just look at him, looks how he's posed...

248
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,240
His upper body and his arm is raised,

249
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,776
It looks like he's delibertely
tryng to show us his watch.

251
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,845
Aha...let me explain!

252
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,380
It's heat stiffening!

253
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,248
When a body Is burning...

254
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,486
the heat causes the skeletal
muscles to coagulate and shrink

256
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,421
Heat Stiffening
the result IS heat stiffening!

258
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:33,225
Heat Stiffening
there are more muslces to bend the
arms and legs rather than stretch them.

261
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,928
And the joints begin to bend halfway

262
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,433
and the result is, the body looks like
it's in a boxer's fighting position

264
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,237
So you see, the body gets into
that position quite naturally!

266
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,839
Wow, I didn't know that...

267
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,244
But the important question is
his watchband.

269
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,077
Watchband?

270
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,846
What about it?

271
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,917
Take a good look, it's unbuckled, isn't it?

272
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:03,021
That doesn't mean anything
see the can near the victim's feet?

274
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:08,560
That explosion was probably
set off with the gasoline in this can...

276
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,896
The explosion was powerful enough

277
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,098
to destroy the can it probably
blew the watch loose

279
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,766
You're probably right...

280
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,937
it was must've also blown
the plastic sheet off.

282
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,305
Plastic sheet?

283
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:24,976
Yes...when the Superintendent and I
came here looking for Kano,

285
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,678
it was on the box...

286
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,313
Just like that one.

287
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,485
And then? You did look
inside the box, didn't you?

289
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,087
No, as you can see

290
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:40,125
the box is tied securely from the outside,
I didn't think anyone could hide inside.

292
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:44,630
Besides, no one was inside the box...

293
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:49,234
when I got back to the lounge,
Mr. Kanie was still there.

295
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,169
Hey... Mouri...

296
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,072
Who is that smart aleck kid?

297
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,475
His name's Heiji Hattori.

298
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,212
His father's the Chief of Police of
the Osaka Metropolitan Police.

300
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,547
You mean, he's Heizo's kid?

301
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,183
No wonder he knows so much...

302
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,686
So you know the Chief of Police...

303
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,657
Yes, during Kendo practice we
sparred with each other quite often.

305
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,292
But I was no match for him.

306
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:15,861
Hey Hattor!.

307
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:16,762
Huh?

308
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,399
Look at that strange thing on his face.

309
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,200
What?!

310
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:25,671
Why this is?!

311
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:27,272
It's silicone!

312
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,243
Yes, the material is
polygemethylcyclosun...

314
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,211
commonly known as silicone!

315
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,580
The fire warped it but these things are

316
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,517
widely used in plastic surgery to
heighten the bridge of the nose

318
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,587
So that means this fellow
had changed his looks.

320
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,524
Yes, I'm sure about it!!

321
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,759
Excuse me!

322
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,195
We'll cover him with this.

323
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,566
Why would he have plastic surgery?

324
00:13:55,134 --> 00:14:00,505
Well...maybe he's 1 of the 4 who
pulled off 400 million yen robbery

326
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,141
he could've been part of the gang.

327
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,845
If the victim really is Mr. Kanie...

328
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,048
then there's a strong possibility
Mr. Kameda is also part of the gang,

330
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,717
they seemed to get along so well.

331
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,287
It seemed like this was a get-together
between friends who'd had plastic surgery

333
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,421
and hadn't seen each other since then...

334
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,624
Which means the other partner is...

335
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,560
could be Kujiral,

336
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:24,963
he seemed so interested in the case
and he looks very nervous...

338
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,965
he seems a likely candidate...

339
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,333
You may be right...

340
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:33,438
He acted a little strange when
Mr. Kanie gave him his lighter...

342
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,639
And another thing bothers me...

343
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,511
it's what he shouted on the upper deck...

344
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,513
he's alive...

345
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:46,718
Il Knew it... he's... alive...!

346
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,356
It was so obvious, he panicked
when he saw the knife through the bill!

348
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,826
The writing on the bill said...

349
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,629
Poseidon the God of the Sea
gave me back my life,

351
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,231
thus the shadow is resurrected...

352
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,870
The "shadow" is referring to Saizo Kano,
the Mastermind in the shadows and

354
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,374
resurrected means he
was once killed somewhere!

356
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:15,313
He was probably killed by his
3 partners in that robbery...

358
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,218
and then he took on the identity
of the mysterious old man.

360
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,288
But I don't understand...

361
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,892
not just about the identity of the old man
who disappeared from the ship...

363
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,896
but why do all 3 of the men involved in
the robbery have to be on the same ship

365
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,464
on the day the statute of
Iimitations runs out?

367
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,633
And putting out that strange ad to boot...

368
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:39,671
And I'm curious about that fellow
Masaru Furukawa who put out that ad...

370
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:43,675
Is that the real name of
one of the robbers... or is it...

372
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,712
Anyway, that old man holds
he key to the mystery...

374
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,982
I'll bet we'll find a lot of skeletons
when we rattle the closet.

376
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,950
That's for sure...

377
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,153
What? You don't remember?!

378
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,888
I hear you very clearly!

379
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,392
Back on the deck, you said
I knew it, he's alive.

381
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,794
Did I say that?

382
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,962
Don't play games with me!

383
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,299
Come on, tell the truth, you'll feel better...

384
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,304
You meant Saizo Kano, didn't you?

386
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,508
on NOW... on now any Ing...

387
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,044
I really don't...

388
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,513
We re not getting anywhere...

389
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,448
Superintendent!

390
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,318
I've talked to the crew members!

391
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,385
And, how did it go?

392
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:33,058
All their alibis check out...at the time of
the explosion, excluding us passengers,

394
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:39,364
all the crew members, including the
Captain were always working in a group

396
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:44,169
And since the explosion took place after
we heard what sounded like a gunshot

398
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,272
and ran up to the upper deck,
It means the only person

400
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,775
capable of starting the fire is someone
who wasn't with us on the deck...

402
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:56,681
So it must be Saizo Kano,
he's the only one we can't account for...

404
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,750
No, there's one other person, isn't there?

405
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,051
You know...

406
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:04,322
Mr. Kameda, he went back to his cabin
because he wasn't feeling well...

408
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,725
No one's seen him since...

409
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,460
Not that you mentioned it...

410
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,397
Well go to his cabin right now
and bring him here!!

412
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,832
Yes sir!

413
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,001
I'm going with him!

414
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:16,835
Me too.

415
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,370
Hey...come back here!

416
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:19,871
Wait for me!

417
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,139
I'm going with you!

418
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,379
Yes...l understand...

419
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,447
I'll see you there then...

420
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,116
roger and out!

421
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,252
Continue on to Ogasawara!

422
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,521
Aren't we turning back, Captain?

423
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,257
No, they're sending a helicopter
out first thing in the morning.

425
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,361
Our ship is loaded with cargo
they need on the island.

427
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,132
And as soon as they're ready, the Coast
Guard will also send their boat out

429
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,802
so until help arrives, those detectives
will have to do their best...

431
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,772
Start engines, raise speed up to 20 knots.

432
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,975
Start engines!

433
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,880
Mr. Kameda.

434
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,416
Mr. Kameda?

435
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,886
Seems he's not in.
Go borrow the master key again...

437
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,655
Oh? It's not locked.

438
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,626
Mr. Kameda? I'm coming in!

439
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,296
What's this?

440
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,231
It looks like no one's in...

441
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:27,172
If so, we'd better hurry and report this
to Mr. Samezaki... .Isnrt that'right=Heiji'...

443
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,944
Hey, where are you?

444
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,914
Conan?

445
00:19:15,186 --> 00:19:16,820
How'd it go! You find anything?

446
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,395
Yeah, in the engine room below.

447
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:27,365
There was a little blood on the floor and
I found empty shell casings

449
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,901
And this strange letter...

450
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,971
I found a suspicious piece of paper too.

451
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,206
It was crushed up and
thrown away though.

453
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,674
Where'd you find it?

454
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,676
You know the restroom at the
entrance to the restaurant?

456
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,578
It was In the trash can inside.

457
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,280
Inside the trash can in the restroom?

458
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,618
And then? What does the letter say?

459
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,654
Waiting in the engine room.
Masaru Furukawa"

461
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,589
Masaru Furukawa again.

462
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,660
Blood stains and an empty shell casing...

463
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,801
There it is! One shot to the temple!

464
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,403
There's no doubt about it,
it's a gunshot wound!

466
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,842
The victim came to the
engine room because of this letter...

468
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:14,913
And...he was shot in the head
then put inside the box...

470
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,714
Yes...ll think that's reasonably correct.

471
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:22,220
What about that piece
of paper you found?

473
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,323
It was probably written on the
same word processor as yours

475
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,328
Meet me at the stern. Masaru Furukawa"

476
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,766
this is proof that someone
Iured that fellow Mr. Kujirai out!

478
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,136
How do you know it was Mr. Kujirai?

479
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,538
Two of the crew members saw him...

480
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,209
It was past midnight, that guy looked scared

481
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,078
He was yelling "Hey, I'm here!

482
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,849
And when the crew man called out
to him the fellow got shook up

484
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,385
Please don't tell anyone you say me here!

485
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,290
That's what he said then it seems he went
back to the lounge where we all were...

487
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,195
Those crew men thought someone might
show up there so they kept watch but

489
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,531
no one came. And just when they
were about to return to their posts

491
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,668
they said they heard
gunshots from the upper deck...

493
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:14,072
And was that box burning?

494
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,807
Of course not!

495
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,677
And there didn't seem to be
any timing device either...

497
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,848
What this means is, the killer fired
a shot on the upper deck then

499
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,418
set the flag on fire and when he saw
everyone was on the upper deck,

501
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,121
he shuck down here
and set the box on fire...

503
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,326
If that's true, then Mr. Kujirai's
fear is understandable...

505
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:36,661
Yes...

506
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,865
after all, if he was unlucky, he'd
been killed and set on fire here too...

508
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,302
One problem remains,

509
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,372
is it possible for the killer to fire
the shot on the upper deck then

511
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:51,342
come here without
being seen by anyone?

513
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:56,781
Well, I have an idea who the killer is,
and in time I'll be able to prove it

515
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,284
You've figured it out too?

516
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,853
You mean you have too?

517
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,356
Then shall we compare notes?

518
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,732
First, the mysterious old man
calling himself Saizo Kano

520
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,570
Like you said...he left the ship

521
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:25,076
and no one noticed that he returned,
but somehow he was on board, then...

523
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,712
That's a trick set up by the killer...

524
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,147
a fake!!

525
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,587
There are only two people
who could've done it...

527
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,522
That's right! What we have to
Iook at very carefully here is...

529
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,860
The heat stiffened body's elbows
were:in frontlofihis face and

531
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,863
the fact that his knees
were completely bent!

533
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:52,036
It proves both arms were raised when
the body was put in the box and shifted!

535
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,772
Only one person had
a reason for doing that!

537
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,642
But that too was a ruse!

538
00:22:57,643 --> 00:23:02,079
The real killer faked his death and
Is still hiding somewhere on this ship.

540
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,750
Huh? What are you talking about?

541
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,187
Look at this! This watch us the proof!

542
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,824
Hat are YOU talking about?
That's the killer's trump card...

544
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,293
Hmmm, this is very interesting...

545
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,131
How unusual, our
deductions aren't the same...

547
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,870
Yeah... this has only
happened once, when we first met.

549
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,308
Alright then

550
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:32,610
Let's see whose deduction is correct...

551
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,346
Shall we make a contest of this?!

552
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,748
Hey!...Wait up!

553
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,017
Oh...I almost forgot!
Fix that watch, will ya!

556
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:43,320
Are you telling me to get this
burnt up watch moving again?

558
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:45,089
Of course not!

559
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,625
Silly! I mean put it back
where it came from

561
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,328
Oh... I see...

562
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,066
What?! Kameda wasn't in his cabin,
Is that what you're saying?!

565
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,569
we looked for him for awhile but...

566
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,671
You fool!

567
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:02,106
I don't know so many
people can just disappear!!

569
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,375
Outta my way!! I'll look for him!

570
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,449
I'm off to search for him too...

571
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,752
so I'd like all of you to wait
here for just a little longer...

573
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,420
I refuse!

574
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:16,988
You're a private detective

575
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,791
and the other man's a former
police officer, isn't that right?

577
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:25,363
I don't think either of you have
any right to keep us here.

579
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,531
B...but, listen...

580
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:30,468
Sorry but I'm going
back to my room and rest.

582
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,070
Is\m going too.

583
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:33,838
MM. me too...

584
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,373
Wait...come back here!

585
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,541
You should't move!

586
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,677
No need to worry.

587
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,581
We can take care of ourselves.

588
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,049
Right?

589
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:45,650
Of course...

590
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,326
It has to be here!

591
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,096
If my deduction is right...

592
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:03,368
there has to be a place someone can
hide without being discovered...

594
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:04,935
Huh?

595
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:09,240
It...can't be...

596
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,777
A good hiding place?

597
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,814
Yes, you have an idea don't you?
Some place that you usually can't get into

599
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,150
You know, some place that's off limits!

600
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:24,122
You little troublemaker! There's a
killer on board and you go galivanting!

602
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:25,790
Hey...

603
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:28,226
Where's Heiji

604
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,428
H?... ..You didn't run into hi

605
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:35,833
it's wrong!!

606
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,001
It's wrong!!

607
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,204
Kudo and I were both wrong!

608
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:44,909
Captain!

609
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,545
The ship's route is clear
for the next 30 kilometers!

611
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:48,780
Good!

612
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:50,748
Raise speed up to 293 points!

613
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:51,783
30 knots!

614
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,951
Speed to 30 knots!

615
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,425
Alright then, who?!

616
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,928
Who is the real killer?!

617
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,245
Hey, didn't you hear
a strange water noise?

619
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,113
Huh?

620
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,647
Strange water noise?

621
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,951
A bonito probably jumped.
