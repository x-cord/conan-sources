00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,540
Oh! But. ho...

298
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,074
Oh! But he...

299
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:55,343
was holding a dead parakeet in his hand.

300
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,611
What?!

301
00:09:56,612 --> 00:10:00,148
And, he sud to give him 1 parakeet
just hike the one he was holding

303
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,417
He scemad to He wa rush Lo.

304
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:07,922
It" so shocking that
Chicchi was already dead...

306
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:11,558
Um. but Yuka said that thebird greeted
her in good health this morning and

308
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,961
said "Good morning didn't she?

309
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:16,630
Yes... Which means
the bird didn't die of an illness

311
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:20,969
Besides, it was in a cage so
it couldn't have died accidentally either...

313
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,472
Could it be that the man killed it?

314
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:28,143
Butiif he rushed to go buy
another parakeet after what happened.

316
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:30,945
We 1t least know that
he didn't do it on purpose.

318
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,915
Then. he mistakenly killed WW?

320
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:40,654
Huh? What kind of work?

321
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:41,755
Sos.

322
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:45,293
Mr Sakaguchi mentioned that he 1s working
at the research lab at Beika University

324
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:46,561
didn't he?

325
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,331
I was just wondoring
what kind of research he was doing...

328
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:53,368
Well don't renllyknow, but I think
he's researching some kind of dru yy.

330
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:54,836
WOW)

331
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:58,707
But. it.it can't be!

332
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,643
But...I'm sure it was some kind of drug...

333
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:02,143
Agh! Conan.

334
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:03,010
Doe you have a relative
by the name of Kithdar?
Ag onan

338
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,246
Do you have a relative
by the name of Kitada?
Agh! Don't, Ayumi!

342
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:05,714
Do you have a relative
by the name of Kitada?
Huh?!

345
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,281
Huh?!

346
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:10,051
Well. because he always gets tho credit.

347
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:13,555
So. this time. let's solve the truth ourselves.

348
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,889
B.But...

349
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,725
Oka. . Ayumi?

350
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,259

352
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,049

355
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:46,421
We're sorry!

356
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:50,592
Is your resoarch lab in here?

357
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,327
Yep. it is...

358
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:54,596
May we see it?

359
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:56,564
Ou can't.

360
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,032
Why not?

362
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:00,902
Boecause there are many
dangerous chemicals inside.

364
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,370
Dangerous chemicals?

365
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,105
Just as we thought!

366
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,707
Actually
we went to the pet shop yesterday...

368
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,042
Actually .
We went to thejpet shop yesterday...

370
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,144
Huh?

371
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:14,883
The employee told us everything
Will you plbase explain the situation?

373
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,392
Lil-m sorry...l lied yesterday...

374
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:29,731
The facts, when I got to Yuk's house,
Chicchi'was dead in the cage...

377
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,803
Yuka real ytook good care of Chicchl

378
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:37,038
sO I thought she'd be sad of
she-came back and found out.

380
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,874
That's why I rushed over to the, pet shop
- andsbought a parakeet

383
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,976
tht looks just like Chicchi that
perches on'hands at the pet shop.

385
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:46,147
Then,
what did you do with Chicchi that died ?

387
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:51,586
After I left Yuk1's house at sundown,
I buried it in a park nearby.

389
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,858
Would you please take us there?

391
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:57,892
Huh?!

392
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:00,595
We'd like to offer our prayers

393
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:01,863
Yeah

395
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,199
I rom Tow? Well

396
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,201
You can't take us?

397
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,236
I'm in the midst of amexperiment right now.

398
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,904
[Warmth mm:

Plik Al

407
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:17,245
There's something suspicious about him.

408
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,815
There's no doubt that
he's the one who killed Chicchi!

410
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:24,719
But... I wonder what he: did-te Kill it?

411
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,255
Thank you very much.

413
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:33,161
Pals
Hmm. isn't it thisrway?

416
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:37,799
He probably mistakenly spilled the chemical

Maybe it was an. aerosolized-toxin!

431
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,846
Huh?

432
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:56,050
What's that air something about?

433
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,286
Aerosolized toxin. Genta! In other words.

The parakeet inh1lod the. vapor of a
poison thathe mistakenly spilled!

If this is what happened,
everything falls into place!

If this as what happened.
Everything falls into: placer:

442
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:10,698
Huh?!

443
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:15,820
Mr Sakaguchi opened the
windows and door of Yuka's'house

445
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:21,109
because he thought that. . the vaporized
poison may still be left"in thezair...

447
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,780
His eyes were bloodshot and
he was coughing because

449
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,717
he inhaled the vaporized poison by mistake

450
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:33,221
hat's why-he stayed away from us.

451
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:36,357
That is, he'stayed away from he place
he:spilled the poison!

453
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:40,028

Oh? Well,

509
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:03,911
Okay! Sure.

510
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:09,484
The point is why Mr. Sakaguchi
brought the poison to Yuka's house.

512
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:12,420
Don't tell me that he wns trying te
poison Yuka orthcramother

514
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:16,824
I don't want to think that way,.

The soy sauce container-fell.

Shoots!

538

Huh? Don't tell me he put it in there 2!

539
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,213
That's why Mr Sakaguchi refused to
have hand wrapped sushi together

541
00:17:12,214 --> 00:17:13,281
with them tonight!

542
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,382

00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,512
T. They're alive.

571
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:19,597
Huh?!

572
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:20,615
I.I'm so glad.

573
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:21,816
Whaaaan!
I.I'm so glad.

575
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:22,784
Whaaaan!

576
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,153
Whaaaan!
What's the matter everybody?

578
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:29,290
D.Don't use that soy sauce! It is poisoned

581
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,125
Poi...son?

582
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,395
What-re you talking about?

583
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:38,132
It's not poisoned
We-re already usi g it and eat ng.

585
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,400
Huh?

586
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:44,605
Yes!

587
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,375
Oh...Conan!

588
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,310
Agh...

590
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,346
Mr. Sakaguchi...

591
00:18:52,347 --> 00:18:52,680
Mr. Sakaguchi...

592
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,385
Just as I thought.

593
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,253
I thought this is what you guys were up to!

594
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,956
Conan. what brings you here?

596
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:06,828
Based on your appearance. you look like
your deduction is messed up.

599
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:13,968
Then, is it true that when Mr Sakaguchi
came here, Chicohr was dead?

602
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:18,573
Yoah Very ofton hittlo birds peck on food
until just before they die.

605
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:22,143
and act healthy trying to hide
the fact that they are ill.

608
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,177
Why /

611
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:25,579
When living in flocks. if they display
any signs of being weak from an illness

614
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,085
They ma. become rey to an enemy
and: lose their life. right?

616
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,187
Even If the parakeet is
tame enough to perch on fingers

618
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,589
it has rem ning instincts of
when it used to be in the wild

620
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,008
I see.

621
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,562
That's why it was saying "Good morning
healthily hike always until yesterday morning

623
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:43,731
But,
there were signs of an upcoming illness.

625
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:48,736
Tho core of male parakeots scom to change
from blue to brown when they get sick.

627
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:55,643
Right. Chicchi's cére became brown
because he wasn't in good health.

629
00:19:55,644 --> 00:19:57,645
I didn't know that.

630
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:01,682
So, Mr. Snkwgucfni (indnélqaouffitvzor
have bloodshot cyes because...

632
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,951
he inhaled poison

633
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:08,122
No. Mr Sakaguch really had a cold

634
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:13,194
He hadnititaken a bath for three days.
So. he thought that he "had: bod. odor...

636
00:20:13,195 --> 00:20:15,630
That's why he opened
the windows and doors to keep the smell

638
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,565
from onvoloping tho room...

639
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:19,133
Moreover. that's the very reason why

640
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,335
he was standing some distance away"
from Yuka after she came home.

642
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:26,207
She's a girl So. I thought
she'd dislike me even more if I smelled...

644
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,011
I'm sorry. Yuka.

645
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:34,515
He came awhile ago to tell me
that I should tell you the truth.

647
00:20:34,516 --> 00:20:38,252
hat it would save you from being hurt.

648
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:42,356
That's when I first realized how stupid I was.

649
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,358
Life is invaluable.

650
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,765
I think that you're regretting the fact that
you didn't realize sooner that he was ill...

652
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:56,837
But, Chicchi was taken good care of by you,
and I'm sure he was really happy

654
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:06,414
Since @higeny's cure was brown,
I mistakenly bought a female yesterday.

658
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:14,855
It's a budgie!

661
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,891
The sere Is blue. It's a male!

662
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,693
NY ve To
Wow! Fantastic!

665
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,963
I was thinking about
whether it's good or not

667
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,998
- Aw NV owe -
to buy a new budgie
right after Chicchi.died but.

670
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,954
Thank you

671
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:00,801
How lucky. You've got a family now...
