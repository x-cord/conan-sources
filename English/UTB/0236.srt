I once heard that the
secret of its whiteness

78
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,769
is due to the 90 lo silicate quartz sand!

00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,307

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,752

00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:39,745
No darn way!!

295
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,714
Okay, why don't we go tour
the caves then!

297
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,151
It-seems we=canwgo~down~ using
the elevator from of a temple that building.

299
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,988
And, after that we get to watch
the sunset at Senjojiki, right?

301
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,691
Yep! I'm sure that
it'll be super beautiful...!

303
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,728
Senjojikl

304
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,897
What a scenic masterpiece
Senjojikl

306
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,898
Senjojikl

307
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,800
I'm sure glad we came.

308
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,268
Yeah,

309
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,238
it was worth coming,
if only to see this sunset

311
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,072
Mr Mourn

312
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,508
Maw.!

313
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,744
Did you all come to watch the sunset too?

314
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:13,979
Yes,

315
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,415
because we haven't seen
the view of the sunset here yet.

317
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,150
By the way, Mr. Mourl,

318
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,651
do you like to drink?

319
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,987
Yes! Very~~~much!!

320
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:23,522
If so,

321
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,858
why not stop over at Toretore Market

322
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,960
before going to
Adventure World tomorrow?

324
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,962
Toretore Market. . .?

325
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:32,331
Aside from fresh seafood

326
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,466
they have a whole line of
A+ locally brewed sake.

328
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,402
Locally brewed sake!

329
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,038
You can send it home
by courier service too.

331
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,875
I've also written the bus route
to the market from Shinyuzaku.

333
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,979
There is a bus stop called Bus Depot
near Tdrettore Market.

335
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:51,683
There is no bus that goes directly from
Toretore Market to Adventure World,

337
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,154
and you'll have to get off once at
Shirahama, but it shouldn't take that long.

339
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,257
Thank you so much for all your kindness!

340
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,525
We'll visit there for sure!

341
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:00,792
Goodbye, then.

342
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,529
Thank you so much
for all your thoughtfulness!

344
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,336
Thank you so very much!

345
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,308
It seemed as if Maki came
all the way here

347
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,911
jUSt to give us information
about the market, didn't it?

349
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,779
I guess she's just a kind person

350
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,987

Toretore Market

360
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,395
The bus for Adventure World is bus #3.

361
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,034
The next bus to
Adventure World is at 10:15.

363
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,272
We still have about 20 minutes to go.

364
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,808
Maybe we should go walking
around the area.

366
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,850
What's wrong, Conan?

367
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:35,087
I felt like someone was watching.me.

368
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,122
I guess it's just my imagination though.

369
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,128
If you want it so badly,
why don't; ouifbuy, it now?

371
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,230
Uh-uh, it's okay

373
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,400
Let's go take a look
in the souvenir shop outside too.

375
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:49,735
Letl's gofiConan

376
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,375
Hey, we've only got 7 to 8 minutes left,
so we'd better get going.

378
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,150
Uh, would youamin'd'"
if I stop over at the store of the station?

380
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,284
Huh?

381
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,587
We don't have time, you know.
Hurry it up, okay!

383
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,856
So, you're going to buy it after all.

384
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,726
Not again...

385
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,862
Itis just as if I...

386
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,964
someone is watching me...

387
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,500
This please.

388
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,167
Thank you very much.

389
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,836
H'eyfihurgy Lip-=,, th'efibus is')'goingi to leave!

390

Hmm...

391
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,372
Only one more left. . ?

392
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,209
Somebody else beside Ran is buying it...

393
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,445
Thank you very much.

394
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,816
Makn!

395
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,383
Huh?!

396
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,719
Makn!

397
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,222
Thanks again

398
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,495
Be careful!

399
00:13:57,737 --> 00:14:00,605
Conan, that bus is headed
for Sandanbeku!

401
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,014
Adventure World

402
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,894
Wow~~~Nice shot!

403
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,209
There, Conan, wave your hand.

404
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,610
I, I'm fine...

406
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,313
He's only a kid and yet he's embarrassed.

407
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,647
Why, it's you, Mr Mourl!

408
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,351
I didn't think that I'd run into you here.

409
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,186
Oh, you're ah...

410
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,020
Fuji!
Oh, you're ah...

412
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,155
Kota Fun!

413
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,691
So: you've come here...

414
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,259
Is everyone else here too?

416
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,163
three went out to sketch from morning,

417
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,733
and Maki was saying that she was
going to go driving until sundown.

419
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,938
I saw her around 10:00 sharp
at Shirahama Station!

421
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,974
Oh, I see ?

422
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,108
Really...

423
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,611
Hey, over that side!
Let's go see!

425
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,679
That's a laptop, right?

426
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,081
Do you always carry it around with you?

427
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,549
Yeah

428
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,318
that's why Yura call me a computer freak.

429
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,319
Huh?

430
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,320
What Was that...?

431
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,056
Oh, excuse me...

432
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,324
Hello...

433
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,059
What?!

434
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,928
Clam down and tell me again, Madoka!

435
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,265
What?...Maki is dead?!

436
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,466
What...?

437
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,000
H,Hey!!

438
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:35,567
HLJHeyu

439
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,003
Madoka, this is Mourfl!

440
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,906
Where and under what
circumstance is she?!

442
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,309
In the bushes at Sandanbekl...

443
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,877
Stabbed in the chest with a knife...

444
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,579
Sandanbekl 7

445
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,883
That suspicious looking silhouetted figure
was on board the bus to Sandanbekl...

447
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:53,652
Darn!!

448
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,391
We're all headed that way,
including Mr. MOUI'I!

450
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,226
You called the police already, didn't you?

451
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,562
Did you tell Yura and Kanako already...?

452
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:04,763
Not yet .?

453
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,132
Okay! I'll Inform them, then!

456
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,006
Hey»,

457
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,609
Didn't we just go pass
the entrance of Sandanbekl?

459
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,212
Madoka is more inside

460
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,321
This way!

461
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,002
Madoka!

462
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:45,871
Madoka!

463
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,372
Where is Makl'?

464
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,207
0,over there in 'the bushes.

465
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,748
One stab right into her chest...

466
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,185
She probably died on the spot.

467
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,422
Maki's wallet is nowhere in sight...

468
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,560
This is most likely to be
310389 of murder-robbery...

470
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,929
Theme are no signs" bf any struggle
in the area.

472
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,030
If so,

473
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,599
the murderer could've been
an acquaintance...

475
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:15,733
Hmm. ?

476
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,304
Strange...?

477
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,306
If I remember correctly,
Maki's key holder had...

479
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,742
the key for the rent-a-car on it too .

480
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,545
Does that mean that the killer took it along
and fled with the car...?

482
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,216
But...what's with this key holder then...?

483
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:33,685
Huh...?!

484
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:35,854
What is it?

485
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,056
Work gloves...?

486
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,493
Why does she have work gloves on her?

487
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,664
Haven't I told you time and again
not to mess around the scene of a crime

489
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:46,731
I'm sorry!

490
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,434
Let's wait for the police to come
for further investigation.

492
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,036
Let's wait for the police to come
for further investigation.
OUCh~~~it hurts

495

This sand is...

498
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,876

512
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:32,510
Well,

the duty of any civilian!

I'll help in whatever way I can!

516
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,920
Let me introduce you
to the friends of the victim, then.

518
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:46,358

from Adventure World, Kota Fuji

521
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,762
She is Kanako Mlhara who came over
here from En'getsu Island

523
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,733
She is the one who first found
the body, Madoka Mitsuu

525
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:59,371
And he is Tatsuhiko Yura who came
here from Shirahama.

527
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:02,507
Ms. Madoka Mitsfll,

528
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,678
please tell us 'the circumstanc'e'sfnvvh'en
you found the body of ME. MékilfiShinjoi,

530
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,181
I heard Beethoven playing.

531
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,016
What?!

532
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,817
Beethoven. . .?

533
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,622
I was sketching
on the far end of Sandanbekl...

535
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,660
I heard the melody of
a cell phone ringing behind me...

537
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,964
So I went towards the bushes
where the music was coming from...

539
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,738
I didn't know what to do,

540
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,707
so I called Mr Fuji right away.

541
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,480
I see that Maki was lying
on the ground fairly close to you.

543
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,816
Nevertheless, you didn't realize
that a crime was being committed?

545
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,420
I was faced in the opposite direction

546
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,755
and the sound of the waves was
pretty loud .

548
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,426
But, you heard the melody
of the cell phone!

550
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,228
W,Well.

551
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,431
It's only natural.

552
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,233
Electronic sounds like those of cell phone
are made to be audible.

554
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:06,570
Hmm...well, I guess so...

555
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,041
Officer Ando,
please give us a report on the autopsy

557
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:10,975
Yes, sir!

558
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:15,113
The cause of death is shock
by a stab wound.

560
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,849
There are fit) traces of the conpse
having been moved after death,

562
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,350
and the estimated time of death,

563
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,086
in other words the time the murder is
thought to have been committed is,

565
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:26,558
judging from the condition of the body
between 9:00 to 11:00 this morning.

568
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,360
I'm sure the time the murder was

569
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,962
committed can be
narrowed down a bit more!

571
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:31,695
What?!

572
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,966
We ran into Maki at Shirahama Station.

573
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,634
It was about 10:10 when we saw her!

574
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,002
What?!

575
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,971
Are you sure it was about 1010?

576
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:44,709
After bowing to us,
she left immediately in her car.

578
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:50,615
We were going to get on the 10:15 bus
headed for Adventure World,

580
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,749
so I'm sure there's no mistake!

581
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,551
Officer Ando!

582
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,921
How long does it take to get from
Shirahama Station to Sandanbeki by car?

584
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,423
Well...

585
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,960
since it's the tour season now,
it should take less than 15 minutes.

587
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,629
Let's say it takes about 14 minutes,

588
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,599
so she arrives at Sandanbeki about 10:24.
1493

590
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,366
1493

591
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,470
If she parks the car in the alley
closest to the scene of the crime,
1453

594
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,872
it would take her 2 minutes to get there...!
1453

596
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:14,506
1453

597
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,541
If we assume she was killed immediately,

598
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,878
the time the murder was committed,
no matter how early,

600
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:21,479
would be around 10:26!

601
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:22,714
Yeah

602
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,517
Which means that the time
the murder had been committed

604
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,752
is narrowed down to
approximately 34 minutes!!

606
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,554
By the way,

607
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:33,625
Maki'swallet seems to have disappeared
from among her personal effects.

609
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,959
Justsa few minutes ago,

610
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,228
the car that the victim was thought to
have been driving was found

612
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,498
near Sansho Shrine
about 3 kilometers away from here.

614
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,767
And an empty wallet was found
inside the car!

616
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,169
It's Maki's!

617
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,605
So, we've already gotten to
the bottom of this case...

619
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:47,839
Wait!
So, we've already gotten to
the bottom of this case...

622
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,272
Wait

623
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,075
Was the key of the car found?

625
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,646
the key was in the ignition of the car.

626
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,449
Um, did you only receive
one key from the rent-a-car shop?

628
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,985
I think so.

629
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,354
I don't think they normally give you
two keys, do they?

631
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,458
This is a case of murder-robbery!

632
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,629
After the killer attacked Makl,
the killer stole the car and fled on it,

634
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,799
and abandoned it near Sansho Shrine!

635
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,269
No...murder-robbery is probably
Just camouflage...

637
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:22,040
It's most likely that this murder was
committed by an acquaintance of hers...!

639
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,641
If so.

640
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,477
The murderer is among the people here...!

It was unfortunate that
Maki witnessed you.
