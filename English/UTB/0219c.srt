1
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,620
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,455
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,094
He sees through the one and only truth.

5
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:29,695
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,164
no case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan

9
00:01:54,881 --> 00:02:00,486
THE DETECTIVES COME TOGETHER!
KUDO VS THIEF KID

11
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,091
The Thief Kid...

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,361
He's an honest guy

13
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,296
The minute his name was mentioned

14
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,231
he showed signs of his identity.

15
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,632
I sensed your piercing,

16
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,235
callous presence...

17
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,238
No doubt about it, he is here...

18
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,740
Inside this house...

19
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,943
I don't know what he's up to, but,

20
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,412
I wonder if he can continue deceiving
the 7 detectives

22
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,815
who are gathered here!

23
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,750
4 Ah WAH
ay, O-

25
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,018
Then,

26
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:36,756
are you saying that the Thief Kid
is the one who invited us here?

28
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:41,093
It seems that he gathered the six of us

29
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:45,064
that have a eputation of being good
detectives hereto compete intellectually.

31
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,767
By staking the treasure that
he had stolen up to now,

33
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,802
as well as our lives...

34
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:54,573
He's probably watching us
from somewhere this very minute.

36
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:58,543
I found surveillance cameras
all over this place.

38
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,724
This is an appetizer.

39
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,995
So, the last supper that
he is referring to has finally come.

41
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,735
Excuse me, maid?

42
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:23,936
Yes?

43
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:27,706
By any chance did
the master instruct you on

45
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,676
which order to place
the dishes in on the table?

48
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:31,644
1 CO.

49
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:33,379
I was told to place the dishes on the table

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,214
starting with Mr. Hakuba
and continue on clockwise.

52
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,482
Well,

53
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,751
It just bothered me

54
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,719
that he was calling this the last supper

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,222
despite the game having just begun.

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,926
There's no poison in the food,

57
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:48,727
because I'm the one who made it.

58
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:52,631
But, the forks, knives and spoons,

59
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,234
the wine glasses and tea cups

60
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,003
have been placed
on the table beforehand.

62
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,074
We all seated ourselves according to
where we found our name plates.

64
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,778
I don t-think he Intends to commit murder,

65
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,448
but he may set up

66
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,351
a sinister joke
to test our capabilities.

68
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,688
It may be wiser to wipe
your glass cup and fork

70
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,424
with your own handkerchief before eating.

71
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,492
No doubt about it.

72
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,027
I don't like the idea that things

73
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,362
are being carried out as he planned.

74
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,932
Would you like to do a game of rock,
paper, scissors and change seats then?

76
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,236
B: But, what if someone ill-fatedly
gets the poisoned seat?

78
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,838
That's that, take it as fate,

79
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,040
and cry in the coffin

80
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,043
Oh no...

81
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,384
Boy, that sure was good!

82
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,520
Just-as-expected of:a gourmet detective!

83
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,955
You've really got fantastic talent
for cooking too, don't you?

85
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,728
I went through axalot of training
to satisfi this tongue of mine, so...

87
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:59,031
It seems we took our imagination
a bit too far...

90
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,734
We can't be too sure yet.

91
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,736
Well, people,

92
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,739
how did you like the last supper
that I prepared for you?

94
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,241
So, here it comes.

95
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,144
I guess it's time for me to talk.

96
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:16,048
Let me explain why I chose
this place which I dished out a lot for,

98
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,250
as the stage for this game.

99
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,819
First, take a good look,

100
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,689
at the many dishes that are in front of you.

101
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:27,793
A bird.

102
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,264
There is an image of an eerie bird
with a large beak.

104
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,134
Isn't this a crow?

105
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,403
Then, this is probably...

106
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:38,938
Have you figured it out?

107
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,141
That's the millionaire who died
a mysterious death a half a century ago.

109
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,145
Renya Karasuma

110
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,447
It's the crest of Renya Karasumaru.
Renya Karasuma

112
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,749
R, Renya Karasumaru?!

113
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,186
Not only the dishes but also...

114
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,189
the doors, floors, railings...

115
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,925
the chess pieces and the playing cards
in the living room

117
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,362
were all specially ordered
and made by his request.

119
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:08,234
In other words, this is a villa,
which had been built by Karasuma...

121
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:10,936
or, rather, it used to be a villa...

122
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,672
40 years ago,

123
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,709
a blood-chillin tra ed occurred here.

124
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,345
Until that stormy night...

125
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,282
Being that you are all superb detectives,

126
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:26,585
you may have already noticed the minute

128
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:31,123
the remains of the enormous amount
of blood that was splattered and shed.

131
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,859
1 CO...

132
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,962
it was on a certain night 40 years ago,

133
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,232
when this place still retained its beauty.

134
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,436
The prominent figures of the financial
world were invited here,

136
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,472
and a special gathering was held.

137
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,775
It was entitled Memorial for
the late Renya Karasumaru.

139
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,378
He passed away at the age of 99.

140
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,649
But, in actuality, the gathering
was an auction of the various artworks

142
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,951
that Karasumaru had collected
during his lifetime

144
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,855
More than 300 items were auctioned

145
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,991
And, it was scheduled
for a period of three days.

147
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,829
On the 2nd night, that stormy night...

148
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,935
Two men were freezing

149
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:22,341
and with trembling lips, remarked

150
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,678
that they had lost their way In the storm,

151
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,881
and they would like to
spend the night until the storm subsided.

153
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,353
The host of the auction was hesitant about
Ietting the two stay the night at first, but

155
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,189
the man handed the host
over a small parcel saying

157
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,358
that it was in exchange for
Ietting them stay there

159
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,329
The contents of the parcel seemed to
be something like a cigarette,

161
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,365
and the host smoked it
just as he was told to...

163
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:52,237
Then,he gradually got merrier and merrier,
and let the two men inside.

165
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,407
The other guests who
were watching were urged

167
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,243
by the two to smoke likewise,

168
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,879
and the whole place
was covered with smoke.

170
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,882
D,Don't tell me that the parcel was...

171
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,884
Marijuana

172
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:11,290
The guests had a enjoyed a merry,
boisterous time for a while,

174
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,093
but after a while things began to change

175
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,997
A man screamed as if
he had seen the devil,

177
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,901
carried the item that he had
bid for and now owned, and ran...

179
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:26,138
A woman started crying as if
asking someone for forgiveness

181
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,907
until her tears dried out.

182
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:33,077
Yet another man,
delightedly poked his arm time and again

184
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,714
with the pen that he was holding.

185
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,885
The guests finally began to snatch
the works of art from each other,

187
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,355
and using auctioned items, such as
Iong swords and jeweled daggers,

189
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,491
started killing each other

190
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,560
The auction grounds had transformed into
a scene of massacre and hell...

192
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,365
The day after the hideous
and nightmarish night,

194
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,702
the two men had disappeared
with the art works and jewelry,

196
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,874
Ieaving 8 dead and as many as
over 10 people comatose behind.

198
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:08,414
But, why is such a serious crime
not known to the public?!

200
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,383
Probably because among them...

201
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,820
There was a powerful figure of
the financial world,

203
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,622
or maybe a member of the family.

204
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,490
I see...

205
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:23,162
If the conditions were such that
no one could tell who killed who...

207
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,532
Those involved may have come to
the conclusion that it would be better

209
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,701
to keep the case under cover,
rather than solving it.

211
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,940
It was probably within the calculation
of those men too, wasn't it?

213
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:40,345
Well, 'this age old story sure does
whet,my appetite.

215
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,247
So, now .

216
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,183
Do you understand why I chose this place

217
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,853
as the stage for the game?

218
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:53,325
I would like all you detectives to re-enact

219
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,362
the tragedy that occurred here
40 ye rs ago.

221
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,868
That ugly scene of people fighting over
the treasure and killing each other.

223
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,404
Really stupid...

224
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,709
I figure it's too cruel to make you all just
search blindly all throughout this building

226
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,412
so let me give you a hint.

228
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:14,646
H, Hint?!

229
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,380
H, Hint?!

230
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,585
When the two travelers
Iooked up at the sky.

232
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,620
A devil descended near the palace.

233
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,557
The king carries the treasure
with him as he flees

235
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,228
The queen collects tears in the chalice
and asks for forgiveness.

239
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,329
The queen collects tears in the chalice
and asks for forgiveness.

241
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:31,396
The warrior falls dead by
the sword stained with his own blood.

243
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,300
The warrior falls dead by
the sword stained with his own blood.
-- - 14

249
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,201
The warrior falls dead by
the sword stained with his own blood

251
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,404
That must be...

252
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,707
Don't you think that these sentences
are more than suited

254
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,510
to describe the competition
of intelligence

256
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,013
staking your lives that is
about to be carried out here?

258
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:48,914
Don't be ridiculous...

259
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,451
To kill someone, you need to
have some who wants to kill you,

261
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,153
as well as, the will to kill yourself.

262
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:00,859
Of course, you do not have a choice
and cannot have out of this game.

264
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,665
Because you are all already
under the magic spell that I have chanted.

266
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,132
00008000,y,

269
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:15,307
when someone among you
Iets out a scream

271
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,409
that is the start of the game

272
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,810
Understand?

273
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,547
The one who finds
the treasure must enter

275
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,416
the location of the treasure
in the computer

277
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:27,419
that is in the room on the
fourth floor in the center tower.

279
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,489
I will give you half the treasure
as promised,

281
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,226
as well as instructions on
how torget out of here.

283
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,363
M, Mr<Mogi!

284
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,100
Mr Mogi, are you all right?!

285
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,606
Just kidding!

286
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,677
What a bad old man you are, really...

287
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,145
Sorry, sorry...

288
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,647
As a token of my apology, I'm out.

289
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,749
I'm not at all interested in
treasure hunting.

291
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,818
But, how do you intend to get out of here?

292
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,954
Don't worry.

293
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:05,356
This is not some isolated island
in the middle of the ocean.

295
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,860
I'll get somewhere
if I keep roaming the mountains

297
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,797
See you all later then, detectives!

298
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,682
Hey, mister, it won't work.twice.

299
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,156
22:34 and 51 seconds,
verified breathing stopped.

301
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,325
Judging from the circumstances here,

303
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,195
I think it is impossible
to try to resuscitate him.

305
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,796
What?!

306
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,366
No sign of cyanosis,

308
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,668
in which the lips turn purple, is visible.

309
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,271
And besides, this almond odor is
distinct of hydro cyanic acid gas.

311
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:57,776
Which means cyanide was
in the tea that he just drank.

313
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,211
'000000000009° 00000

314
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,946
There is no redox reaction.

315
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:01,880
VP 0000000009° $0900

316
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,816
"8 e8et000000000s0een) ~
I guess it's not the tea...

318
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,284
Then, what on earth happened to him...

319
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:09,788
Then, what on earth happened to him.

320
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,525
For the sake of Detective Ogami
who has died to make way

322
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,129
for the grand start of this life
risking competition of intelligence,

324
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,296
go search for the treasure
with all your might.

326
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,265
Cut out your stupid talk!
Go search for the treasure
with all your might.

329
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,233
Go search for the treasure
with all your might.

331
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,302
While you are still alive...

332
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,305
A cassette tape...

333
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,175
It seems to be connected to a timer.

334
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,543
A timer?

335
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:36,782
Were you also instructed on the time
at which to bring the food in?

337
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,752
Yes, in detail, appetizers, soup,
main dish and dessert...

339
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,991
Which means that he wasn't talking
while watching us, but...

341
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:50,428
The tape was being played.

343
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,197
So, now we, know two things.

345
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,735
That the killer intended to
Kill Mr. Ogami to begin with,

347
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:01,707
and, that maybe, the killer is among us...

348
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:11,483
The killer may be among us?!

349
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,119
Take that tape for instance

350
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,922
Somebody in this room could've
recorded the voice beforehand,

352
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,191
and pretended to listen to it

353
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,992
Iike everyone else here, right?

354
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,496
1, That is possible...

356
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:30,402
And sit in this same dining room
as Mr. Ogami, without us noticing...

358
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:33,939
he was made to drink the cyanide
and poisoned himself to death.

360
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,976
Right in front of
the very eyes of all 5 of us.

362
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,947
Moreover, from the contents of the tape,

363
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,516
it sure sounds like
the killer knew what time

365
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,651
the victim was going to die too.

366
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,490
The question is, there was no
cyanide compound reaction from the tea

369
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:54,760
that he was drinking
until just before he died.

371
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,461
Then...

372
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:00,365
maybe the poison was on
the rim of the cup and not in the tea itself.

375
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,804
because he drank
from the cup two to three times.

377
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:11,610
But, the criminal that you're referring to is,
the Thief Kid, right?

379
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,614
I've heard that he never kills anyone.

380
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,882
No...

381
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,684
This is the first case in which something like
this has happened, as far as I know.

383
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:20,919
Well,

384
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,587
talking is not going to get us anywhere.

385
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,990
Shouldn't we o take a look?

386
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,659
To see whether our cars have really
been blown up or not!

388
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,294
I agree.

389
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,666
There could be a car
that was spared from being blown up.

391
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,637
Yeah, the explosion
that we heard a while ago

393
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,473
could've been NM bluff:

394
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,055
The car that I rented...

395
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,092
My Ferarri's done medium too.

396
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,461
My Alfa...

397
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,764
As well as Ogami's:Porsche are all gone!

398
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,100
Is that Benz yours, then?

400
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,471
I had my granny drive me over here.

401
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,440
Strange.

402
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,944
I had Mr Mouri give me a lift here

403
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,879
Who's Benz is that?

404
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,883
I think it s the master's car

405
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,587
When I got here early this morning,

406
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,322
It was already here.

407
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:35,427
Which means that there is someone else
here besides us, after all.

409
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,730
Could it mean that my car
that is on the other side,

411
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,131
has also been burned.

412
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,636
On the other side...
You mean you didn't park your car here?

415
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,808
because I was instructed to park it
at the backggate

417
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,745
What's the short cut to the back gate?!

418
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,714
Go through the enclosed garden...

419
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,890
Go to the back gate from the kitchen
to the left beyond!

421
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,296
Oh, your car's just fine!

422
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,233
Isn't there something fishy about this car?

423
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,637
That rat probably forgot to set the bomb!

424
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,674
Then, maybe we should go check to see
if the bridge is really gone.

426
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,910
I'll go with you.

427
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,077
I guess I will too.

428
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,345
Me too.

429
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,016
Come now, too many captains
will sink the ship.

431
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,450
True,

432
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,988
We'll end up not with the Phantom Thief
but rather, a Phantom Ship.

434
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,425
Then, why not decide
which detective goes by tossing a coin?

436
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,361
I jus happen to have
exactly 5 coins on me.

438
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,903
My, you're pretty well prepared, little one!

439
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,572
This is a very primitive way
to decide, however.

441
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,375
I guess we've got no choice.

442
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:01,279
Then, the one who gets heads...

443
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,949
gets to go drive over to the bridge
and check it out.

445
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:18,730
The ones who are going are me,
Mr Mourn and Mogi, right?

447
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,442
Please be careful, dad!

448
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,189
Don't tell me that.

449
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,724
It couldn't be?!

450
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,394
Come, let's go back inside!

451
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,563
Come on, let's go!

452
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,397
Oh, okay

453
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,438
What a sight...

454
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,906
The bridge is completely drowned.

455
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,710
Hey, granny Senma!

456
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,846
Will you bring the headlights up closer!

457
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,180
I want to look at my feet...

458
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,182
Okay!

459
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:14,185
Closer, closer,

460
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,487
Closer...

461
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,226
I wonder if the killer will move.

462
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:22,027
Yeah...

463
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,595
I don't think this is all there is to it.

464
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,675
Ms. SS, Senma!

465
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,381
