00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:02,500
Suspense and deduction

00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,237
the love and hatred
between two people.

00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:05,905
What will happen to pops testimony!

00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,006
Prosecuter, Lawyer,
and Conans solution!

a child in appearance
with the 1. Q of an adult

12
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,146
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,777
Ms. Kisaki and Ms Kujo

15
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,681
the "Madonna" of the prosecutor's
office are to battle it out in court again.

17
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:00,686
The defendant is accused to breaking
into an office and when he is discovered,

19
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,288
he and the victim fight,
and during the struggle,

21
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,223
he accidentally kills the victim...

22
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,529
But'Prosecutor Kujo claims
that he did intend toukill.the victim

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,197
and: heliis charged with
burglary andimurder!

26
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,332
And he is charged with
burglary and murder!

28
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,703
Old man Kogoro and
I start to investigate

30
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,805
investigate and we discover
something at the crime scene

32
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,274
It's can't be!

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,411

34
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,013

I'll be testifying at the next trial,
please go easy on me

98
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,222
You found your father-inzlaw's. body,!

99
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:19,225
When you went te return something ow
he'd forgotten, didn't you?

101
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:23,329
Yes. He had dinner
here and left without his glasses»

103
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:24,396
His glasses ua.

104
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,831
Yes, his reading glasses

105
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,701
Take your time and
enjoy your meal

107
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,146
this restaurantdooks fancy but
the pasta isnst very good, is it

109
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,582
I agree, I think the
olive oil is a bit;heavy

111
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,990
By the way, how
are things for the next trial going?

113
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,958
Not too good...

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,729
You'll lose unless
you change your approach

116
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,664
And. what do you mean by that?

117
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:02,001
You won't get him off
on thesburglary and murder charge.

119
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,970
So you've got to stress the
fact that he did it out of love

121
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:09,508
for his daughter and that
the victim was also at fault.

123
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,211
Are you saying I should accept
the prosecution's charges

125
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,947
and ask for leniency due to
extenuating circumstances?

127
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,649
What choice do you have...

128
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,083
Don't be ridiculous!

129
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,552
@ defendant insists
he had no intention of Killing him!

131
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,621
You believe everything
your client tells you,

133
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,290
that's why Madonna
always gets you in court

135
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,359
Don:tsyoutell me how to do my job!

136
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:31,297

What is it?
Why are you looking through the files?

148
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,725
Well, something
in here was bothering me

150
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,060

You keep messing around
with important documents!

Good grief!

167
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,906
Well if you're going to be like that

168
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,343
why don't you think of
something that'll help mom!

170
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,648
She's so stubborn. I hope
Madonna creams her in court

172
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,083
Just listen to you!

173
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,652
I'll bet you just don't have the
confidence to beat Ms Kujo

175
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,723
You've got some nerve!
She's no match for me

177
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,492
Then why don't you defend him?

178
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,296
He can;t. Dad doesn't
have a license to practicellaw.

180
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:40,332
Why can'the be a
special counsel then?

182
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,533
What's that?

183
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,870
If someone with a
Iicense to practice law or

185
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:50,209
if the defendant makes a request, the
person they indicate can act as lawyer

187
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:55,648
Show the court how brilliant
your deductive powers are

189
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,051
My: brilliant: deductive powers?

190
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,355
Any crime can be solved by me.

191
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:09,161
Well, if you insist!
But let me think about it

193
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,600
Him, special counsel?

194
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,470
Yes!
He wants to help you so much, mom

196
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,407
Thanks but no thanks.

198
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,977
Dad really wants to help!

199
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,748
So you say but I just don't
think he has the ability

201
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:30,883
But .

202
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,786
I have a message"from Uncle
Kogoro, he Wants you

204
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:39,458
and the building superintendent to
come to the crime scene tonight

206
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,527
To the crime scene?

207
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,431
He said you'll see something that will
change the way things are going in court

210
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,766
Change the way things are going?

I don't mind but what I
do you want me to do?

216
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,111
I'm not too clear on that myself

217
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:05,884
Mr. Akiyama, will you do exactly
what you did that night?

219
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,655
Hey Conan, where is Kogoro?

220
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,025
Oh, uh, he stepped
outside to get things ready

222
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,226
Outside?

223
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,160

Iet's see, there was no one
here that night when I got here

244
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,939
Mr. Arima looked through that little
window to see inside the office

246
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,041
And he said somebody
was inside, didn't he?

248
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,309
Yes, that's right

249
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,178

00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,080

Impossible!

253
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,686
Is there somebody inside?

254
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,820
I don't understand

255
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,723
Take a look for yourself: Ms- Kisaki

256
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
What the!

257
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:51,797
I just set things up exactly
Iike Uncle Kogoro told me

259
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:56,368
Set things up, are you saying,
he knows who the killer is?

Mr. Akiyama: you stated that you
Iooked into the victim's office

288
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,121
through the:small window,
and saw him being beaten,

290
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,423
is that correct?

292
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,294
How many times did
the killer strike the victim?

294
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,298
I saw three blows being delivered

295
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,699
Shortly, after that

296
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,135
you heard the sound of the victim
falling to the floor, correct?

298
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,671
Yes...

299
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,638
End. of;questioning!

300
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,007

00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,081
Mr. Akiyama

304
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:22,488
you claim that you saw the victim being
hit but did you see the assailants face?

306
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:28,961
No. I, I didn't actually
see the assailant"s face

308
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,533
Whatsdo you mean by that,
whattexactly did you see then?

310
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,971
The light outside cast the
killer's shadow on the wall

312
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,908
Order in the court!

313
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,579
So you're saying you merely saw the
assailant's shadow, is that correct?

315
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,314
Yes, that's correct

316
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,216
Its the same thing.

317
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,119
As: long:as-hersaw the assailant,
seeing his shadow is good enough

319
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,788
Let me ask you one more time

320
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,292
Mr. Akiyama, is the defendant here,

321
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,327
the assailant you saw that evening?

322
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:09,201
No. like I said, I only
saw a shadow on the wall

324
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,505
So you can't say for sure the defendant
iS the assailant then, is that correct?

326
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,840
Yes, that's correct...

327
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,074
Thank you

328
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,145
NO more questions

329
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,580
Oh for goodness sakes!

330
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:25,617
What is«dad doing!
He hasn't done anything except sleep

332
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,287
Don't worry, his tim Oillrcome

333
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,422
Are you sure?

334
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,525
I call Mr. Arima to the witness stand

335
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,363
\ Mr. Arima, you and Mr. Akiyama

336
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,899
heard the sound of
the.victim falling. didn't you?

338
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,201
Yes, I'm certain of it

339
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:47,472
The. door was locked so you
brokevit:down by/ramming

341
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,141
ntostandithen ran inside.

342
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,911
Yes. But the killer had already
escaped:through the window

344
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,682
and my father-in-law, I mean,
Mr. O@tsu was on"the floor

346
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,818
And what about the safe?

347
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:01,954
It was open

348
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:03,855
No more questions

349
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,856
Defense, your turn.

350
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,695
Here goes

351
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:13,665
guess it's time for me to
Iiven up this boring trial

353
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,634
Good luck. dad

354
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,871
I'll see how he does first!

355
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:35,954
Yo. ef
vo <4

357
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,591
NW os Yr -
Special counsel, you may
proceed to question the witness

360
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,293
Yes sir!

362
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,629
Mr. Arima,

363
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,499
you claim you arrived at the
victim's office a little

365
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,836
past 9 PM to deliver an item
he'd forgotten, is that correct?

367
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,406
Yes, my father-in-law forgot his
reading glasses at my restaurant

369
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:58,176
But the office was locked
and you couldn't enter

371
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,378
That's right.

372
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,515
The dogr Was actually
unlocked, wasn't it?

374
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:08,954
And the victim was in his office
counting«#h& money in the safe

376
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,692
What are you getting at,
A, are you implying I...

378
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:19,297
No. I'm merely pointing out the fact that
you could have committed the crime too

380
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,433
Ridiculous!
Why would I kill my father-in-law!

382
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:27,239
When it comes to money, you
can'titrust your own family.

384
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:31,343
Unlike usual, ole Kogoro is
actually making some sense

386
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,847
Objection! Special counsel 1s
merely voicing his own-opinion!

388
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:36,815
Ee! 3

390
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:42,788
Objection granted. Special counsel
shall stick to the facts at hand

392
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,625
But based on my
many years of experience,

394
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:51,196
the first person to report the
crime is usually the guilty one

396
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,199
Alright 'then. based onYou r
many years of experience,

398
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:57,869
how do you explain the
things left on the crime scene

400
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,373
and the defendant's \
fingerprints on the safe?

402
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,445
When the witness and the victim
were fighting over money

404
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,314
the defendant was looking in through
the window: watching them

406
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,551
Well that's. anew. theory...

407
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:17,122
Then after the witness hit the
victim over the head and left,

409
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:23,061
Defendant took the opportunity to enter
the office to steal the money in the safe

411
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,033
The who was the assailant
Mr. Akiyama saw?

413
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,070
The truth is,
the victim wasn't dead yet

415
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:36,007
he regained consciousness
and struggledWith the defendant

417
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,744
now you're going way off base

418
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:43,815
You-re saying then is, the defendant
did indeedzcommiit the murder

420
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,085
I. I guess I am...what?

421
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:51,690
What are you saying! You're supposed
to be here to defend the client!

423
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,661
I'm a famous private detective,
I'm here to solve this.case!

425
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:02,634
I was a fool to depend on you.
Forget:it! You just keep out of my way ll

427
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,971
How dare you, I'm not finished,
I'm getting to the best part

429
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,341
Family fuels should be
carried .out elsewhere

431
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,712
I hate you dad!

432
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,716
I guess it's time I took ole Kogoro out

433
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:21,686
You just sit down
and keep your mouth shut!

435
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,221
A decoration piece!

436
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:30,695
Your honor, I'd like to
retract my previous statements

438
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,997
Just forget it!

439
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:36,568
The defendant entered
that office befor Mr. Arima,

441
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,737
not after.

442
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:43,708
The victim walked{in on him while he
was trying to get the safe open.

444
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,813
He hit the victim inadvertently
and ran out of the office

446
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,582
The question is what
happened after that

448
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,986
The defendant thought
he had killed the victim

450
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,490
but the truth-is, he had just
knocked him unconscious

452
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:04,262
someone else arrived on the scene
shortly thereafter and killed him!

454
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,264
Are you saying that it was me?

455
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,267
You claimed that the victim
forgot his reading glasses

457
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,336
in your restaurant, isn't that correct?

459
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:16,208
Did he need his reading
glasses during meals}too?

461
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:19,277
Well, he needs them to read the menu

462
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,546
That's strange.

463
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,748
The indictment:states.that'the victim

464
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,351
opened the safe because the
defendant threatened him

466
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,820
The victim didn't have his glasses

467
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:33,158
I wonder how he managed
to get the safe open

469
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:38,797
and his office was dark, the only light
was from the neon sign outside

471
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,466
How should I know?

472
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:47,205
The victim was still alive when you
delivered his glasses, wasn't he?

474
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,442
Father, are you in?

475
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,413
What happened?
Your head's bleeding!

477
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,649
Leave me alone!
It's nothing!

479
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,385
That was right after he
wandered in on the burglar.

481
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,089
The first thing he got worried
was the money in the safe

483
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,824
I have your glasses here

484
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:17,235
When you saw the money,
you thought of killing him

486
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:22,007
and you hit over the
head with the ashtray

488
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:28,813
Prosecutor! I came here as a witness,
why am I being treated like a suspectlr

490
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,851
Mr. Mouri, you've forgotten
one very important-detail.

492
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,554
The witness has an alibi

493
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:42,093
You bet I do! I was on the other side of
the door when father was beaten

495
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,029
and fell to the floor,
Mr. Akiyama was with me

497
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:47,899
Didn't you hear
Mr. Akiyama's testimony?

499
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,603
He said that he
never saw the assailant

501
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,772
B, but he saw a shadow

502
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,708
Yes, a shadow on the wall

503
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,745
You committed
murder blinded by the money,

505
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,882
now you had to make it look like
a burglary, you were desperate

507
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,184
Then you came up with ah-idea,

508
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:13,658
you used the clock in
the victim's office

511
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:22,834
Your honon!- This clock is
exactly like the one:in the victim's office

513
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:28,039
The killer evidently used the
movements of this figure

515
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,577
along with the light from the outside
and cast it's shadow on the wall

517
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:37,482
then led Mr. Akiyama
into mistaking the time

519
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,618
Wh, what about the sound!
Explain that!

521
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,322
Mr. Akiyama and I hear my father fall!

522
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,825
That's easy

523
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,559
What?

524
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,495
You probably put a golf ball

525
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,598
tied with a string under the leg
of the desk in the victim s office

527
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,935
The other end of the string led under
the door to the outside of the office

529
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,040
and when Mr. Akiyama looked inside
and got a scare, you pulled the string

531
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,947
See? Didn't I say it was easy?

532
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:13,385
Do you have any proof I did it?

533
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,921
Anyone could have
done what you said!

535
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,924
If you have proof
that I did it, I'd like to see it!

537
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:25,130
The witness is right. If you're insisting
he's guilty, I'd like to see some proof too!

539
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,632
The proof, Prosecutor,

540
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,236
IS on that list of items found at the
crime scene, which you are holding

542
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,804
On this list?

544
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,243
See, it says screw for
eyeglasses, doesn't it?

546
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,913
If it belongs to the victim's
reading glasses,

548
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,582
when did it get where it was found?

549
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,353
He was supposed to have left
» his glasses: at the restaurant

551
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,960
It came loose and fell off
when the assailant hit the victim,

553
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,762
that's the only
explanation I can think of

555
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,668
Another thing Mr. Arima, you
used your cook.s apron to wipe

557
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,970
your fingerprints off the
ashtray&didn't you?

559
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:12,743
The lab report stated that the ashtray
was wiped with a cloth containing oil

561
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,017
Request permission to have a sample
of the olive oil used in Mr. Arima's

563
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:23,088
restaurant be tested against the oil on
the cloth used to wipe the ashtray

565
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:33,031
/ Mr. Afima. after the crime. you repaid a
Ioan of 50 million yen, didn't you?

567
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,938
We can always have that
money tested for fingerprints

569
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,146
it was my father-in-laws fault...
he was so greedy

571
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,352
you must be relieved,
your money's safe

573
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,654
Do you want some of this?

574
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:01,192
But if you don't pay me back
what you owe me by next week

576
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,461
I don't care if you are my
daughter's husband,

578
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,797
I'm going to have you kicked
out of that restaurant

580
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,934
Mr. Mouri, you were
right about everything.

582
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,203
I killed my father-in-law!

583
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:25,583
I move that the charges of burglary
and murder against the defendant

585
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:30,155
be dropped and I will draw up a new
indictment for attempted burglary

587
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,589
Does the defense have any objections?

588
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,425
None

589
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:39,597
Then court is dismissed!

Why don't we all go get

654
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,410
That reminds me, I'm hungry.

655
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,679
How about some delicious
wine and Italian cuisine.

Japanese sakeand sashimi instead...

hot stew sounds good too

Oh who cares...

662
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:57,902
