1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:02,235
Just as flowing water has no form

2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:03,870
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,571
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:11,811
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,211
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult,

7
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,914
No case is left unsolved
when Detective Conan comes to the scene.

9
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:55,848
MURDER ON THE 5.5. SYMPHONY
20 YEAR VENDETTA

12
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,649
2 NA TL

13
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,889
I've figured it all out...

14
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:06,225
now all I have to do is prove it...

15
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,027
Oh excuse me

16
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,496
We're looking boy
who speaks with a kansai dialect

18
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,632
That kid asked us the same thing

19
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,234
and we've been looking for him too

20
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,268
but we-can't find him anywhere...

21
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,637
Sorry, Dr. Agata!

22
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,239
I can't talk now.

23
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,308
I'll call you later.

24
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:23,075
Eh?!

25
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,410
Wh, what did you say

26
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,680
We'll get the entire. crew #
to search the:ship.again

28
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,948
I'd appreciate:that

29
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,254
Good: grief. . what are youtdoing here?

30
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,856
Oh uh...nothing'...

31
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,492
I'm getting worried,
where didlhe go to anyway?

33
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,259
Who re you talking:about?

34
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,994
Are ou serious?

35
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,430
Heiji, of course!

36
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,132
Oh.4 him?

37
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,303
He's probably swimming
with the fishes somewhere

39
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:54,874
Mouri...

40
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,077
This guy... might just be...

41
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,546
I know what you m

44
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,382
Huh?

45
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:04,884
# Sf \

47
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:05,985
Dad?

48
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,424
Sir? What's wrong?

51
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,728
What're you doing?

52
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:16,762
Dad?

53
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,730
Ran,

54
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,499
tell all the others:to come here!

56
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,536
I've figured everything out.

57
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,037
Go on, hurry!

58
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:26,972
You what... 7?!

59
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:33,512
Is-that true?

60
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,947
You've solved the case'?

61
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,384
That's right... I've figured everything out

62
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,220
the entire truth behind this case...

63
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,857
You're not going to say that
Kanie's not the killer, are you?

65
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,027
Kanie is the Kil

66
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:53,432
Like you said, he pretended to be dead
then lay in wait

68
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,102
for a chance to kill...

69
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:58,370
Mr. Kuijirai, that was you!

70
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,208
Then whose body is that set on fire?

71
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,176
It's Mr. Kameda

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,716
Mr. Kanie lured Mr. Kameda out
and shot him then hid the body inside

74
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:16,889
the emergency ladder box at the
bow and returned to join the others

76
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,559
Then he set the flag on
the upper deck on fire

78
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,830
And when everyone ran up to
the deck, he set fire to the box...

80
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,634
The reason why he didn't
change Mr. Kameda's clothes

82
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,302
as soon as he was put in the box is,

83
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,472
he was waiting for the Superintendent

84
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,674
to giveyup the search for
the old man named Kano

86
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,145
it takes a Ion \time to dress someone

87
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,881
he couldn't risk being seen
by the Superintendent

89
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:47,552
And the proof is the way the victim's
arms were up beside his face!

91
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,756
If you raise the arms when
putting the body into the box,

93
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,359
even after rigor mortis sets in,

94
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,294
dressing the body is easy

95
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,463
And the reason the watch
wasn't clasped was,

97
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,935
his watchqprobably dfdnét fiflMrrKameda.

98
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,970
Before setting the fire,

99
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,540
Mr. Kanie called
Mr. Kujirai out to the stern

101
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,110
and tried to set him up as the killer...

102
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,747
Because the first person
found hanging around

104
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,749
a crime scene usually
viewed as a strong suspect

106
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,551
But why?

107
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:22,321
Why did he have to make it
Iook like he was dead?

109
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,725
He wanted to surprise his next victim,

110
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,261
which was Mr. Kujirai, and fill him with fear

111
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,566
He wanted vengeance against the men
who betrayed him 20 years ago...

113
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,234
Be...trayed?

114
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,571
Yes! That old man
named Kano was also

116
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:42,841
a ruse to scare the men,
the old man did not really exist...

118
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,410
Look at this,

119
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:47,179
the wound on Mr. Kanie's body

120
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:52,651
This old bullet wound is the very proof!

121
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,587
You..don't mean...

122
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,722
That's right!

123
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,158
This is Saizo Kano

124
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,262
the man everyone thought
died 20 years ago,

126
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,698
the Mastermind in the shadows!

127
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,600
You're lying...

128
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,336
it can't be...

129
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,706
I don't believe you...

130
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:17,776
You're lying...

131
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,612
this man couldn't possibly be Saizo Kano...

132
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,683
Because... Kano is... Kano is...

133
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,687
is my father!

135
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,993
Y...your father...?

136
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:35,661
That's right

137
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,133
Saizo;Kano, the Mastermind
in the shadows. is my real father...

139
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,436
The reason I joined this tour is

140
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,171
I wanted to find him

141
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,873
it was rumored he was killed

142
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,174
20 years ago by his accomplices

143
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,378
but I thought that maybe...

144
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,213
he was still alive...

145
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,116
but no one here reminded me of him

146
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:02,288
But... what if he'd had plastic surgery
and changed his appearance?

148
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,555
Don't be ridiculous!

149
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:05,958
I'd recognize him
no matter how he looked!!

151
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,360
Do you think I couldn't
recognize my own father?!

153
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,095
And it'd be the same with him!

154
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,332
If he saw me? you'd
know by his:reaction!!

156
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,534
20 years may have gone by...

157
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,703
but it we'd know each other...

158
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,673
That's exactly what I wanted to hear...

160
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,809
Forgive me Nagisa...

161
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,513
I had my suspicions but I needed proof...

162
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,950
So that I could completely
destroy the killer's plan...

164
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,385
The killer's plan...?

165
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,324
The killer rigged it to look ll
Mr.Kanie shot Mr. Kameda,

167
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,894
dressed him in his
clothes and set him on fire,

169
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,596
this would make us think
he faked his death

171
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:48,867
and hid somewhere firing shots
Ieading us on wild goose chases

173
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:54,173
but after failing in his
attempt to kill Mr. Kujirau,

175
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:58,377
and realizing he could not escape
he killed himself, that was the scenario

177
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,183
It was all a ruse to make us believe
Mr. Kanie was Saizo Kano

179
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:08,387
so that the killings on this ship were to
carry out a vendetta against the men

181
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,289
who betrayed him 20 years ago

182
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,693
Then . you mean. the killers...

183
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,197
That's right...it's someone else...

184
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,366
and he's right here!!

185
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,238
Oh come on now...
what are you talking about Mourn

187
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,007
You know for yourself

188
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,010
When the explosion went off at the bow

189
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,948
all the passengers here
were on the upper deck!

191
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,284
And all the other crew
members have alibis...

193
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,988
besides, you said so yourself, you'd
need a timing device to have set it off

195
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:43,989
So how can you...

196
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,257
I found it!

197
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,726
I found the timing device

198
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,795
You found it? In there???

199
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,296
He used a cigarette...

200
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,967
He »laced a li hted ci arette
in the space in the box

203
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,704
just over the can of gasoline

204
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,173
If you wind it with thread,

205
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,242
it'll take about 10 minutes
for the thread to burn

207
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,177
The cigarette will fall inside

208
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,746
And a fire will start automatically

209
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,584
But then...

210
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:16,722
how do you explain the 4 shots
that came from the bow

212
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,390
and the 2 from the prow?

213
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,260
Even then all of us here were

214
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,928
He used a cigarette then too...

215
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:30,068
He probably taped some fireworks
with a cigarette to the railing

217
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,473
That way, after it explodes, the
evidence will fall into the ocean...

219
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,143
There were burn marks on the railing

220
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,013
and some paint had been off,
that proves my theory!

222
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,118
By the way, regarding the flag
burning on the upper deck,

224
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,353
he used the same trick,

225
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:52,124
first soaking the flag in gasoline then
attaching the cigarette with fireworks...

227
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,228
Which means, by using this method

228
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,629
Anyone could have

229
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,565
committed the crime...

230
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,166
Uh... .er...

231
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,836
So who did it!

232
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,904
Who did all that!

233
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,106
It's...oh geez...

234
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,508
it's too late!

235
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:20,919
What was that!

236
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,221
There was an explosion in the rear!

237
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,890
Stop all engines! All
stations check for damages!

239
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,033
Lower deck! Any damages?

240
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,201
No damages!

241
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,803
No need to worry

242
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:43,808
The bomb went off about 100 meters
behind the ship, that's all...

244
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,378
100 meters behind the ship?

245
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,779
Was that a bomb?!

246
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,782
Just to be on the safe side

247
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,485
We put it on a rubber boat
which we tied a rope to,

249
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,121
the other end was attached
to the ratlin on the bow

251
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,456
then we let it out on the ocean...

252
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,457
Mr. Ebina...

253
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,161
Yes, it was the bomb
we found in your trunk!

255
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:03,962
Eh?!

256
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,663
Trunk ..7?

257
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,134
How... how did you know...7?7

258
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,572
Your room was very clean,
even your sheets were unwrinkled...

260
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,141
and your trunk looked like
it hadn't even been opened,

262
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,344
then when I noticed how
concerned you were about the time,

264
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,079
it made me suspicious...

265
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,581
That bomb was probably meant

266
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,919
to kill all the members of
that robbery 20 years ago,

268
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,555
you prepared it a long
time ago, didn't you...

270
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,927
You wanted to avenge the death
of your co-worker didn't you?!

272
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:37,763
Co-worker?

273
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:43,835
The distinctive way he counted money,
indicated he worked in a bank.

275
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,839
Also, he whispered the name
of the female bank teller

277
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,108
who was killed in the robbery

278
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,878
Yoshimi Samezaki...

279
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,981
She wasn't just another co-worker...

280
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:02,754
she was...she was the most
important thing in the world to me...

282
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,123
You mean you're...

283
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,558
you're the one who cried so
Ioudly at my daughter's funeral...

285
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,226
Yes, that's rightly

286
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,564
I quit the bank that day,

287
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:17,502
I've been going from job to job ever since
Iooking for those killers in my own way!!

289
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,404
Even after the statute
of limitations ran out...

291
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,009
I see...so it was you...

292
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,846
So you're the special person
she asked me to meet...

294
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:34,019
If...if only you'd ve have... .that day...

295
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,656
If only you'd come to the
bank like you promised!

297
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,127
She...she'd probably...oh God...

298
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,697
Forgive me...

299
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:50,435
one of my men was stabbed that day

300
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,338
I heard about what happened...
when I was at the hospital...

302
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:01,747
You saw that ad in the paper
and joined the tour too.

304
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,783
Yes... thought this might be it...

305
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,154
if 1 was wrong...l intended to throw
the trunk into the ocean

307
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,255
before the bomb went off...

308
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,628
Sot was you?

309
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,266
Did you kill all those men
involved with the robbery?

311
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:24,970
No..it wasn't mel! I didn't do

312
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,372
I brought a bomb with me!

313
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,608
I don't own a gun!

314
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,976
It's the truth! Please believe me!

315
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,178
It's alright...l believe you...

316
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,082
I know you're not the killer...

317
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:42,354
Like I said before, to set
Mr.Kanie up as the killer,

319
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:47,426
one had to make this seem like
Saizo Kano's act of vengeance,

321
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:49,795
or it wouldn't seem plausible...

322
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,365
the reason the killer disguised himself
as an old man then left the ship

324
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,567
and returned as someone else is,

325
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,571
he wanted to create the illusion
that Saizo Kano was alive.

327
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,475
He left a message on
the bill hinting of Kano

329
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,876
on the upper deck

330
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,678
This was all part of
his plan to make us think

332
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,849
Kano was trying to scare
the men who betrayed him...

334
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,452
And all of this was so that we would think

335
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:19,591
that the gunshot wound on Mr.Kanie's
body was the wound Mr. Kano got

337
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:23,195
when he was shot by one of
his accomplices 20 years ago!

339
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,497
You mean. ..that wound...

340
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:30,268
He probably got that when he served
in the foreign army long ago...

342
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,804
Remember, one of the
suspects was reported

344
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,906
to have served in an foreign army

345
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,310
And... he was one of the accomplices...

346
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,445
so that means

347
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,783
Yes, the only one who could
use that fact in this scheme

349
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:49,354
IS someone-whq8knew
about Mr Kanie's wound...

351
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,489
ou don't mean...

352
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,990
One of his old partners!

353
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,160
Mr. Kujirai! You're 'the
only one, aren'tfyou?

355
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,998
Th...that's insane... .haha...

356
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,469
First, you saw Mr. Kameda
Ieave the restaurant

358
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,105
then you mentioned
Saizo Kano's name

360
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,841
in the excitement, you
went to the engine room

362
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,444
where you had told Mr. Kameda
to wait and you shot him!

364
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,515
Then you hid his body
in the box on the stern

366
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,450
He was killed in the engine room?

367
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:22,087
Yes... I've already found
blood stains, a shell casing

369
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,057
and the letter he used to lure
Mr. Kameda in the engine room

371
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,661
You probably slipped the
Ietter under the cabin door...

373
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,898
Mr: .Kujirai came back to the lounge

374
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,000
waited for the Superintendent

375
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,837
to call off the search for Kano
then went to meet with Mr. Kanie

377
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,208
probably in the restroom
next to the restaurant.

379
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:47,979
Mr. Kanie was probably already
asleep due to being drugged...

381
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,582
then you stole his
clothes and his wristwatch

383
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:55,086
and put them on Mr. Kameda
then set up that timing device...

385
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,256
The reason why you deliberately
called attention to yourself

387
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,925
and had the crew see you, was

388
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:04,029
to make them see the box
was not on fire then

390
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,400
and also to give us the impression you
were called out there to meet someone...

392
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,037
The reason why you left the note
in the trash can in the restroom,

394
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,372
was to pretend to be afraid of Kano

395
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,710
and have us think
he was coming after you...

397
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:24,749
You were probably going to say
that it was in that book of matches

399
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,253
It was all to make us believe
Mr. Kanie was behind everything

401
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,389
that he had lured you out...

402
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,927
You set the cigarette device on the flag

403
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,563
before you changed
the clothes on the body...

405
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:45,136
that way, you could run up with
everyone when we heard the explosion

407
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,573
we would be your alibi...

408
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:55,714
You moved Mr. Kanie who was
sleeping, from the restroom to the prow

410
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,017
while we were all concentrating
on the burning body at the stern...

412
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:04,389
Then you watched our movements
after some time had passed,

414
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,258
you placed another device at the stern

415
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:09,628
after hearing the sound,
while we went running,

417
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,529
you went back to the prow

418
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:14,432
pulled Mr. Kanie back up and shot him.

419
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,435
Then you shot yourself

420
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:21,373
and fired another shot
through the window into the restaurant

422
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,945
After that, all you had to do was set
2 more devices and you were ready!

424
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,283
You came back to the stern and
had us all gather in the restaurant

426
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:33,451
where you gave us your false confession

427
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,054
and waited for the
explosions to go off

429
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,957
If you fell at the first explosion

430
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,627
it would look like the shot
came from the prow!

432
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,397
Wait a minute, hold it right there, Mouri!

433
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,732
I was with him

434
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,402
when he fell and I saw
the wound right then.

436
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,505
If he shot himself earlier,
there'd be more blood...

438
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,307
He used a tennis ball!

439
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,142
Before he shot himself in the arm,

440
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:00,578
he had the tennis ball
pressed against his artery

442
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,681
it was to stop the flow of blood!

443
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,150
He held it there tightly
until the explosion went off...

445
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:11,156
Ran found the ball under
the table in the restaurant.

447
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:15,927
He probably threw it there in the
confusion after the second explosion

449
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,832
But why didn't he kill Mr. Kanie
when he first took him to the prow?

451
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,903
If Mr. Kanie committed suicide
right after we found the burned body,

453
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,106
the killer's trick would seem unnatural...

454
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:32,844
The trick with disguising
the body with Mr. Kanie's clothes!

456
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,579
The reason he raised the body's arms

457
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,985
and unclasped the watch
was to create an illusion!

459
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,320
And he hired Heiji Hattor)
the private detective

461
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:45,256
from Osaka for the same reason!

462
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:50,628
Of course Mr. Kujirai probably figured
we'd to do our jobs as detectives as well

464
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,031
But you hired a private
detective from Osaka

466
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,300
because you lived in Osaka, didn't you?!

467
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,806
When people who live in the Kanto
area put cards back into the case

469
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,041
we don't use the term fix...

470
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,545
So that's how you knew...
now all we need is evidence...

472
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:14,419
You'll probably find it when you check
the area around the shattered glass,

474
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,855
you'll get a luminol reaction...

475
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,892
There'll be just a trace but
you'll find some smears from

477
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,427
when he wiped the blood

478
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,562
that splattered when he shot himself...

479
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,066
No! It wasn't me!!!

480
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:28,733
What?!

481
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,968
This is a trap!

482
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,370
Someone set this trap to frame me!

483
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,671
Why you!

484
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,640
Don't try to fool us!

485
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:39,644
That star...sure is beautiful...

486
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,445
What?!

487
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,647
Huh? What is that?

488
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,685
What is that strange star
approaching from the left?

490
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,121
What is that?

491
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,526
Look! Isn't that...

492
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,194
It's Heiji!

493
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:10,008
That's right... he found Mr. Kanie tied to
the prow but you knocked him out

495
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,510
and threw him overboard, he's our witness!

496
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,079
Oh... .rats...

497
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:19,617
You cant deny anything
any more. Mr. Kujiral?

499
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,820
But how did you figure it all out?

500
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,522
That Kanie wasn't the real killer?

501
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,424
The watch

502
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,095
The watch's stem is on the opposite side

503
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,498
because it's made for a right handed
person but it was put on his left hand,

505
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:36,267
at that point, I crossed
Mr. Kanie off as a suspect

507
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,136
You tried to make him look like you

508
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:42,107
but you were made a big mistake
by putting the watch on wrong

510
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:47,979
You were done in by
your partner's expensive watch...

512
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,150
By the way, it was also Mr. Kujirai who
put the ad for this tour in the paper

514
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,552
You all probably decided 20 years ago

515
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,588
that on the day the statue
of limitations runs out,

517
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,024
you'd place;an ad in the paper
under the name of Masaru Furukawa...

519
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,661
The reason the 3 got together was

520
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:08,700
were going to get the money they
put into a safe deposit 20 years ago...

522
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,537
To take the money out of the safe
deposit box you rented 20 years ago,

524
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,739
you needed the key,
the seal and the signature...

526
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:20,411
You 3 each had one of the items,
it would also be your identification

528
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,680
when you met each
other after all those years

530
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,549
after having plastic surgery done

531
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,453
Mr. Kujirai'whoiwas.in charge
of the signature,

533
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:32,089
saw the seal and key
Mr. Kameda and Kanie displayed nonchalantly

535
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,291
so he knew right away who they were

536
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:36,895
and he immediattely set his plan in motion

538
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,697
I...

539
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,400
after killing them, stole the key and seal,

540
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,502
he intended to take
the money all for himself...

542
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,804
What a fool...

543
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,873
the statute of limitations had run out

544
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,409
he went through'so much trouble...

545
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,611
I wanted to win...

546
00:21:55,147 --> 00:22:00,552
I thought up a perfect plan...
but that Saizo Kano...

548
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:04,556
20 years ago, he said
Your plan is full of loopholes..."

550
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:07,791
I wanted to outdo him!!

551
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,128
But I don't understand!

552
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:14,933
Why are there so many people involved
with that case all over this ship?!

554
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:18,136
I didn't even mention the
name Kano once in the ad...

556
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:22,006
You mean...you didn't know
what Masaru Furukawa meant?

558
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,876
It's the nickname Kano used,

559
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,812
he said there were just a few
strokes so it was easy to remember

561
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,847
so we were to use it when we
needed to contact each other...

563
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,916
No one except us is
supposed to know about it...

565
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,953
Hahahaha, this is hilarious!

566
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,855
Turn-the name sideways!

567
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,825
It becomes Saizo Kano!

568
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:42,460
What?!

569
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,262
That's why I joined this tour.

570
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,966
Also the statute of limitations
ran out of that day...

572
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,034
I had my doubts but...

573
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:55,772
Masaru Furukawa was Kano's alias
which he picked intending to be funny!!

575
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:58,142
No way!

576
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:02,814
You were never
any match for Kano...

578
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,883
After all, for the past 20 years

579
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:10,088
Kano had you by the coat tails...

What?! You fell in the ocean?!

625
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,652
You're kidding .

626
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,020
It's no joke!

627
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,456
Someone pushed me from behind and I fell in!

628
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:55,493
Didn't you notice I was gone You're cold!

629
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,229
But...you were lucky, you're alive!

630
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,300
Whenil"was:floating in the ocean,
that fishing boat captain found me!

632
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,669
It was awful!

633
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,904
I had to take all my clothes off in water

634
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,107
and use my flashlight to signal
ships sailing faraway

636
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,942
Worry a little!

637
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,211
You...took your clothes off?

638
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:17,714
Of course! Wet clothes soak up
so much water so they're heavy!

640
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,618
If I didn't take them off, I'd ve drowned!

641
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,054
The only thing I kept was my pants and

642
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,656
this thing I forgot I had in my pocket...

643
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,128
this here amulet

644
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,700
Il don't Know whether
it really works or not though...

647
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,171
Wh, what're you staring at me for .,!

648
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,207
Come now, don't play dumb!

649
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,111
You were looking at the amulet
Kazuha gave you all dreamy eyed...

651
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,212
No I wasn't.

652
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,915
This amulet's bad luck, I was
thinking of throwing it away!

654
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:54,819
But I didn't want something bad to
happen, that's why I'm holding on to it!
