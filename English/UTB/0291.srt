128

(0 guess it's some sort of local
event they came up with.

132
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,656
Mr. Kaneshiro's the mayor of
that island we were just on,

134
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,594
he told me that members of his family
have been kidnapped and robbed,

136
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:06,165

drunk anything for who knows how long

It was exactly a year ago that several

was a crew member

00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:41,840
It looks like he hasnnt fixed it,
the 'typhoon wrecked 'it though

311
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,409
I knew it was white!

312
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,715
You're right, it doesn't look
Iike it did the last time I saw it

314
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,985
I feel like I'm in another dimension...

315
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,255
You mean. you come to this island a lot?

316
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:00,359
Yeah. until two years ago.

317
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,159
I used to look out at this from my ship.

318
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,564
the ocean around here's full of
brown striped mackerel scad.

320
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:07,299
Brown striped mackerel scad?

321
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,034
You guys did too. didn't you?

322
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,673
Yeah. There's a great diving spot
right at the tip of this island...

324
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,909
But ever since they found that body.

325
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,979
Nobody comes near here,
it gives them the creeps

327
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,648
Hey guys well

328
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,717
Heiji and I will be discussing
things around here

330
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,555
SO you go look for other
spooky areas on this island!

332
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,724
Look for something that you
think will solve this mystery!

334
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:33,558
Okay!

335
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,762
What the...

336
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,166
he doesn't make this show sound so
serious. I bet he doesn't believe in me.

338
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:48,373
The Princess sleeps. not in B but A...

339
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,577
A & B probably refers to 1. 2 and 3

340
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,848
The Princess is sleeping in number
LWW OIT aa Nec THE Olga Hv

343
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,751
Hey Kudo. you got any ideas?

344
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,820
No. nothing...

345
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,124
You sure you haven't
figured it out already

347
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,161
but you don't want to tell me
cause you want beat me?

349
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,696
I wouldn't do that!

350
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:15,801
Listen, maybe it means the princess
sleeping face is the prettiest?

352
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,236
Hey wait!

353
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,871
Maybe it means .

354
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:24,843
The princess who's usually pretty I0OK™
gross when she's sleeping?

356
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,614
Hmm, that's not grossly impossible...

357
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,148
Hey! Pretty good!

358
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,284
Stop gabbing! Ninnies!

359
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,853
Aw, rats!

360
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,358
Ms. Taira's late. I wonder where she-is...

361
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,626
You're right .

362
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:45,797
It's been about an hour
since the rest of us got back to the ship.

365
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,334
Do you think she's still diving?

366
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,569
It's possible...

367
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:56,842
Wait up!

368
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:57,709
Hew!

369
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:03,315
I'll search from this side up to the shore!

370
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,217
Okay. I'll take this side!

371
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,087
Hey Miss Taira!
Where are you!

373
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,424
Miss Taira! Miss Taira!

374
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:13,525
Hey!

375
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,493
Hey!

376
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,742
MM. Miss: Taira»

377
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,810
Miss Taira!

378
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:40,819
What!

379
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,688
Miss Tara's been murdered?

380
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,289
Ihcan't believe it...

381
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,856
You've got to be kidding!

382
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,728
She was killed about 2 hours ago...

383
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,799
She was strangled
something like a thin rope

385
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,869
she probably got those scratches
on her arms and legs

387
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,507
when she struggled as
she was being strangled

389
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,279
Which means the murderer
killed her in the woods

391
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,183
then carried her out her to the beach
then ran away not too long ago...

393
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,254
after leaving this weird
message in the sand

395
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,725
I am the "guso's' messenger?

396
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,965
Hey young detective...

397
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,470
How do you know that the murderer
ran away not too long ago

399
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,771
it's easy!

400
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,706
Look over there!

401
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,576
The sand's wet up till there.

402
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:41,446
That means the water was up
to there during the high tide.

404
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,050
But the waves are just
below the words now,

406
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,085
you'd have had to write them recently

407
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,388
when the tide was low or the
waves would wash them away.

409
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,327
Let me also add that this place is exactly
on the other side of the boat landing!

411
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:00,632
We were all on the boat a hour
ago waiting for her to get back

413
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,468
This kid and I were the first
to go look for her,

415
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,470
we split up and went around the island

416
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,473
then we found her body. which means...

417
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,344
there's somebody else on
this island besides us

419
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:16,948
And that person strangled her to death!

420
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:17,716
No way...

421
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,051
Somebody besides us?

422
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:24,022
Kazuha, you've got a digital
camera, don't you

424
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,658
Uh, yes...
I have it with me

427
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,560
Alright then Kudo.

428
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,963
Let me have that glowing watch or yours
and one side of your sandal!

431
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,167
Eh? I understand about the
watch but why my sandal

433
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,803
Oh I get it. _.

434
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:41,273
You needed something to
show how big the words were

437
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:47,379
I have to take a picture now or they'll
get washed away at the next high tide

440
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,683
Hey what is this! You
didn't need my watch

442
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:53,685
I guess not.

443
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:58,990
Okay then let's carry her body back to the
boat before she gets washed out to sea!

445
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,859
Yeah, okay...

446
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,263
Who'd want to kill her though...

447
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,334
Maybe...there's something in the ocean?

448
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,536
Something inside the ocean?

449
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:16,274
You remember, she went snorkeling
as soon as she got to this island.

451
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,779
I'm sure there's something there for
her to be so dead set on diving here

453
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
What do you think they mean?

454
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:27,752
I don't know. bum! think it'd better if we
went back to.the boat now

456
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,988
and wait for daylight before
we investigate

458
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,624
I knew he'd say that...

459
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,061
Hey. what'd you do that for!

460
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:41,333
I don't believe him, he threw my sandal
knowing I'd see him and try to stop him

462
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,735
Somebody. stop Heiji!

463
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,304
He's going to go into the ocean!

464
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,207
So what. he's just going for a swim...

465
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,244
But the key to the murder's in the ocean?

466
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,313
That kid's got guts!

467
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,852
The current around! herefs fast and
to dive at night is reckless,

469
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,189
even a professional diver
could end up losing his life

471
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,390
What!

472
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,962
17] prettyssure it was around here...

473
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:13,632
Heiji'! Don't do it!

474
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,600
It's dangerous!

475
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,870
He. Hei!

476
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,409
What's that?

477
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:28,546
There's something black down there...

478
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,084
Is. that an...anchor?

479
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,427
Heiji!

480
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,964
Hew!

481
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,635
There he isl

482
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:55,373
Hew...
Hey, you swim pretty fast!

484
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,041
The current swept me away. you fool

485
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:00,345
What? You mean you knew the
current around here was fast?

487
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,212
Yeah.

488
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,615
Remember what those guys said?

489
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,918
About there being a lot of brown striped
mackerel scads around here

491
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,222
well, they're migratory fish that swim in
waters where there's a fast current

493
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,327
and there were a lot of seagulls flying
around trying to get the fish

495
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:21,099
Is that why you rushed
out to look for Miss Taira?

497
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,933
That's right!

498
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,503
I figured that if she was
still diving at that time.

500
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,606
She might've been carried out to sea...

501
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:35,280
But you know Heir,
you try too hard to look good!

503
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,750
You dummy! I just wanted to solve this
case as soon 1s possible

505
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:39,884
Yeah. sure!

506
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:44,222
I'm sure Heijji wouldn't be so
sneaky and cheat by getting

508
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:49,227
as much information possible beforehand
so that he can beat Kogoro tomorrow

510
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,796
You know me. I wouldn't do that...

511
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:59,137
Anyway, let's take Miss Taira's body back
to the cruiser first then talk things over

513
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,473
Where did you say you
were taking the body?

515
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,441
You heard me. I said the cruiser...

516
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,211
Hey. what the.

517
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,880
The cruiser's gone!

518
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:16,054
Hey you think that captain panicked when

519
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,454
he heard somebody got
killed and left us here

521
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,625
Fool! The only ones who <<
know it was murder is us.

523
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,395
we're the ones who found the body!

524
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,464
Then maybe he's the<murderer!

525
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:30,468
After we all left to 10Ok for Miss Taira,
he took the cruiser and got ahead of us,

527
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:35,373
carried her body out to the
beach and wrote those words.

529
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:42,180
Impossible! Conan and I were
scouring the shoreline at that time

531
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,050
We'd have noticed if the
cruiser went past us

533
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,319
It doesn't matter anyway...

534
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:53,124
It seems that captain holds
the key to this crime

536
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,961
Well anyway

537
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,131
We just have to wait for
someone to come rescue us

539
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,733
Yes, you're right...

540
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,503
When the TV station realizes their staff
hasn't returned by nightfall

542
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,772
I'm sure they'll come looking...

543
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,341
Uh. .don't hold your breath...

544
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:15,547
We weren't supposed to
come here until tomorrow .

546
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,751
We were having such a hard time getting
the boat and setting things up so we

548
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:23,655
decided to come here today instead,
and we didn't tell the producer...

550
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,789
You've got to be kidding!

551
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:28,927
Are you telling me no one:knows
we're on this deserted island)

553
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:33,932
Uh: 'Yeah. I told them we'd
et everything done tomorrow

555
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,839
I just hope you and that captain didn't
plan this to bring the ratings up!

557
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,807
Of course not!

558
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,343
Don't worry. everything'll be fine!

559
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,714
I'm sure Ran's father will notice we're
not back, he'll come looking for us

561
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,084
Let's wait inside that house!

562
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,069
Boy this awamori is the best!

563
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,708
Yes. it is this is a well cured sake,
I ordered it special so you'd relax

566
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,743
and your wits would be
sharpened for tomorrow's match

568
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:20,778

Hm) 5%

580
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:30,622
whatever the outcome...
I'll be prepared for it

582
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:37,262
I wonder what's keeping that Hattor
fellow, your daughter and the others

586
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:40,397
Oh. you don't have to worry about them

587
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:45,069
He probably doesn't want to
face me the night before the match

589
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,370
He probably doesn't want to
face me the night before the match

591
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,040
That seems pretty immature.

592
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,242
Let's forget about those kids,

593
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,945
I intend to drink until morning
and sharpen my wits!

595
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,982
Here's to my victory!

596
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:08,526
I think we're in a lot of trouble here...

597
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,961
I think so too .

647
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,342
The cigarette's not an expensive brand

648
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:08,913
and the water at the bottom of
the cup isn't completely dry yet

been several of them
