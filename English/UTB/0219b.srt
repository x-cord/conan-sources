W-What a guy!

00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:30,129
To fall onto the crowd
together with the screen

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,965
It s impossible
to find him among that crowd...

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,003
Yes...Me ure here

10
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,007
Hey! Megure!!
Are you the one who fired?!

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,643
No...I'm not the one who fired...

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,948
By the way, Inspector,
didn't he leave a message with you?

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,985
He did. something about a code...

16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,054
Code?

17
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,196
This is Greek to me...

19
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,469
Was a letter like this really carved
in the center of the face of the clock?

21
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:11,904
Yeah...that's it!

22
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,241
At any rate, that's important evidence...

23
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:18,344
We've got to have them
postpone moving the clock tower

25
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,312
until the code is deciphered...

26
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,883
I don't need you to tell me that!

27
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,385
Well, I guess all is well...

28
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:30,790
since the clock tower is safe
and his plan didn't work out...

30
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,293
No...wrong, Inspector Megure...

31
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,362
He left a code on the face of the clock

32
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,664
and left the clock tower
up to the police to take care of...

34
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,233
He took the clock tower away
from the hands of the owner

36
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,469
who was planning to have it moved...

37
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,305
Besides, it's written in the code, see?

38
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,607
You change the katakana characters
to roman characters,

40
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,378
and move the vowels one space
each clockwise and read it...

42
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,482
It says The bell will not toll for you."...

43
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,020
Come to think of it,
I still haven't asked you...

45
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,922
The name of the thief

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,258
Oh well...
I guess it doesn't really matter...

48
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,168
Are you waiting for somebody too?

49
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,805
I'm going out with daddy

50
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,777
But, he said he may be busy with work,
so we might not be able to go...

52
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:27,513
Here you go.

53
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,382

Is anything the matter?

60
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,879
Thanks to your remark
I just remembered something!

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,281
The clock tower incident,
when I was really in a fix...

64
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,885
And, whatever
became of that clock tower?

66
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,519
Oh, yeah

This is the sound of...

71
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,277
The police investigated afterwards,
and found out that the diamonds

73
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,579
were fake, so the city
bought it for a cheap price...

75
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,581
Okay! Shall we get going then!

Never be conceited, or take them lightly...

86
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,770
Look into their hearts

87
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,873
and concentrate all your nerves
so that you may look through them.

89
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,875
Give it all the skills you have...

90
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,377
Yet, keep smiling and be gracious.

Wow, talk about lucky...

247
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:32,303
How dare that guy at the service station
tell us to use this road...

249
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,642
Uh, Uh, Dad, is this really the right road?

250
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,210
Of course!

251
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,746
He took me into his stand
and sold this really expensive map

253
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:44,850
that he insisted was very explanatory
of this area too!

255
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:48,520
If this isn't the right road,
He's going to pay for it!

257
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,763
So, we've finally come out to
a normal looking road...

259
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,266
I guess he wasn't lying
when he said that this was a shortcut!

261
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:05,270
Because, see, isn't that it
on the Tight hand side?

263
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,539
The place that we're headed for...

264
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,010
It sure is an eerie looking building...

265
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,082
It looks more like Dracula's mansion,
than a Twilight Inn to me.

267
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,885
H-Hey, Dad; are we really going there?

268
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,385
O a place like that...?

269
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,757
You dummy! We've got no choice after
getting an invitation like that, do we?

271

as Dracula in Japan!

286

that called? A mountain witch...

00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,683
Now, what a way to greet
a woman at a first meeting...

291
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,152
Oh...I'm so sorry...

292
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,154
What are you doing out in a place
Iike this, granny?

294
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:31,757
Most obviously,

295
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:35,894
my cute little Fiat stalled on me...

296
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,897
So, I was waiting for someone: to...
Come by...

298
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:44,836
You folks are going to
the Twilight Inn too, aren't you?

300
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,339
If it's not too much trouble,
would you give me a lift?

302
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,577
Yes, why not. Go ahead
and ride in the back seat.

304
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,412
And, while you're at it,

305
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,615
would you please move my things
from my Fiat into your car?

307
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,216
On, all right...

308
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,718
Thank you so much...

309
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,467
Do we have a while more to go?

310
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:19,438
We've just got a little more to go,
but, is anything wrong?

312
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,674
I've got to go to the ladies room!

313
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,042
Ah, come on...

314
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:24,943
Miss?

315
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,145
I guess it's none of my business,

316
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,749
the principal. of*the:elementary school
of our town used to always say...

318
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,420
that people who succeed in life, are those
who never let an opportunity pass them by

320
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,423
Once you let the opportunity pass you by,

321
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,525
thinking that the same sort of
opportunity may come by again,

323
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,695
no matter how long you wait for it
to come by, it never will...

325
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,332
Why didn't you finish
what you wanted to do

327
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,967
when you stopped over
at the service station a while ago?

329
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,005
How did you know, granny?

330
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,807
That we stopped over
at the service station...

332
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,745
Very easy, little one...See, over there...

333
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:09,421
The empty ashtray and
the still new cigarette butts on the floor

335
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,390
goes to show that
you are a heavy smoker...

337
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,492
Yet, the ashtray us empty...

338
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,093
The only place you could've emptied it

339
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,897
is at the service station
about 10 kilometers away...

341
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:23,502
A gentleman who is nice enough
to give a strange old lady a lift

343
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,404
would never throw his cigarettes out of
the window of his car

345
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,638
in front of a young lady

346
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,076
Hey, hey, granny...

00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,444

hearing about cases in a comfy chair

371
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:49,226
Oh come on, flattering an old lady
will not get you anywhere...

373
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:51,797
So, she's the one...

374
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:56,334
Well then, I guess I'll keep this
ashtray for now...

376
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,335
Hey, wait!

377
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,807
Even if we get to the inn,
don't ever smoke in front of me!

379
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,544
I hate the smoke of cigarettes...

380
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:12,651
There's the Twilight Inn right in front of us.
Give. it all you got andsstep:on the:gas!

382
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:25,964
Uh...

383
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,064
Dad* open. the back, please!

384
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,074
The closer you get to it,
the more it looks like a haunted house...

386
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,576
Dad, I'm going to go on inside!

387
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,613
The ladies room, the ladies room...

388
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,286
Wow! Look at all those fancy cars!

389
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,324
A Mercedes Benz a Ferrari, a Porsche...

390
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,361
It sure is full of dangerous cars...

391
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,430
It's an Alfa Romeo!

392
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,000
Classy!

393
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:35,600
Hey!

394
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,872
Don't you go touching my girl like that...!

395
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,644
This one's a shrewd that
I finally tamed after 5 years...

397
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:51,016
I don't want her to get upset
over some strange man touching her

399
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,118
Right, flimsy mustache...

400
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,820
Flimsy mustache?!

00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,521
Hi there Mogi, it's been a while

Hey! Granny Senma

404
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,095
Which means you were invited here too...

Are you all right, though?

00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,841
I read in the papers that you were shot
by a Mafia in Chicago last week...

428
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,444
I've forgotten something so old...

429
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,582
And? Have you come around
to wanting to get married yet?

431
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,584
You're going to be 40 in three days,

Please come in...

439
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,986
Oh...Well, this is...

Please put your umbrellas here...

Yes, sir! Please excuse me...

444
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,501
I just went to the kitchen, but...

445
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,703
If I remember correctly, he's...

446
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,505

I cherish that uplift
and stimulate my brain cells!

00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,432

00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,871
I'm so sorry...

484
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,106
to have kept you waiting

485
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,176
Why did you summon four detectives up

486
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,546
to a remote place
in the mountains like this for?

488
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,781
Well,

489
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,451
we actually invited
six detectives altogether.

491
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:08,286
Hey, hey,

492
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,322
are you telling me that
there are two more detectives?

495
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,656
1 CO,

496
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,458
another woman and a young man...

497
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,293
Young man.

498
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,461
Don't tell me it's Shinichi?!

499
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,862
No way!

500
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,897
I think it's Heiji

501
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,699
Right?!

503
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,470
Two other detectives were

504
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,939
4 also included in the master's list,

505
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,141
but Mr. Kudo could not be contacted,

506
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,812
and as for Mr. Hattori,
we got a call from his mother saying

508
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,815
that he can't make it
because he's got an exam coming up...

511
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,416
Because those two were cancelled,

512
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,387
the master okayed Mr. Mourn

513
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:45,056
to bring two members of his family.

517
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,195
And where is this detective lover weirdo?

518
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,796
I have no idea...

519
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,499
since I, myself has never met him yet...

520
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,135
But, you got the list from him, didn't you?

521
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,003
Yes,

522
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,674
I did get this list when I came here
for an interview to be hired as a maid.

524
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:03,808
But,

525
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,510
it was a very peculiar type of interview.

526
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,012

561
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:15,320
When I entered the interview room,

562
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,989
all I saw there was a computer,

563
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,425
an explanation of the dinner,

564
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,727
and a list of the invitees on the desk.

565
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,030
Nobody was in the room.

566
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,266
So, having no choice I started reading

567
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:30,402
the papers as instructed on the PC,

568
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,771
when I sudden]! heard a noise.

569
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,006
% RA U
Then. I saw the sentence,

571
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,409
FERAL mM
You are hired
on the screen of the computer.

574
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,511
Then,

575
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,447
you don't know why you were hired?

577
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,184
But you must've at least heard his voice?

578
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,254
You did say that he gave you an okay,
didn't you?

580
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:54,858
Well, all the details were exchanged
by mail using a cell phone.

582
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,531
This sounds really interesting.

583
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,034
The thrill is killing me.

584
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,570
I was already electrified the minute

585
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,540
I saw the strange pattern of that door!

586
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,043
It sure does look strange.

587
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,345
I wonder what it is a pattern of...

588
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,047
Be careful, baby.

589
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,850
If I'm not mistaken, that's probably
the remains of an old blood stain.

591
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,820
What?!

592
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,556
You're joking, aren't you?

593
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,458
No, they re real blood stains.

594
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,695
The remains of blood that had splattered

595
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,099
at just about a 45 degree angle
to the door.

597
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,967
Not only the door

598
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,169
On the wall there are the remains of
blood stains streaming downward.

600
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,671
On the floor,
there are droplet blood stains.

602
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,740
Although they have been wiped away,

603
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,243
there are blood stains soaked here
and there everywhere in this house...

605
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,682
It seems that these blood stains

606
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,084
are not just those of one or two people.

607
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,219
Just as expected of you...

608
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,758
Luminol...

609
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,761
When it is sprayed onto blood stains,

610
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,931
It oxidizes because of
the active oxygen within the blood,

612
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,968
and emits a bluish
purple fluorescent color

614
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,204
You make good deductions.

615
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,706
Ex-coroner...

616
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:15,073
Ms. Ikumi Soda.

617
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:15,707

649
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,219
H-Hakuba?

650
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,755
You mean you're
Police Superintendent Hakuba's...

654
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,259
Police Superintendent Hakuba

655
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,894
Is my father indeed,

656
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:36,761
Mr. Mouri.

657
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,568
A-An eagle?!

658
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,539
Oh, I'm sorry to have scared you.

659
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,442
Whether it was because Watson here
was accompanying me in Britain,

661
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,546
I'm not sure but he has become
very sensitive to the smell of blood.

663
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,781
W-Watson

664
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,918
I'm sure glad
I came all the way back home, though...

666
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,953
After all, here I am standing at the scene

667
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,855
of the tragedy that
has been hidden for ages.

669
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,957
One that I have only heard of as rumors.

670
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,460
I'm here at last after a period of 40 years.

671
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,698
This is more than I could ask for
to awaken my intellectual excitement.

673
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,900
Tragedy

674
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,050
Oh, no...

675
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,285
You're pretty good.

676
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,688
Why, thank you...

677
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,093
How about this,

678
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,962
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro?

679
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:46,964
All right!

680
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,000
Look, look, I've got a straight!

681
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,469
So, I win again!

682
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,472
She sure is as stron: as ever, I tell ou...

683
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,873
Wait a minute,

684
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,845
Now, let's not cheat, Ran.

685
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,081
See, the Jack to your very left.

686
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,949
You've got one on top of the other,
don't you?

689
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,518
Oh; you ré right.

690
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,454
I'm sorry, I didn't realize it.

692
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:14,392
They seem to have-been stuck together
from the start, though...

694
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,132
What's wrong, Ran?!

695
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,201
There's blood on the playing card!

696
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:27,672
Oh my, my! blood has splattered
there too, I see.

698
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,141
Come to think of it, the maid was saying

699
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,944
that the things here are just
as they were at the time of the crime

701
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:35,179
That practically nothing has been moved.

702
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,915
WwW Which means that something
happened in this room too.

704
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,520
Thank you all for waiting.

705
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,188
Dinner is ready

706
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,190
so please come to the dining room.

707
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,326
The master is waiting for you.

708
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,062
So, the big boss finally
makes his a earance...

710
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,297
I can't wait to see him.

711
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,105
I somehow don't seem
to have an appetite.

713
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,478
Here we are.

714
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,286
Please go on inside.

715
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:22,694
Hey, hey,

716
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,695
what's with that attire of yours?

717
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,798
I think you've been watching too much TV.

718
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,868
To you all, the distinguished
and famed 6 detectives!

720
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,339
Welcome to the Twilight Inn.

721
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,843
Well then, won't you all take your seats?

722
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,487
Take the dishes out
just like I instructed you to a while ago.

724
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,822
Oh, yes sir...

725
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,190
Now,

726
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,226
the reason why ll invited you all over here,

727
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,195
is because I want you to find the treasure

728
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,099
that I have hidden somewhere in here.

729
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,968
I want you to find
the enormous amount of riches

731
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,471
that I have accumulated over the years

732
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,905
And, risk your lives to do so.

733
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,774
R-Risk our lives?!

734
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,813
What was that sound?!

735
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,615
No need to worry

736
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,017
I just made sure
that you'd be stranded here.

738
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:20,752
What?!

739
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,422
I am always being chased around
by all of you.

741
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:29,794
So, I thought I'd experience being the one
to corner you for once.

743
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,697
Besides, I also did away with the bridge

744
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,499
that you crossed to come here,

745
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,100
so even if you had your cars,

746
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,302
you wouldn-t have been able to
makerit out of here anyway.

748
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,472
Of course there is no telephone here,

749
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,875
and the cell phone is
out of range of the signal waves.

751
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,944
So it is impossible to get help
from someone on the outside.

753
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,646
Yes...

754
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,981
half of the treasure,

755
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:53,284
as well as the solution as to
how to get out of here

757
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:56,687
will be given only to the one
who finds the treasure.

759
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,790
This is the game...

760
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,791
How do you like the idea?

761
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,228
I just don't take well to people like you

762
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,399
who go around fleeing about
hiding under a mask like that.

764
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,339
Come now,
you can't work on an emp. stomach.

766
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,242
Please enjoy the dinner
to your heart s content, the last supper.

768
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:20,378
A speaker is attached
to the neck of a mannequin?!

770
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:22,680
Who...

771
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,016
Who on earth could be doing this?!

772
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,850
My...

773
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,853
A persongasgrenowned as you, Mr. Mouri,
had no idea why you were called here?

775
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:32,957
It was written in black
and white in the invitation4letter

777
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,660
1 he'Phantomrof a God-Forsaken«Child <<

778
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,530
- The phantom...

779
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,498
The phantom...

780
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,500
That is something
that appears unexpectedly

782
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,968
and has no concrete body.

783
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:45,803
The word child in the sentence

784
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,039
Is written with the Japanese character *
attached to the left.

786
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,272
So it refers tosthe child of a beast,

787
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:51,275
because this character is used:o write
words like coltTand puppy in Japanese.

789
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,679
The God forsaken beast
in the New Testament,

791
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,349
refers to the goat that
could not receive the blessings of God.

793
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,452
Therefore, it refers to a baby]goat?

794
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,622
And, of course, a goat is a goat,

795
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,958
but a baby-goat in English is called...

796
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:08,960
a kid...

797
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,361
W-What?!

798
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:13,831
Maybe this will make it
easier to understand,

801
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:14,732
kid the phant wm thief

802
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,901
Kid the phantom thief
Sool
kid the phantom thief

806
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,135
H-Hey,

808
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,370
don t«tell me that...

809
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:20,637
Don't tell me that...

810
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:21,739
Right,

811
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,008
He never lets the prey
that he is after escape.

813
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,911
The way he carries out his feat
Is practically like magic.

815
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:30,081
He is a genius criminal
that confuses the police

817
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,950
with faces and voices
that are as limitless as the stars...

819
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,453
He's the main dish

820
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,289
that we, the detectives, drool to savor...

821
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,059
He's a stuck-up villain
that I would sure like to throw into jail.

823
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,564
He is the only instance so far
that has ever thrown me off...

825
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:51,636
People who have seen him in the dark
dressed in his white outfit call him...

827
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,739
The Thief Kid!
