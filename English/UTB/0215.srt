And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,090
Today s episode is a true suspense story.

5
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,558
Two incidents happen
in places that are far apart.

What a nice sunset...

15
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:13,766
Just watching it, takes all of
today's exhaustion away...

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,368
You can say that again.

18
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,006
I'm about to forget that you got stingy
about paying rental car charges,

20
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,509
so we end up being stalled
in a placedike this.

22
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,346
Is anything wrong?

23
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,984
This us the entrance to our villa.

24
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,687
It's not a parking lot...

25
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,656
Or, did you want to talk to me?

26
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,761
Oh, I'm so sorry.

We've come on a family trip,
but the car broke down.

00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,400
My name IS Kogoro Mourn.

30

Please don't worry,
we're not suspicious people.

32

00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,793
there is trial for well-known cases?!

51
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:18,731
He's the lawyer that'll do anything
for money, if I remember correctly.

53
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,968
Well, most of the cases that I handle are
dangerous. That's why I'm always in a fix,

55
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,904
because of people coming after my life.

He s got a very unique type of fur...

77
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,847
What kind of dog is he?

78
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,449
The thing is, I don't know.

79
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,953
The maintenance man of this villa
picked him up

81
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,822
I'm just keeping him as a watch dog.

82
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,658
Is that right
Well, aren't you a luc « dog, Johan!

84
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:28,100
This is Indeed a case of Buddha in Hell!

85
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,070
I thought that I'd have to give up
eating fish for tonight,

87
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:33,272
but to think that I get to eat all this food!

88
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,474

115
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,568
After hearing that Mr. Mouri
stopped by here tonight,

117
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,069
I regained my appetite.

118
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,039
Would you all ike to have some wine too?

119
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,439
I don't think so,

120
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,975
because we're having
some local sake just now.

122
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,713
Yes, hot Japanese white wine.

123
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,318

I didn't want anything to happerO
while you were on vacation,

136
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,350
so, I figured that
it'd be better for me to bring it over.

138
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,453
Oh, Mr. Mourn

He's the renowned detective,
Mr. Kogoro Mourn!

155
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,866
Why don't you go ahead and join us

157
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,302
Thank you very much.

158
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,739
What?! You don't have the parts?!

159
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,943
You mean you can't get it until tomorrow?
What'll we do for now?

161
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:18,877
Mr. Mourn!

162
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,280
Why don't you spend the night here?

163
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,218
You were on a trip anyway, weren't you?

164
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,987
Oh, this is the Tachibana residence,

165
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:31,056
please repair the car so it works like new,
even if it takes time.

167
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,858
Yes, thank you.

168
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,461
So, Mr. Mourn,

169
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,596
please take it easy to your heart's content.

170
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,598
Ce Thank you...

171
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,534
Talk about rich!

172
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,672
A western stile mansion made of stone
and a hot spring white cedar bath!

174
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,475
Lawyers sure must make a lot of money!

175
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,011
Rather,

176
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,681
it just goes to show that Mr. Tachibana
Is the type of lawyer he is rumored to be.

178
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:03,489
What's with these figures?!

179
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,727
Don't tell me that you're embezzling
money from the office?

181
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,697
This has been happening ever
since I've left accounting up to you!

183
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,467
I wonder if a man who can't even control
the way his wife wastes money,

185
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,137
has any right to say
anything about accounting?

187
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,640
I hear that your wife
Is taking revenge on you...

189
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,375
Revenge?

190
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,645
Will you hurry up and divorce her,

191
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:30,115
make money under the table,
circulate finances or,

193
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,485
do something for the sake of the office?!

194
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:37,156
You'd better do something before
what's-his-name T.K Kills you!

196
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:42,828
Wow,

197
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,997
What does she mean by revenge?

198
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,033
And, the initials 1 XK...

199
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,002
Hey!

200
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,837
Do you have anything on her yet?

201
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,138
No, not yet...

202
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,173
Rats!

203
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,942
That's why you can never
pass the bar exam!

205
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,111
Pardon me sir,

206
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,647
but you're the one who's not
giving me time to study!

208
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,049
Why do I have to do things
other than my own duties.

210
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,654
Don't you dare talk back to me!

211
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,291
Your rudeness will not
be accepted anywhere!

213
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,940
I can't eat anymore...

214
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,445
Johan, you sure can eat, can't you?

215
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,384
Oh, you're up already?

216
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,219
Good morning!

217
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,821
Did you sleep well last night?

218
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,157
Yes thank you very much.

219
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,527
I'll go and get a big catch today too,
SO you can expect a delicious dish today.

221
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,430
Ism-sorry for us intruding on you like this.

222
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,499
Don't worry about it.

223
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,868
Take your time and relax here
until your car is repaired.

225
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,637
I'm enjoying your company here too.

226
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,305
Mr. Tachibana, your lunch.

228
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,842
Take care of things for me then, will you.

229
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,245
Bye!!

230
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,829
Johan is barking...

231
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,130
I wonder what's wrong?

232
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,432
I'm sorry,

233
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,801
I think he wants to go for a walk.

234
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:35,307
I was busy in the morning
since Mrs. Tachibana decided to go home.

236
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,709
God, I'm in a fix,

237
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,579
because I have to head back
to Tokyo right now...

239
00:09:41,548 --> 00:09:44,049
We could take Johan for a walk for you.

240
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,286
We've got to do something to repay you
for all the hospitality we're receiving,

242
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,787
right Dad?

243
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,322
I guess so.

244
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,558
We ve got to go to
the repair shop anyway too.

246
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,960
Really?

247
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,363
That would really be a great help.

248
00:09:58,698 --> 00:09:59,565
No problem,

249
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,133
no big deal!

250
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,336
Hey, wait, Johan!

251
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,805
Cut out your running!

252
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:07,773
Hey!

253
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,278
I'm telling you to stop!

254
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:14,947
I'm pooped!

255
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,515
Break time! Break time!

256
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,784
I'm not going to move an inch from here!

257
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,457
You two sure get along, don't you?!

258
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,558
No way!

259
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:30,762
I'm just trying to get along with him
because his master's been so nice to us!

261
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,968
What's up, Johan?

262
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,675
Johan, where are you going?

263
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,710
Wait for me!

264
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:50,983
Do. ou like boats, Johan?

265
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,619
Maybe he knew someone on the boat.

266
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:02,226
Well, well...

267
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,496
It sure looks delicious!

268
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,231
Dig in!

269
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,733
It sure does!

270
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,770
The view is fantastic
andvitésureffeels good!

272
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,205
What?"

273
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,973
Isn't something wrong with that boat?

274
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,209
It's tilted at such a sharp angle...

275
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,648
Don't tell me that's Mr. Tachibana's boat!

276
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,783
What!

277
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:26,018
Hey!

278
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,920
It's capsizing!

279
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,021
Oh no!

280
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,690
Yaeko

281
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,225
please call the police!

282
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,459
Y-Yes, Sir.

283
00:11:56,349 --> 00:12:00,619
Are you sure that
he is Mm Kensuke Tachibana?

285
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,821
Y-Yes...

286
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,090
There is no mistake, it's him...

287
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,094
It just happened to be high tide,
so we had a hell of a time rescuing him.

289
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,163
It just happened to be high tide,
so we had a hell of a time rescuing him.
Mr Inoki (28)

Mr Inoki (28)

296
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,432
I'm sorry it turned out this way.
Mr Inoki (28)
a police officer

300
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:13,865
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

301
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,336
Officer,

302
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,838
wasn't Mr. Tachibana
wearing a life jacket?

304
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,909
Yes, I'm sure he was wearing one
when he left this morning!

306
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:25,310
Are you sure?!

307
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,879
Then why isn't he wearing it now?!

308
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,882
There are people who take
their life jackets off when it gets hot.

310
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,853
Therefore, we have a lot of accidents
Iike this happening!

312
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,022
But, it's winter now.

313
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,791
And, no matter how warm they say
this part of the region is...

315
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,760
He could've stayed afloat

316
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,663
€e was wearing 1s le jac ee an ye

317
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,234
My God,

318
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,871
and I warned«shim to be careful
because theiwaves wereshigh.

320
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,540
What a thing to have happened.

321
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:01,713
The more so it's hard to believe that
he would take off his life jacket.

323
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,251
Excuse me, may I ask who you are?

324
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,555
I'm Inuyama,
who rented the boat out to Mr. Tachibana.
Hiroshi Inuyama (70)
an owner of a boat rental shop

329
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,524
I own that boat rental shop over there.

330
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,262
To tell you the truth, a boat of the same model
as the one he rented was stolen.

332
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,831
I wonder if you could look for it,
while you're at it?

334
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,766
Are you sure?

335
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,800
Yeah!

336
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:26,204
The kids saw a guy wearing
a red baseball cap sail away on it.

338
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,774
Oh, we saw that boat too!

339
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,042
From the cape over there!

340
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,010
And, which way did it go?

341
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,413
Where would that direction be?

342
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,815
Since it was the road:below the cliff,

343
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,351
the boat was blocked by,
and sailed out of sight.

345
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,722
That's in the direction
where Mr. Tachibana had the accident.

347
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,593
Then, it could be that the boat rammed
into Mr. Tachibana's boat!

349
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,130
But, we saw it
about 2 hours before the accident.

351
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,802
But something bothers me
about that man.

353
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:01,273
It could be the man
who came to the villa once before.

355
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,240
What?!

356
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,311
A man who came to visit Mr. Tachibana
about 2 months ago

358
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,181
was also wearing a red baseball cap

359
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,650
He had an argument with Mr. Tachibana...

360
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,553
If he was the same man,

361
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:18,090
he probably stole the boat
to get close to Mr. Tachibana.

363
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,893
We'll begin a search for
the boat.immediately!

365
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,128
Oh, that'll be a great help!

366
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,308
Oh, officer...

367
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:37,642
What is it you want?

368
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,678
I am afraid no one is back yet...

369
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,147
We've got the results of the autopsy.

370
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,649
What shall we do, Officer Baba?

371
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,052
Let's wait!
Mr. Baba (42)
a police officer
2 BAN

376
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,221
I'd like to watch
Mr. Mouri makes his deduction too.
Mr. Baba (42)
a police officer

382
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:51,590
O-Okay...

383
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,559
What do you mean
you want to watch Pop's deduction?

385
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,997
Mr. Mouri is pretty well-known
around here too.

387
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,867
Besides, according to the rumor,

388
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:05,470
I hear he dances to Yoko Okino's music
as he makes deductions!

390
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,240
The so-called, "Dancing Kogoro™!

391
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,876
Just what are they talking about anyway?

392
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,311
Sleeping pills?!

393
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,782
That's what you found in him?

394
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,116
Yes,

395
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,919
it seems that
after taking the sleeping pills,

397
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,755
he fell in the water
while asleep and drowned

399
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:28,193
Did Mr Tachibana show any signs
of possibly committing suicide?

401
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,929
I wonder, suicide...

402
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,766
He could never have been
thinking of suicide!

404
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,500
Because...

405
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,638
You can be expecting a good meal today
because I'm going to go and get a big catch

407
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,809
He also told us to relax
and make ourselves at home

409
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,411
because he enjoyed our company.

410
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,213
I see...

411
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,550
Which means somebody
must've made him drink it.

413
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,424
I just got back.

414
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,494
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.
I'll get dinner ready right away.

416
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,763
Ms. Kamei?

417
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:05,630
Out shopping?

418
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:06,932
Yes,

419
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,503
because the people from the office
will also be gathering here.

421
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,372
I can see that you're busy,

422
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,042
but could we ask you a few questions?

423
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:17,909
Yes.

424
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,246
What kind of lunch did
Mr. Tachibana take with him?

426
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,217
Sandwiches and hot coffee.

428
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,352
What kind of sandwiches were they?

429
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:31,656
Hamburger patty. pickles,
vegetable salad, and onions.

431
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,159
Exactly what came out in the autopsy

432
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,996
Which means that
Mr. Tachibana ate his lunch.

434
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:42,334
And, Mr. Sakuraba was the one
who gave the lunch to Mr Tachibana?

436
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:46,538
Mrs. Tachibana suddenly asked me
to do something for her,

438
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,541
so he gave the lunch
to Mr. Tachibana for me.

440
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:54,112
So, that's makes it possible for three
people to have mixed in sleeping pills.

442
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,882
N-Nobody would put
something like that inside!

444
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,684
What's this about sleeping pills?

445
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,953
Mr. Sakuraba?

446
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,288
Y-Yes...

447
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,055
Y-Yes...

448
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,259
Did you know that Mr. Tachibana
has passed away?

450
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,959
Yes.

451
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,462
I heard so from the officer
in the parking lot just now.

453
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,899
By the way,
where were you until this time of day?

455
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:18,536
1, I was at the Tokyo office
doing something for Mr. Tachibana!

457
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,607
I heard that the boat that Mr. Tachibana
was in capsized and he drowned.

459
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,377
Now, what does this have to do
with sleeping pills?!

461
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:31,149
It seems that someone
sneaked sleeping pills into his coffee.

463
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,118
Oh, no...

464
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,790
The guy who was wearing
the red baseball cap may have done it.

466
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,928
Right, that's another possibility!

467
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,265
It seems that a strange-letter
was received too, right, Mr. Sakuraba?

469
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:48,967
A strange letter?

471
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:50,935
«xv,

472
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:53,405
Mr. Tachibana had been receiving
blackmail recently...

474
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,140
Blackmail?!

475
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,575
Why didn't you mention it earlier!?

476
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,713
Here they are!

477
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,982
The same thing is written on
all three of them!

481
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,987
If you donst want your lawyer's license
revoked get 3,000;000 yen ready.

485
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,121
TX...

488
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,525
This is indeed blackmail!

489
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,993
In the diary says,

490
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,031
The guy is a hopeless devil,
blackmailing me .

492
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:24,469
After I win him an innocent verdict
despite the crime-that" he committed ~

494
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,839
Mr. Sakuraba, do you have any idea
what the initials T.K. stand for?

496
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,108
No, that's...

497
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,045
You're not being very clear...

498
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,314
According to the diary it looks to be

499
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,651
that Mr. Tachibana won this person
an innocent verdict knowing that

501
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,053
this T.K. committed the crime,

502
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,122
and you knew nothing of it?

504
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,761
I just happened toscome across the letter
when I was clearing the papers out.

506
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,031
Mr. Tachibana got angry
and told me to forget about it

509
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,005
The people from the office have arrived.

510
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,708
We'll go over right now.

00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,588
Well, there were some trivial things
we wanted to check on so.

528
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,123
Where us Mrs. Tachibana?

529
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,459
She's waiting at her residence
with the other members of the family

531
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,796
Where is Sugi...who was it.

532
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,031
You mean Ms. Sugimura?

533
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:30,735
She's off on Saturdays and Sundays
and seems to have/gone out.

535
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,237
We can't get a hold of her

536
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,213
There it is!

537
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,286
A red baseball cap!

538
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,622
We've got to report this immediately
to Officer Baba!

540
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,291
I'm sorry to be intruding on you
so early in the morning,

542
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,127
but we found what seems to be evidence

543
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,563
This red baseball cap.

544
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,031
Have any of you seen it before?

545
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,368
It's the same color as the one the person
sailing the boat was wearing!

547
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:05,904
I see...

548
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,339
What about you, Ms. Kamei?

549
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:12,043
Yes I'm sure it looked like that.

550
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,613
Actually, there is a name on this cap

551
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:17,248
Please take a look.

552
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,185
Do you have any idea
who thissnam Kumada refers to?

554
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,155
No, not at all.

555
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,323
How about you?

556
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,758
I have no idea.

557
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,526
Hey, Mr. Sakuraba,

558
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,395
isnt Mr. Kumada the one

559
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,964
that Mr. Tachibana
defended about 5 years ago?

561
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,733
The hearing that they had, the same year
you came to Mr. Tachibanass office?

563
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:38,603
Oh, yes, him?!

564
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,739
And!
Did that person get an innocent verdict?

566
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:42,841
Yes,

567
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,477
although the circumstances
seemed to be against him,

569
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,413
Mr. Tachibana won him
an innocent verdict

571
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,381
His name was Tatsuya...

572
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,584
I think it was Tatsuya Kumada!

573
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,452
Tatsuya Kumada!

574
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,187
The initials would be...

575
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,593
So, we've got a connection here
with the initials

577
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,727
that were on the letters of blackmail!

578
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,596
This could be...

579
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,434
Although the man called Kumada
was blackmailing Mr. Tachibana,

581
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,003
he was probably being ignored.

582
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,472
Or maybe Mr. Tachibana,
on the contraryatold him

584
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,541
that he would press charges
of blackmail against the guy!

586
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,111
So, he goes all the way to
where Mr. Tachibana is fishing

588
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,482
and forced him to drink sleeping pills,
took off his life jacket and drowned him.

590
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,317
It fits In, Officer Baba!

591
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,086
Okay, Officer Inoki1!

592
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:31,022
Let's go search for
Kumada as a prime suspect!!

594
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,290
Yes, sir!

595
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,966
But, just think that he's: living In
a place only 25 minutes from the villa!

597
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,536
That makes him even more suspicious.

598
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,703
I guess we've got him!

599
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,573
And how come you're tagging along?!

600
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:52,143
Because I witnessed the man
wearing the red baseball cap!

602
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,783
Strange

603
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,587
I hear that he is a night owl
who is asleep in the mornings.

605
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,390
The door's not locked.

606
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:06,858
What?!

607
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,194
Mr. Kumada, we're coming in...

608
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,673
W-What is this?!

609
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,108
The suspect Kumada...

610
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:27,745
has committed suicide!

Ms Sugimura.

660
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,575
Why do you, who only
came to the office three years ago,

662
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,544
know of the case
that happened 5 years ago?

664
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,945
I hear that your father committed suicide

665
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:12,983
because of your husband,
didn't he, Mrs. Tachibana?

667
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:17,622
I hear you've embezzled
quite a large sum of money?

669
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,324
Don't be ridiculous!!

670
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,392
I get it!

671
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,228
So, that's what happened!
