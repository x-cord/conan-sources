00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,804
Because we cherish them
we can continue

5
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,606
The point is in the fishing and trolley

6
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,575
we: reveal the truth
that-goes against common sense

8
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,343
He sees through the one and only truth,

00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,477

no case is left unsolved

16
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,449
Invited by Sonoko,

17
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,120
we all come to ,3 bass fishing contest
held at Lake Okutan.

19
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,622
There, we meet the candidates
for championship

21
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,290
Ms Saori \ ukawa and

22
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,259
Mr. Takuya Masubuchi

23
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,697
as well as free-lance writer
Mr. Toshihiko Funaki.

25
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,066
The competition for the 1st day ends.

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,835
It's a bit of a concern that

27
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,404
that night, Mr. Funaki and Mr. Masubuchi
get into an argument,

29
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,941
and sure enough, the following day,

30
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,144
very near the place we were fishing

31
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,013
Mr. Funaki is found dead
from a stron im act to his head.

34
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,686
I wonder if that place is cursed...

35
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,522
Cursed?!

36
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,724
Mr. Minai, what do you mean?

37
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,995
The thing is, somebody diedithere
6 months ago too.

39
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,863
Who is the person that died?

40
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,765
A person called" Mr. Kanie.

41
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,501
Who was also good friends with
Ms. Ayukawa and Mr. Masubuchi.

43
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:53,005
A person died there a half a year ago.

44
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,174
This is nocoincidence.

45
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,444
The murderer is probably one of the two!

50
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,691
Okay,
Iet's start with you, Mr. Masubuchit...

52
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:18,080
Please tell me where you were
between 10:00 to 10-30...

55
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:21,400
Between 1000 to 10:30...

56
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,802
I was under the steel bridge
at that time...

58
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,772
The steel bridge?!
On which side of the steel bridge!

60
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,373
On the side where the road is!

61
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,075
What. the side where the road is?

62
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,810
Yes, that's right!

65
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,214
he steel«bridge is...
where Mr. Funaki was killed!

68
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,448
He was found«in.a grassy area
about 100 meters upstream.

70
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,151
He was found in a. grassy area,
about 400 meters upstream.

72
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:44,356
It Seems so. I was surprised at
thefigreat number of police there.

74
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,691
Imm.

75
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:50,629
I think that he would've had to walk
behind you\to-get to"that grassy area...

78
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,366
Didn't you notice Mr. Funaki
walk behind you?

80
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,903
No. I didn't because...
I was absorbed in fishing...

82
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,006
Is there anyone

83
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,674
who can testify that you didn't move
from under the steel bridge...?

85
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,044
No alibi. eh...

86
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,880
Mr. Masubuchi was near there...?

87
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,899
What is it?!

88
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,985
May I go now...?

89
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,122
O.Oh, yeah...l may ask you
some questions again later

91
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,594
S.Sonoko...

92
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,395
Hmm.

93
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,232
Nobody heard any scream...

94
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,900
The rock where he hit his head
cant be found...

96
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,772
Conan,
are you going to quit fishing-already?

98
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,643
I don't feel up to it anymore.
But. if you guys want to. go-ahead

100
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,814
Yes...yeah...yeah...okay.

101
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,582
Inspector,

102
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,518
we checked the alibis/of everyone,

103
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,620
from those who broughtitheir own boats
to those who rented boats: but.

105
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,723
Nobody seems to have gone near
the place the corpse was found!

107
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,126
So. the boat wasn't used...

108
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,562
Which means it's somebody that was
alone on the left shore of the lake.

113
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,066
A Vi 7,
¢ 'HH ray. ,
Which means it's somebody that was
alone on the .left shore of the lake.

118
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,570
Ta Imspestoénst right

119
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,073
I went 10 the inn that the victim
stayed over at last night,

121
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,659
and I was bothered by something
that one of the guests said.

123
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,311
Bothered?

124
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,278
Yes,

125
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,749
he says that the victim and Masubuchi
were arguing in the bath room

127
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,085
I see! Okay!

129
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,597
Hey. kids, .it's not for you to listen.

130
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,933
We're fishing

131
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:35,967
SN TA

133
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,770
we figured if the candidate for champions
Mr. Masubuchi picked this place to fish,

135
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,373
we maybe ablejto get a large
catch here too...

137
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,409
Yeah, something as big as a whale,
kyaha, ha. ha...

139
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,012
If we fish something, that large,
we won't be able to take itthome

141
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:52,050
If we get to fish something like that,
we'll be able to boast about it in school...

143
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,153
All talk you, kids, I tell you.

144
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:59,024
So. how about it. Mr. Masubuchi?

145
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,362
Silence could work against you

146
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:08,133
because a lot of people have:seéen you
and Mr Funaki arguing.

148
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,835
Mr. Funaki...

149
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,103
r. Funaki...?

150
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,722
Mr. Funaki said something ridiculous

151
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:16,540
that's why I couldn't help shouting at him.

152
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,709
Something ridiculous...

153
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:19,811
Well...

154
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,045
Well...

155
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,683
Hie insisted that...
I hiked Ms. Ayukawa...

157
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,520
and that he'd play go-between for us.

158
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,822
That's why I sort of blew my top!

159
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:31,189
That's why I sort of blew my top!

160
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,592
Oh. is that all?

162
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,531
Mr. Funaki said that Ms. Ayukawa
would never refuse any offer from him.

164
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,701
Ms -Ayukawa would never refuse
any offer from Mr. Funaki ?!

166
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,637
- - Come to think of it. even last night

167
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,140
she followed Mr*Funaki
despite looking very unwilling...

169
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,548
A person also died here 6 months-ago...

170
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,551
Conan, what are
we going to do in a place like this?

172
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,721
Thelpolice already came here
and searched,

174
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,189
so I'm sure we won't find anything here either

175
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,025
Let's go home...

176
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,927
Mitsuhikoss right.

177
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,645
The murder weapon wasn't here.

178
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:13,965
Moreover,
we didn't even hear Mr. Funaki scream.

180
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,086
Trolley... .train...7?

181
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,224
The smell of kerosene...

182
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:39,558
The stain on the vest...

183
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,393
The stain on the vest...

184
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,010
I get it!!

186
00:07:42,512 --> 00:07:44,629
Genta! Mitsuhiko!
Let's trace these tracks!

188
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,831
What?

189
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,467
Mr. Funaki wasn't killed here!

190
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,201
What?!

191
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:49,501
I dm a...ke a ea
What?!

193
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,405
Théeyplace where Mr. FunaKi was Killed
IS: somewhere along the tracks!

195
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,106
Let's go!

196
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,746
How far-are we goingtogo...
There's nothing...

198
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,849
Tia "aw
Okutani Station soon

201
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,082
We 're~going-to:reach
Okutani"Station.soon...

204
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:04,549
We're goingrto.reach
Okutani Stationsoon.?.

206
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,117
I'm sure we'll find something...

209
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:20,365
Isn't that Mr. Funaki'sy?

211
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:24,169
The actual murder site is here!
But.how...?

213
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:35,247
Excuse me, did anybody come on
this bridc e between 10:00 to 10:30?

217
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,582
What about a.camera man?

218
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:42,020
Yeah, at about 9:50,
he came from the direction of the dam

221
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,156
and went down the steps
that you all just came up

223
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:45,390
and went down the steps
that you all just came up.

225
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,893
Did anyone cross this bridge after that?

226
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:52,597
Not one person until the police cars
ame and this place got boisterou.

228
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:58,169
Early in the morning Ms. Ayukawa
came and went down the steps. though...

230
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,704
Ms. 'Ayukawa did!

231
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,574
Yes, at about 7:30. I think it was.

232
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,076
She came back after
about 10 minutes though.

234
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:15,270
So, Ms. \ ukawa did come after all.
T how...

236
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,090
Conan, I just remembered,
We gotta return the boat.

238
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,960
Conan, I just remembered,
We gotta return ithe boat

240
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:26,798
Genta. you said that you saw
Ms Ayukawa go up opposite Kutanisuji.

242
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,033
But which side of the lake was she on?

243
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:36,775
She was on the left when viewed
from the lake. so maybe-this side?

245
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:39,611
After climbing back-up from this side,
in order to throw a.stone at Mr..Funaki

247
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,415
from right under the bridge that is opposite
the bridge

249
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,418
she would have to cross
this bridge once.

251
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,853
But... the guard says nobody crossed.

254
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:49,087
But...the guard says nobody crossed.

257
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,305
But... the guard says nobody crossed.

258
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,726
But, if he was killed here.

259
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:58,096
Why was his body found where it was?
How was it carried there?

261
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,450
He fell into the lake and
naturally drifted to the shore there,

263
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:05,937
where he came to and climbed up.
He then passed away...

265
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:11,810
No, Mr. Funaki's body was not wet,
and he wasn't using a boat...

267
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:16,648
It's unnatural that hispbody was
where it was after all.

269
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,851
But, I'm certain that he was killed here!

270
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,052
Conan.

271
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,990
We're going tobe charge extension fee
if we don't return the boat

274
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:25,290
We're going to be charge extension fee
if we don't return the boat.

277
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,659
What method was used?

279
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,294
Conan. the,boat...

281
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,229
Y.Yeah, ljknow.

282
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,865
Are we going to ride it to the boat house?

283
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,466

Around the place where 'Kutanisu;
merges with the main stream.

291
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,585
Oh! That handkerchief....!

I was hoping for two
consecutive wins but...

00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,259
§ unfortunately I've lost to Mr Masubuchi

319
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,447

Tournament. Ladies and Gentlemen,
thank you all so very much.

327
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,396
Fueeh

328
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:17,469
Aaagh. she's doing the same thing
as the Sleeping Kogoro!

330
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,737
What?!

331
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,972
Please wait, Ms. Ayukawa.

332
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,943
I still have something
I'd like you to tell everyone

334
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,278
I'd like you to tell us
why you killed Mr. Funaki...

338
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,080
Huh 2!

339
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:29,914
What?!

340
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,751
What?! You mean Ms. Ayukawa

341
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,687
I'd like to know why you did what you did

342
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,723
at this tournament where I'm serving
on behalf of the chairman.

344
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,725
Come on. please tell us!

345
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,862
Just what; do you think you're saying?!

346
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:48,399
She was in Kutanisuji on the
opposite side of the lake back then.

348
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,485
That's not the point...

349
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,306
Because Mr. Funaki was not killed
where he was found.

351
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:55,907
What?! That can't be!

352
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,307
What?! That can't be!

353
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:56,908
What?! That can't be!

354
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,844
Conan, please show her the stuff.

355
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:00,979
Okay

356
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,451
We found this camera
beside thewrailftracks of Kutanisuj.

358
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,452
This is Mr. Funaki's camera.

359
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,723
He took pictures for us
yesterday so I remember!

361
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,423
What?!

362
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,194
The camera of the victim was
found in Kutanisuji...

364
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,463
But. why was it in a place like that?

365
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,132
We found it under Kutani Bridge!

366
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,168
And these are the pictures that

367
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,601
were printed from the film that
was in the camera!

369
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:24,936
Were printed from the film that
was in the camera!

371
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,670
Hey!

372
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:26,738
Oh#yes, sir...

374
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,648
There's a picture of a trolley there, right?

375
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,050
The place that picture was taken from...

376
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:42,720
The place where the leg of Kutani Bridge
touches the shore,

378
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,123
a very small flat area.

379
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,726
I asked a railroad buff and found that

380
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:53,031
the place is famous for getting
the best shots of the trolley.

382
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:56,367
Ms. Ayukawa,

383
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:01,206
I hear that you were invited by Mr. Funaki
to have a drink with him last night.

385
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,908
At that time you gave him
information of that place

387
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,677
when he asked you for information

388
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,646
on where he could take pictures of
the trolley for a railroad bufffmagazine

390
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,283
B.But Mr. Funaki was found
3 kilometers away,

392
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,452
opposite the steel bridge.

393
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,889
I just said that's not the point.

394
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,824
Inspector Yokomizo,

395
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:25,730
didn't you notice the black stain that was
on the vest that Mr Funaki was wearing?

397
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,799
Now that you mentioned it...

398
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,202
The forensic officers reported so.

400
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,339
The substance seems to have
been oil and soot...

403
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,943
Yes, it's the exhaust of the diesel steam
engine that pulls the trolley along.

405
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,411
Exhaust?!

406
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,716
Mr. Funaki moved from under Kutani
Bridge to the place he was found...

408
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,352
On the roof of the trolley

409
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,186
What?!

410
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:48,820
Huh 21

411
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,421
Carried on the roof...?!

412
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,692
You threw a rock at Mr. Funaki

413
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,695
who was waiting for a chance to
take a picture of the trolley.

415
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,265
The rock hit him on the head

416
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,001
and he fell on top the roof of the trolley
from the impact of being hit.

418
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,737
Then carried on the roof of the trolley...

419
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,706
he crosses:the bridge
until the: sharp. curve

421
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,241
where he is flung off the roof...

422
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,744
and his body thrown to the place
where it was found...

424
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,813
S.Such a coincidence exists...?

425
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,749
It's no'coincidence.

426
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,386
There is a train that leaves
Lake Okutani Station at 10:50

429
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,222
Ms. Ayukawa calculated it so that

430
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,558
Mr. Funaki would fall on the roof of
that train and killed him

432
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,564
Then, she knew ahead of time that
thelbody would drop where it did too?

434
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,782
It's most likely...

435
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:38,102
No way...no matter how much
he was off his guard,

437
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:42,407
that Funaki would never let
Saori kill him that easily.

439
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,275
If she dropped something.

440
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,611
Be it a rock or something
rom on Op 3 'fge...

442
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,081
the guard at the station at the foot
of the bridge wouldve seen it.

444
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,451
I confirmed with the security guard

445
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:58,923
and he said that no one crossed
the bridge between 10:00 to 10:30.

447
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,359
If so. Saori couldn't have
committed the crime.

449
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,062
It would look to be so for everybody.

450
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:09,367
But, this is a carefully planned
murder committed by Saori.

452
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,736
It can't be...

453
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,807
Because she told me that she was
in Kutanisuji, but opposite the tracks...

455
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,109
That's right. isn't it, Saori...?

456
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,913
Yes. But at'around 7:30 in the morning

457
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,349
the security guard told me that he saw

458
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,286
Ms. Ayukawa go down the steps
at the foot of that bridge.

460
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,890
Her going there at that time has
nothing to do with the murder, does it?

462
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,092
Conan.

463
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,193
Yes~~~Il

464
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,631
What's this?
It's just: wplain wooden board...

466
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,202
That's...a board that Genta and Mitsuhiko

467
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,004
who were on the board picked up.

468
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,807
They found it where Kutanisuj
merges with the main stream.

470
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,810
\ Ms. Ayukawa used that board

471
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,512
How 4

472
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,548
Ms. Ayukawa who-went there at 7:30

473
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,386
placed that board right above,the place
that Mr. Funaki wouldybe standing.

475
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,357
Half:of it. was suspended
in-air-and.balanced very precisely

477
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,844
so it wouldn't fall over.
She then placed a rock on the board.

479
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:17,185
At 10:07 Ms. Ayukawa appears at
the pedestal opposite the bridge

481
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:21,239
and threw a rock towards Mr. Funaki
who was taking pictures of the trolley...

483
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,164
Gyaah!

484
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,932
- 4 dd
That's just your imagination.

486
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,668
Do you have evidence to prove
that it's a fact?

488
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,005
Mr. Masubuchi, didn't you think
It strange that

490
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,908
Ms. Ayukawa was going to Kutanisuji?

491
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,578
I hear that Kutanisuji is not
a good {fishing spot.

493
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,816
Why did Ms. Aukawa who was aiming
for championship go there?

495
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,887
Besides the handkerchief that is attached
to the tip of that line is Ms. Ayukawa's.

497
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,291
You can find handkerchiefs
Iike that anywhere

499
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:18,362
Please check that handkerchief.
You should get luminol reaction from it.

501
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,748
There are no blood stains on it!

502
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:21,566
Ms. Ayukawa

503
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:27,204
when Ayumi hurt herself yesterday
you used that handkerchief, didn't you?

505
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,673
A slight amount of Ayumi's blood
should've rubbed off

507
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,308
A slight amount of Ayumi's blood
should've rubbed off

509
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,310
on the handkerchief back then.

510
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,913
Of course there is no blood stain
anywhere onrit now.

512
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,949
But, Ms. Ayukawa,

513
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,553
do you know that once a handkerchief
Is stained with blood\

515
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,906
no matter how clean you wash it there
will be luminol reaction.

517
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,694
How long has it been since you washed
Ayumi's wound for her with it?

519
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,432
Ms. Ayukawa!
Why did you kill Mr. Funaki?!

521
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,238
He's been\blackmailing me
since 6 months ago.

523
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,772
10g,
Saon. .!

526
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,644
Six months ago,
a man called Mr. Kanie...

528
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,647
was found dead in the same place
that Mr. Funaki was found.

530
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,051
Mr. Funaki was probably
blackmailing you

532
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,554
because of something. to do
with that incident, wasn't he?

534
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,824
I had no intention of killing Mr. Kanie.

535
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,094
WwW. Which means you killed
that guy called Kane....?

537
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,931
Wetwere walking along Kutanisuj.

538
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,068
I have no intention of getting marned

540
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,105
4¢So, you like Masubuchi after all,
don't you?

542
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,243
How about it? Please tell me straight!

543
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,048
Whaag~~~~I1]

544
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,954
Mr. Funaki saw what happened.

545
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,890
And he blackmailed you...

546
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,243
Is that it?

547
00:19:58,196 --> 00:19:59,730
Ha.ha.ha...

548
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:03,401
I'll keep it quiet to the police, but
for doing that...

550
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,805
I'm in a pinch right now, could you
Iend me about 200,000 yen

552
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:16,647
This new model camera-costume
close to 1 . 000.000. yen

Yiou knowfwhatilimea

555
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:25,289
I paid him three times up to now,
total of 7.000.000 yen...

557
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,260
Then about a half month ago...

558
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:33,781
I hear you signed a contract
as a Pacific Sports Adviser!

560
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,867
How much was the contract fee?

561
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,070
T's none of your business...

562
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,974
Oh well...
Please give me 10.000,000 yen.

564
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,477
You know what will happen if you refuse,
don't you?

566
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,216
Since he told me then, that he
wanted to take a picture of the trolley,

568
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,585
I figured if I showed him where it is,

569
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,387
so he would surely take pictures
under that bridge.

571
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,156
As long as the timing.isiright,

572
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,291
the corpse would fall on
the roof of the trolley

574
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,794
and carried to the same [place
where Mr. Kanie's body was found

576
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,697
That's what you thought, is that right?

577
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,599
I figured if things went on as is,

578
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,885
I would be blackmailed
all my life by that guy.

580
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:13,220
Hen everything ahead of
me went black...

582
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,809
I'm really sorry that I spoiled
your important tournament.

584
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,247
More than for me. I think this contest
was more important for you. right?

586
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,291

587
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,379
