Stars. are for some reason attractive

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,373
They can be the culprit or the actor

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,208
A secret-filled cell phone

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,143
There are tricks everywhere in the mails
as well as the conversations

7
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,644
D An entangled baffling:case!

8
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,446
He sees through the one and only truth

A child in appearance;

17
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,885
I know that... I shouldn't send this

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,422
Maybo I should just take my time
ind see what happens?

20
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,626
I know I may)n1ve a chance to come
in touch with their boss eventually.

22
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,262
Anyway .

24
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:12,965
Conan!

25
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,334
You're still in your pajamas...

26
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,804
I told youito hurry and get changed
because weirO going out. didn't. 1?!

28
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,007
Lid
Come on. never mind the cell pone.

00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,243
O.Okay

Gee whiz...

33
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,017
Oh, right. I guess.!'ll send Shinichi
rr mail before going out

35
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:36,287
Because he may show up
ut of the blue. while we're out.

37
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,491
We're going to accompany
Dad today to cover a case...

39
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:45,664
If it turns out to be a tough one,
I may be asking you for advice...

42
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,037
That's Conan's cell phdnc ringing...

43
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,809
Oh...he just got mail...

44
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,978
Hmm. don't tell me it's the mail I just sent?

45
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:00,646

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,250
+ WORE
I can't be becauséll sent mine

49
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:09,171
But, the timing is too good for it
to bg)a coincidence. 4

LA RA

Request from a Queer Family" Part 1

54
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,337
Did,you look at the contents...?

55
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,005
N.No. I didn't...

56
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,374
It sounded like you got incoming mail,

57
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,843
so I just wondered who it was from...

58
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,179
I. m sure it's from Doc!

59
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,981
Oh... just as I thought

61
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,617

PB s repwmng
the Youth Detective Squad badge...

64
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,471
Ugh. it's from Ran-!

65
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,157
Which mean, oh, don't tell me...
don't tell me.

67
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,858
Talk-about trouble

68
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,199
Give me a break

70
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,035
I mean, do you guys have to tag along
Iike this. each and every time.

72
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,639
But your cliont requested that you come
along with family.and all right?

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,043
Besides, we may come up with some idea
that may help you out¥again too.

76
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,179
Right:- Ran?

78
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,183
With a fantastic deduction
that is just as good as some great detective

80
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,285
that is usually god knows where

81
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,887
Going all out like that...

82
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,373
There's something fishy about
that mail that you. got a while ago.

84
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,228
H's probably taking measures
30 that the mails that I sent him

86
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,497
wo t'be seen by someone
he doesn't want them to be seen by.

88
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:30,068
- - SN
He told me that he couldn't give me his
phone number because he's bus

91
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,771
and can't answer the phons,
but he gave it: O Conan after all.

93
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,540
If he had been g¢gntacting Con:™n
all the time.

95
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,377
Conan's fantastic deductions

96
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,513
and him, for some strange reason,
knowing things about me

98
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,415
all fall into place

99
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:47,252
That Shimucchi. taken; advantage
of a child how dare he

101
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,754
141" never forgive him!

102
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,244
Oh: tho-coll phono?

103
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,580
Yes. I'd like you to find it for me

104
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,632
If possible. by today...

105
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,752
If not. I may end up

106
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,138
not being able to stay here-anymore.

107
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,974
Oh, and why would that be...?

108
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,959
Well. the thing is...

110
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,761
What, you'll be getting mail from the one

111
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:15,080
you're having an extra marital affair
with tonight ?!

114
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,652
You're the one who needs to hush up,
gee...

116
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,789
I'm worried that the mail may be seen
by my jealous husband

118
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,023
I'm worried that the mail may be seen
by my jealous husband,

120
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,061
my strait-laced father-in-law or
talkative younger brothers...

122
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,564
Then, why don't you contact your {HM-HOV
Immediately

124
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,399
and tell him not to send you mall

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,021
Well, he's the one who ¢ ill.) me
from his side all the time.

127
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,605
And his number is an unlisted number.

128
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,408
He 1lw1ays sends me mail
over the weekends

130
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,878
but he rarely looks at the mails
that I send him from my side

132
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,115
I have no way of contacting him
from m side.

134
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,951
He sounds pretty selfish

135
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,153
But there are egotistical people
Iike that around....!

137
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,689
Right, Conan?

138
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,092
0.Oh~?!

139
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:00,425
O.Oh~7l

140
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,362
And. where and when did you lose it... 7 «rr

141
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,963
I don't know.

142
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,299
I just realized the night before last...

143
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,636
But, I'm pretty sure that someone
in this house has it.

145
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,372
What do you mean?

148
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,292
} called my cell phone as soonas lost It.

149
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:21,046
After about 10 rings or so,
somebody answered the phone

151
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,583
but said nothing and hung up right away

152
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,954
But I heard the sound of my father-in-law
% ky WEAR xo) L=tanloo0) WLR,

154
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,156
on the other side of the line.

156
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,593
Listen to this.

157
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,528
He sure.sounds terrible.

158
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:41,032
Moreover, he only plays-the flute
in his room...

160
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,235
So, the fact that this sound. was heard
on the phone means...

162
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,555
{Loe=C dix=yicor=Alll MO MENSEFSOIMSW MO Ne
in this house...

164
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,609
But no matter how many times I called after
that. I get no answer and the phone is cut.

166
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,778
Hon... why not get everyone in the house
together and...

169
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,281
YzYes. of course I already asked everyone

170
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,383
Butithey've all told me
that they don't know

172
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,453
I'm sure that they're waiting for me to goof!

174
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,257
Somebody probably .doosn'tilike me
and wants to chase me out of this house...

176
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,093
If divorce comes up god knows how much
alimony will be demanded of me...

178
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,863
Why don't you call the phone company and
have them stops your phone service... 2

180
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,366
Even so, I wouldn't be able to
erase the mails

182
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,734
that he had sont me from the memory...

183
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,935
10 (mallee 1. @d lem sew.
That he had sent me from the memory...

185
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,905
I dewhave it locked just in case
SO NO one gets to look at them.

187
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,908
AMA stop the phone,
it:wouldiprobably breed: more 'suspicion

189
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,177
and the lock may be undone.

190
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:29,080
Hmm. But. how should I go about looking-for it?

191
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,318
Ou're her friend from
your Jr. High School days.

193
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh. yes sir! I'm" Mouri...rather, Goro Mori.

194
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,493
Mr. Mori will be building a house soon

195
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:45,130
so he wanted to see this house
that you designed for reference...

197
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:51,570
Oh, I see, please help yourself
and look around to your heart's content.

199
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,773
That's why 'sho 'asked him
0 bring they family with him.

201
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,526
I'll let.you:listen.to my flute

202
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,578
Oh, uh, I really don't think...

203
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,180
Can you tell if you hear
your cell phone ring?

205
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:06,451
Yes. but it could be on manner mode...

206
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,486
Okay. ring it.

207
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,100
NY this age.

208
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,870
ou need to go to the restroom
so often_that it's a bother.

210
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,974
Lxcuse me for a moment.

211
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,010
Don't tell me that father...

212
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,880
I=don't think so, because whoever
answered the phone just now

214
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,782
hung up right aOay...

216
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,588
He sure doesn't look to be
such a strait-laced person.

218
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,624
He looks that way,
but is actually veryafrightening...

220
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,611
Even the incident
that happened 12 years ago...

222
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,730

223

You mean your ex-boyfriend or something'?

228
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,879
Of course not.

229
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,517
Oh. so you write novels?

230
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,654
Yoah: I'm still unknown

whether you like it or not.

234
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,996
Shigehide Kariya. You mean you're the one
Who writes those pure love novels?

236
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,301
So, the rumor about your novel
being aired on TV/ Is) true.

239
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:33,638
But. I expected you to be much older...

240
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,275
On. your novel's going to the dramatized
How-wonderful.

242
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,010
Hey Ran. make the-call.

243
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:51,990
Qu ed G50 BRO DUI 1

244
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,725
Yes. hello...

245
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,327
How about it?

246
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,496
No, he isn't the one
,1, because it hung up right» away again.

248
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,999
Yes. a meeting from now?

251
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,301
[Isis

254
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,537
Il meet you at the family restaurant
in front of the station then...

256
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,505
What timing-though,

257
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:11,009
a while ago and even now,
talk about asstring: of coincidences.

259
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,411
R.Right. coincidences happen a lot.

260
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,246
Oh, things that seem to happen by chance
are called coincidences

262
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,748
because they don't usually happen

263
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,750
I... guess you're night.

264
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,153
ButsMrs. Kariya,
if it's this type of investigation

266
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,624
you may as wellsgel yourself another cell
phone and try callingsyourself.

268
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,759
Are you saying that I go out and
ge myse sano -1erce pone.

271
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,463
I don't have much money
that I can use freely.

273
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:37,769
I decided to hire a professional instead of
relying on my friends

275
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,270
(). Oh

276
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,541
So. your husband is an illustrator.

278
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,278
He doesn seemrte-be : dung, though.

WN RIO WR eeu), Gaia I 3 one ROE,.

282
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,621
See. coincidences don't keep on happening.

284
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,391
This picture sure looks familiar.

285
00:10:59,392 --> 00:10:59,891
This picture sure looks familiar...

286
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,461
Oh, that's it, the painting of Tsugutaka
Kariya that was popular some time ago.

288
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,264
Or. so. you're familiar with my painting

289
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,832
Just who are you all?

290
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,135
Oh. dear, he is.

291
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:13,538
Oh. so you're Tsugutaka Kariya.

292
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,606
I expected you to be a lot younger...

293
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,478
Phooey, I guess you could say the paintings
of the young people are like e-mails,

295
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,347
where as my paintings are letters.

296
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,349
The depth of color differs.

297
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,188
A guest?

298
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,489
Leave it be.

299
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,793
I'm sure it's the publisher that's come to
pressure me to hand in my work

301
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,329
It's been ringing for quite
some time already

303
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,403
Uh. wasn't it a guest?

304
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,540
W. Well, I went to answer-the door
but there. was no one there.

306
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,810
Do things like this happen often?

307
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,378
Sometimes.

There no place to look for it. anymore.

Talk about a stupid case.

318
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,135
Yeah, there are people deceiving people
behind their back too.

320
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,138
Talk about stupid.

321
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,008
Um. may! stay over at Doc's house tonight?

322
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,878
Huh, you're going to play

for a little while.

328
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,355
Because mm badge is repaired

329
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,959
Oh~Shinichi. what's up at this time of day?

330
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,580
Bummers. I'm in a fix.

331
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:45,797
Tonight at around 7.00,
Bummers. I'm in a fix.

333
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,298
Tonight at around 7.00,
It's seems that Ran...
called my cell phone...

336
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,503
a woman's body was found in a car
parked along the Teimusu River I

338
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,540
Vie aid)
The woman has-been identified
from her belongings as

342
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,560
Mrs Tomoko Kariya, 39 years old.
Aihousewife residing in Haidocho.

344
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,396
Thopohce have concluded this
to be a murder case...

346
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,868
W, Whatcthemd

347
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,310
The victim is Mrs. Tomoko Kariya.

348
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,327
According to the medical examiner,

349
00:13:17,328 --> 00:13:21,783
she was stabbed in the stomach then later
hit on the head with a blunt instrument.

351
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,586
She was stabbed then later assaulted?

352
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:27,455
Yes sir, there's a possibility
that there could be more than one culprit.

354
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:30,391
Because it's unnatural to think that
the culprit wound stab someone

356
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,393
then use another weapon
to attack her again

358
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,462
Wall 2266.

359
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,699
I think there was similar case like this
in the past...?

361
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:42,604
Her bag and cash are nowhere in sight,
so it ma be arobber...

363
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:45,306
We can't be too sure. Officer Takagi.

364
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,709
Oh, Mr. Mouri?!

365
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,979
Hey. hey, this is work
for the police toshandle!

367
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,981
I wish you passersby outsiders
Keep out of-this.

369
00:13:53,982 --> 00:13:55,950
No. no. Inspector!

370
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:58,419
I am no outsider to this case!

371
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,389
The fact is,
that woman asked me to do work for her.

373
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,159
What?! Mrs Kariya was having
an extra-marital affair?!

375
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,327
N.No way

376
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:09,163
Unfortunately, it seems to have been so.

377
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:12,133
Then, did her partner killer her?!

378
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:14,219
No. we don't know for sure yet .

379
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,671
Would you have : ny idea
who it could've been?

381
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:21,009
Come to think of it, 2 guy with 7" mustache
accompanied by a child came around.

383
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,045
Right, I think his name was Goro Mer
or something like that.

385
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,080
Goro Mori?

386
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,782
Well that's...

387
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,084
It's him

388
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,819
How dare you-—!

389
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,189
You've got me wrong...

390
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:39,327
Kogoro Mouri. that renown detective...!

391
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,328
Yes sir

392
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:42,964
When I came, this afternoon I couldn't reveal
Mm name cause of certain.reasons...

394
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:48,269
Does that mean that you already arrested
the one who killed Tomoko?

396
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,271
IN Cs Juno Ot

397
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:54,442
Excuse mg, where were you today
at:around 7:30 in the evening?

399
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:59,847
Huh, me? I was here all the while,
right Mr Nakamura?

401
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:04,619
Oh yes sir, he was blowingshis flute from
a little before 7:00 when everyone came.

403
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:06,754
All the way to about 8:00...

404
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:07,088
All the way to about 8.00...

405
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:12,393
He stopped blowing for a little while
around 7:30 when I served him dinner.

407
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,395
Did you actually see him then?

408
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:18,199
No, when he's blowing his flute I am told
to leave his dinner outside his room

410
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,468
SO as Not to interrupt him

411
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:26,674
But maybe he smelled the aroma of curry
outside the sliding paper door

413
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,345
Oh, it's been a long time
since we had curry for dinner...

415
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,048
Yes, around 7:30. 4.1 was here.

416
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,017
I came back after the meeting ended
at 6:00.

418
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,419
And was confined]in this room
working right through.

420
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,556
I think the two over there can testify to that?

421
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,257
Is that right?

422
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:44,943
Yes sir, that's correct...

423
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,762
Ever since the lights &f'thé-room was
turned on around 6:30

425
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:50,264
Shigehide's silhouette was in view
from the sliding paper door...

427
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,569
Even when I brought him his dinner...

428
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:54,836
Even when I brought him his dinner...

429
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:58,339
Which means you didn't actually see
him in person

431
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,477
No, because I'm told not to enter
when he is working.

433
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:06,280
Is at really true though,
that Tomoke was killed ?

436
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:09,384
that's why we're investigating the case.

437
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:13,054
Then hurry.on. with it and get .going home

438
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,091
Since you all came and keep calling out to
me or going back and forth the corridor.

440
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,661
I cant seem to. concentrate on my work.

441
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:22,363
What's with him? That's no way to talk.

442
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,099
Which means

443
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,301
the only people left in this house
that we haven't questioned yet

445
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:29,437
Is Tomoko's husband.

446
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:30,838
Yes, sir

448
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,726
His dinneriis still left outside...

449
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:38,713
Mr. Tsugutaka Kariya, please answer us!

450
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:39,914
What's up?

451
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,483
Well. he won't say anything...

453
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:43,084
Well. he won'tisay anything...

454
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,388
Asked If I'have-anyidea: if I don't I can't
possiblyranswe ithat question

456
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,658
It wasn't in me to usually
talk to herlinyway:

458
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:53,695
It exons Goes om evem
your dinner too...

460
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,963
Are you feeling sick or something...?

461
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:58,700
NO, I was absorbed in work
that I simply forgot.

463
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:02,253
When you brought dinner to him,
you didn't talk to him?

465
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,905
N.No well...

466
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,958
But. I'm sure he was in his room

467
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,777
because I could smell
the sweet aroma of his pipe...

469
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,115
Okay, now that you're done,
get going home!

471
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,685
His wife's been killed
and he's still going to work.

473
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:21,789
Those three have .an alibi.

474
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,857
Es sir

475
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:26,260
It would take 20 minutes even if you went
fin speed from here to the murder site...

477
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,195
hey couldn't have committed the crime.

478
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:32,133
Which makes the man she was having
anjaffair with the most-suspicious.

480
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,635
But, we have no idea of who,
or where he is...

482
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,572
Shall we try tracing him
starting with Mrs. Kariya's friends?

485
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:44,545
Yes. this is the Kariya residence.

487
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:49,250
U.Uh, there's a phone call for Mrs. Kariya

488
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:52,553
Hey. hurry and put Tomokoxonsathetline

489
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:54,922
Tell her to answer my mail

490
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:57,942
This is the police

491
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,111
What is your relationship
with Mrs. Tomoko Kariya?

493
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:01,813
Huh?

494
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,897
What?

497
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,401
- - en. -»
He's innocent.

499
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:08,402
Huh?

500
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,839
He seems to have been
at a pub in Hokkaido

502
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,910
He says he called in rage
because she didn't answer his mails

504
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:19,781
nor answer her cell phone today.

505
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:22,250
Then, he didn't know about the incident?

507
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:26,854
But, Inspector, it only takes 1 or 2 hours,
to Hokkaido by plane,

509
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,956
so if he flies straight to Hokkaido
after committing the crime...

512
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:31,858
No. there were several of his colleagues
b Rim

514
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:35,062
who said that, they began drinking
about 8:00

517
00:18:35,063 --> 00:18:37,265
So. he couldn't have committed the crime...

518
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:39,400
If so. who could've killed her?

519
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:45,006
How strange though, that all three people
eat their meals In a different room.

523
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,040
Yes .

524
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:51,712
But, everyone used to eat together
until 12 years ago.

526
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,548
12 years ago?

527
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:57,485
Yes, when the 3rd son, Eisuke was here,
everyone always ate together...

529
00:18:57,486 --> 00:18:58,953
Right...

530
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:00,521
Eisuke...?!

531
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,456
Eisuke Kariya...

532
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,759
I get it! Now I remember,

533
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,060
it's that case that happened 12 years ago!

534
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:08,129
Inspector?

536
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:13,267
There was n incident 12 years ago
that seemed very similar to this case!

538
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:19,006
The one who was killed was Eisuke's fiancé,
Ms. Motoka Aida.

540
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:23,227
Like Tomoko, she was stabbed
then later struck to death.

542
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:27,181
Back then, Eisuke who had disappeared
was also thought to be a suspect but...

544
00:19:27,616 --> 00:19:31,953
a large amount of his blood was also found
near the phone booth.

546
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:37,124
Moreover, after the incident, all the cash
from Eisuke's account had been withdrawn

548
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,026
So, we thought that Eisuke
nC = of, xed)

550
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:42,713
and killed after the money
wad taken from him...

552
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,768
The murder site was a lonely place,
and there were no witnesses

554
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,737
Investigation was at a deadlock...

555
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:53,341
Come to. think of it, there was a call
from Eisukes friend last night.

557
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,010
For BEisuke?

558
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,078
N.No.

559
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:58,713
Fer Mrs. Kariya

560
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,551
Something about the caller, Eisuke and
Tomoko all used to

562
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:07,154
belonglto the same drama club
of the university they went to.

564
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:10,458
Back then she seemed to be very annoyed.

565
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:15,029
I didn't call! Cut out your stupid talk!

566
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,633
Something sure smells fishy.

567
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,868
Do you know the phone number
of that persons'

569
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,423
Oh... Is that so. I

570
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:29,944
Okay, if something comes up
I may get back to you. thank you.

572
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:32,346
How was it?

573
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,883
He's innocent. He has a perfect alibi.

574
00:20:36,218 --> 00:20:38,618
He seems to have received silent phone
call last" night. so he checked

576
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:42,056
the history of his incoming calls and found
that it was Tomoko's cell phone number.

578
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,526
He tried calling her back many times,
but couldn't connect

580
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:48,029
so he decided to call her home phone,

581
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,664
Strange.

582
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,733
En Br
Mrs Kariyass cell phone disappeared
the. night before esterda .

585
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,669
Fe I 5
and-it-was supposed to have been locked.

587
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:57,838
D.Don't tell me that the person
who had the cell phone

589
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,574
unlocked the phone and made the call...

590
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:03,511
\ If so, could that have been
the motive of the culprit?

592
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,348
Several calls from her extra-marital partner
were found saved in her cell phone too.

594
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,583
In other words. that person is the killer...

595
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:13,087
But, you found her cell phone right away,
didn't you?

597
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:16,022
No. Mrs. Kariya is the one who found it

598
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:19,993
and I don't even know where she found
er... I didn't bother asking

600
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,567
Okay, Conan, we got
all the information we need.

602
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,970
You're going to call Shinichi, aren't you?

603
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:30,237
Go on. and call him!

604
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:32,473
Right once you call him:ythat s it.

605
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:35,176
I'm taking that cell phone from you ind... 4

606
00:21:35,177 --> 00:21:37,111
talk"to him directly myself

607
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,314
You can't possibly do something like that.

608
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:41,949
What can-t.you-do!

609
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:46,587
Because toilock the cellphone
ou need to enter:4 digits.

611
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:51,092
There are 10.000 R@ssi » lities
from 0000 to 9999".

613
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:54,028
I couldn't possibly try
all those numbers out.

615
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:56,998
Well, maybe if I were 6 bored
and had nothing to do

617
00:21:56,999 --> 00:22:00,368
and moreover, was an invisible man
unseen b an bod . then ma be...

619
00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:02,169
An invisible-many

620
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,204
W's true that)

621
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:06,874
If it were to take 3 secondsgto try it once,
that would add up to 30:000 seconds.

623
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,041
8 hours.

624
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,778
Whew. I'd give up at that point

625
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,180
Which means the one who unlocked
the phone would be someone

627
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:16,150
who can stay without being bothered by
anyone for a long period of time

629
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:20,421
In other words, the three who are
usually confined to theirreoms4d
