1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,000
There's{no shape to running water.

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,603
There's no form to rustling wind.

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,938
You're free to make deductions no
matter what the case may be.

5
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:07,807
Mystery of Trick Ridge is coming
to an end.

7
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,609
Heiji and I solve the mystery perfectly.

8
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,477
He sees through
to the one and only truth.

10
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,211
With the appearance of a child and
the brain of an adult...

12
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,815
His name is Detective Conan!

13
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:58,150
Hattori and Kazuha are called out to
the Trakeda home

15
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,685
on Trick Ridge in
Tottori Prefecture.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,620
The two get lost

18
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,423
and meet up with a foreigner, by the
name of Robert Taylor.

20
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,562
We were also
calledÂ«~out to the Takeda home

22
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,497
and accidentally meet up with them on
the way there

24
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,099
We were called

25
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,968
to solve the mystery of the curse of the
Spider Mansion of Trick Ridge

27
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,506
On the night of our arrival,

28
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,708
Nobukazu,
the oldest son of the Takeda family

30
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,111
commits suicide on the second
floor of the storehouse.

32
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,980
In addition
Kazuha was attacked

34
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:34,387
and found tangled
in strings at the same storehouse!!

36
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:34,787
It's...

37
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:40,826
Kazuha!

38
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,828
Business card?

39
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,497
Yeah.

40
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,571
I got it.

41
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,040
Hey it's...

42
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,507
Can it be...

43
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,710
Can this be a stun gun?

44
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,379
She didn't see the killer.

45
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,982
But she said, she saw a
weird cicular objects.

47
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,183
Ircular objects?

48
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,053
Something this small.

49
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,588
BB shots!

50
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,424
That's it!

51
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,059
I never thought of that!

52
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,994
If that's the case.

53
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,662
I found it!
I found it Hatton!

55
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,932
Same here.

56
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:23,269
An bizzare string
with loops on both ends

58
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:24,870
Yeah.

59
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,309
We found the killer!

00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,481

Mystery of the Spider Mansion of Tottori
(Final episode)

PL TD AA

67
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,859
What?
He figured out who the murderer is?!

69
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,397
Did 'Mr. Mouri really say that?

70
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:52,598
That's right!

71
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,268
He said for everyone to gather on the
second floor of the storehouse!

73
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,303
Oh yes

74
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:01,907
and he also said to bring
that big doll in the workshop too...

76
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,978
and also, it would help if there
IS some spare gasoline.

78
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:12,318
Hey, hey... what's that kid from
Osaka up to...?

80
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,521
Bringing the corpse down
without permission!

82
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,790
Did he really say to wait here?

83
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,592
Yep!

84
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,459
That's right!

85
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,131
Here it comes...

86
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,912
Oh, you're all here.

87
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,914
Well, let me start...

88
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:44,049
to tell you about the many incidents

89
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,185
that have happened here at the
Takeda's home.

91
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,454
Mr Mouri, please wait...

92
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:54,460
When we found Brother,
the door was locked from the inside.

94
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,596
There's only that one small window

95
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,332
barely large enough for a child to
et through...

97
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,369
I don't think it's a curse,

98
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,171
but if you say there's a murderer,

99
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,239
will you
first explain?

101
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,042
How the murderer
escaped from this room!

103
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,245
If there is a way like that,

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,447
I'm the one who'd like to know
how it was done.

106
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,982
Huh?

107
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,717
Yes...

108
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,722
the criminal had no need to
escape from here.

110
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,592
That's because, when the killer
murdered Nobukazu,

112
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,395
the murderer wasn't,
in this room!

114
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,131
No way!

115
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,731
No way!

116
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,533
Then, how did he do it?

117
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,037
The strings used for the puppets!

118
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,574
The murderer used
puppet strings, ropes,

120
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,843
and thumbtacks to commit

121
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,179
this crime In a sealed room!

122
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,582
The set-up is simple!

123
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:53,519
First, the rope is set-up so that the
Ioop closes when it is pulled

125
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,254
and it is tied to the beam.

126
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,992
With small loops made on both
ends of the string,

128
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,294
the loop of the
rope is pulled to four corners,

130
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,497
and fixed to the small window
with thumbtacks

132
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,570
Another long string is attached to the
base of the loop of that rope...

134
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,574
it is put over the beam
in the center of the room

136
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:19,311
and leads out the small
window and the set-up is completed!

138
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:20,946
Look!

139
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,982
Like this!

140
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,850
Little boy...

141
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,688
All that's left to do is
call Nobukazu out here,

143
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,358
make him look out
of the window,

145
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,561
and pull the string...

146
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,365
The loop of the rope closes and he is
able to murder Nobukazu.

148
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:44,370
But, why did Brother lock the door?

149
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,704
And...

150
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,242
Anyone would think it strange if he was
told by the person he was waiting for to

152
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,245
Iook out the window..."

153
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,847
He locked the door

154
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,717
because it was something important
and he didn't want anyone to see him.

156
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,220
He looked out the window

157
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,022
because he probably heard a sound.

158
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,023
A sound?

161
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,695
the criminal fired BB-shots
at the window with an airgun,

163
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,699
so that
Nobukazu would look out the window.

165
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,304
It was to take revenge

166
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,307
for Misa, who committed suicide here
three years ago!

168
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,511
Revenge for Misa???

169
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,378
Yes!

170
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,113
The criminal probably thought

171
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,585
that Nobukazu, having found
out that Misa wasn't his real daughter

173
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,488
went hard on her and forced her
into committing suicide.

175
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,024
Not his real daughter?!

176
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,826
What does it mean?

177
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,829
Isn't that right...! Ryuji!

178
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,766
Dear...?

179
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,735
I'm sorry... Yoko...

180
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,969
I'm sorry... Yoko...

181
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,907
I knew I had to tell you about it
sooner or later, but...

183
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,442
Misa...

184
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:57,910
that child...

185
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,646
Is the daughter
made between.

187
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,514
Brother's wife, Kinuyo, and I!

188
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,953
You're joking... aren't you?! Dear!

189
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,689
It's true...

190
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,560
It was before I met you...

191
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:19,565
Kinuyo was told at the hospilal that
Brother could not have children...

193
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,834
and she pleaded me with tears...

194
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:27,039
He wants a child... please
make his dream come true" she said...

196
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,775
That was the first and last time...

197
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,044
Brother and I have the same blood type,

198
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,846
so he wouldn't have found out.

199
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,348
Until three years ago

200
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,618
when the doctor at the hospital
ipped his mouth...

202
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,492
Misa ended up committing suicide

203
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,827
and Kinuyo, feeling responsible,
followed her...

205
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,034
It's ..%wlt's all because I listened
to her plead...

207
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,770
Dear...

208
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:01,840
But, how did you know
Lh was.Misa's father?

210
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,010
Kinuyo and I didn't tell anyone...

211
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,577
Her name...

212
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:13,284
Misa and the daughters of you and
Yoko resemble each other

214
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,952
and form -a circle .

215
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,090
I recognized that and knew...

216
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:23,028
You secretly made the names of your
daughters have relation to one another.

218
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,098
It's also seems like
you were unusually upset

220
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,301
at Misa and Kinuyo' s funerals...

221
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,771
But, Mother named all the daughters...

222
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,440
I already knew!

223
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:40,312
I named the three to form a circle
for you.

225
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,880
What???

226
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,350
Don't take an old person
for a fool!

228
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,019
When Kinuyo

229
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,890
came home from the hospital
with the baby .

231
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,092
I knew right away
from the way you two acted.

233
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,164
But,

234
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:04,436
I didn't think you'd take revenge
for the daughter suicide,

236
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,038
Nobukazu, was responsible for

237
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:06,638
What?

238
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,108
Making it look like the curse of
the Spider Empress!!

240
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,377
You're disgusting!

241
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,812
Mother, you're wrong!

242
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:16,014
Didn't kill Brother...

243
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,550
Ryuji isn't the murderer!

244
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,287
I said it, didn't ll...

245
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,023
that the murderer
fired an airgun at the window

247
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:28,560
and when Nobukazu looked
out the window, the string was pulled.

249
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,162
And he was killed

250
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,365
Even if the room was sealed,

251
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,503
If someone made movements
in front of the storehouse like that,

253
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,438
he'd immediately be suspicious.

254
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,241
The way this set-up was made,

255
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,010
there would have to be
more than human strength used

257
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,678
or the rate of failure
would be very high.

259
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,282
To make it successful,

260
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,618
you would need the strength

261
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,687
to pull the thumbtacks,
on all four corners, off at once!

263
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,624
Without being noticed by anyone...

264
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,426
there's only one person
who could have done that...

266
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,495
You're the only one!!

267
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,105
Without being noticed by
anyone...

269
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:17,308
there's onl Â«one person who
could have done that...

271
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,645
You're the only one...

272
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:24,917
Robert! You used the car
to visit the grave with the girls!

274
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,520
You're the only one
who could've done it!!!

276
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:34,626
After dinner,

277
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,594
After dinner,

278
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,529
when you were going
out to visit the grave...

280
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,865
you parked the car
in front of the storehouse...

282
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,268
you waited for the girls to come
running over to the car that waiting.

284
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:48,273
You could have shot at the storehouse
window from the driver's seat.

286
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,608
And,

287
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,077
beforehand, you could have lead
the strings out the window

289
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,546
If you tied it to the car
before dinner...

291
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,515
all you would have to do is
drive the car off...

293
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,851
You'd be able to pull with great
strength...

295
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,321
The string that was left on the car.

296
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:06,525
Was retrieved in the mountains
when you stopped to look at the scenery...

298
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:10,462
and was thrown away somewhere
along with the airgun.

300
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,065
Please wait a minute!

301
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,201
Yes, I'm definitely
the one who moved the car,

303
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:20,272
but it could have been someone else
who tied the string to the car!!

305
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:21,873
And,

306
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:25,077
I hadn't been here for 3 years.
I just arrived today!

308
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:28,180
I completely forgot the location of house,
that I got lost

310
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,116
From the time I arrived here to the
time we went to visit the grave,

312
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,385
I was with you almost all;that time

313
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:36,388
I wouldn't have the time to rig a set-up
Iike this...

316
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,659
I hasn't been three years since
you visited here.

318
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,794
It's several days ago!!

319
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,729
Yes!

320
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,797
You murdered Mr. Negishi

321
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,667
and rigged this set-up on that day!

322
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,671
What?!

323
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,075
That's why only Mr. Negishi was
killed in the barn.

325
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,212
He avoided this
room that was rigged with the set-up.

327
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,783
He called the high school detective
from Osaka with a strange request letter

329
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,252
He made the meeting on the road
Iook accidental

331
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,588
to make it look like
he hadn't been here for three years...

333
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,726
No one would suspect a person,

334
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,362
who was lost and picked up
by an Osaka detective on the road,

336
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,899
to have something like this

337
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,036
set up beforehand.

338
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,838
Ut... why kill Mr. Negishu...

339
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:30,509
I don't know that

340
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:34,546
but If know for sure
that Robert found out

342
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,749
about Misa's suicide
and the narcotics at that time!

344
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,484
Narcotics?!

346
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,419
IT CO.

347
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,154
Nobukazu worked with Mr. Negishi

348
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,223
stuffing the dolls with
narcotics

350
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,026
and selling them at a high price.

351
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,562
Brother dealing narcotics?!

352
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,029
That can't be true!!

353
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,832
If you don't believe me...

354
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,769
check the dolls in the workshop later.

355
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:02,240
The dolls are filled with narcotics.

356
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,478
And, after killing Mr. Negishi,

357
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:11,216
Robert stole one of the dolls that
Mr Negishi was planning to take with him

359
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,417
The next day,

360
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:16,555
he made the plans to
call Nobukazu out to this room.

362
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:22,294
If you're interested in narcotics, I've got
some good drugs... wanna make a deal...?"

364
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,029
that's probably what he said on the phone

365
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,364
Nobukazu suspected someone in the family
of killing Mr. Negishi

367
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:31,303
and stealing the drugs

368
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,605
and he jumped
at the phone call!

370
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:42,047
He was called out to this room where
the trap was set up and was murdered.

372
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,015
Am I wrong?

373
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,218
Stop!

374
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,487
You don't have proof
and you're making false accusations...

376
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:52,090
And, you're forgetting something
important!

378
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:58,597
Explain the mystery why Nobukazu was
tangled in the strings...

380
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,500
Huh?

381
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,035
Was he really?

382
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,637
Ah . yeah...

383
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,705
Huh?

384
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:17,015
Hey, old man! I'm ready!

385
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:18,617
Right, right!

386
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,420
I completely forgot about it
until you mentioned it...

388
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,690
that thing about
Nobukazu being tangled in the strings.

390
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,560
That set-up has been taken care of,

391
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,427
hasn't it, Conan?!

392
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,765
Look... It was dark and you probably
didn't see it, but...

394
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:40,839
Strings are attached to the rope
that's tied to-the-beam!

396
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,577
Proof rather than discussion...
Let's actually try it.

398
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:46,745
Then, Yuzo...

399
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:47,479
Then, Yuzo...

400
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:51,283
stick the head of the doll,
you have, out the window...

402
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,350
Ah... sure...

403
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,420
That's it!

404
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:59,090
Just like how Nobukazu
Iooked out the window...

406
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:06,097
Robert confirmed the situation
and then moved the car off.

408
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,369
The string tied to the
car is pulled

410
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,638
the thumbtacks come loose

411
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,877
as the rope choked Nobukazu, it
pulled in the opposite direction

413
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,814
and the back of Nobukazu's head bangs
into the beam!

415
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,417
The string is pulled more
and it snaps

417
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:30,088
Nobukazu's body dives into a
sea of strings

419
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:35,894
and dangles from the ceiling as if
tangled in a spider's threads!

421
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,297
The question is... Robert,

422
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:46,638
How did you know that
Nobukazu' s body was tangled in strings?

424
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,676
The only ones among you who knew
about it were

426
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:57,415
Ryuji, Yuzo, Chie and Miyuki. The four
who came to the scene of the crime.

428
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,751
Of course, these four were told

429
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,955
not to tell anyone
about the scene of the crime.

431
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,892
And, one more person...

432
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,960
in other words,

433
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:15,433
that's the murderer who rigged the
set-up to kill Nobukazu.

435
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,410
Obert...

436
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,078
How...

437
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,880
How did you know?!

439
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,483
It sounds funny!

440
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:36,421
You kept everyone from talking
and waited for me to make the slip!!

442
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,889
The number of fish!

443
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,225
The fish we had for dinner...

444
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,562
The unexpected guests were suppose to be
me, Kazuha, and you three people but,

446
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,565
she was short only two fish!

447
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,233
That means

448
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,904
you were an expected guest that
somebody had already invited.

450
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,475
At first, I thought you and Yoko, who
bought the fish, were suspicous

452
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,812
but hearing that Nobukazu handled
all the money

454
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,814
the only suspicious one
Ieft was you...

456
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,684
I sensed something was going to happen!

457
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,753
Nothing had happened yet,

458
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,223
so I let Kazuha go to visit
the grave with you...

460
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,026
but Nobukazu was murdered
and I panicked

462
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:20,699
If you were the murderer, you migh have
run off with Kazuha find Ran

464
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:25,437
You dangled Kazuha in the strings
on the first floor of the storehouse

466
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:30,541
but didn't kill her to make it look
Iike a curse.

468
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:36,614
And to create an illusion to make us think
that there is a way to escape from this room.

470
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,482
Of course,

471
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,953
there's also the reason
that Kazuha found the BB-shots...

473
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,492
But why? Why even Mr. Negishi?

474
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,228
Several days ago,

475
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,565
when I came by here,
he said this...

477
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,603
If it's Misa you're looking for,
she committed suicide after you left!

479
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,272
Nobukazu was picking
n her anyway...

481
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,077
Well, it cant be helped,
she wasn't his real daughter...

483
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,615
A girl like that,
nobody would marry her anyway.

485
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,753
There'd be nothing good
even if she were living.

487
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,690
With eyes that were high on drugs...

488
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,226
he laughed and told me that!

489
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,096
I desperately learned to read and
write Japanese

491
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,767
because she wasn't
good at English;

493
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,868
I finally was able
to come and meet her.

495
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:38,676
I looked forward to
eeing her smiling face...

497
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:43,815
But, don't you think you overdid it,
for putting Kazuha in that situation?

499
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,885
I didn't care who gets hurt, or who was
suspecting me

501
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,154
I didn't care about that anymore!!

502
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:53,024
Even everyone in his household,
who let her die!

504
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:58,496
Hey, I thought of not telling
but I'll tell you anyway!

506
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,666
When Misa was In an unstable
state of mind.

508
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,470
When she was conversing with you in
roman-Japanese,

510
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,671
Stop! Hatton!!!

511
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,607
The real reason why she committed
suicide was...

513
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,677
maybe... just maybe!

514
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,415
Shine?

515
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,184
Yes, that's right!

516
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,854
S-h-i-n-e" is shine!

517
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,989
It means to be bright

518
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:30,328
Maybe for Robert,
Misa was a bright light.

520
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,663
Light?

521
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,031
Come to think of it, Robert said

522
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,701
he wanted a bride that was like a
Iight...

524
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,770
We've got to apologize to Robert.

525
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,173
Apologize?

526
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,176
Because, it was the same as the letters
from Uncle Negishi's name...

528
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:49,714
So we thought Robert wrote a terrible thing
and gave it to Misa.

530
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,116
We thoughtihe wrote..."die"...

532
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,539
Morning came and Robert was
taken off by the Totori Prefctual police.

535
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,075
In the police car,

536
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:21,913
Robert repeated the same words
over and over again...

538
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,783
Why wasn't I Japanese...

539
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,722
Why wasn't she American.

540
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,791
Like a broken puppet

541
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,396
he repeated
over .and over again...

584
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,358
Hey .
Why did Robert go off with the police?

586
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,959
Why? Why?

587
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,695
But the murderer
is'the*Spider Empress...

589
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,097
We saw it!

590
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,498
Before we went to take a bath,

591
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,635
we saw that long spider's thread
coming out from the storehouse window!

593
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,570
Oh that's probably...

594
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,405
Yep!

595
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,139
Huh?

596
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,076
It's the doing of the Spider'Empress.

597
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:37,415
Robert just went back to his country.
So there's nothing to worry about it!

599
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,951
You're right!

600
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,887
Grandmother, tell-us a story again!

601
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:47,892
Then... how about "the White Rabbit of
Inaba...

603
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,094
We've heard that one before!

604
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,166
It's Grandma, after all...

605
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,639
How beautiful!

606
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,445
What's that?!

607
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,348
Drowning...

608
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:14,152
In other words,
due to some sort of accident,

610
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:17,088
she wasn't able to
escape from the shell.

612
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,691
No... #4!
this isn=tean accident!

614
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,026
U's a planned murder!
