In each and every case to be solved

Owning a super car is everyone's dream
and emotions run as high as the price.

20
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,430
That's strange,

21
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,031
he was walking with us just awhile ago...

23
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,337
Why do you guys get to rest,
that's not fair

25
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,106
Good grief,

26
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,674
winning first prize in the drawing
was real lucky but why's the hotel

28
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,711
In such an inconvenient place
and there's no buses either...

31
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,716
Hurry up, Dad!

32
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,787
What an inconvenient hotel...

33
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,590
I knew it was too good to be true

34
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,626
The eat all you can shabu-shabu
2nd prize would've been better, huh

36
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:42,862
You can say that again...

37
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,030
Aw come on,

38
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,465
don't be a spoil sport!

39
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,467
Well I can't help it...

40
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,237
when"re we going to
reach the hotel anyway?

42
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,106
We're almost there, don't give up!

43
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:58,077
That place we can see from here,
I wonder if that's the Kirigamine Hotel...

this is a pretty nice hotel
but why don't you provide your guests

54
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,533
with pick-up service from the
nearest train station or something

Good grief, you re always wandering off

82
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:54,967
Look at that, isn't that neat!
Look at all those old sports cars!

84
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,436
They are impressive

85
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,873

The long nose and the beautifully curved

89
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,080
It looks like a real jaguar, doesn't it

90
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:12,318
Even today, many Jaguar collectors
dream of owning this car

93
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,654
And this...

94
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:21,160
This is a
Mercedes Benz 300SL, Gull wing

96
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,230
Gull wing means the wings of a seagull

97
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,499
when you open the door,

98
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,301
it looks like a seagull with it's
wings spread out, doesn't it?

100
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,704
You re right

101
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,307
Isn't that a Cadillac over there?

102
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,645
Yes, a Cadillac El Dorado.
It's a 1953 convertible! 7

106
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,817
it's said to be the most powerful
and ultimate American model.

108
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,486
Production was limited
to only about 500 cars

110
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,723
and I heard they virtually disappeared
\\from the show rooms in no time

112
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:56,562
They say collectors still talk about
the El Dorado legacy!

114
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,731
You know a lot of about
these cars don't you, kid...

116
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:04,203
This is the historic car show room
we ve just put up

118
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,571
I see...

119
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,040
The owner of this hotel is
quite a car enthusiast

121
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:13,412
You could say he rebuilt this hotel
just for this show room...

123
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:14,980
What's that?

124
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,415
There's an open space back there

125
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,184
Yes,

126
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:23,122
that space is reserved for the
owner s persona errart lino

128
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,189
What?

129
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:26,025
When you say Ferrari Dino,

130
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,395
you don't mean the 206 GT do you?

131
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,164
I certainly do

132
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,866
iV Wow

133
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:37,136
Conan, what kind of car is it?

134
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,172
They only made 152 of them and

135
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,075
it's close to impossible
to get your hands on one now.

137
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:47,012
Dino is the nickname of Alfredino Ferrari,

138
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,180
the only son of Enzo Ferrari,
Ferrari's creator

140
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,915
the only son.of Enzo Ferrari,
Ferrari's creator

142
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,152
He died when he was 24 years old

143
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:58,023
but the engine he helped
design was built into the car

145
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:04,597
That's why Enzo Ferrari named the
model after his beloved son

147
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,999
So that's the story behind it

148
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Katsuro!

149
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,472

192

Don't complain.

193
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,751
We should just be thankful we
got first prize in the drawing

195
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,854
Do they expect all 3 of us
to sleep on 1 bed?

197
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,656
Let's tell them to give us a bigger room!

198
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,825
Never mind, we'll use this sofa

199
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,429

200
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:44,463

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,506
don't worry

Stop being so stubborn, Dad!

212
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,789
The hotel's not so busy,
what's the big deal

214
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,125
I'm going to make them
give us a bigger room!

216
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,596
But won't they charge us if we do that?

217
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,333
And if you make too big a fuss,
they might throw us out!

220
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,306
Mr. Moun?...

222
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,975
A threatening letter?

223
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,610
Letesisee here...

224
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,678
Don't open the show room.

225
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:34,947
Or you'll be sorry

226
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,851
That letter arrived at the hotel
a few days ago...

228
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,188
my staff and I were just discussing
what to do about it...

230
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:47,259
For a threateninglletter,
it doesn't sound so threatening

232
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,329
maybe it's just someone's idea of a joke?

233
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,464
I hope you re right.

234
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,167
But just to be on the safe side,
would you mind guarding it

236
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,236
until tomorrow's opening?

237
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,207
We'd like the infamous private detective
Kogoro Mourn to help us In this matter

239
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:05,476
Did you contact the police?

240
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,514
If you accept this assignment,

241
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:14,019
As a special favor, the hotel will let you
stay in this suite, which is our very best

243
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,156

Did it get on you?

267
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,854
Don't worry,

268
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:22,921
it's not too bad

269
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,457
Dad, you've had too much too drink!

270
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,626
Sir!

271
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,728
There's trouble in the show room!

272
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,064
What?!

273
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,032
Let me go,

274
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,300
don't try to stop me!

275
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,436
Calm down Mr. Otake

276
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,403
Don't do it!

277
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,372
Get out of my way!

278
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,807
Let go of me!

279
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,142
Let me do as I please!

280
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,010
Don't be a fool

281
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,212
Shut up!

282
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,581
I'm going to wreck this car!

283
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,817
Mr. Otake, what's the matter with you!

284
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,687
You love this car more than anything!

285
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:56,588
What?!

286
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:57,255
Eh?!

287
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,992
He's trying to wreck his own car?

288
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,827
Mr. Otake, how could you...

289
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,532
How would you know how I feel!

290
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,001
What is this all about!

291
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:12,771
L...I'm going to destroy this
darn show room!!

293
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,317
This car

294
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:29,354
this 1953 El Dorado convertible
was my dream...

309
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,666
Then why are you trying to destroy
something so precious?

311
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,402
I'd rather destroy it with my own hands

312
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,737
than let someone else have it...

313
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,773
that's why

314
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,207
Let someone else have it?!

315
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,709
What do you mean?

316
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:51,743
Humph

317
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:56,682
ask Teraizumi over there what I mean,
then you ll know

319
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,418
What is this about, Mr. Teraizumi?

320
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,354
It's all a gross misunderstanding...

321
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,689
Mr. Otake,

322
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,192
you should be thanking me
rather than hating me%*

324
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,194
Thank YOU?

325
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,765
Not 1 single person is looking forward
to this show room opening up.

327
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,001
Except you, of course.

328
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:17,034
He's right

329
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,641
I understand perfectly how Mr. Otake
feels about wanting to destroy his own car

331
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,647
It is true, no one is looking forward to
seeing this show room open up

333
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,316
Excuse me, who are you two?

358
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:48,233
That Teraizumi over there, swindled the
3 of us and took our cars away!

360
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,936
That's just nonsense.

361
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,872
You brought that bad luck
upon yourselves

363
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:56,775
What do you mean, he swindled you?

364
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:01,113
Although it wasn't big,
we all ran our own businesses.

366
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,281
I ran a travel agency

367
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,517
I was a realtor

368
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,686
I ran a automotive repair shop...

369
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,957
but with the economy so bad,
we were having a difficult time

371
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,359
And that's when that Teraizumi
approached us and said that

373
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,795
if we put our cars down as collateral,

374
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,331
he'd lend us money
at a low interest rate...

376
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,801
Of course, we accepted the offer

377
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,303
But it was a trap...

378
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,406
We didn't find out until later,

379
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,976
but that fellow was working behind our
backs,and sabotaging our businesses

381
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:37,783
we couldn't meet the dead line to repay
our loans and so he got our cars...

383
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,520
Teraizumi intended to
cheat us from the very start,

385
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,654
that's why he offered to lend us money!

386
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,627
How dare you say things
Iike that about me...

388
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:52,464
do you have proof
I sabotaged your'business?

390
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,903
If you've got the energy to tell
idiotic stories, why don't you go out

392
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,573
and do something about getting
the money to pay me back!

394
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,841
Why you thief!!

395
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:03,508
Humph...

396
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,044
you don't scare me...

397
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,678
aha,

398
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,183
so you're the ones who
send me that threatening letter

400
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,584
Threatening letter?

401
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,152
What are you talking about?

402
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,153
Don't play dumb,

403
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:17,022
this show room WILL open,

404
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,192
no matter what you do!

405
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:23,929
Huh?!

406
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,064
Those shoes

407
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,068
Donit.worry'slsli'take care of it!!

408
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,005
The opening ceremony's at
3 tomorrow afternoon

410
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,441
Tonight's going to be our last chance.

411
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,110
That's right,

412
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:38,977
don't worry

413
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,713
we re going ahead as scheduled

414
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,514
Understand?

415
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,157
Excuse me... Mr. Sagara,
what room are you in?

417
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,126
I'm in 202...

418
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,293
Hmmm

419
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,662
Why do you want to know?

420
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,498
No, uh .

421
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:02,968
That car's really something else

422
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,171
and I just thought I'd drop by
and ask you all about it...

424
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:11,143
Well, tonight's not a good time...
I have plans

426
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,044
What kind of plans?

427
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,447
I don't think that's any of your business

428
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,482
Yeah...you're right...

429
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,722
Room service?

430
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,357
I didn't ordered anything

431
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,459
I think you've made a mistake

432
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,660
£L=NO,

433
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:32,397
you're the owner's guest and this is
compliments of the hotel

435
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,467
Please feel free to call me if there's
anything else you need...

437
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,669
Well, if you say so!

438
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,638
Maybe I'll have some wine then...

439
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,373
something from the Bourgogne region

440
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:42,707
No Dad,

442
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,377
Hahaha.

443
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,714
I'm very sorry about ruining
your pants earlier

445
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,284
No problem...it was nothing.

446
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,452
I changed right away...

447
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,290
That's the Dino's engine...

448
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:03,395
Now that you mention it, I hear a
car engine too, but it's very softO.

450
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,996
There's no doubt about it

451
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,498
it'sithe Dino

452
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,599
Are you sure?!

453
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,705
Sir, where are you going at this hour?

454
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,475
Those guys put me in a bad mood...

455
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,443
I'm going for a drive

456
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,278
Mr. Teraizumi

457
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,881
the fog ls thick tonight,
I don't think you should go

459
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,652
It's safer than spending the night in
the same hotel with those guys!!

461
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,363
Remember, drive carefully

462
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,731
I will

463
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,689
Sir, Mr. Teraizumi hasn't returned yet

464
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,260
Oh for goodness sakes,
and it's already 9:00,

466
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,629
where could he be...

467
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,565
He's still not back?

468
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,968
He's such a hopeless case

469
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,272
But then the opening ceremony's
not until 3,

471
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,375
there's still plenty of time

472
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,810
You've got to be kidding

473
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,313
we've got to get the Dino set up

474
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,650
and the guest will start
arriving at about noon

476
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,687
I think it's odd though,
he hasn't called at all...

478
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,456
Did I hear Teraizuml's not back yet?

479
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,791
Mr. Kameoka, Mr. Otake

480
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:44,496
If he s been involved in an accident
and can't get back,

482
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,564
then I guess the opening ceremony's off

483
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,767
God's punished him, I know it!

484
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,971
Doesn't Mr. Teraizumi have a
cellular phone or something?

486
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,374
Oh, that's right, I forgot all about that

487
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,309
Let me have that,

488
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,546
I'll give him a piece of my mind and
Iet him know how worried we were

491
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,918
Hello, is this Mr. Teraizumi?

492
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,820
It's me, Mourn...

493
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,722
Where are you?

495
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,791
wh. . where am [I...7?

496
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,161
It, it's pitch black...

497
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,862
Pitch black?!

498
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,366
Hello, Mr. Teraizumi,

499
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,534
Mr. Teraizumi!

500
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,635
What's the matter?

501
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,837
It sounded like he was hurt

502
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,040
he said, Where am I, it's pitch black

503
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,875
and then the line went dead.

504
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,477
Pitch black?

505
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,945
But it's all white outside with fog

506
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,182
Mr. Mouri, what did he mean pitch black...

507
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,216
Hmmm...

508
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,659
Sir, it's 10:00.

509
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,528
We've got to start preparing for
today's ceremony...

511
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,030
Yes, you're right.

512
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,665
Katsuro, I'm counting on you...

513
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:54,531
Yes sir...

514
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,408
Today's ceremony is cancelled, cancelled!

515
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,410
God s punished him for sure

516
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,379
Good grief,

517
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,581
It's just like the threatening letter said

518
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,983
Eeek!

519
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:14,685
Ran?!

520
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:19,656
Ran!

521
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,393
Where are you!!

522
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,129
Conan! Over here!!!

523
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,665
Ran!

524
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,640
Ran what happened, are you all right?

525
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,843
Yes, I'm fine

526
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,213
What happened, Ran?!

527
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,781
I'm sorry

528
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,383
I was taking my morning walk

529
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,020
when I heard this voice in the fog
and it just scared me...

531
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,790
Aren't you Noda, the security guard?

532
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:54,291
What are you doing here?

533
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:55,727
Well.

I saw this young lady walking in the fog
and she was heading for the cliff
Kazuo Noda

551
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,801
so I thought I better warn her

552
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,537
and then all of a sudden,
she starts screaming...

554
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,771
I'm sorry...

555
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,208
Good grief, you scared everybody!

556
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,643
It's a car...

557
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,878
Maybe Mr. Teraizumi's
finally come back...

559
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,015
No, that doesn't sound like him.

560
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,850
That's Mr. Sagara's car...

561
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:19,250
Eh?!

562
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,426
What's going on?

563
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,627
Why re you all out here?

564
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:31,963
You were right,

565
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,533
you can tell whose car it is just by
hearing the engine, that's fantastic

567
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:36,733
Hahaha,

568
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,570
I know most of our regular guests.

569
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,339
Well, I've got to get back to work...

570
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,177
Uh, Mr. Sagara,
where were you last night?

572
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:49,881
Uh... well...
I went for a little drive around here

574
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,451
Did you see Mr. Teraizumi's car?

576
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,554
Now step back,

577
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,857
I'm going to go park my car...

579
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,832
it's already too late to get
the Dino on display

581
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:08,800
Uh huh

582
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:12,670
Oh well, since werdon't know
where Mr. Teraizumi is,

584
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,240
there's nothing we can do

585
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,041
Somebody, come quick!

586
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,944
STerTeraizumi's...

587
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,613
Something's wrong!!

588
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,214
He's in his car!!

590
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:24,716
What?!

591
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,161
Mr. Teraizumi!

592
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,796
Mr. Teraizumi!

593
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:41,499
Mr. Teraizumi!!

594
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:42,767
Get a doctor,

595
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,801
call an ambulance!

596
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:44,836
It's too late

597
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,604
he's already dead...

598
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,516
the cause of death
IS carbon monoxide poison.

600
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:03,021
The engine is running and the car is
filled with exhaust fumes...

602
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,559
I guess the exhaust fumes
- flowed backwards into the car...

604
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,727
So that means this is an
accidental death

606
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,162
Huh?!

607
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,865
The window's slightly open...

608
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,701
What does this mean...

609
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,437
Why?

610
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,406
Why is the window open...

611
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,810
was this really an accident?

You can stop the charade now Mr. Kuroiwa

655
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,339
Tell us the truth,
you're relieved he's dead,

657
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,441
aren't you?

658
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,810
I didn't hate him!

659
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,578
Not like those men!

660
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,515
Then-the engine was running?

661
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,084
How'd you know that, kid?!

662
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,719
Don't tell me it was you...

663
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,754
No, you're wrong! It wasn't me!

664
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,389
What'is this?

665
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,791
It breaks off straight across...
