on our way to get in!
Some Spring skiing.

19
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,227
On the way

20
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,030
Mr. Araide and Miss Jody

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,778
two men wearing ski suits
board the bus

27
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,280

Try something like that again

33
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,598
and you're really going to get it!

34
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:46,565
Rats!

35
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,234

00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,110
but I'm sure he couldn't see me.
I was hiding behind the seat...

41
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:00,912
that must mean...

42
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,349
another one from their
gang is on this bus...

44
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,352
It must be one of those three

45
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,487
since they could see what I was doing

46
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,659

00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,295

00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,833
How'd he do
without anybody noticing?

51
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,506

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,847

00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,858
Here, on this bus...

96
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,896
someone from the organization?

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,466
But for. now,

98
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,701
wé'verfgot to find out who
these hijacker-is partner is.

100
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,704
I've got to figure out

101
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,006
who it is and take care of mm, for now,

102
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,608
the organization is,
the least of my worries...

104
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,645
and those three are very suspicious.

105
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:16,182
The most suspicious one is...

106
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,986
the guy who has the opportunity
to signal h'i'm, by sound...

108
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,155
the guy who'é's'abeen coughing

109
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,423
Shuichi Akai

111
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,324

But then...

119
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,862
Doctor Agasa is also coughing}.

120
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,400
There's not too much difference
in the sound of their coughs}.

122
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,235
Anduif the signal's sound,

123
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,871
then that woman chewing gum
is also a suspect...

125
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,139
Miharu Tomino
(Passenger)

127
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,775
but the coughing sound is louder...

Miharu Tomino
(Passengen)

132
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,245
Those guys were by
the driver's seat that time...

134
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,382
they wouldn't be abletto/hear her
chewing gum from there'../.

136
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:54,787
That leaves that guy
with the hearing aid

138
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:57,823
If that hearing aid were
a wireless'microphone,

140
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,224
If that hearing aid were
a wireless microphone.

158
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:03,963
neither of the hijackers

159
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,298
don't have anything in their ear

160
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:07,766
besides, if he said something,

161
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,568
the other 2 beside him
would've heard him...

163
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,004
The only thing those hijackers are

164
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,040
also checking is that back mirror...

165
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,208

and make our getaway and
you're going to buy us time to do that...

that you're not the hijackers...

259
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:37,269
And whether our escape
is successful or not,

261
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,472
depends on you. driver!
It's all in your hands]!

263
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,175
When we get off the bus,

264
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,945
drive away and draw
the police's attention to the bus!

266
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:47,913
And to make sure

267
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,282
you follow our orders,

268
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,284
we're going to take 1 hostage with us...

269
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,864
That woman in the back chewing gum!

271
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,702
You, come here!

272
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,120
When we get to the end of the tunnel.
I'll ive ou the Si nal to s eed u

274
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,957
after the cop car following us is
out of sight. you stop the bus!

276
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,693
After we get off,

277
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,428
keep going until you run out of gas

278
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,332
That's if you want this girl to stay alive

279
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,534
Yes, I'll do it!

280
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,269
No, that's wrong...

281
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,605
she's no hostage...

282
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,407
She's one of them!!

283
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,342
I was right...

284
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,811
after the 3 of them leave the bus

285
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,880
they're going to detonate
the bomb in these bags

287
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,251
killing us all so we can't
testify as to what happened.

289
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,055
That's right...

290
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:07,025
they're going to be
under police protection

292
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,726
because everyone will think
they were really passengers

294
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,263
they're going to make-up a story

295
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,665
bout the whole thing.

296
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,502
And the police probably think

297
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,038
there were only 2 hijackers.

298
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:22,674
So if they say there was a struggle

299
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:25,310
between the passengers
and the hijackers,

301
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,380
the police will believe
that something happened

303
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,917
and the bomb went off
killing everyone...

305
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,686
Which means

306
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,556
the homes of Mr. Name and the guy
with the cold will be found

308
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:45,931
wearing ski suits and the police will
think that they were the hijackers

310
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,134
They made them change in the tunnel

311
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,837
so that they couldn't be
seen from the outside but

313
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,773
this darkness will work for me too...

315
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:02,547
Huh?

316
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,249
Is that our badge?

317
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:06,985
Co, Conan!?

318
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,521
Ears! Ears!

319
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:11,623
Listen!

320
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,159
Do exactly what I'm about to tell you!

321
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,527
Don't worry!

322
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:16,795
The inside of the bus is dark and

323
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,898
they're so sure their plan is
going to work, their guard is down...

325
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,435
The moment the bus
comes out of the tunnel...

327
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,570
that's when we make our move!

328
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,219
Okay! Speed up!!

329
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:42,754
Okay!

330
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,191
Don't try anything stupid...

331
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,394
Just do what we tell you
and you won't get killed'...

333
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,762
What a -lié'r. "5.

334
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,363
Huh"?

335
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,699
I know you're going to kill us...

336
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,269
Isn't that why you're
Ietting us see your face?

338
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,970
Listen everybody,

339
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,639
if we don't do something.
They're going to kill us...

341
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,008
with this bomb

342
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,546
Why you little brat!

343
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,014
I'll shut you up"

344
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,615
No idiot! Don't shoot

345
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,586
Huh 2

346
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,822
hams that refigrafim....

347
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,156
Hurry!

348
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:22,894
Uni'?

349
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,298
8, stop!?

352
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:36,942
This way mister!

353
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,280
Mitsuhiko, don't let go!

354
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,815
You don't have to tell me!

355
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,463
H that hurts...

356
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,143

is they-device thatlll set off the bomb!!

362
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:29,928
Kid-f, you just made a big mistake.

364
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,212
I'm so sorry!

365
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,214
We braked so suddenly.
I lost my balance

367
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,516
8, stop that

368
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:54,953
Hey, what gives?

369
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:55,921
He trigger's...

370
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,092

nd stop it halfway

375
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:14,239
You shquld have at least studied
that before. you attempted to use it...

377
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,107
Wh, what the?

378
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,642

397
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,497
Oh no...

399
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,201
We've got to get away
from here, right now...

401
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,470
When the bus skidded.

402
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,573
My wristwatch must've hit somethi'hg.
The bomb's been activated!

404
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,409
There's less than
a minute before it explodes!

406
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,378
Are you serious!

407
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,049
Inspector!

408
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,851
The bus's in the Koboto'ke Tunnel area.

409
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,419
They've come to a sudden stop
and now there's no movement!

411
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:02,988
What should we do?

412
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:04,589
Should we storm the bus?

413
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,993
Wait for your backup to arrive.

415
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,770
Co, Conan!?

416
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,572
What happened?

417
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,807
The bomb those hijackers
brought on the bus is

419
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,876
going to go off
in less than 20 seconds

421
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:25,710
What I?

422
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,878
We've go to do something...

423
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,682
I'll stop thé cars at the tunnel.

424
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,284
Chiba, yo'u'go to the other lane!

425
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,185
You other men.
Help the passengers out of the bus!

427
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,421
Ye's ma'am!!

428
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,459
MEW Where's N? I

429
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,961
I don't see her...

430
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,863
No, she couldn't be

431
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,098
It's not possible, she's...

432
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,504
That-is right.

433
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,239
This is the best way...

434
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:56,574
Even if wene saved,

435
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,510
I'd probably run into that person"

436
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,813
when the police question us...

437
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,116
If I were to disappear right now,

438
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,421
then there'd be nothing, left to link
those guys with the ofgénization.

440
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,891
I've always known that but...

441
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,294
I knew that from the moment
I ran away from the organization.

443
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:21,166
There'd never be a place

446
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:23,868
I'm such a fool...

447
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,037
I really am a fool...

448
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,973
aren't I, sis...

449
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,741
Co, Conanr

450
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,010
Conan

451
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,579
Conan

452
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,983
She's hurt!

453
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,586
Can you take her with Doctor Aqasa
and the others to a hospital?

456
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,656
I can answer all the
police's questions by myself!

458
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,027
Oh: I guess so...

459
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,430
There!

460
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,665
Don't run away Haibara...

461
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,269
From your destiny...

462
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,371
Don't run away...

463
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,411
Get to the hospital, quickly

464
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:40,879
Oh, yes

465
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,187
Oh, cool kid!!!

466
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,693
Breaking the window like that
and rescuing the girl

468
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,996
was so James Bond!

469
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,766
Miss Jody. yoi'J're more
Iike Agent 007 than me!

471
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,803
You tripped the hijacker
and pretended to apologize.

473
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,073
But actually. you put the safety on.
On that gun, didn't you?

475
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,375
Oh, yes!

476
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,041
Oh, yes!

477
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,978
It went exactly like in the movies!

478
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,414
Haha. . .~.oh\come on

480
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,517
you're very bright!

481
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,720
How did you know
she was part of their gang?

483
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,824
T Was the bubbles...

484
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,625
Bubbles?

485
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,329
She was chewing bubble gum

486
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,765
that's how she was
signaling the hijackers

488
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,835
which passenger
was acting suspicious .

490
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,771
The bubble would break and

491
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,440
the hand she used to pull
the gum off with would show

493
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,442
what side and the number
of fingers she used.

495
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,711
Would show which seat
that passenger was in.

497
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:52,584
Then how did you know
her wristwatch would set off the bomb?

499
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:57,055
She was wearing a watch
that had stopped at 1:00.

501
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,490
That made me suspicious

502
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,959
I'm so mad though!

503
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,962
Their boss got away!

504
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,396
