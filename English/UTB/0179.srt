1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,468
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:04,737
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,472
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,474
Today there is a coffee shop
Iocated by a slope.

7
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,476
A truck comes crashing.
Is this a case or an accident?

9
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,078
He sees through the one and only truth

10
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,479
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of
an adult, no case is left unsolved

12
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,946
A child in appearance with the l1.Q. of
an adult, no case is left unsolved

14
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,816
when Detective Conan
comes to the scene.

16
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,383
Heave, heave...l can't walk anymore

17
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,385
Hey, hang in there.

18
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,387
Just a little more to go...

19
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,724
According to Doc's map it's right
around the curve up ahead...

21
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,192
Hang in there, Genta.

22
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,730
Hey, maybe taking the bus
would've been faster!

24
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,531
No way. We're going to
be treated to lunch,

26
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:15,668
so if we take the bus it would
render everything meaningless

28
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,070
You mean you just wanted
to save bus fare?!

30
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,273
What a tight brat...

31
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:27,813
Coffee Shop Truck Crash"

32
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:32,785
Uh, it's supposed to be around here...

33
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,588
Hey, Mitsuhiko, isn't that it?

34
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,189
Huh?

35
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,197
Peach Sunday!...

36
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,799
This is the place after all.

37
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,335
Can you read English, Mitsuhiko?

38
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,871
No big deal...

39
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,542
Come on let's go inside. I'm starved!

40
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,876

51
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:28,841
He said that he's going to be a little late,
so for you to eat anything you like.

53
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,576
All right!! It looks so good!

54
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,379

00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,861
The most recommended
menu here is Sundae!

64
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:50,596
It's the master's original menu!

65
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,198
I'll take that, then!

66
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,265
Me too!

67
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,668

68
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,737

Aren't you goingpto eat, Conan?

79
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,485
Huh?

80
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,953
Give it to me then!!

81
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,287
Ah, Genta!

82
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,156
What a waste if the ice cream melts.

83
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:19,558
What's that?! Leaflets again?

84
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,427
It's a rush job.

85
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,696
They're going to be passing it out...

86
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,564
at the shopping arcade
this coming Sunday.
Kazuo Ohara
Ohara Planning President

90
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,634
You should just refuse
such a cheap paying job.
Toru Aida
Ohara Planning Designer

94
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,102
I can't do that.

95
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,106
This is*the kind of job that leads
to a stable income! Right?

97
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,375
Right...

98
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,981
Will you think about the you know

99
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,516
No matter how many times you ask me
my answer will not change.

101
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,586
Is it money you want?!
If so I'll increase the amount...

103
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,789
I don't think you can, with
the work that doingfhow!

105
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,993
Maybe not just yet, but
I promise.that-Somedayl'll...

107
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,728
There you go again...

108
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,062
Can't you do something about it?

109
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,531
Talk about persistent.

110
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,335
I don't want to end my
Iife making leaflets.

112
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:07,072
Working-with you is ruining my*talent.

113
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,776
Take it easy. I'll bet you don't )
have any on the pamphlets...

115
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,212
of the resort hotel that I'm asking
you to work on this time.

117
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:18,016
Yeah, as for that, I'll take the job as pay!

118
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,953
You can't handle it any way
if I leave, you?

120
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,288
What...?!

121
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:26,692
But, I promise to finish these
Ieaflets before I leave.

123
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:33,632
Let's get started.
You're in a rush, aren't you?

125
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,338
I'm<going to the restroom.

126
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,485
It was delicious!

127
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,587
Huhy.!

128
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,921
Two of them?

129
00:05:57,224 --> 00:06:00,326
Mitsuhiko, what's your
second recommendation?

131
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,995
You'll get a stomach ache
if you eat too much.

133
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,862
I'll be fine, no big deal

134
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,802
I told you so

135
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,937
I have to go to the restroom.

136
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,106
Agh, Genta somebody's
using the restroom now...

138
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,814
Huh, somebody's inside!!

139
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,417
Boy, that was good!

140
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,885
It's indeed worth recommending.

141
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,955
Oh, Genta, someone was inside, right?

142
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,156
Yeah.»

143
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:35,027
I don't know who's in there, but
he doesn't answer when I knock!!

145
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,830
Oh, he's come out.

146
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,635
Whoopee! Saved!

147
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,105
If you're going to order another
serving, order one for me too!

149
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,509
Huh?

150
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,746
He's using his right hand this time...

151
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,015
He's ambidextrous.

152
00:06:57,317 --> 00:06:58,417
Hello.

153
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,152
Oh» Dr.¢Agasa.

154
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,421
I'm sorry I'm late

155
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,023
We're all digging in

156
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,025
OhAea »all you-like.

157
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,495

161
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,102
Is your stomach okay?

162
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,437
No problem, no problem!

164
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,708
Look at that bus.

165
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,710
I wonder what it is. It's beautiful!

166
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,911
Truem.

167
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,355
I think I dropped my lighter. I'll go check.

168
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,493
I want it done by sundown.
I'm countin Yon you

170
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,395
Yes yes...

171
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,904
Hey Conan, what are you going to have?

172
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,405
Oh, I'll have coffee.

173
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,606
Coffee?

174
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,208
Oh, no, I mean...

175
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,877
W What Is this?

176
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,949
W Whatyis this?!

177
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,232
Which means that you just

00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,834
s \ ou were spared?

180
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,772
Yes, I just happened to go to
the restroom to look for my lighter...

182
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,907
Thank goodness you were spared...

183
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,877
Oh, you're the president of
Ohara Planning...

185
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:36,081
The office is located right
above this hill, isn't it...?

187
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,383
Mr. Saito!

188
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:42,321
I've found the driver of the truck!!

189
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,223
Okay, I'll be right there!

190
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,298
Did you park your car part
way up the slope like this

192
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,933
and make your delivery?!

193
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:59,438
I'm sorry, I usually park on
a flat place up the slope

195
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,106
but that car was parked here today,

196
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:05,110
so had no choice but to
park my car in front of it.

198
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,779
I made sure my side brakes were locked

199
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,949
and had my gear in reverse
just to be safe!

201
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,653
Mr. Saito I went to the site right away

202
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,257
checked the driver's seat but
the side brakes weren't locked!

204
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,093
It can't be!! Please
check more carefully!lq

206
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,029
I'm positive that I pulled my
side brakes and locked it!!

208
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,764
Of course he's lying!!

209
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,832
Ida was...

210
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:31,437
Aida was my precious right hand man...

211
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:36,308
Without him, my company Is finished...!!

212
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,445
Oh no . did someone pass away?!

213
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,678
President!!

214
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,614
S.Segawa...

00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,284
What are you doing.in a place like this?!

216
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,319
If we don't deposit the money today,

217
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,322
they're going to stop
shipment of the goods!
Michiko Segawa
Employee of Ohara Planning

221
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:54,760
I know... But, this is no
time for something that...

223
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,229
Aida passed away...

224
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:57,963
What?!

225
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,199
He got mixed up in an accident...

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,366
OO. Oh no...

227
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:14,613
Strange...l wonder what it means...?!

228
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,415
Hey, Conan!

229
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,616
Conan!

230
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,824
Hey, this place is off limits!!

231
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,393
I forgot something in the restroom.

232
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:33,932
He was licking his finger when
he first came out of the restroom...

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,835
I wonder if he got hurt in the restroom...?

235
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,904
But...why...?

236
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,654
Bloodsstains?

237
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:03,228
These are traces of a hand
touching the frame from outside .!

239
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,234
I see

240
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,571
The blood got here when he
came back from outside...

242
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,974
That's why therewas no
answer Genta knocked.

244
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,913
Mr. Ohara wasn't in the toilet then.

245
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,486
He hurt his left hand
when he was outside.

247
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,124
That's:.why he held the pencil
in his right after coming back...

249
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:38,764
But...where did he go to do what...?

250
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,246
Before the accident, Mr. Ohara seemed
very concerned about the time...

252
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,317
Did he have to go out at a certain time...

253
00:11:59,152 --> 00:11:59,885
time.

254
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:00,619
Time...

255
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:04,856
Hey Conan, where were you?

256
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,493
Oh, I just went to get
something I forgot...

258
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,968
Does anybody remember what
time the accident occurred?

260
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:19,871
About 14.10. It was right
after Dr. Agasa got here.

269
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,610
There's one at 14:07...

270
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,311
Is something wrong?

271
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,178
Yeah...

272
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,915
I wonder what route
the bus that left here

274
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,084
just before the accident took...?

275
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,252
I think it's about time it'll come back.

276
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:38,757
It supposed .to make a round from the
complex back to the shopping arcade.

278
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,899
Why was that bus parked?

279
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,735
This is the terminal as well as the depot,

280
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:52,971
so the buses take a 5 to 10 minutes
time adjustment break time.

284
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,216
What is it?

285
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,550
Do we have a case?!

286
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,920
No fair Conan! You're
always hogging the clues!

288
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,422
He's right!

289
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey I'd like to ask you kids
some questions too,

291
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,301
so come here, will you.

292
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,635
Okay

293
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,306
A piano cord...?

294
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,612
I see, I've got it!

295
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,214
This is homicide!!!

296
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,916
And the killer is...

297
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,818
I'm sure it's him!!

298
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,992
Uh, officer

299
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:47,859
Yes?

300
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,995
I have some urgent business to attend to

301
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,296
so I'd like to be excused for a while.

302
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,265
We can't allow that.

303
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:57,101
I have to go make a bank
transfer to one of my clients.

305
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:01,540
30 minutes, no:20 minutes, please.

306
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,610
Has he been interrogated?

307
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,913
Yes, briefly.

308
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,880
I guess, you can go, then.

309
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,883
Thank you so much!

310
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:16,221
No good! If he is released, he'll go
and get rid of all the evidence!!

312
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,023
Doc!

313
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,292
This is homicide!

314
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,860
WwW. What....?!

315
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,096
Move your lips like always for me!

316
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:24,963
OO, Okay!

317
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,932
Wait just a minute!

318
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,867
Who, me?

319
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,504
Yes, I can't have you leave just yet.

320
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,272
What are you talking about?

321
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,374
We've got a homicide case!

322
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,414
Who are you?

323
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,883
I am Dr. Agasa.

324
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,619
Will outsiders stay out of this!!

325
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,322
Hold it, let's at least hear him out.

326
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:52,557
Dr. Agasa, do you have any lead?

327
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,527
I not only have a lead, I even have proof.

328
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,762
R. Ohara...

329
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,965
I have proof that you are the killer

330
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,870
Don't be ridiculous!
No matter how you at it,

332
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,606
this is an accident caused by the
carelessness of the driver

334
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,474
whose truck crashed into the shop!

335
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,709
That's not true!

336
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,812
Let us hear, Dr. Agasa. «

337
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,650
All right, let me start with the
trick involved in this case...

339
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,918
Nonsense!

340
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,422
I'm a busy man! I don't have time to
wasting listening to a fabricated story!!

342
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,258
Mr. Ohara!

343
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:29,961
It'll just be a short while,
so let's hear him out.

345
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,932
Please go ahead.

346
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,737
Mr. Ohara, you parked your
car on the top of the hill

348
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,873
where the courier truck always parks

349
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,975
Then you asked Mr Aida
to come with you

351
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,777
to the coffee shop
at the bottom of the hill.

353
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,113
And then, you made him
sit by the window

355
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,516
so that he couldn't see the
slope from his side...

357
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,818
Isn't that right?

359
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,856
I didn't make him sit by the window
so that he couldn't see the slope!

361
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:00,659
The place is sat just happened
to be by the window!

363
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,131
See...Then, you left a while late
in the middle of negotiations...

365
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,067
pretending to go to the restroom.

366
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,671
I wasn't pretending!
I really went to the restroom!!!

368
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:16,975
That's strange...Genta here says,

369
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,413
he tried knocking at the door many times
but that you didn't answer?

371
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,883
That's right. My stomach was
so sore, I thought I'd die!

373
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,451
Hat's because...

374
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:30,555
Back then, you snuck out of
the window of the toilet,

376
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,924
and went over to the courier truck...!

377
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,828
You placed a wooden linchpin
that you had set up beforehand

379
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,497
in front of the front tires of the truck.

380
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,666
Don't be ridiculous

381
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,703
Why would I have to
do something like that?

383
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:49,541
It's was a trick to make it look like
you weren't committing the crime!

385
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,844
You tied a piano cord to that linchpin,

386
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,615
and then tied the piano cord
onto the rear end of the bus

388
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,117
that was parked for time adjustment.

389
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,854
Then, you shifted the gear of
the courier truck to neutral,

391
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,656
and released the side brake.

392
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,594
You then returned to the coffee shop
as if nothing had happened...

394
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,464
When the time came,
and the bus starts off,

396
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,332
the linchpin would come off.

397
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,402
That would make the courier truck,

398
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,806
roll down the hill on its own!

399
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:26,077
All you had to do next, was wait for
the bus to go by the coffee shop

401
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,046
and get out of the way...

402
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,683
by pretending to go to the
restroom to look for your lighter!

404
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,753
I see!

405
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,289
The thing;'that was shimmering
at the rear of the bus

407
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,790
was the piano cord!

408
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,463
You mean this?

409
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,132
Here you go.

410
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,500
Oh, yes!!

411
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,738
It's just a plain piece of wood...

412
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,775
The wooden linchpin is dragged
along by the bus,

414
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,611
and shatters as it bounces
on the pavement.

416
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,247
That is what is left of the linchpin.

417
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,517
OO « - ny
Ie carw Ic ya gaine
speed because of slope,

420
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,886
crashed into the
window of the coffe shop

422
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:11,122
and burst inside, just a
you had planned!

424
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:22,233
Mr. Aida was hit by the truck from
behind and passed away.

426
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,771
L...Let's say the trick is as you say...

427
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,374
But, do you have proof that I did 1t?!

428
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,276
I have proof!

429
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:38,316
Your mistake was, when you tied the
piano cord on, you hurt your finger.

431
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,387
My hand got stuck to the knob
of the door of the restroom!

433
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:47,425
The courier truck can be
operated with just one hand,

435
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,295
SO you :1:n eave any
blood stains there.

437
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,530
But, when you went in
through the toilet window,

439
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,200
you touched it and left blood stains on it!

440
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,741
Blood is left on the inside of
the window of the toilet...

442
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:08,413
After returning from the restroom you,
continuedimaking arrangements.

444
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:13,952
But since you hurt your left hand,
you held the pencil with your right hand.

446
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:19,924
Conan witnessed you licking
your left hand occasionally.

448
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,659
Isn't that right, Conan?

449
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,695
Yep!

450
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,499
I It's true tha Jllhurt my finger!

451
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,536
But like I just said, I scraped
It by the doorknob.

453
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,039
Can something like that
be considered proof?

455
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,339
Can't it, officer?

456
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,075
True...

457
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,543
Shut up.

458
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,277
Yes, sir!

459
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:44,382
Anyway, if you insist that rm the killer,
show me concrete evidence!!

461
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,651
Hey, what's that?

462
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,126
There's a glove with a
strange pattern in the car!

464
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,641
What is the meaning of this Mr. Ohara?

465
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:16,647
If the piano cord;on the bus is checked
your blood should also be detected on it.

467
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,852
The wound that you acquired
on your hand the toilet,

469
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,956
and the glove with blood
stains on it is in your car.

471
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,592
The blood stain on the frame of
the window of the toilet shows

473
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,427
that you held the frame from outside.

474
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:36,134
Furthermore, your blood stains are also
on piano cord that is tied to the bus...

476
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,004
How are you going to explain all this?!

477
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:45,110
How about it, Mr. Ohara?

478
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,416
I killed him...

479
00:20:56,055 --> 00:21:01,092
That guy... Aida, he dared forget
all that I did for him now,

481
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,195
and betrayed me by saying he was
going to quit working for me...

483
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:10,702
If he quits the company my
company may go bankrupt...

485
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,438
If it were going to go bankrupt any way,

486
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,107
I figured I should kill him making
it look like an accident,

488
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:20,778
and at least get of hold of his life
Insurance money as compensation.

490
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,482
To tell the truth, I was undecided
until I began making arrangements

492
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,217
with him at the coffee shop...

493
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,588
