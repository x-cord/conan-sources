1
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,519
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,255
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,590
Ail and Mitsuhiko are at bay

5
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,125
Mushrooms on skewers, can they tell

6
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,927
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,363
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,032
no case 'istleft unsolved with
Detective Conan

11
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,350
We, the Youth Detective Squad, went into
mountains to hunt for mushrooms!

13
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:02,221
Absorbed in what he is doing,
Genta walks into the hunting area...

15
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:06,292
We split into two to look for Genta.

16
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:11,797
Ail and Mitsuhiko finds
the dead body of a hunter who ls shot

18
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,233
and end up being the target
of the killer themselves!

20
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,604
Ayumi and I ran into Genta and
went along with the three other hunters

22
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,974
to search for Al and Mitsuhiko, however...

23
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:30,382
MUSHROOMS, A BEAR AND THE
YOUTH DETECTIVE SQUAD" PART II

25
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,721
This is the last chip...

26
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,659
We've nothing left to drop anymore, Al.

27
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,868
A Air!

28
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,469
What's wrong?

29
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,740
I think I sprained it slightly
when I fled a while ago...

31
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,443
I was trying to walk
despite the pain, but...

33
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,013
Will you let me take a look at it?

34
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,083
I'm sorry...

35
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,351
H.Hey!

36
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,255
Your leg is swollen purple!!

37
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,793
I'm going to give you emergency
treatment right now, so you stay put.

39
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:17,263
Emergency treatment...
You mean you've got bandages on you?!

41
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:21,634
Nope!
But, these scissors and towel will do!

43
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,472
See, if you cut at every other interval
Iike this, it makes a perfect bandage...

45
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,176
Doesn't it!

46
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:36,148
Wrap this twice around the ankle,

47
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,052
go from the heels over to the top
of the feet, and back to the ankle...

49
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,355
Then, repeat this several time,
wrapping it firmly...

51
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,293
Finally, set it into place
and tie it firmly and it's all done.

53
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,462
Wow, you're pretty good.

54
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,666
Actually, when I sprained my leg
at camp some time back,

56
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,903
C..Conan

57
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,640
did the same for me,

58
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,715
He... sure knows a-:lot of things
and is really admirable...

60
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,018
Moreover,
he's moves on his own intiative...

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,689
I could never even come
close to him in any way .

64
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,294
Silly you...

65
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,562
Huh?

66
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,367
The important thing is not
who you learned of that knowledge from,

68
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,636
but rather, where and how you use it...

69
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:35,307
You're the best rescue person
around for me right now.

71
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,277
Thank you. You sure are a great help.

72
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,648
Oh no problem...

73
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,518
I'm happy to hear that...

74
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,855
Anyway...

75
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,058
It's dangerous staying in
the middle of a mountain path!

77
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,828
Let's sit down in the forest
and think things out!

79
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,264
Of how to let Conan and the others
know about us!

81
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,299
Yes, I guess so...

82
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,015
What?! What was that!

83
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,350
Are you serious?

84
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,921
Yes! The dead-body of a man 4
hidden under branches and leaves

86
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:25,891
was found near the place
you;mentioned-torme *

88
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,195
Something about him being shot in the
stomach and having died instantly...

90
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,433
\ Oh, and the dead body of a bear cub
seems to have been buried nearby too.

92
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,367
A bear cub?

93
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:40,272
Yeah, but this one seems to have had
a'rock placed over where it was buried.

95
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,641
At any rate,
it's dangerous in the mountains!

97
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,610
Leave looking for the kids to me

98
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,477
and you all get out of the
mountains right this minute!

100
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:46,979
Hey, is anything wrong?
And you all get out of the
mountains right this minute!

103
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,216
W Well...

104
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:56,689
A bear cub! We thought we found the two,
but there were two bear cubs.

106
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,093
We're having the owner of the inn
that we're staying at look for the two too.

109
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,598
Oh, what a scare.

110
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,333
Come on, let's go after them!

111
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,169
We'll be In a fix if the sun sets!

112
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:11,737
1 O on 2

115
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:12,571
» oda"

116
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,408
Hey! Why are you hiding the truth?

117
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,378
Don't tell me that maybe the killer
is among one of the hunters...

119
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,846
It's not a maybe! The killer is...

120
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,748
among them!

121
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,650
The killer is

122
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,352
undoubtedly,

123
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,987
among the three!!

124
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,521
What?!

125
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:37,629
He's planning to shut Ai and Mitsuhiko up
because they witnessed the murder.

127
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,233
Then, why is he looking for
them together with us?

129
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:46,538
He's blocking their path, and waiting for
them to show up on their own...

131
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,775
He's going to say that he shot them
because he mistook them for a bear...

133
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:54,446
And, do you have any idea
who the killer is, Shinichi?

135
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,482
N™wnot at all...

136
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,284
There aren't enough clues around..."

137
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:00,052
But, don't worry!

138
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:04,657
I'm sure that the two who are
witnesses will tell us who the killer is...

140
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:09,128
They'll let us know in a way
that only we'll be able to understand...

142
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,602
Hey, look, there are a lot of mushrooms
on the ground here!

144
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,337
Huh? Where, where?

145
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,772
What's with all this?

146
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,675
There are three mushrooms
skewed to a branch!

148
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,978
The other four are scattered about.

149
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,148
The names of the mushrooms
that are skewered are,

151
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,183
from the top,
Tengudake, Matsutake, Shiitake...

153
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,888
The ones on the ground are,
3 Shimeji, and 1 Hatsutake...

155
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,557
Hey, Is there some meaning
to the mushrooms?

157
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,426
I wonder.

158
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,930
No, don'timove!

159
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,533
But, I wonder if they'll figure it out?

160
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:48,600
They will!

161
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,569
That's something he really likes.

162
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,707
A code that we twisted
our brains and thought out!

164
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,083
Nonsense!

165
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,419
It seems we don't have to
worry about them!

167
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,788
They re absorbed in picking mushrooms.

168
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,224
Let's hurry on along then!

169
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:19,631
Strange, I was sure
there was something to it, but...

171
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,433
Hey, Doc, stay back!

172
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,269
I've figured it out!

173
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,507
I've identified the one who is trying
to get rid of Al and Mitsuhiko!

175
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:29,742
What?!

176
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,977
Get ready for this.

177
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,680
I'll put you to sleep with this

178
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,181
anesthesia gun in a sec.

179
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,017
What are you doing; Conang

180
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,653
Get out of the way!

181
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,622
It won't hit the killer who's right there!

182
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,757
The killer??

183
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,694
The killer is there, among the three!

184
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,867
But, how do you know?

185
00:08:54,868 --> 00:09:00,105
What else can it be? Al and Mitsuhiko
are dropping potato chips to let us know

187
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:05,043
where they've walked by and yet,
they're running from us.

189
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,347
The police-had already found
the corpse together

191
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,616
with the bear cub a while ago and,

192
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,185
The dead body of a bear cub?

193
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,854
Conan IS aiming something at someone!

194
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,791
It's his wristwatch type anesthesia gun.

195
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:24,763
It seems he's figured out
the message we left behind.

197
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,433
When he shoots the needle into the killer,

198
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,235
we've got to carry the bear cub
and join Doc and the others!

200
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,637
Okay!

201
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:45,818
Huh?

202
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,123
WwW, Why?!

203
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,692
Hey!

204
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,431
Let's cut out this stupid cat and mouse
game!! What do you say, Mr. Killer?

206
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,767
Killer?!

207
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,968
What...?

208
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:08,106
I figured out who the killer is,
by decoding the mushroom message...

210
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,311
The mushrooms total 7 in all

211
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,313
It stands for all seven of us.

212
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,383
The 3 mushrooms that are scattered
stand for three kids

214
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,452
The big Hatsutake stands for Doc.

215
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:26,558
And the other three
that are skewered onto the branch

217
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,362
stand for the three hunters
and the rifles they are carrying.

219
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,798
I see, I get it!

220
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,402
The only poison mushroom that
Is skewered on is the Tengudake!

222
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:41,240
Which means that the killer is carrying
the rifle on his right shoulder...

224
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,207
D,Don't be ridiculous...

225
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,610
Wrong!

226
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,580
Everybody who: knows theymountains

227
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,650
knows that the Tengudake
is a poison mushroom.

229
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:56,989
If the killer figures it out first,
then everything will go down the drain.

231
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,390
Then which is the killer?

232
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,260
Remember,
I thought you how to look for mushrooms,

234
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,396
using tracking down
a criminal as an example.

236
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,033
See! You've got the criminal!

237
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,270
It's the Matsutake!!

238
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,404
I see!

239
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:15,908
Only we know about that.

240
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:21,246
Yeah, In other words,
the killer that.-the code indicates is

242
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,115
you!!

243
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:33,558
Yeah, In other words,
the killer that the code indicates Is you!

245
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,360
Mr. Matasaburo Saiga!!

246
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,264
What?!

247
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:45,003
The police have already found the corpse.

248
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:51,209
I don't have verification yet, but I think
its: the:man with small eyes, your friend!

250
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,244
What!

251
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,114
Al and Mitsuhiko coincidentally set foot
into the scene of the crime

253
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,350
and found the body...

254
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:02,020
So, Mr. Saiga fired at them...

255
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,957
That's why Al and Mitsuhiko figured

256
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,594
that they would be killed for
having witnessed the murder!!

258
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,363
H,Hey, gramps?!

259
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,099
H,Hey!!

260
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,435
He's got a rifle you know!

261
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,036
Hurry and use your anesthesia gun...

262
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,005
So, you can't take it anymore, can you...

263
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,975
Hey. Shinichi?!

264
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,846
No, he didn't fire at Al and Mitsuhiko
to kill them.

266
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:31,016
The real reason he fired is...

267
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,119
Don't come out!!

268
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:42,827
H, Hey...

270
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:43,762
MI. ricy...

271
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,831
W,What is that .14

272
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,469
Ju, Jubei...

273
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,368
I won't let you get away brat!!

274
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,906
If you show your back as you flee,the bear
will instinctively think that you are prey.

276
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,777
Without taking your eyes off him,
back off slowly.

278
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,813
Jubel! Don<t you know me!

279
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,519
Calm your anger down
and go back to the woods.

281
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,221
You've got to get ready to hibernate,
don't you.

283
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,493
You'd better hurry or the other bears
will take away all the good caves!

285
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,763
Go on! Jubeu! 60!!

286
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,235
Jube!

287
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,671
Ail! The bear cub! Give her back her cub!

288
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,442
The bear cub that is near you
IS probably Jubei's cub!

290
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,909
If you're carrying the cub, let it go!

292
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,267
Right, Mr. Saiga fired his gun
in order to save Al andiMitsuhiko...

294
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,336
as well as Jubel.

295
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,978
The hunter that was killed
probably tried to kill Jubei...

297
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,548
And in order to prevent that

298
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,718
Mr. Saiga shot that hunter...

299
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,255
Since Al and Mitsuhiko happened
to come along just then,

301
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,459
he fired a threatening shot at them
before Jubei had time to notice them,

303
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,162
and them flee away from where they were.

304
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:02,934
The blood stain that was found
near Mitsuhiko's badge

306
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,437
that was on the ground, is probably one
that dripped then...

308
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,574
But, He could've told them verbally
rather than fire at them...

310
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,210
Like I think<$you've noticed
just a while ago,

312
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,579
bears are extremely sensitive
beyond imagination

314
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,383
If the two were at a distance where it
was hard to still hear someone shouting,

316
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,485
and if the shooter was confident
about his marksmanship,

318
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,487
this would've been easier than
trying to relay something verbally.

320
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,056
Isn't that right, Mr. Saga?

321
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:31,630
Hey, hey, hold it! We came into
the mountains to hunt, you know.

323
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,267
Why do we have to get killed for
shooting a bear?

325
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,870
Moreover, it's the bear that
the old man has been raving

327
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,272
about being really vicious...

328
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,242
Besides, aren't you the one who shot
the eye of the bear and damaged it?!

330
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,580
Yeah,

331
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,282
that's right.

332
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,019
It's the same as if
I had damaged Jubei's left eye...

334
00:15:55,054 --> 00:16:00,058
I'm alive and kicking in exchange
for Jubei losing her left eye...

336
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,194
In exchange?

337
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,163
It was 20 years ago

338
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,900
I came to this mountain
was still deeply covered with snow

340
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,569
In the spring to hunt bears.

341
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:27,886
I slipped from carelessness.

342
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:32,858
I fell several meters below
and broke both legs.

344
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,528
I couldn't even utter a word

345
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:42,434
Jubei appeared before my eyes when
I could not budge an inch on my own.

347
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:53,778
I gave up thinking that I would be eaten.
So, I closed my eyes...

349
00:16:56,082 --> 00:17:00,418
That was when I felt this strangely
warm thing touch my face...

351
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,655
I frightenedly opened my eyes...

352
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:09,194
Jubei was licking my wound
over and over again...

354
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,500
After she finished licking every part of me,
of all things she fell asleep beside me.

356
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,003
Whether she was planning to eat me
after getting up,

358
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:21,839
or whether she mistook me
to be one of her kind

360
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,342
because of the black fur I was wearing,
I never found out...

362
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:30,682
But, It was a really comforting time for me.

363
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:35,921
I felt so good,
I almost forgot the pain in both my legs...

365
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,858
Then a gun shot echoed
through the mountains,

367
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,629
and she lost her left eye...

368
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,531
She left my side...

369
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,503
A hunter that had come after her,

370
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:55,006
thought that she was going to eat me,
and fired at her.

372
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,814
In other words,
thanks to Jubei finding me,

374
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:07,185
I was rescued before freezing to death.

375
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,823
Ever since then, I came to the mountains
everyday to find Jubei

377
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,226
and chase her all the way deep
nto the mountains

379
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,829
where she wouldn't
be found by other hunters.

381
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,003
Then,
all that talk about Jubei being vicious...

383
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:31,242
Yes, I was trying to keep people away
from her, by scaring them.

385
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,778
It seems that recently what I've been
doing seem to be having opposite effects

387
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,146
from what I expected though...

388
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:38,650
A hunter acting like a member
of the humane society ?

390
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,553
I feel sorry for the hunter who was shot!

391
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,422
He comes in to shoot a bear
that he figures is his enemy

393
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,958
and ends up being shot by a hunter
he thinks is a friend.

395
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,362
A bear is a gift from the heavens.

396
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:54,966
We, the bear hunters never did{Jconsider
bears to be our enemy

398
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,303
Besides, if a bear were to find me

399
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,505
and I unfortunately get hunted down,
that too, is fate...

401
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:04,009
1 will have no choice but to close my eyes.

402
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,112
But, that hunter was unforgivably unfair!

403
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,381
What are you talking about?

404
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,482
He's referring to the use of a decoy!

405
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:17,088
I think that hunter used
the bear cub as a decoy

407
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,024
What?!

408
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,092
The boy's absolutely right!

409
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:28,600
That man most likely shot one of
Jubei's cub to death and lured Jubei out!!

411
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,604
Morever, he hung
the dead body of the cub to a tree!

413
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,644
I doubted these very eyes-of mine...

414
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,147
Because while watching
the mother bear desperately trying

416
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,949
to pull her cub down from the tree,

417
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,852
the man who had his gun

418
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,122
aimed at the mother bear
Iooked more-a beast than she did...

420
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,993
An hour after the incident,

421
00:19:55,994 --> 00:20:00,065
we ran into the police who was
searching the mountains...

423
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,334
The elderly bear hunter was taken away
by the police...

425
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,371
He walked away gazing sadly

426
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,974
at the mountains where Jubei resides...

474
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,432
The bear cub's grave...

475
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,101
So, that's when you figured
everything out.

477
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,802
Yeah...

478
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,338
At first,
I thought that Mr. Saiga killed the hunter

480
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,974
because he wanted to kill Jubei himself
but...

482
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,145
a person like that would never make
a grave for a bear cub like he did...

484
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,949
Besides, he would've been able to
hunt Jubei down any time

486
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,852
since he even knew when she gave birth.

487
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:05,323
But, If so,
why didn't he say so in the first place!

489
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,826
If he did so, Mr. Saiga
would've been arrested by the police

491
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,929
and Jubei could've been killed, right?

492
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:17,669
But, it's amazing how you figured out
the bear cub was with Al and Mitsuhiko...

494
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,906
I saw the excrement and footprints
of the cub on the potato chip...

496
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:25,843
as well as the mother bear that
Ayumi was concerned about,

498
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,047
coming after her cub too!

499
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,250
Bears usually give birth to two cubs.

500
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:36,254
If the cub that Al and Mitsuhiko
brought along with them are siblings,

502
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:39,057
everything makes sense.

503
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,094
I'm sure that
Mr. Saiga was trying to stop Jubei

505
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,863
who would most likely have been
outraged at having her cub killed,

507
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:49,634
from attacking Ai and Mitsuhiko
who had her other cub with them.

509
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,438
Which means that the old man
was more concerned about the bear

511
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,540
than he was of us...

512
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,176
Yeah, probably...

513
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,645
It can't be helped!

514
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:05,049
That man's been friends
with Jubei for the past 20 years...

517
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:11,322
Being humane to animals can be
a nuisance when it comes this far...

519
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,725
Oh, but .

520
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,693
But, all is well!

521
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,164
Because the mother
and her cub were both fine!

523
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,570
I hope they find a nice place to hibernate.

524
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,171
Yes, I sure hope so!

525
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,517
What's with that look of yours...

526
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,452
Nothing...

527
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:05,410
It seems that you mustiinsert a 100 yen
to get to watch an hour of this TV.

529
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,779
