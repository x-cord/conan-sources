1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,703
Even one's destiny gives us a clue
to the mystery.

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,771
The most puzzling case becomes
transparently clear.

5
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,640
Today 3 case occurs
in a regular condominium.

7
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,609
There's a twist to the strange accident.

8
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,143
He sees through the one & only truth.

9
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,211
A child in appearance with the IQ.
Of an adult,

11
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,615
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:55,949 --> 00:02:00,786
Was it Murder or an Accident?

14
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:03,556
Good grief,

15
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,459
Ran says she's going to see a move

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,027
so she dumps
Conan on me!

18
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,296
Think of me as your lucky charm.

19
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,831
What do you mean?

20
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,699
Well, every time you solve a case,

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,101
I'm always with you.

22
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,769
You're cra «!
It was all just coincidence!

24
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,838
May I help you?

25
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:19,505
Huh?

26
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,042
Are you Mr. Mourl?

27
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:23,976
Yes...

28
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:25,644
you must be Mr. Ueda!

29
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:26,712
Please sit down.

30
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:27,813
Thank you...

31
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,218
Oh, I'm sorry my cigarette

32
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,519
does it bother you?

33
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,688
Yes...

34
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,590
Hot coffee please.

35
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:38,991
Yes, right away.

36
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,330
Actually, it's about a colleague of mine,
Dr. Yoshimura,
George Ueda

51
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,969
Are the prank calls still; coming?

52
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:53,339
Theyx'se'em to-getting wo'rs'e.

53
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,842
At first, a threatening letter arrived, then

54
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,713
But lately, threatening telephone calls
have been coming in

56
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:05,017
When he goes out, he's followed, he's
become a nervous wreck.

58
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,255
I'm so worried he might commit
a terrible medical mistake.

60
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,757
I don't blame you for worrying.

61
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,593
Dr. Yoshimura says he doesn't
Understand What it's all about either.

63
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:19,598
I want to hire you to look.for the
culprit and find out why he's doing this.

65
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,167
I understand.

66
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,803
You can leave it to Kogoro Moun!

67
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,738
First off,

68
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,040
I think it would help
if I spoke to the victim, Mr. Yoshimura

70
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,910
and got all the details from his personally.

72
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,015
I'm going to see if that Dr. Yoshimura
is in his room

74
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,721
Hello, Yoshimura'? It's me!

75
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,831
He was In his room. I'll take you there...

76
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,809
This is the place; Mr. Mourl...

77
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,646
Yoshimura lives in the corner
unit on the 5th floor.

79
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,381
Shall we go up?

80
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,350
Gggggh

81
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,019
What was that just now?!

82
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,154
This way!!

83
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,754
Hey Conan

84
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:24,997
What in the world

85
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,432
Why this is!

86
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,134
Sir! Call an ambulance!

87
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,335
Uh. . .right!

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,936
Yoshimura!!

89
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,004
What did you say?!

92
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:33,706

Yoshimura!

119

120

What does this mean...

121
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,139
The deceased is Mitsuo Yoshimura,

122
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,241
A 25 year old male

123
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,310
He was employed as a doctor
at the city's medical university

125
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,247
The key to his apartment was
found in his pocket

127
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:19,350
So Mr. Mouri, you were
hired by Mr. Yoshimura

129
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,220
And just happened to witness
the accident, is that right?

131
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,388
IUD...

132
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:26,025
according to his friend Mr. Ueda

133
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,595
Mr. Yoshimura was
apparently being threatened

135
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,129
I see!

136
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,164
Mr. Yoshimura's apartment

137
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,266
Is on the 5th floor
it's the unit at the extreme end

139
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,571
I guess he fell from his own apartment

140
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,775
We'll be going to his apartment now!

141
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,878
We may be able to
determine how he fell.

143
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,083
I know it's your job but we really
appreciate your cooperation

145
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:51,417
It's really no problem

146
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,352
It's really no problem

154
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,856
I'm so sorry about Mr Yoshimura

158
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,470
What oes?

159
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,205
No one's here either

160
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,375
For secufl \ Reasons»
we've programmed the elevator

162
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,477
To stop on every floor at night...

163
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:22,514
I see, but it must be very
irritating when you're in a hurry.

165
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,583
It us

166
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,953
That's why the late Mr. Yoshimura always
used the emergency stairs

168
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,155
Of the warehouse on the next
building when he was in a hurry.

170
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,658
The stairs on the building next door?

171
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,059
He's right

172
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,695
The distance between his apartment

173
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,832
And the warehouse stairwell
is perfectly jumpable...

175
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,369
I warned him several
times he shouldn't but...

177
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:46,372
5th floor...

178
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,711
Excuse me, officer

179
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,813
Would it be alright if I changed?

180
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,516
My apartment's on the next floor

181
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:58,617
If you need me for something

182
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,185
I think it'll be alright,

183
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,422
When you're done changing, please
come to Mr. Yoshimura's apartment

186
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,457
I most certainly will

187
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:30,616
It's May but this year's pretty chilly.

188
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,483
You're so right...

189
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,355
A glass of whiskey & water...

190
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,157
It looks like he was drinking alone.

191
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,293
It seems he didn't feel safe
anywhere else...

193
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,163
Besides the hospital where he
worked & this apartment.

195
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,632
Now that you mention it, recently...

196
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,136
Some very suspicious looking
en were following him around...

198
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,172
They'd go to his apartment in the
middle of the night sometimes.

200
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,140
According to Mr. Ueda

201
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,610
The threatening phone calls came at
all hours, there was no pattern.

203
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,645
Hmmmm

204
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,249
Why it's...

205
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:11,790
Is the veranda Mr. Yoshimura
always used to get in & out?

207
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,258
Yes, that's right.

208
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,028
Mr. Yoshimura kept a pair of sandals

209
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,496
Here all the time & came &
went through here...

211
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,099
I warned him against it many times...

212
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,300
Inspector...

213
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:27,139
The apartment was locked & his key
was found in his pocket!

215
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,507
On top of that, the lights...

216
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,611
In the room were all on & there're
no signs of a struggle!

218
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,779
It appears the death was accidental,

219
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,283
A result of Mr. Yoshimura's
carelessness.

221
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,019
That theory does appear very credible...

222
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,491
A sandal...?!

223
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,860
How'd it get way over there.

224
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,763
Wait a minute...

225
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,342
It's not the roof...

226
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,909
Which means...

227
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,612
See...

228
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,248
Thank you very much.

229
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,052
Rats, so it was a prank call.

230
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:23,028
Hey

231
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,296
This door bell's not working...

232
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,266
Mr. Uedal- Mr. Ueda!

233
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:28,267
Yes?

234
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,904
Excuse me,

235
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,372
I'm so thirsty,

236
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,807
May I have some water?

237
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,175
Oh, sure

238
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,212
No problem...Come on in.

239
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:41,613
Thanks!

240
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,485
Wait here, sit wherever you want

241
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:47,553
Thank you

242
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,226
You know Mr. Ueda,

243
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,662
a flower delivery man was just here...

244
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,329
Yes,

245
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,164
I think someone~played a prank on them.

246
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,132
Really?...

247
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,279
What's the matter, kid?

248
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,416
You shouldn't be up there, it's dangerous!

249
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,617
Come back here.

250
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,485
Oh alright.

251
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,159
Here's some juice

253
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,595
Thank you

254
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:30,829
After you finish that,

255
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,498
Iet's both go to where
Mr. M'ouri is waiting.

257
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,365
Okay!

258
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,235
Mr Ueda, are you hot?

259
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,736
You're perspiring so much.

260
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,940
I perspire easily.

261
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,976
I'm going to the restroom,

262
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,245
why don't you finish your drink.

263
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,079
Okay.

264
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,487
I wonder what left that mark...

265
00:10:59,192 --> 00:10:59,992
What is this...

266
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:01,994
Hey r!

267
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,928
There's another other there...

268
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,831
and over there too.

269
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:07,633
On the bed...

270
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,235
table & sofa too...

271
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,779
I see,

272
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,148
now I understand!

273
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,290
What do you think you're doing?

274
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,324
Eh...!? Uh...

275
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,626
I forgot something in
the room downstairs,

277
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,228
I'm'going to get it!

278
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,329
Good grief...

279
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,972
Hey!

280
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,974
You shouldn't do that,

281
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,143
we're still checking the scene.

282
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:52,978
I'm sorry!

283
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:57,182
Actually, I came here to give you a
message from Mr. Mourn...

285
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,016
From Mr. Mourl'?

286
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:58,550
From Mr. Mourl'?

287
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,351
He said...

288
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,688
Uh huh, yes, yes...

289
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,222
Yes, I understand!

290
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,124
I'll go right away,

291
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,093
but you must t touch
anything in this apartment.

293
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:08,694
Okay!

294
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:16,935
I knew it...!

295
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,103
There's no mistake about it...!

296
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,707
Mr. Yoshimurals death
wasn't an accident!

298
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,508
He was murdered

299
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,514
I regret having to say this,

300
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,116
but as Mr. Mouri deduced,

301
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,484
it appears Mr. Yoshimura's
death was an accident.

303
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,486
For some reason,

304
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,688
when he tried to jump from his
veranda to the warehouse,

306
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,356
he must have tripped.

307
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:39,491
How unfortunate

308
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,027
and just when you were
coming to see him...

310
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,895
Mr. Ueda,

311
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,531
didn't you call him & tell him
we were on our way?

313
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:47,366
Yes...

314
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,202
Then I wonder why he would go 'out'?

315
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:53,238
Children shouldn't butt in!

316
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,641
If you're going to bother us,
you can wait outside!

318
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,209
Oh alright.

319
00:12:58,977 --> 00:12:59,745
I guess I have no choice...

320
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,546
I'll have to put him to sleep for awhile...

321
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,616
Uh oh...

322
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,017
Uh oh...

323
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:05,283
Uh oh...

324
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,753
Huh?

325
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:08,954
What's wrong, Mourl'?

326
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,288
Inspector,

327
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,258
I think it's too soon to leave.

328
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:13,959
What?!

329
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,528
There are several suspicious
details that need clearing up,

331
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,430
before we dismiss this as
a simple accidental death.

333
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:23,802
Mr. Yoshimu [81:5 apartment was locked

334
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,239
but the door chain wasn't on...

335
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,109
don't you think that it's strange for
a man who was being threatened...

337
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,444
Yes, that's true...

338
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,577
Another thing,

339
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:37,649
if he was sitting in his living room having
a drink just prior to falling to his death,

341
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,486
isn't it strange that
all the ice was melted?

343
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,989
Hey Mourl

344
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,457
what are you trying to say?

345
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:50,829
Mr. Yoshimura wasn't
in his apartment when he fell.

347
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,297
That's ridiculous!

348
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,466
Théfimwhere do you think he was?

349
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,736
The key to that question
is Mr. Yoshimura's sandal.

351
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,471
His sandal?

352
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,707
On the victim's foot

353
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,842
He wore sandals on his left foot

354
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,445
But his right was bare.

355
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,979
The missing side,

356
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,750
was on the roof of the warehouse
next door & pretty far in too.

358
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:17,355
Even if he'd tripped while trying
to jump to the emergency stairs,

360
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,292
I doubt the sandal would fly all
the way to condominium roof there,

362
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,162
he'd have had to fall from
above the 5th floor.

364
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,100
I'd guess the roof!

365
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,904
But the door to the roof was locked!

366
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,906
Are you sure!?

367
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:35,841
Then that means...

368
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,276
If it wasn't from the roof,

369
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,712
then there's only one
other place I can think of...

371
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:41,947
You're not implying...

372
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,182
I am. Inspector,

373
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,120
Mr. Yoshimura didn't fall from
his apartment on the 5th floor,

375
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,089
he fell from this
apartment on the 6th floor!

377
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:52,657
Mr Ueda...

378
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,094
You caused it to happen, didn't you!

379
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,664
Th, that's absolutely absurd

380
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,135
Detective Chiba, will you help me?

381
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:03,835
Sure.

382
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,672
First, move the television
to the corner of the room

385
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,077
Is this alright?

386
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,779
Fine!

387
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,083
Next, move the table to the center of
the room & put the chairs on both sides

389
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,953
And finally,
move that bed against the wall.

391
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,855
Mouri, hold it right there

392
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,957
A bed's too heavy to move...

393
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,059
Just you wait & see...

395
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,827
Cl]...!

396
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:29,161
Eh...!?

397
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,798
This bed has casters so it's easy to move

398
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,400
Now Inspector,

399
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,469
Iook at this room carefully,

400
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,705
Haven't you seen this
exact same setting somewhere before?

402
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,581
Everything's set up like
Mr YoshirfiUra's,ap'artment; #501

404
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:54,019
Mr. Ueda rearranged his
apartment in this manner,

406
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,224
He made Mr. Yoshimura
think thus was his apartment

408
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,561
But Mr. Mourl,
the furniture's not the same!

410
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,762
That's right,

411
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:07,032
but If you were to wake up In dark,

412
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,501
you wouldn't notice right away that
you were m someone else's place.

414
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,336
That's how,

415
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:15,307
you got Mr. Yoshimura to
fall to his death from the window.

417
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,409
Just a minute!

418
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,144
When Yoshimura fell,

419
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,480
I was with you, Mr. Mouri, remember?

420
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,949
That's right...

421
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,853
you used me as your alibl.

422
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,089
But if I were with you,

423
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,791
how did I make Yoshimura fall,

424
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,027
tell me that?

425
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:41,666
You knew Mr. Yoshimura had a habit of
using the warehouses emergency stairs,

427
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,035
so you used this fact to stage your trick!

428
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:50,108
You were probably drinking with
Mr. Yoshimura in his apartment,

430
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,443
drugged him with something that

431
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:55,847
Could snap hin out of quickly,
jUSt in case something happened.

433
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,350
Something weak like
a sleep inducing drug.

435
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,420
After he fell asleep, you carried him
to this apartment & put him on the bed.

437
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:09,060
Mr. Yoshimura was mentally distraught,

438
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,797
you fooled him into thinking
he was in his own apartment,

440
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,635
then you left him there & came
to meet us at the coffee shop,

442
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,070
where you called him telling him that the
men threatening him were coming for him

444
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,373
And that he should get away from there!

445
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,910
And you had an accomplice.

446
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,112
Are you saying he had help?

447
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,480
Inspector Megure

448
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,083
This man has something to tell us.

449
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,020
My nameais Umemoto, I'm a florist.

450
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:38,823
Inspector Megure,
this is the accomplice...

452
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,527
Although he didn't realize
that he was aiding a murder.

454
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:43,962
Mr. Umemoto,

455
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:49,401
please tell everyone
what you did here tonight

457
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,368
Alright,

458
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:56,608
I received an order for flowers
to be delivered to Mr. Ueda in unit 601,

460
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:59,511
of this condominium tonight at 7 PM.

461
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,179
To this apartment?

462
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,416
Yes, I arrived at 7 and I'd been told,

463
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:09,554
that the buzzer was out of order
so I should knock when I arrived.

465
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:15,327
I did as I was instructed & pounded
on the door but no one answered.

467
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,963
So what did you do?

468
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,098
Well, there was nothing I could do,

469
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,935
so I made my other
deliveries & came back again,

471
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:28,272
That gentleman over there came to the
door & said that he didn't place any order.

473
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:30,709
Inspector Megure

474
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,810
Now do you understand?

475
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,514
Mr. Ueda's call scared Mr. Yoshimura,

476
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,618
then Mr. Umemoto the florist's timing
is perfect when he knocks on the door...

478
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:44,789
Mr. Yoshimura thinks it
is the men who are after him.

480
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,194
So he tries to jump to the
next building like he always does,

482
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:55,033
But, he's on the
6th floor & he doesn't make it...

484
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,405
he falls straight down.

485
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,509
That's ridiculous,
you have some imagination!

487
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:08,579
The reason you held
Mr Yoshimura up was,

489
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:14,152
to give yourself an excuse to go back to
your apartment rearrange the furniture.

491
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,188
That's why you said you wanted to
change out of your bloodied sweater.

493
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:22,227
The reason why you were perspiring
when Conan went to your place,

495
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:26,431
was you d been moving
the furniture all by yourself.

497
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,233
That's a lie! Can you prove any of this?

498
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,735
You want proof?

499
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,103
We have proof,

500
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,540
When you were in the coffee shop,

501
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,675
you said you didn't smoke Cigarettes.

502
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,047
And yet there're
cigarettes & an ashtray right there

504
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,283
Mr. Yoshimura's a smoker,

505
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,185
just in case he woke up
before time & wanted a cigarette,

507
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,155
you didn't want him wandering
around looking for an ashtray,

509
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,091
because that would make
him realize he wasn't in his own place.

511
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,462
That's why you
brought-one from his' place.

513
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,499
Mr. Yoshimura brought this
himself when he came to visit!

515
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,902
It doesn't prove anything

516
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,573
Inspector, please check the
incoming calls on that telephone.

519
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:11,910
Let's see now...

520
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,246
A call came in at 7:15...

521
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:17,482
Mourl,

522
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,051
the number is from a cellular phone.

523
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:24,589
It's probably Mr. Ueda's number...

524
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,624
it's the call he made
from the coffee shop

526
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,560
Oh, I see!

527
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,361
Hey, hold on just one minute!

528
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,631
I called my apartment
by mistake that time...

530
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,033
Oh really,

531
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:40,105
then why is your call to Mr. Yoshimura
recorded on his telephone

533
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,078
How did you confirm that
Mr. Yoshimura was in the apartment?

535
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,647
You must ve been positive that;
you wouldn't be suspected,

537
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,883
since you were with us all along,

538
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:55,453
you thought his death would bewritten
off as a simple accident, didn t you.

540
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:59,457
That's why you didn't think
we'd ever Check his telephone.

542
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,193
Is that true, Mr. Ueda'?

543
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,164
The truth is,

544
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,999
I bought some stock & lost a lot of money,

545
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,733
Just when I needed money,

546
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,171
Y'oshimura came to me
with a no fail proposition.

548
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:19,210
His plan was that I'd steal drugs
from the university & he'd sell them...

550
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,281
Sol did like he said, I got my
share of the money & that tided me over,

552
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,918
but then he said that if I didn't do it again,

553
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,322
he threatened to tell
the university about me...

555
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:36,928
I was afraid I'd be dragged in too deep
so I started planning how to get rid of him

557
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,531
Just about the same time,

558
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,534
I heard that he was being threatened
by some bad business partners,

560
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,570
so I decided to use that.

Case solved, eh?

602
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,309
Uncle, listen, you sneezed earlier
too, are you catching a cold?

604
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,812
No, my nose is just itchy, that 3 all...

605

608

Like that will ever happen!

618
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,806
Smoke from the incinerator!

619
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:12,884
What's that?

620
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:13,651
That's strange,

621
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,555
there were 2 blue
cushions the last time I looked

623
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:20,091
there's one more now...

624
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,560
