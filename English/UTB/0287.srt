1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:04,502
Suspense and deduction closes the gap between
the love and hatred between two people.

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,640
A mystery on the shining
broadwayiwith. my mother

5
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,308
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,243
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

8
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,379
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

10
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,078
After the case in €hinatown
at Yokohama was solved

12
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,881
Ran suddenly collapsed and
In her delirium,

14
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,417
she recalls a case from the past...

15
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:01,721
The ase was.

16
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,456
When Mom finagled us

17
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,225
into going with her to
see a musical in New ork.

19
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,731
Waiting for us in front of
the theater. was Sharon Vineyard.

21
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,499
A famous actress and
also mother's very close friend.

23
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,634
She was going to give us
the backstage tour

25
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,804
but as we walked through
the wings before the show...

27
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,343
What's that on the ceiling?

28
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,947
Oh that, they're stage costumes!

29
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,716
They have them suspended up there
so it doesn't get in the way.

31
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:31,984
I see...

32
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,291
Look out!

34
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:40,059
Armor!

38
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:00,780
Ran!

39
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,083
Ran!

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,625
(38 BxR)
SHINICHI IN NEW YORK-PART II

42
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,810
Hang in there Ran...

43
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:37,183
We're almost there,
we're almost at the hospital Ran...

45
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:38,918
Ran!

46
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,520
Are you alright, Ran!

47
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,995
I knew it was me
somebody wants to kill me!

49
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:54,533
I don't think so the rope snapped
because it was worn out.

51
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:58,237
Alright, whe did this?
Who hung that thing up there!

53
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,973
Things could've been worse though...

54
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:05,044
We were lucky that huge
mirror over there didn't break.

56
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,981
You're right, that mirror's
CL UR

58
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:13,719
What are you girls talking about, you don;t
owe that mirror or an angel any thanks,

60
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,421
You should thank her!

61
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,426
Thank you'll} I owe you my life!

62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,528
Oh. it was nothing.

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,098
Hey! We should be getting ready by now.

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,968
We'll see you in our dressing
room after the show then

66
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,069
Okay!

67
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,771
Ouch!

68
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,140
Oh. I must've scrapped it...

69
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,275
Let's see, a bandage
do I have a bandage!...

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,209
Here

72
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,612
I was right, there is no God after all

73
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:43,816
If there was things wouldn't
have turned out so unfairly.

75
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,588
Yukiko, I'm, going home.

77
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,959
Weren't you going to watch the show?

78
00:04:54,294 --> 00:05:00,099
Yes, I had intended to but
something important's come up

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,603
Besides, I've heard it's going to
storm tonight so I'm canceling...

82
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,430
This is great!

83
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:36,936
% knew you'd liKe it. You don't see
musicals of Such grand scale in Japan!

85
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,475
But there seems to be one kid
who doesn't feel the way we do.

87
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,078
Listen you! We've come all this way,

88
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,446
the least you could do is
pay attention to what's going on!

90
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,217
What's so great about this anyway?

91
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,652
They've just taken a Greek myth and
fixed it up into a romantic comedy.

93
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,723
Alright then, what's the
Greek myth it's based on.

95
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,825
The Golden Apple.

96
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:05,463
A long time ago, tere were 3
goddesses. Hera, Athena and Aphrodite,

98
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:11,503
had been invited to a banquet but there was
another goddess named Eris who wasn't

100
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:16,375
and filled with jealousy,
she sent them a golden apple...

102
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,080
with 2 message reading
To the most beautiful goddess"!

104
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,782
What? Isn't that just like...

105
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,586
Yeah, and the 3
goddesses decided to let

107
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:32,124
the prince of Troy choose which
one was the most beautiful

109
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,662
and each vied for his vote by telling him
what they'd give him for choosing them

111
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:43,502
that actor we just met, playing the
poor prince.he's the Prince of Troy

113
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,807
The actress playing the
rich man's wife is Zeus's wife,

115
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,810
Hera, the goddess of
marriage who promised to

117
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,079
make him the most
powerful man on Earth.

119
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,516
That headstrong looking
Japanese actress

121
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,451
IS Athena. the goddess of wisdom

122
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,254
who promisedi't "make
him victorious in battle

124
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,424
That sexy actress is the
goddess of beauty, Aphrodite

126
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:09,828
who promised to give him the
most beautiful woman in the world,

128
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,899
and the gloomy looking
actress in the previous scene

130
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,567
is the one who was jealous of the 3

131
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,703
the one who sent them the golden apples,

132
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:21,106
Eris. the goddess of discord, even
their names sound similar!

134
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:29,081
But in this play, money is power,
and work is the. battle

136
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,550
and romance is the beautiful woman,

137
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:38,524
and the golden apple has been
transformed into a necklace of jewels

139
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,760
And then? So who did he choose?

140
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,829
Aphrodite, of course!

141
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:48,200
But that was what eventually
caused the battle of Troy

143
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:53,605
But that's a Greek myth,
this musical is.a. little different,

145
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,276
you're going to be surprised

146
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,645
when you see who that sorry
Iooking poor prince really is.

148
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:07,119
Look! You poor souls
My name is Michael.

150
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,923
MM. Michael does he
mean the angel Michael!

152
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,559
He's got to be kidding...

153
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,895
You must heed my:swords.»

154
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,030
aly vA

155
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:03,242
What the!

156
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,118
Heath

157
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,820
It ca be...

158
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:17,856
You're right. he's probably playing...

159
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,994
No; he's: not playing
he's dead.

161
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,897
A gun

162
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,500
Somebody shot him!

163
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:33,772
Yes, it looks that way, I think it'd
be best if we got away from here too

165
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,074
Mom! Take care of Ran!

166
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,443
Sh, Shin!

168
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,150
Dang it...
I knew I'd be too late

170
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,087
A bullet casing?

171
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,392
This is...

172
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,605
What in the world!

173
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,409
I never thought it'd be
Heath who'd been shot...

175
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,911
Do you know him, Captain?

176
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:18,717
My wife's a big fan of)
his so, what happened?

178
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,553
The performers are
waiting in their dressing rooms

180
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,022
but the audience all ran off...

181
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:27,058
He, took a bullet in the
chest. 1it'srembeddedl~

183
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,295
in the wings on his back...

184
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:34,266
The wings on his back?
Oh. y6u mean this?

186
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,635
From the angle of the entry wound,

187
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,371
I'd say he was shot from
above at a 40 degree angle.

189
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,842
40 degrees? That's pretty high up.

190
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,277
Of. course it-is!

191
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,382
The shooter was up there
in the balcony seat,

193
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,819
And he used a laser sight.

194
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,454
Night Baroness!

195
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,523
Well if it isn't Yukiko.

196
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,391
And why are you here?

197
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,294
I just happened to watching the show.

198
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:06,965
I never dreamed the musical
would turn into a mystery though.

200
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,702
He was shot during the
climax where the angel appears,

202
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:15,073
the fireworks went off
and smoke filled the stage.

204
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:20,012
The image of the angel in the mirror
slides up and at the same time,

206
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:24,116
Heath, dressed as the
angel rises up from behind.

208
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:29,421
It was meant to look surreal, like
he had actually flown out the mirror...

210
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:35,327
So:what you're saying .is. the shooter
shot him: from the balcony

212
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,996
as he flew up from behind the mirror.

213
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,834
That's right and then the shooter
threw the gun onto the stage

215
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,838
to cause a panic, that way, the
shooter could get away in the chaos

217
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,474
Are you sure about that?

218
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,944
About the shooter being
in the balcony, I mean.

220
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:58,050
Of course I am! Thanks to all
the smoke on the stage. I clearly saw

222
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,019
a red beam leading from
the balcony to the stage

224
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,022
Besides. I think my son saw it too.

225
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,190
Your son?

226
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,826
Yes. he's standing right beside you!

227
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,263
What? Ouch!

228
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,765
He's the real thing alright.

229
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,737
Is this your son Shinichi, the
one you're always bragging about?

231
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,673
Yes, isn't he the splitting
image of Yusaku?

233
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,942
And they're both so mischievous too!

234
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,711
C€aptain! May I have a word.

235
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:27,746
What is it?

236
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,950
X, Cr
Shinichi, can't you behave yourself!

238
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,719
Gr . b)
Yeah, yeah...

240
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,523
Yukiko, it seems you were right.

241
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,831
There was a suspicious person who
bought that seat a month ago in advance.

243
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,834
And it seems they couldn't distinguish
whether it was a male or male!

245
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,269
Since the person wore a scarf and hat.

246
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,340
That's {he shooter. no doubt about it

247
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,076
But why that seat?

248
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,113
Is that a good seat. is it expensive?

249
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,984
That seat's at an angle. it's not a very
good seat, that's why it's cheaper

251
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,755
If someone came with their face hidden
and specifically requested that seat

253
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,323
they'd leave a lasting impression...

254
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,159
that's exactly what
the shooter would w ft.

256
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,796
I don't understand...

257
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,433
what are these two strange
marks on the deceased's body... \

259
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,835
Strange marks'? -

260
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,507
Yes, on his neck,
don't they look like burn marks?

262
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,343
And there s blood on his right hand...

263
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:36,248
Maybe he got it when he
grabbed his chest after he got shot

265
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:41,720
No, what: puzzles me is the
blood on his palm is smeared

267
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,089
It probably got smeared
when he touched something after

269
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,024
getting the blood on
his hand but there's no blood

271
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,960
on his clothes and it
wasn't possible for him touch

273
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,596
anything while he was hanging in mid air.

274
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:56,101
I don't think even you,
Might Baroness can solve that riddle.

276
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,437
0, 1 cE, elt Yor

277
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:03,075
Then let's ask Yusaku!
I'm sure he'd know

279
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:08,046
No, Yusaku's holedup in a
hotel room In Los Angeles-now

281
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:13,652
Thatis too bad a famous actor.s'
been murdered, what a mess

283
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,723
the murderer got away and on top
of that, we donit have a single clue

285
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,727
there's no telling what thegpeople and
the Chief will say, not to mention my wife

287
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,461
Excusemme...

288
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,632
then why don't you let Shinichi solve this?

289
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,304
Let Shinichi do it?
No way. impossible!

291
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:37,209
He s still a child and this is a
real murder weyre talkingtabout.

293
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,113
Yes but Shinichi solved the crime that
happened in the airplane

295
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:45,851
Sure, I'll bet that after the criminal
was caught, he whispered

297
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:51,389
I knew it, it's just as I thought, didn't he?

298
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,461
Uh, no, he was involved in the
investigation from the very start

300
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,896
He was?

301
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,366
Yes, and in the end, he
got all the suspects together and

303
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,568
smugly began to solve the crime

304
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,471
he acted like he was Holmes
or Poirot or something

307
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,672
So he did?

309
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,911
My Shinichi did that?

310
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,311
What?

311
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:26,191
The murderer is one of those four
actresses? I, I don't believe it...

313
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,494
Right after the shooting.

314
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:33,031
I went up to the balcony
¢ "at and I found this bullet '¢asing

316
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,902
it wasn't hot, it proves someone
Ieft it there beforehand...

318
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,038
But you saw it too, didn't you?

319
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,975
There was a red beam
ff@m that balcony seat to the stage.

321
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,545
Yes. that's whit it looked like,

322
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,814
but there's no way we could tell

323
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:53,385
where that beam came
from and where it was directed.

325
00:15:54,353 --> 00:16:00,625
That's right that beam probably came
from the stage. not from the balcony

327
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,863
It was to make us think it
was coming from up there

329
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,565
what I'm trying to say is...

330
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,267
the person who hid their
face to reserve that seat

332
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,603
and the strange package: that arrived

333
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:17,809
was all a ruse to make us think
someone was after the actresses!

335
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,645
Oh. uh huh

336
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,814
Yes. I see what» ou mean...

337
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,183
And of course, this is part of it too

338
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:31,957
Huh? This is where that suit of armor
fell just before the show started...

340
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,925
Look at the floor

341
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,896
there's thin fishing line tied to the nail

342
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,764
and there's markings
on the floor beside it.

344
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,566
It looks like something was cut...

345
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,238
And there's fishing line on
the suit of armor that fell too.

347
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,140
Are you saying somebody
did this deliberately?

349
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,310
That's right, the culprit
probably had a blade

351
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,579
or some kind attached to
their shoe and used it to cut the line

353
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,381
causing the armor to fall...

354
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,888
The culprit knew that Sharon's friends,
that's us, would pass through here

356
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,156
during our backstage tour!

357
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,694
Which means, the culprit Is someone
who was here to drop the armor,

359
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:14,399
and was also one of the
performers on stage with Heath

361
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,803
that way she could aim the beam
at the balcony then shoot him

363
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:25,977
anyone of those four
actresses could have done it!

365
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,814
But he's 6° 3" tall!

366
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,584
All of them are under 6°

367
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:37,454
How could anyone of them shoot him
from overhead when he's taller

369
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,424
than them and on top of that,
he was behind the mirror

371
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,560
Yes, he's right explain that, Shin!

372
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,195
I. uh, haven't figured that out yet...

373
00:17:59,011 --> 00:17:59,210
Lila...where you telling
me the truth just now

375
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:02,079
Lila...where you telling
me the truth just now?

379
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:08,620
Yes, Heath and I were seeing each other,
we had been for about 5 years...

381
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,691
Then you knew he was
also going out with me too!

383
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:17,729
Will you two calm down! Must you
talk about that today of all days!

385
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,564
Hey now...

386
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,535
I'd. think you'd be the
most upset 'aboutithis

388
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,906
your boyfriend has 2 other girlfriends...

389
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:28,573
You mean you too, Rose?
Lila Sanchez

391
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,209
You mean you too, Rose?
Lila Sanchez
IDI IOFxA
ELVES a OB
RE THR (32)

396
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,877
Were you dating him too?

397
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:38,883
I see those four do seem to
have a motive for killing Heath...

399
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:43,989
Why? I don't understand. I know he was
dating the three of them but...

401
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,525
Everess doesn't seem
to be involved with him?

403
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:53,397
Unlike the others, she doesn't have a
photo of him on her mirror

405
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:58,403
The truth is. Everess
and Heath are married

407
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,170
What!

408
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:05,043
Sharon told me secretly when we
wer& being given the backstage tour

410
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,445
she said it was a secret because

411
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,315
his popularity would
drop if it\became public.

413
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:15,286
So that's why she hated him. because
he was dating the other three.

415
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:21,626
But what we have to figure out is,
how he was shot from above!

417
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,131
Rose was the closest to the mirror,

418
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,934
but, she was on the ground,
acting the part of a startled woman

420
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:35,774
Everess was staggering...
Akane was on her knees praying

422
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,277
The only one able to
shoot him from above was Lila

424
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,512
who was standing and
clutching her head. but

426
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,649
unlike the others who
were hidden by the smoke,

428
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,885
Lila's hands were in plain view,

429
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:51,890
everyone would have
seen her take a gun out...

431
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,493
Do you think it's
possible Heath bent down?

433
00:19:55,828 --> 00:20:00,198
I doubt it, those wings
were. foot operated

435
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,534
and rigged so he couldn't bendadown

436
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,669
I see...

437
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,839
Hey Shinichi have you
come up with something?

439
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,153
Hey Shinichi.
Wait a minute

441
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,390
You've figured it out, haven't you?

442
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:28,326
Don't keep me in
suspense, tell me about it!

444
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:32,363
Hey Ran... how tall you are?

445
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,265
160 centimeters!

446
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,634
That'd be 53...

447
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,538
this pamphlet is about
172 inches so that's a foot

449
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,406
1 feet...

450
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,577
I hate to ask but can
you put this on your head

452
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,212
and stand in front of the mirror?

453
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,980
What?

454
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,785
What's this supposed to prove. Shinichi?

455
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,460
What. are you going ts do'?

456
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:04,262
Amman...

458
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:06,698
A clue.

459
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,566
A clue?

460
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,136
See, up over there!

461
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,937
There's a small crack...

462
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,674
That's strange. this mirror's been with the

463
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,010
troupe for years, it's their guardian spirit,

464
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,045
Sharon told me they took
good care of it because

466
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,714
they thought it'd be bad
Iuck if it got cracked...

468
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,650
He" what's this...

469
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,454
it looks like: its been patched!
Are you sure they took good care of this?

471
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,528
Don't yousthink this
curtain's a little crooked?

473
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:39,797
Somebody might've bumped into it
when they were trying to get to safety.

475
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,401
Hey Shinichi, let's go back already.

476
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,036
We're going to get scolded...

477
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:54,879
Feathers? How'd they get stuck here?

478
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:59,384
This cover of the floor
isn't used for anything...

480
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,355
Blood!

481
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,059
That's it now I understand!

482
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:12,897
The Killer used that certain
stage prop to commit the crime...

484
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,568
This bloody crime...

485
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,371
Was committed by someone
Iike that sneaky goddess Eris.
