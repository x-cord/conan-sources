00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,672
Maybe I should start off by
skiing at a real estate agency...

9
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:16,943
A warehouse?

10
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:20,312
Haven't you rented out a warehouse
that is ilncenspicuous

00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,049
in the suburbs and won't be suspected
no matter what IS dene there to anyone?

What is it?

33
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,397
Isw$ there a novelist who lives near here?

34
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,232
A novelist?

35
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,333
What do you mean?

36
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,871
After brother disappeared
he calledrus once at home,

38
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:19,939
What!

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,341

besides brother taled so fast.

45
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:38,057
All' she ce Td make out was>his words,
I'm with a lot of people like Sosek.

00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:42,628
He's with ..- people like Soseki...

48
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,967
Soseki

49
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:51,003
Did you tell the police about this?

50
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:55,408
Of course! But: they couldmt find anybody
Iike that no"matter 'how lard they searched

52

54
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:04,250
But, wasn't your brother a fan of Soseki?

55
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,652
If so, here's nothing
to worry about. is there?

was trembling and cut off half wa...

59
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:21,033
I see . He somehow made
the call while they weren't around,

61
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:26,005
Come to think of it, a man who
Iooks like Soseki does live near here!

63
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,978
He's the owner of the bookstere on the corner...
his niekname is "One-thousand yen."

Get out of here!

That's why I told you not to come.

83
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,322
What's with that man, anyway.

84
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,191
He sure smells fishy

85
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,860
No, he probably has nothing
to do with the incident.

87
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,528
I checked the warehouse of the beokstore but,

88
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,432
there was no printer for
printing out counterfeit bills:

90
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:32,838
:alking about printers, he newspaper agency
in front of the station was installing one...

00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,439

What were the people in there like?

97
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:51,224
A lady who is always wearing a broad brimmed
hat is the president of that small agency.

just means that he wasn't killed...

difficult to detect even by appearance
