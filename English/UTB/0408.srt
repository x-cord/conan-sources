the tree is where Ms. Tenko's body was
found at the end of the hallway...

50
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,974
Something's suspicious

The shadow of the vase?

63
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:14,326
First the moonlight is directly from tho back

64
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,595
the design of the vase could not be seen...

65
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,364
After the b ackout.

66

When we found Ms. Tenko's body.

67
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,637
The moonlight was from the side
so we could see the design of the vase!

69
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,875
Huh!? The moon can't move that fast!

70

That's not possible. that doesn't .

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,995
First the moon was covered by clouds.

79
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,798
So it was dark and the design
of the vase couldn't be see

81
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:56,168
the cloud disappeared during "the blackout

82
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,770
and so the design could:now.be seen?

83
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,505
If\ ou say so...

84
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,640
It may be so...

85
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,108
And then?

86
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,980
Didn't you hear the culprit run away or
voices during the blackout

88
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,482
It may have been so

89
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,786
but the lights suddenly turned off
and we were, screaming so...

91
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:19,024
Mr. Hoshikawa was telling us
in a soothing voice to'calm down...

93
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,626
Soothing voice?

94
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,661

down on the sofa.

131

And was.-standing still for about one minute
of the blackout

133
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:51,316
I told her it wouldn't be a good idea to
move around in the dark...

135
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,852
Then who reset the breaker?

136

when it was thrown.

went into Mr. Masakage's room

shrubbery as cushion.

was looking for the book.

260
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,246
And was killed.

261
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:35,350
And afterwards, Mr. Hoshikawa, Kazuha,
Ran came in so

263
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:39,454
after the blackout, put Ms. Tenko's body
at the end of the hallway

265
00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:42,691
went into Mr. Masakage's room down the
hall to the left

267
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,393
And escaped from the window.

268
00:10:47,163 --> 00:10:49,297
There were works on the hallway switch to
make it look like a blackout...

270
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:49,831
There ware works on the hallway switch to

276
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,510
If it wasn't an outsider.

277
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,880
How would someone among the three

278
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,983
put Ms. Tenko's body over there?

280
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:14,589
Also Mrs. Manri, you said that,

visited 5 years ago.

If there's anyone to be suspicious 1bout,
wouldn't it be him?

287
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:25,033

Huh? H... habit...

292
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,147
I don't know...there might have been,
but it's been 5 years.

294
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:42,917
Hmmm. for example.

295
00:11:42,918 --> 00:11:46,521
Push ng up the middle of his sunglasses
ith his left hand little finger .

297
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:49,691
Right, right! That habit...

299
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,259
What?

300
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,327
Why does Heiji know?

301
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:55,263
I don't know but I know...

304
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:57,766
that what Mrs. Manri is saying is...

307
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:59,933
the person in the very right of this picture.

308
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,938
The man with 1 hat, sunglasses, and 1
nmwpnilvtsfino flea m» 001Of!

310
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:06,274
Is. Isn't it...

311
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,209
Mr. Handa when he was young?

313
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:10,545
That's right

314
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:14,349
Mr. Handa pushed up the middle of his
sunglasses with his left hand little finger...

316
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:20,221
Then, the suspicious Man Mrs. Mann met
5 years ago was Mr. Handa ?

318
00:12:20,756 --> 00:12:21,823
Stupid!

319
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:27,729
If that-rm an was Mr. Hand who was hiving
in this house as Mr. Masakage's pupil

321
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,630
Mrs. Manri would've recognized him!?

322
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:32,267
Oh. that's true...

323
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:34,269
Well. that's to say...

324
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:37,672
when people say things that's not true but
actually sounds like it's true.

326
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,409
They usually visualize someone they
know in their heads!

328
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,880
It would be bothersome If things don't
add up later on...

330
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,616
And that someone is...

331
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:51,753
Is Mr. Handa when he was young!

332
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:55,023
I see...if that man's habit

333
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,558
ANTI
Is just like Mr. Handa's

335
00:12:56,926 --> 00:13:01,963
Mrs. Mann will-have 0 problem
recognizing it, so it will not bc suspected...

337
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:02,764
But.

338
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,033
Why lie like that...

339
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:08,036
She realized who the culprit was...

340
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,940
from where Ms. lenkaers body lay...

341
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,808
and from the state the body was found...

342
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,212
Mr Hoshikawa...

343
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:19,764
t-hut you are t-ho murdOrOr!!

344
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,955
Then Mrs. Mann, you covered up for
Mr Hoshikawa

346
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:28,356
N.no that can't be true!

347
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:30,892
When Mr. Hoshikawa found Ms. Tcenke.

348
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,962
I was clinging on to him
so he wasn't able to move.

350
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:38,500
That's why I'm going to unravel that
mystery right now!!

352
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:41,302
Look at this. this hallway...

353
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,737
It's the same as last time. right?

354
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,540
Uh...yes. justilike'this

355
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:50,178
It was poorly lit but I noticed thoro was
nothing at the end of the hallway...

357
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:52,447
WwW .well at that time...

358
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,818
I was holding on to Mr. Hoshikawa's arm
Iike this!

360
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,320
S.stupid! You're too c ose!

361
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,189
So you won't play any tricks on me!

362
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,257
So behave!

363
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:04,158
Hey...

364
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,728
Hey. so hurry up and unravel the mystery!

365
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:10,331
WwW. when Mr Hoshikawn pressed this
switch...

367
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,101
you said it blacked out

370
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:16,271
If it blacked out. the breaker...

371
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:21,543
Conan!?

372
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,680
Since when were'you there?

373
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:27,415
How did you...

374
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,218
I was here all the time

375
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:32,654
Don't lie to me!

376
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:33,688
When it got dark,

377
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:35,790
You came out of the storage room,
didn't ou?

380
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,262
I was here in this storage room
the whole time

382
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:42,997
but the door didn't open I

383
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:47,035
B.but I didn'ttsee Conan...

385
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,438
Huh? What?

386
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,675
What is it. Conan

387
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,742
Huh?

388
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,044
Disappeared?

389
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,512
We didn't disappear!

390
00:14:57,846 --> 00:14:58,947
Conan?

391
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,548
Like this...

392
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:03,818
Brother Heiji just moved Mr. Masakage's
room

394
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,453
door like this...

395
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:10,158
during, the blackout...

396
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,193
Just like Mr. Hoshikawa did...

397
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,630
Rh... that can't be true!

398
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,837
Ah!!

399
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,706
Th this is...

400
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,874
Isn't it similar? This room...

401
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,077
Iooks just like the end of the hallway...

403
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:34,349
The door of the storage room is
that closet...

405
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:37,051
The right wall is this screen!

406
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,753
And...

407
00:15:38,754 --> 00:15:39,253
And.

408
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,590
The small window at the
end of the hallway is...

410
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,763
The big window hidden by this sideboard...

411
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:53,401
Ws = Om, Om CF Bales Wks leges
room that can be scen.

414
00:15:55,738 --> 00:15:59,240
If behind Mr. Masakage's room door 18
the mirror...

416
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:01,976
You can tell already. right?

417
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,446
Before the blackout what Kazuha saw

419
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:11,302
The roomyseen as reflected in the mirror
behind the door!

421
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:15,973
Then, the body was at the end of the
hallway from the very beginning...?

423
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,027
Ah. .so during the blackout

424
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:23,031
Mr Pl loshik yw shut the mirror door
and showed it!

426
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:29,270
But when we centered the room, there was
no Mirror in back of the door...

429
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:32,540
That's right, that's right! There was ne extra
door at all!

431
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:32,807
That's right, that's right! There was no extra
door at all!

433
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:35,677
Conan?

434
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,912
This door is some door

435
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:42,650
move the mirror by the knob and put the
door together...

437
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,688
And I becomes one door
Some trick!

439
00:16:47,823 --> 00:16:51,092
You noticed the trick because the door was
too thick

441
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,494
and the line down the center, right?

442
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,029
Uh huh...

443
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,264
and also

444
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,333
because of the uncomfortabl: feeling
Kasuha and that Indy was talking about!

446
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:00,401
Huh?

447
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:01,869
You were saying.

448
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,073
Before and after Ms Tank body was
found,

450
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,308
the shadow of the vase was different

451
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,778
I was convinced as I recalled that...

452
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,897
before and after Ms. Tenko's body was
found.

454
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:18,486
It must have been a different place where
the moon light was cast differently.

456
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:22,457
But this house is a convenient house for
tricks...

458
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:24,125
Of course...

459
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:26,594
this door, room, hallway...

460
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:32,400
Mr Masakage made everything in order to
play this trick...

462
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:33,835
What! ?

464
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,537
Bring the guests to this hallway...

466
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:39,339
When he turns off the light closes the door.

467
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:42,376
And shows the Christmas tree at the
end of the hall

469
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,913
and surprises everyone with the magic.

470
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:47,781
So that's it!

471
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:49,851
No w\ Wy
That's"why Mrs. Manri knew that
Mr. Hoshikawa

475
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,552
was the culprit from the beginning.

476
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:52,086
Cr Ww\ \ \\

477
00:17:52,421 --> 00:17:56,057
But, wasn't it you who wanted to come here
Mr. Handa...?

479
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:56,491
\\\\

480
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:02,597
Mr. Hoshikawa didn't intend te kill. His
intent to Kill probably developed

482
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:07,735
when Ms. TenkoO said she was going to do
the trick "Witch Reborn in the next show...

484
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:08,870
No...

485
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,806
Actually It's
The Resurrection of the! Dev I'...

487
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:15,510
the titlovof the magic
Mr Masakage:-thought of...

489
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:16,944
Huh?

490
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:20,114
The same stage setup and performance...

491
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,350
I realized right away

492
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,303
that she looked at
Mr Masakage s trick book

494
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,755
and was going to copy it...

495
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,592
1 he Mogic that had been sealed because
It was too dangerous.

497
00:18:32,227 --> 00:18:34,095
That miracle magic

498
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:38,216
But, she was just going to steal the
master's trick...

500
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,635
She)d id nxtiknewWAtha™

501
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:45,173
everyone, in other words. wo discussed
and decided not to do that magic...

503
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:48,209
Because it was before she became my
husband's pupil

507
00:18:49,744 --> 00:18:55,383
Mrs Mann covered up for me-when she
said the book was in the storage room...

509
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,121
Master always carried the book around...

510
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:04,125
but one day ten, ears ago. he misplaced
the trick book

512
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,160
but one day ten years ago, he misplaced
the trick book

514
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:09,397
and said he was going to go look for
it but never came back...

516
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,235
I thought if was strange for her to be able
to look at the book

518
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,606
so I celled her to the teacher's room
ind confronted her...

520
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,242
That's right. I stole it...

521
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,828
I am clever with my hands by profession...

522
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,714
I was going to return it the teacher
when he returned

524
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,017
but I didn't think he would be so shocked

525
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:32,185
to disappear from everyone.

526
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:33,887
But...

527
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:36,591
the teacher who was always telhng us to
surpass him

529
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,493
didn't realize that he was betrayed...

530
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,463
It was probably his time to quit...

531
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,300
As a magician...

532
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:55,543
Well, if I perform Mr. Masakage's not yet
performed magic all over the world...

534
00:19:56,311 --> 00:20:00,047
The master will be happy from under the
sod don't you think?

536
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,689
Th that's why you killed her?

537
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,260
Uh huh. my mind went into total panic

538
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:16,030
and when I snapped back to myself,
she was all bloody lying in front of me...

540
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:20,166
I recalled the master's
Christmas tree magic...

542
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:23,871
and used that to make at look lake an
outsider had killed her...

544
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:31,545
Then you broke the branches in the
s rubbery. and erased the footprints...

546
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:32,647
Yeas...

547
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,784
Probably, the weapon was the vase in
Masakage's room

549
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,688
There was blood on the base of the vase...

550
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,992
and maybe a few drops of blood got on
Mr. lioshikawa's black clothes...

552
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:48,129
Uh huh. the evidence is all over the place

553
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:50,431
I failed as a magician...

554
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:52,433
You're a failure even If you're not a
magician!

556
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:54,735
Brace yourse

557
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,589
Unlike magic, your charge will not
disappear eas ly
