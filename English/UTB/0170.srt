1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:02,902
Just as! flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,370
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,172
deductions take all shapes and styles
In each and every case to be solved

5
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,474
Today's episode is at a hospital.
Kogoro is surprised

7
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:09,942
and Ran is acting strange too.

8
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,011
He sees through to the
one and only truth!

10
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,980
With the appearance of a child and
the brain of an adult...

12
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,249
His name is Detective Conan!

13
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,218
Yeah...ll can't come home for a while yet.

14
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,554
Gee, what on earth are you doing?

15
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,689
All the others in class are also
worried about you too.

17
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,257
I've got no choice.

18
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,894
I'm handling a dangerous and difficult
case, right

20
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,296
Uh, you know what...

21
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:14,200
Oh, I'm sorry, Shinichi! I have
something to do and gotta go.

23
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:14,900
What?

24
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,970
Bye, then, and take care because it's
getting cold!

27
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,113
There's something...something strange
about Ran recently...

29
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:30,816
She seems to be giving me the cold
shoulder when I call her...

31
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,687
She's not raving, "Shinichi, Shinichi
Iike she used to before either...

33
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,524
And, the strangest thing is...

34
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,861
Ah, Conan!
I'mOgoing out for a while!

36
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,796
I left your dinner on the table

37
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,565
so warm it up with the micro-wave
before you eat it, ok?

39
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,067
Oh, okay...

40
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,205
She recently goes out n the evenings
almost everyday .

42
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,475
Although Ran says she's going to karate
Iessons...

44
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,611
Something bothers me about the way

45
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,113
she looks so happy...

46

Blind Spot in the Darkness" Part I

50
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,656
One day...

51
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:14,393
What?!
You were going to the hospital?!

53
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:18,898
Yeah...I'm going to get
the results of the test now.

55
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,966
Is something wrong with you?

56
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:23,736
I feel a bit tired recently...

57
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,238
You're probably drinking too much.

58
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,908
Right! I don't see why you
have to take us with you

60
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,976
when we just came back from school.

61
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,845
Why make such a big thing of it.

62
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:39,318
The doctor told me to bring my family
along when I go to the hospital...

64
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,755
H..Hey, don't tell me that you...

65
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,458
Mr. Kogoro Mourn...

66
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,759
Mr. Mourn...

67
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,426
Mr. Mouri...

68
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,230
Another...six months...

69
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,000
I know exactly how you feel but,

70
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,236
unfortunately for the next six months
have to...

72
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,039
Hey, you!
How cruel can you get!!

74
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,875
Suddenly téllingfme that
I only have another six months to live!!

76
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,510
If I'm that seriously ill,

77
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,347
isn't it only manners for:you
as:a doctor to give it to me slowly...

79
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,549
Huh?...Seriously ill.

80
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,753
I just wanted to tell you to stay away from
alcoholic drinks for the next six months...

82
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,056
Huh?...Alcohol?

83
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,858
Yes... The results of the tests show that

84
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,862
you have kidney trouble
caused"by over drinking

86
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,663
Although the symptoms
are still very slight...

88
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,135
Just as I thought...

89
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,239
Dr. Araide, you really scared me!!

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,608
Telling-me to bring my family
along with me

92
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,878

alcoholic drinks,

Please reduce your daily intake of
alcoholic beverages

00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,752
Yes, I'll make him quit drinking for good!

103
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,786
Hey!

104
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,058
You have a call from Ms. Sugita. She's
asking you to give her a house call...

106
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,494
Not again...

107
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,030
What a troublesome patient

108
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,066
All she's got is plain ulcers,
but«she's such a worrier

127
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,649
Excuse me.

128
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,418
May I use the restroom?

129
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,887
The restroom for patients is broken...

130
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:22,688
my...

131
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,062
I turned right at the corridor so...
It's this way+...

133
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,133
Yes, the examination room is
right up ahead...

135
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,636
Gee, what a large house this is...

136
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,971
Wow!

137
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,244
Oh, no, it's my fault for being
absent minded...

139
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,786
Okay, that's all.

140
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,020
Oh, thank you...

141
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,189
Uh, who are you

142
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,793
I'm Kogoro Mouri's daughter, one of the
doctor's patients.

144
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:03,195
Oh...Mr. Mouri's daughter...

Hey! Don't tell me it's you again!!

157

How long is it going to take you
to get used to this house anyway?!

176
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:52,011
After all, you have the same name
as the famous Kogoro Mourn.

178
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,181
Oh, you've never heard of
the renowndetective...?

180
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,918
Uh no, so, you see...

181
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,555
What?! \ ou're the famous detective...!!

182
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,590
Yes!!

183
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:09,128
Well, ll was wondering
from the time I saw, your name

185
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,898
but you're him in person, eh!!
I was completely deceived,

187
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,735
because you acted like
you knew nothing about medicine...

189
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,506
How, about having dinner over
at our house tonight?

191
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,242
Lets talk about medicine, the two of us!!

192
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,379
No! I've got homework to do,

193
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,416
and Ran has karate practice too...
4 right?!

195
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,952
Why not? Lets have dinner here!

196
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,256
Resting one lesson couldn't possibly hurt

197
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,393
something... something's
strange -after all...

199
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:48,200
You graduated with honors from
Tohto University, Tomoaki!!

201
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,468
Fantastic!!

202
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,270
True, isn't it, Tomoaki!

203
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,638
I was just lucky.

204
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,308
How about thinking of marrying
my daughter?

206
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,077
Come on, Dad!!

207
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,113
My I think you two make quite
a nice pair. What do you say?

209
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,482
Oh, please knock it off, Mom.

210
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,750
Agh!!

211
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,052
Are you all right?

212
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,555
Please be careful since
the steamed dish is hot.

214
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,622
I'm sorry...

215
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,858
Is it all right?

216
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,594
Weren't supposed to have a meeting
tonight about your class reunion?

218
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,397
Oh, that's right! I have to call Masae!

219
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,337
Well, if you want to marry-her,
Iet me know anytime!

221
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,974
If we join hands, we will indeed be like
Holmes'and. Watson's

223
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,243
Every case"ll be solved in no time!

224
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,212
Give me a break!

225
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,282
Besides, I don't think that a detective
and a doctor make a good pair.

227
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,151
Our mission as doctors is

228
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,553
not to perform an autopsy
so that the killer can be arrested

230
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:45,624
to save the victim's life...

231
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,260
Oh...you got me there!

232
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,867
It's hard to tell who
Holmes is. isn't it, Ran...

234
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,606
Ran...

235
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,909
Dr. Araide sure is late.

236
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,678
He should already be finished working...

237
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,880
He's taking a bath...

238
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,983
He has a habit of taking a bath
before dinner.

to be the first to take a bath!

Phooey! Some bread winner!

264
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,302
All he did was take after the family,
and yet he acts so big!

267
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:37,142
The only person that is related by blood
in this house is you, my grandson!

269
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,745
And to think that you're going to be
Ieaving this house

271

at the end of this month...

272

274
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,385
Oh, Mother, what about dinner?

275
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,557
No thanks, why don't all you strangers
enjoy dinner together!

277
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,161
Oh, don't let it bother you.

278
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,330
Grandma is upset because

279
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,867
father changed the toilet and bathtub
from Japanese style to Western style.

Western style?

282
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,305
She was especially enraged

284
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,842
when he changed the white cedar bath tub
to one with a shower curtain.

286
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,978
She shouted saying, "Are you trying to
dirt on the tradition of this house!

288
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:16,248
Well, she sure is an energetic
elderly woman.

290
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,883
Oh no! A black out?!

291
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,687
It seems that the black out is only in
this house.

293
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,989
The lights of the house next door are on...

294
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,591
Kyaah!

295
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,560
Are you all right?

296
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,997
Uh, I'm sure there's a flashlight in that
drawer over there...

298
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,001
Here it is!

299
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,171
I'll go check the breaker!

300
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,305
Can you handle it?

303
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,409
Watch your step, Hikaru.

304
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,913
What's up? What happened?

305
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,581
There was a black out.

306
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,488
Oh, no, isn't this the sound of rain?

308
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,656
1 CO...

309
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,758
Bummers...

310
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,563
Oh, the lights are on.

312
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,207
Oh, I'm sorry! I thought you were Dad...

313
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,545
What on earth is going on?

314
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,046
Oh, mother...

315
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,216
nd... about the charges.

316
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,985
Well, I think 30,000 yen
is a bit too expensive.

318
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,320
Did the lights turn on?

319
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,489
You idiot! Can't you see for yourself?!

320
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,759
Maybe you'd better go check on how
father is doing?

322
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,595
He's probably angry that the lights
wen ut.and besides,

324
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,163
I'm worried about his heart to...

325
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,197
I guess so.

326
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,799
I'll go check then.

327
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,467
Oh, I'll go too!

328
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,937
Why did it black out...?

329
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,004
I wonder...

330
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:50,275
Probably a short circuit somewhere or
the fuse blew out...

332
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,310
Kyaah!

333
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,579
Huh? What is it?

334
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,247
It's from the bath tub...

335
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:03,255
-- . SL ~-T SA

336
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,159
Father!!

337
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,769
Father!!

338
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,971
Don't touch him!!!

339
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,243
If you touch him,
you'll be electrocuted too.

341
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,045
Electrocuted?!

342
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,050
Hey, come on, don't tell that...

343
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,523
He was Killed because of this razor that
IS connected to the extension cord...

345
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,527
I'm going to try CPR, Mother,

346
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,365
please prepare an ll.V with cardiotonic
drug! Hikaru, call the ambulance!!

348
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,599
FHurry!

349
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,734
PY Yes!!

350
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:51,702
Oh, and call*the police too!

351
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,171
Okay!!

352
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,044
There seems to be no doubt that

353
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,481
this extension cord got soaked in the
water and he was electrocuted...

355
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:07,185
He used the mirror above the bath tub
when he shaved using the razor

357
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,988
But, why did he shave while bathing...?

358
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,457
Wait a minute,

359
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,259
don't tell me that this is...

360
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:20,731
Unfortunately...
Mr. Yoshiteru Araide has passed away.

362
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,002
He did have a weak heart to begin with...

363
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,339
Oh no...

364
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:31,409
And? Under what circumstances was
Mr. Yoshiteru Araide found?

366
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,811
Oh, well...

367
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,415
His head was faced this way, and
he was slack...

369
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,819
I wonder why he used his electric shaver
while soaking in the tub...

371
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,954
He had a habit of doing so.

372
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:46,158
He always shaved while making
his guest wait...

374
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,928
He even made sure that we smoked
proofed it...

376
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:55,133
What a strange habit; -to'take a bath
while his guests are waiting...

378
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,302
Father liked to take a bath and

379
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,505
he always took a twice a day,
in the morning and before dinner,

381
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,741
saying that sanitation was a
must for doctors...

383
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:05,210
Phooey! It serves him right!!

384
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,380
The heavens punished him for not taking
heed of Chiaki's warning!

386
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:14,486
This is probably chastisement from
Chiaki who is in the world beyond...

388
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,821
Grandma!

389
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,989
Chiaki...?

390
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,394
She's my mother who died in a traffic
accident 4 years ago.

392
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,097
Chiaki always warn him about

393
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,699
using the electric shaver
when taking a bath saying,

395
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,969
Don't use it with the cord on
because it's dangerous.

397
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,805
And you, Yoko?

398
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,708
I'm his second wife and married him
two years ago.

400
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,977
I used to be in the same class
as Chiaki in nurse school,

402
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,446
and she used to complain to me a lot.

403
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,483
Inspector, please watch!

404
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,686
He tries to shave using this mirror,

405
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,355
the part where the shaver is
plugged into the extension cord

407
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,390
stops on the edge of the tub.

408
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,893
Very dangerous indeed.

409
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,462
Where were you all during a black out?

410
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,198
We were all in the kitchen.

411
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:06,304
I saw mother go up the stairs by the
corridor opposite the bathroom too.

413
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,873
If so, then the only likely conclusion
would be that...

415
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:13,945
Mr. Araide mistakenly pulled the cord
of the shaver into the water

417
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,548
while he was shaving, and electrocuted.

418
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,617
This is an accidental death.

419
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,018
I guess so...

420
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,426
Hey!! Cut out that mischief!

421
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,429
But, my head is messed up and feel like
falling down.

423
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,031
Huh? Why?

424
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,901
Well, the man who died
was shaving standing up,

426
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:39,304
and Detective Takagi
was copying him, right?

428
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,373
If so, when he got electric shock,

429
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:45,310
his head is supposed to come
this way like Detective Takagi, right?

431
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:50,115
But, that man's head was
faced the other way. I wonder why?

433
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,416
That's true.

434
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,585
Hey, this may probably be...

435
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,755
Phooey! No big deal!

436
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,461
While Mr. Araide was shaving...

437
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,665
he realized that the cord was going to
fall into the water...

439
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,700
and rushed to pick it up...

440
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,436
but he pulled it into the tub instead.

441
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:18,810
He then touched the railing
accidentally and was electrocuted.

443
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,378
So, you see!

444
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:24,516
Hmm...pretty good, Pops.

445
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:30,622
Agh! No! Don't touch that! The razor is
vital proof, isn't it?

447
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:34,059
Touch it? I'm just holding it!

448
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,760
How about you, Detective Takagi?

449
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,563
No, I only held it in my hand too...?

450
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,599
How about the Investigation officer?

451
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,268
I just took pictures.

452
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,339
Strange. Then I wonder who played such
a bad prank like this...?

454
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,141
Just what are you trying to get at?!

455
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,880
Because look, the switch of the razor is
turned off!!

457
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,983
What's going on?

458
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,818
It is strange after all!!

459
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,121
If he was electrocuted while shaving
the switch would have to be on...

461
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:09,160
The switch must've moved when you fell

462
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,562
Iike so...

463
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:16,835
Huh? The plug should've been pulled out
to avoid danger.

465
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,070
Yes, I have it right here!

466
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,073
I see! This is the battery charge type!

467
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,777
Then, why was it switched off?

468
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,147
I wasn't moving when
the body was found, was it?

470
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,851
I think...that's only natural.

471
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,588
Somebody didnlt want the noise of the
shaver to be heard!

473
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,758
Huh? Who didn't want it to be heard
by who?

475
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,529
Beats me! I'm just making guesses!

476
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,964
Maybe,

477
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:52,804
someone could put the cord into
the tub without Mr. Araide noticing?

479
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,072
You idiot! He'd inotice* *

480
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,243
If you did something like that, even if
the shaver wasn't making any noise!

482
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,781
Besides, everyone has an alibi when the
the house blacked out...

484
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,719
When the lights went on, it turned off
once then went on again, right?

486
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,426
Hikaru? You were the one who went to
Iift the breaker, weren't you?

488
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,493
Yes!!

489
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,998
Did you lift the breaker twice back then?

490
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:25,136
Oh, I'm sorry!! I seem to have touched the
wrong switch,

492
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,472
The breaker of another place
seems to have been lowered,

494
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,241
so I put it back again right away...

495
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,111
I'm really sorry!!

496
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:39,483
Inspector, the second one was the
overload current breaker...Maybe this is...

498
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,454
Maybe a timer was rigged so that there
would be a black out,

500
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:49,260
and if someone went into the bathroom
to sneak the electric cord into the tub,

502
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,129
anyone of those four could've done so...

503
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,231
It's possible...

504
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,800
Uh, what are you whispering about...?

505
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,868
Oh, no, it's nothing.

506
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,839
I would like to confirm your alibis before
the black out occurred, just in case.

508
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,476
We just gave you our alibis a while ago?!

509
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,880
Huh? Are you saying that
the killer is among us?

511
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,916
Like I just said I'm doing so, just in case!

512
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,021
Oh, you were on the phone all through
the black out?

514
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,758
Yes...from the time before the black out
till the lights went back on.

516
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,762
I was on the phone
by the kitchen entrance.

518
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:30,802
I was talking to my friend, Masae about
arrangements on the reunion.

520
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,304
Oh, I did receive a catch phone, though

521
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,208
No one answered when I picked it up,
and the person hung up right away...

523
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:38,943
Detective Takagi, will you verify this
right away!

525
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,045
Yes, sir!

526
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:45,884
Was looking for a flashlight when it
blacked out and handed it over to Hikaru.

528
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,253
I was here in the kitchen right through...

529
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,722
Can someone verify that for you?

531
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:53,024
No not really

532
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,727
Tomoaki was here all the while.

533
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,697
After Hikaru went to raise the breaker,

534
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,601
I was scared, so I was clinging on to
Tomoaki until the lights went on!

536
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,470
Are you sure?

537
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,373
Why?

538
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,878
So like I said, I thought he was my dad.

539
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,015
Next, Mitsu, where were you?

540
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:22,754
I had just finished climbing the stairs
when the lights went out.

542
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:26,624
And, I fingered my way to
my room upstairs.

544
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:33,031
But, I hear that when the lights went back
on, you were downstairs near the kitchen

546
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,834
I felt a presence.

547
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,838
Just as I was about to hit the sack,
I felt a presence outside my room...

549
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,439
Don't tell me...

550
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,409
Someone else other than all of you
had snuck into the house?!

552
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,348
I felt that way and*followed the
sound downstairs. But, I found out.

554
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,716
What did you find out?

555
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,885
It was the sound of the rain.

556
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:59,891
And, finally you, Hikaru.

557
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,559
Yes!

558
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:07,031
I went over to the breaker to turn on
the lights...I'm still not used to this house,

560
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,601
so I got lost a bit, though...

561
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,871
You didn't notice anyone suspicious,
did you?

563
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,739
No nobody...

564
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,411
Just as I thought.

565
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,682
I noticed you were
holding your arm...

567
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,852
You're always much too tolerant
from before.

569
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,454
A burn?

570
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,755
Excuse me,

571
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:34,726
but I'd like to treat her wound
so would it be all right to go to the clinic?

573
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:38,363
Yes, but please have the officer in the
corridor accompany you!

575
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,632
We'reiunder surveillance, eh?

576
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,868
Oh, and one more thing!

577
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:49,908
You seem to be the only one who had left
the house between Spm and 7pm

579
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,543
where were you?

580
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,312
I went as-temporary basket ball coach for
alhigh school basket ball club!

582
00:21:54,313 --> 00:22:00,051
It's my alma mater, and since my mentor
broke his bone,

584
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,587
I'm substituting for him until he recovers.

585
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:05,890
You, a doctor, a basketball coach?

586
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,693
You can go ahead and ask Ran about it.

587
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:13,765
I go to coach for Teitan High School, the
school that Ran goes to

589
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,435
You know, the advisor of the basketball
club Mr. Tabuchi, don't you?

591
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:19,637
Oh, yes.

592
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:26,310
Hey, don't tell me that the reason for
karate club that Ran was going to daily is...

594
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:32,584
It can't be?!

Will you please go check the breaker?

639
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,847
Okay!

640
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,951
I wonder why the lights went out?

641
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,287
Come to think of it, that man was saying

642
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,524
something about experimenting while
taking a bath.

644
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:22,060
Don't tell me that Dad...

645
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,163
You're the killer, aren't you?!
