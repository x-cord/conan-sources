1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:03,736
The distance between love and hate is
filled as the two solve mysteries together

3
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,605
Officer of police headquarters
and the detective squad,

5
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,673
Love and mystery is on
the verge of explosion

7
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,342
He sees through the one and only truth

8
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,377
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

10
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,080
NoJcase is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

12
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:02,455
Hey! Isn't that Hide?

13
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,790
Where. where, I can't see!

15
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,527
They said on radio just a while ago that

16
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,464
Hide is going to be riding the car
at the end of the line!

18
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,065
Oh, that's right!

19
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,936
It'sure.is unusual to have a soccer
victory parade though...

21
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,205
It can't"be helped...

22
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:22,541
Everygyear a-big-fuss-is made over
the Spirits being:the-winning candidate,

24
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,412
and. finally this year they won
the J1¥¢hampionshipsfor the-first time!

26
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,950
Moreover, they won by a dramatic
come-from-behind victory...

28
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,286
Right! In the second half lost time
they were losing 1 to 0,

30
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,489
but Hide tied the game!

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,525
And then right after playoff
Naoki scored V goal!

33
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,793
He was awesome!

35
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:45,598
But with all this crowd,
we can't really see the parade.

37
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,469
Ght... It's so disappointing becau
I even brought my video camera along...

39
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,271
That's why I told you, right?

40
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,608
We should've kept watching TV
ike we wens!

42
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,942
Come. come!

43
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:01,213
We set the video before coming here,
SO we can all watch it together later!

45
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:05,951
Uh. .Hey! Maybe if we go there,
we can have a better view!

47
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,519
Huh'?

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,821
There! Over there!

49
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,855
I see!

50
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,191
If you go on.topathe empty cans container, 4
we may-get a better view!

52
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,059
Let's go!

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,659
Okay!

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,998
How is it? can-you-See?

55
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,068
Wait a second...

56
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,305
I can see glimpses of their heads,
but not their faces.

58
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:30,309
Ouch sF=.

59
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,144
Hey. hey!

60
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,882
Dang. if it was only a bit"higher!

61
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,419
But, I don't see anything that is higher
than this empty cans container

63
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:41,954
Neither do I...

64
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,459
That's it!

65
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,961
Hey. hey hey...

66
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:50,529
PARADE ANDE MALICE AND SAINTS
PART I

70
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,235
(B1%R)
PARADE ANDE MALICE AND SAINTS
PART I

73
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:02,641
On. I see him in the distance! Ms Hide!
Naoki is also betfhdi=>

75
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,711
It Seems like he's looking this
way and waving his hand!

77
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,979
R.Really?

78
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,815
Hey. let me see too!

79
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:13,519
Oh, wait a minute.
This is the best part!

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,953
Hcy!

82
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,992
You shouldn't climb up there!

83
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,027
Oh. I.I'm sorry

84
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,362
Ill put him down right away

85
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:27,165
Staying up here a little while
won't hurt will it, old lady!

87
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,837
Hey! What's with the oldflady bit?
How dare you call me old lady!

89
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,807
If you don't listen to me I'm going to

90
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,641
arrest you.

91
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,978
Officer Sato!

92
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,780
What are you doing dressed like that?q

93
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:47,119
Oh, I get it! You sneaked of f from work
and came to watch the parade in secret!

95
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,423
I see!
That's why you're in disguise

97
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,693
No way!
I have my reasons

99
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,061
You're dating, right?

100
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,129
With Officer Takagi

101
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,064
Y. Yumi!

102
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,901
I happened to see...

103
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,201
Saw what?

104
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,972
Officer Takagi choosing
a wig in the restroom!

106
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:12,044
Dating while on the move,
you guys are pretty cool!

108
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:16,048
N.No! This is

109
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,784
You can't talk about us then...

110
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,653
You mean it's okay for
officers to do stuff like that? 7

112
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,455
It's against service regulations

113
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,091
What will become of
the future of Japan...

115
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,961
1.I'm telling you
you got it all wrong!

117
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,165
We're on duty, on duty!
It's no date!

119
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,770
Inspector Shiratori,
How come you're in disguise too?

121
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:42,274
We just received an odd fax at
the headquarters a while ago

123
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,477
am an anti Spirit.

124
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:48,347
Something interesting will happen at
Al) (xr WO [Re eid

127
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:48,547
Something interesting will happen at
fo - pallor Silo (ereks KR ee

130
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,148
Something interesting will happen at
WO - moRiern Salo IF Ta, RR 0

132
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,887
And that FAX. was very similar to the ow
one in a case that I previously handled @P

134
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,790
That's why we, of the 1st
Investigation Unit is here too.

136
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,794
But, the culprit knows our faces,

137
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,396
sO we all disguised ourselves
and are investigating right now!

139
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:09,868
Well, it's more likely a bad prank
of some fan jealous of the championship

142
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,905
so it's not a date..."

144
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,711
And besides, the date in question,

145
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,913
IS supposed to be next week...

146
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:29,121
I thought that you couldn't wait till
then so you both got eager and...

148
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,522
I guess not then...

149
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,926
H.Hey. how come you know about it?

150
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,427
Everybody,knows about it

151
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,732
You're going to Tropical Marine
that just opened. right?

153
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,634
E.Everybody?

156
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,802
Don't take the Japanese police lightly...

160
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:50,576
If he takes a day off on, the day that
you're off everybody can tell

163
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:54,179
Il heard thatiwhenpOfficer Takagn
was shoved into the interrogation room

165
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,750
and crossyexamined by everybody,
he confesse limmediately

167
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,618
C.Confessed...

168
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,427
Well-just be careful, okay.

169
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,732
It seems that a lot of other people
asked for the same day off too.

171
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:18,637
Right, and it also seems
that rental reservation

173
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:23,375
of the binoculars and communication
equipmentfor that day is full too.

175
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,544
D.Don't tell me that they're
planning to keep an eye on us?!

177
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,780
It sure sounds interesting.

178
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:32,117
Then, shall we go to Tropical
Marine Land too!

180
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,886
Yeah, let's, let's!

182
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,055
Y.You know what...

183
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,924
I'm just going out with Officer Takag:
because I want to show him my

185
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,361
appreciation for having helped
me before! So, it's not a date!

187
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,997
Really?

188
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,699
That's hard to believe...

189
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,668
I'm telling you it's true
and I'm not lying...

191
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,670
Halk SF
Believe me...

193
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:56,842
You're just going to sit back and watch
this all take place, Inspector Shiratori?

195
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:57,943
That's not it.

196
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:01,980
I'm not going to wave a white flag just
because she refused to marry me

198
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,418
They still call each other very formally

199
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,255
There's still room
for me to try for her...

201
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,894
Besides, as far as this stakeout is
concerned. I'm the one in charge

203
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,530
Oh, Is that right...

204
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,634
Date, 'date, date

205
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,870
Hey. Yum,
help me out here: will you

207
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,205
Give it your best shot!

208
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,711
Oh my, talk of the devil,

209
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,683
You idiot, showing
up at a time like this

211
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,795
Mr. Matsuda

212
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:56,668
Oh, it's Officer Takagi!

213
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,439
You're not hiding
under your disguise at all!

215
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,375
You've figured me out after all.

216
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,712
I had no idea that you guys 9
would be here, though

218
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,782
But, all three police
officers were surprised!

220
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,683
Really?

221
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,086
Y.Yes. sort of...

222
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:20,526
How about you, Ms Sato? Don't you
think I disguised myself quite well?

224
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,181
Ms Sato?

225
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,983
Inspector Megure gave
you instructions saying

227
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,952
that you didn't have to
disguise yourself, didn't he?

229
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:50,889
Oh, yes, but, I
thought I should anyway

231
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,292
Then, why do
you come dressed like that?

233
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,760
I...I'm sorry...

234
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,063
Now that you know,

235
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,465
get rid of that disguise right
away and go back to your post!

237
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,532
Understand!

238
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,067
O.Okay...

239
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:11,276
1.1 wonder if, I
did something I shouldn't have

241
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,746
Nope syou just-kind of resembled him...

242
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,648
The you just a while ago...

243
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,783
Him?

244
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:24,490
The officer who was employed. for only
7 days at Investigation 1st Division

246
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,359
before you came to headquarters...

247
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,501
Hide!

248
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,403
Naoki!

249
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,907
Oh, the car that
Hide is on seems to have come! 4

251
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,210
Let's force. ourselves to the
front and take a video of him!

253
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,745
Oh. but: since I've
been taping from a while ago

255
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,548
'don't think there's
much tape left already...

257
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,850
You mean you didn't
bring any spare tape?

259
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,418
Oh, I brought it!

260
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,321
Then, insert'it and let's get on with it!

261
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:56,989
Okay!

262
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,358
Come on. hurry, hurry!

263
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,926
Please wait

264
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,863
I wonder if everything's
going to be okay...

266
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,566
You received an odd FAX saying

267
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,835
that something was going to happen
at this parade, didn't you?

269
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,407
Yes, but it seems to
have been a prank after all

272
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,278
B*By the way,
what are=yoill doing here, Yumi?

274
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,847
I've come to back up giving
tickets for illegal parking!

276
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:27,686
A lot of people parking their cars all over
the street in order to see the parade,

278
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,989
You better move your car
quickly too, Officer Takag:!

280
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,324
Or, Fl have to give
you a parking ticket!

282
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,192
Oh, I'll move it right away!

283
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,767
WwW. Where are you
everybody!

285
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,974
E.Excuse me, somebody...

286
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,678
H. Hey!

287
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,382
Congratulations!

288
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,320
But, aren't you a fan of Big Osaka?

289
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:03,589
It's a wonder you
came to watch this parade

291
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,524
I came to place a curse

292
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,360
that they won't win next year...

293
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,595
I see...

294
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,265
Hey, where the hell were you?

295
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,468
You've got to film it
quick or the car's going to leave!

297
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,604
W.Well. the thing is...

298
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,406
The key. the key...

299
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:28,779
Oh brother, it's not my day today

300
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,784
What?
Somebody took your video camera?

302
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,254
Yes. just a while ago. in the crowd...

303
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,427
What's this...

304
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,428
Oh, my god...

305
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,230
Oh, my god...

306
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,768
Cancelsthe parade immediately
and evacuate the people

308
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,835
Yes, sit!

309
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,871
W.What the heck was that!

310
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,908
A bomb, it seems like a car blew up.

311
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,980
Isn't, Isn't that
car Officer Takagi's car?

313
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,481
Don't tell me that Officer Takag...

314
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,818
It's possible, because just a while ago

315
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:44,723
I saw somebody go over to that car
from the space between the crowds

317
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,724
Dang it!

318
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,426
H.Hey. Conan!

319
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:52,130
Inspector Shirator!
WwW. Where's Officer Takagi?

321
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:57,034
It exploded just as he
went over to the car.te-move it.

323
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:02,474
If he got caught in the explosion,
I doubt that he would make it

329
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,110
Then<you mean that Officer Takag:...

330
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,478
OS Oy

332
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,213
That's only if the worse happens... 'l

333
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,481
W, What's that supposed to mean?

334
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:19,057
I made it*te.safety by a hairsbreadth,
so please don't talk like I didn't maketit!

336
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:21,059
Officer Takagi!

337
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,561
You're okay!

338
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,696
Yeah, somehow...

339
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:28,900
I coincidentally
found a paper bag that wasn't

341
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,238
under the car when I parked...

342
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,241
Just when I was about to return,

343
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,978
and consult with Inspector Shiratori
that this may be a bomb

345
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,850
the car exploded...

346
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,753
It's amazing that
you though the content

348
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,055
inside the paper
bag may have been a bomb

350
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,456
Oh. that's because...

351
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,958
It's only natural...

352
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:57,395
I mentioned already that the FAX that
was received at headquarters resembled

354
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,099
the one of a case that we were
involved with previously, right

356
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,338
If the officer was informed that this
was the case of the serial bombings

358
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,040
and yet failed to realize that itimayg,
have been a bomb, something is wrong

360
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,244
Talk about failing to notice,
Iook at her

362
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,348
She still doesn't seem
to realize that you're okay

364
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,415
Let's stop her!

365
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,017
O.Officer Sato!

366
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,920
Officer Takag:!
Officer Takagi!

368
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,223
No, Sato!
You won't make it!

370
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,059
It's dangerous, stay back!

371
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,928
But, he's still inside...

372
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,664
He's still inside...

373
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,100
He's inside!

374
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,639
Hey. Miwako!

375
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,909
What do you think you're doing?

376
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,646
I I'm trying to lift
the car up and get him out...

378
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,249
Officer Takagi is fine.
See?

380
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,918
O.Officer Sato!

381
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,323
You burned the palm of your hands!

382
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,293
H. Hey, we've got
to treat it right away!

384
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:02,694
I guess so...

385
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,997
I'll let you take care
of things from here then

387
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:17,008
It seems that the one Officer
Sato was trying to rescue was...

390
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,179
probably Mr. Matsuda...

391
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,882
O Officer Matsuda?

392
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,386
The type of bomb is a plastic bomb!

393
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,690
The detonating device
IS not the timer type, but wireless!

395
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,461
A cell phone or something" was
probably 'used to activate it...

397
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,897
Then, don't tell me that...

398
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,366
The bomber was
probably watching you

400
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,936
you approach the car
from somewhere nearby,

402
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,640
and pushed the switch
of the detonation device

404
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,774
What!

405
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:55,146
Which means that although the type
of bomb being used is not the same,

407
00:16:55,147 --> 00:17:01,219
it is highly probable that the bomber
is after the lives of we the police

409
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,487
just as the case three years ago!

410
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:08,193
So, all of you keep that in mind and
work with great care, arrest the bomber

412
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,428
yet speedily to arrest the bomber...

413
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,229
Xcuse me...

414
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,298
What is it?

415
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:17,769
The bomber could've been
recorded in video camera

417
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,874
Mitsuhiko was taking video all
through right near the site

419
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,108
Really?

420
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:24,910
Yeah...

421
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,279
And besides, somebody among the crowd

422
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,182
of people watching the
parade stole the camera.

424
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:31,650
Yes .

425
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,885
1. The camera was stolen?

426
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,855
Oh. but the tape is fine! >

427
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,724
He inserted a new tape
just before the camera

429
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,193
was stolen because
he was running out of. tape...

431
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,030
The video camera's fine too!

432
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,564
It was thrown away in a.trash can

433
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,267
of a nearby station
with only the tape removed!

435
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,470
Which-means y
the person whoistole:the camera,

437
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:56,074
wanted the tape and not the camera?

438
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,777
The only ones ho wuld do a thing
Iike steal the camera back then,

440
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:02,380
has to be a fervent fan of the Spirits or

441
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:11,456
someone who didn't want to be
taped, like the bomber, right?

443
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,697
We connected it to a large monitor
and looked through it but

445
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:22,834
It was mostly only
of Mitsuhiko's feet

447
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,673
R.Right, I forgot that I kept the camera
going with the camera facing down

449
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,777
I can tell what you
guys are talking about,

451
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,647
But, scene cannot be seen on the tape...

452
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,883
Inspector Megure, gave you
instructions saying that

454
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,087
you didn't have to disguise
yourself, didn't he?

456
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,521
Who is this man?

457
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,424
Oh: IF sorry, that's me.

458
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,662
How come you taped this part okay?

459
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,964
I'm sorry,
I just happened to film it...

461
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,900
Hey. Officer Sato looks to be crying.

462
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,906
Oh. no, well you see thisfis...

463
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,478
Somebody is behind
you near the car

465
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,248
It looks to be a passerby...

466
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,452
Besides. at this distance it's hard-to
tell one person from the next

468
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:18,256
On no! vg
The camera's face down again!

470
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,193
And that's-the. end ofsthe tape

471
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:30,635
It seems that the scene that we were
I expecting of the bomber placing

473
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,605
the paper bag under Officer
Takagi's car was not filmed

475
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,008
Maybe something was
filmed in the-first part of the tape,

477
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,044
that among the crowd!

478
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,479
Why don't we rewind
the tape-and look at it then!

480
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,185
Yes. this is Megure

481
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,223
What?
Another bomb went off!

483
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:58,630
Yes. this time'it was at the
phone booth in front of Haido Park

485
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,299
Fortunately.
Nobody's been.hurt, though.

487
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,170
From the type of bomb that was used,
it's most likely the same bomber

489
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:09,441
Okay, got it, go on and
continue investigations.

491
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:16,548
Hey, what road is there to get from the
first site of explosion to the Haido Park

493
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,585
T.The road order
of the parade of the Spirits!

495
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,355
Which means that the bomber
IS not after we, the police

497
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,893
but carried out an extremely
heinous prank against the Tokyo Spirits

499
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,728
O Officer Sato

500
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:35,333
Are you all right?
How's your hands? I hear got burns

502
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,868
No problem.
I can go!

504
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,573
Okay. we've figured
out what the bomber as after!

506
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,810
Mereover, he may have set
bombs up elsewhere too!

508
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:50,615
Get all the officers nearby;and go to
the front of the course of the parade,

510
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,851
and evacuate the
people in the vicinity!

512
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:54,319
Do what you can to
take the suspect into custody,

514
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,156
then search for the
bombs with all your might

516
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:58,990
On the double!

517
00:20:58,991 --> 00:20:59,757
Yes, sir!

518
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,128
Just in case-Officer Shirator,

519
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,865
will you contact™the bomb disposal
crew and have-them stand by!

521
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,632
Yes, sir!

522
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:13,438
Officdr Takagi. I want you to stay
back here and keep checking: the video

524
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,508
If you find anything
contact me immediately!

526
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,010
Oh, I'll go to the site too...

528
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,546
You wait back here.

529
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,348
@ Officer Sato...

530
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,452
And. I d like to
have a word with you later

532
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:38,897
Strange, what is the
culprit after anyway

534
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,500
Pretending to be
the bomber of 3 years ago,

536
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,336
sending FAX to headquarters.

537
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:48,139
And blowing up the car of the
officer that is dispatched

539
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,842
But, soon afterwards

540
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,979
the culprit blows up a phone booth
that has nothing to do with the police

542
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,983
I wonder if it's really only a prank
of bad taste towards the Spirits...

544
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:03,621
And, besides, this...

546
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,790
tape that Mitsuhiko took...

547
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,564
Is something that will point out
the bomber really recorded on it?

550
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:18,670
If so, what the heck. is recorded?

Did you really watch it?

598
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,028
I watched it three time already...

599
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,199
If you think that the crowd is suspicious,
everybody in the crowd looks suspicious

601
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,303
and if you think nothing is suspicious,
nothing looks suspicious

603
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,674
Maybe the culprit thought
he was being filmed?

605
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,842
Although nothing was filmed...

606
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,113
Not filmed? I see!
