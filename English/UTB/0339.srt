1
00:00:01,618 --> 00:00:03,302
Friendship. Romance. Mystery

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,070
Because we cherish them we can continue

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:07,339
Ail gets messed up in the Porsche case

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,041
JodienShinichi and Bellmot appear

5
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,142
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:10,743
He sees through the one and only truth,

7
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,578
A child in appearance
with the l1.Q of an adult

9
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,080
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:02:00,986
Four Porsches Part 2

12
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,194
The victim is Mr. Yukiya Banba age 41...

13
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,230
The cause is death by suffocation...

14
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:14,666
From the traces left on his neck.

15
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:17,736
It seems he was choked
)y a string-like object...

17
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:23,041
Moreover, it seems he was choked
with quite some strength...

19
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:25,677
And?

20
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,679
Who is the one that found the corpse?

21
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,214
He's the one.

22
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,950
He seems to have gone
golfing with the victim...

24
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,486
and stopped byashere on their way back .

25
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,122
Huh?

26
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,091
Who are the two people
standing behind you?

28
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:39,591
Oh, yes...

29
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,659
Oh, yes...

30
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,195
They are also golf friends...

31
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,963
As well as Porsche friends...

32
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:47,533
C-Conan?!

33
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,768
You're also Porsche friends, right?

34
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,769
What's the matter?

35
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,673
I came to this department store
with Dr. Agasa and got off the car.

37
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,842
Then I saw them park their cars too.

38
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,577
And I talked to them a bit.

39
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,746
Where's Dr. Agasa then?

40
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,183
I think he's still shopping upstairs...

41
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,251
And. Conan...

42
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,922
Will you give me more of
the details back then?

44
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,557
It was about 1:00 in the afternoon...

45
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,292
4 people came...

46
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,327
on this white Porsche and

47
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,962
only 3 got off.

48
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,114
They were saying that they
were going to shop here

50
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,783
until that man's booze wears off.

51
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,435
It seems as if they were going to leave

52
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,972
after a while on their own cars.

53
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,742
Which means that
these 4 Porsches are yours?

55
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,910
Y-Yes...

56
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,345
Inspector Megure!!

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,913
Hey...

58
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,049
Ded you find anything?

59
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,083
Yes Sir.

60
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,252
I see

61
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,354
COON NY
I OTC...

63
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,156
Thank you...

64
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,910
It seems that the suspects have been

65
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:50,495
narrowed down to you three.

66
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,330
Huh 2!

67
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,332
As a result of the autopsy...

68
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,235
the estimated time of
death is around 1:00p.m

70
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,504
Just about the time you all got here...

71
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,739
In other words...

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,374
It is extremely likely that one of you

73
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:07,045
strangled Mr. Banba
when getting off the car...

75
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,349
Well, it may be a different story
If you left the car unlocked

77
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,050
when you got off...

78
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,254
U-Uh, I locked the door for sure...!

79
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,024
He was still alive when we got off...

80
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,192
Mr. Hote,

81
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,225
Ms. Taeyama,

82
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,828
is it true?

83
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,062
Y-Yeah...

84
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,765
He was wasted and talking in his sleep...

85
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,935
Saying something like "Another OB."...

86
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,039
Besides we all got off
at about the same time,

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,908
SO Nobody had time to strangle anybody.

89
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,879
Il... please tell us more in deta

90
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,748
Please give me your names and

91
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,634
your relationship with Mr. Banba
who had been killed,

93
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:47,586
the order in which you got off the car

94
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,056
and which car you own...

95
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,225
I'm the first one who got off.

96
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,161
My name is Yoshihito Kureki...

97
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,165
I got to know Mr. Banba at
the Porsche new car exhibition...

99
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,602
My car is this Porsche 911 here...

100
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,837
When we go golfing.
I park my-carahere and

102
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,840
all four of us get on this car and
head off together in one car,

104
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,276
just like that boyamentioned

105
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,445
We got off in order to wait for
Mr. Banba's booze to wear off

107
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,982
and decided to kill time
at the department store.

109
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,819
But I realized that I had left
my cell phone in the car

111
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,087
so I came back to get it.

112
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,955
Only to see how I found him...

113
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,891
Which mean

114
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,792
you're the only one

115
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,662
who could've killed him without
being seen by anyone...

117
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,396
Oh. well...

118
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:35,233
WI came back to the car
about an hour later though...

120
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:36,902
Huh

121
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,403
What is this?!

122
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,273
This box in the dashboard compartment?

123
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,741
A-A music box...

124
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,744
The pin broke, so I was thinking
of sending out for repair.

126
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,146
But. I had completely forgotten it was here.

127
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,917
It seems to be working okay...

128
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,052
I guess you can't strangle somebody
using something like this though...

130
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,189
I'm the one who got off after him.

131
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,191
My name is Eiji Hotei...

132
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,128
I used to car race with him
on mountain roads...

134
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,797
When we were young. that is...

135
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,900
I'm into antique-like cars recently...

136
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:14,740
and bought a Porsche 356A that
was made 50 years ago...

138
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,975
Excuse me.

139
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,814
Oh? There's something in the back seat...

140
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:23,882
There...

141
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,219
O-Oh, those're my fishing goods...

142
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm kind of into fishing lately.

143
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,621
Huh

144
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,324
You've even got an electric reel!

145
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,295
If this is used,
you could choke his neck automatically...

147
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,498
Cut out that talk!

148
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,700
The reel was in the bag. wasn't it!

149
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,403
I came back here after
I received call from Mr. Kureko

151
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,672
and haven't even touched the car yet!

152
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,942
I'm Kaoru Taeyama.

153
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,879
It's true that I was the last one
who got off but...

155
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,415
Do you think that a woman like me

156
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,949
would be strong enough
to strangle a mant to death?

158
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,151
Besides.

159
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,320
After golf my gripping strength
IS weakened as is...

161
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,221
And?

162
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,091
What is your relationship with Mr. Banba?

163
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,459
Nothing special...

164
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,363
I just got into talking with him
about Porsches on the golf course

166
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,199
and started making rounds with him...

167
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,469
This Boxter that I got right
after it came out on the market

169
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,304
caught Mr. Banba's eyes...

170
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,139
Huh

171
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,176
You have something in

172
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,343
the passenger's seat too...

173
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,211
Oh that...

174
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,780
It's a gift for the son of my cousin...

175
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,399
It's a radio controlled Porsche...

176
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,068
I could never

177
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,654
strangle someone's neck with it, could I?

178
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,957
And besides after getting
off the car to go shopping.

180
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,059
I came back here after I got a call
from MrÂ§Kureko saying that something

182
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,862
awful had happened to Mr. Banba...

183
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,931
But. I haven't touched a thing!

184
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,301
Hey!

185
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,002
Why don't you look at that?

186
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,003
Huh

187
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:53,371
A surveillance camera?!

188
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,473
I see!

189
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,108
I'm pretty sure we can
find out if someone is lying!

191
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:57,976
Okay.

192
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:58,977
To the security room!!

193
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,544
Yes, sir!

194
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,847
Will all of you please come with me too...

195
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:02,747
What?

196
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,449
I guess we don't have a choice...

197
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,297
I told you to stay still!

198
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,866
But...

199
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,468
Al doesn't look too good...

200
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,171
I figured we should take her to the doctor.
We can't leave her like this...

202
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,009
I guess we have no choice.

203
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,210
Just to be safe,

204
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,580
maybe we should ask Officer Takagi
to secretly let us out with his police car...

206
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,351
Because they may be
ambushing us outside...

209
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,805
Who are they?

210
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,391
Conan!!

211
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,693
You were mixed up in this case after all!

212
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,562
Uh. well...

213
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,998
how did you get in h

214
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:57,769
Only those from the police and those who
are involved in the case are let in, right?

216
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,940
We told them that wcame
to pick you:up then they let us in.

218
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:02,974
Right. Ran?

219
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:03,642
Right...

220
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,781
Ai is here too?

221
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:13,851
C-Come to think of it,
you're some detective, aren't you?

223
00:09:14,953 --> 00:09:18,757
We're going to the security room
to look over the surveillance camera,

225
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,125
so won't you come along?

226
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,128
Come on, let's go...

227
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,731
Okay. Sonoko!

228
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,736
Hey!! Jody. you too...

229
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,404
Let's go!

230
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,739
Hey. Conan!

231
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,544
Reddish...

232
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,183
brown hair...!

233
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,286
Huh

234
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,822
What're you both doing?

235
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,290
Ms. Yasuyama and

236
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:53,525
Mr. Hotel?

237
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,262
After you got off the car.

238
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,130
Both of you have gone back to your cars...

239
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,433
I just went back to get my wallet.

240
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,805
Mr. Kureko always paid the golfing
charges ahead of time so...

242
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,743
so after this all three of you went-into
the department store together to shop

244
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:15,513
and until Mr. Kureko went back to get
his cell phone an hour later

246
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,416
nobody went near the car...?

247
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,251
So. didn't I tell you that

248
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,587
it was impossible for us
to commit the murder...?

250
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,490
It's unreasonable to think that

251
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,259
they would call the police knowing
that they'd be .T8pected...

253
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,428
Besides, all three of them

254
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,431
got off the car at about the same time...

255
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:36,201
There wasn't anything strange
about their moves...

257
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,303
I can't make it out...

258
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,473
How did the murderer strangle Mr. Banba
and what Bf the murder weapon.

260
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,576
How did the killer come to get it?

261
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,810
Darn!!

262
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,479
I've got to solve the case

263
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,317
and get Ai out of here

264
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,789
as fast as I can, and yet...

265
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,362
Inspector Megure!!

266
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,100
The pictures of the interior of the cars
of all three suspects are ready!

268
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,736
Thank you, please leave them there...

269
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,071
Yes, sir!

270
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,546
T-This is it!!

271
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,260
Sonoko, did you figure it out?

272
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,395
Maybe all three of them strangled him

273
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,531
before getting off the car...

274
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,132
Hey...

275
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:46,171
Why don't we go back to where the car is?

276
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,206
We could figure something out!!

277
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,507
In-Inspector!

278
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,176
I-I guess so...

279
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,976
Like they say, check the scene of
the crime out 100 times...

281
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,746
Let's go back...

282
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,348
74 JA
(W!)

284
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:01,686
She's the girl who was wearing the red
hood in the bus that was hi-jacked...

286
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,557
The girl who was lying down in the car...

287
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,692
Don't tell me that...

288
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,662
It can't be...

289
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,037
Shinichi said don't move,

290
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,673
ut if I leave Ai as she is...

291
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,041
I've got no choice...

292
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,877
I'll call Dr. Niide once more
although he may not be in...

294
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,117
Yes, this is Dr. Araid...

295
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,351
Oh, Dr. Araider!

296
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:36,521
I take it that you're Dr. Agasa.
From your voice?

298
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,323
I'm in luck!!

299
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,593
It seems that you weren't in
when Conan called so...

301
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,295
Conan did? That's strange...

303
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,432
I was home all day today...

304
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,885
What seems to be the matter?

306
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,105
ROTC .

307
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:57,392
So. you can't move from there
because there's been a murder?

309
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,077
Well, yes... sort of...

310
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,113
Why don't we do this them?

311
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,917
I'm here at the scene of the crime but...

312
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,986
Have noticed anything?

313
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,954
No, not really...

314
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,792
Why don't you have
Sonoko check everyone's car?

316
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,726
Who. me?!

317
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,730
You're a great detective,

318
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,865
SO you may come up with something!

319
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,469
First from Ms. Yasuyama's car
that's at the very edge...

321
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:26,070
Will you lend me your key?

322
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,906
S-Sure...

323
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,909
Here. Sonoko!

324
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,077
Okay...

325
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,782
I can tell that it's an expensive car, but...

326
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,118
there seems to be nothing strange about it.

327
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,391
Don't tell me...

328
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,260
Don't tell me Sonoko...

329
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,162
You mean it's come?!

330
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,549
I've figured it all o

331
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:59,721
The way Mr. Banba was strangled to death
while sitting in the passenger's seat

333
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,473
and who did it too!!

334
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,842
R-Really?!

335
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,611
If at all possible,

336
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,481
I wish she'd explain why she's explaining

337
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,951
while pretending to be asleep
Iike Mr. Mouri does...

339
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,853
But. have you really figured out:the case.

340
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,222
When all you did was
get into the car and sit:down...?

342
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,024
I touched it when I sat down...

343
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,593
couched it...7?

344
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,563
You see that little groove on the top
side of the window glass?

346
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,933
When my finger touched it,
it dawned on me...

348
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:33,271
That Ms. Taeyama
the owner of this Porsche Boxter...

350
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,841
You. are the killer!!

351
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,943
Hey. hey, are you serious...

352
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,511
s. Tae ama...

353
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,313
Officer Takagi...

354
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,885
Please sit in the passenger's seat of the
Porsche 911 where Mr. Banba's corpse is,

356
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,487
and play the role of the victim...

357
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,422
O-Okay...

358
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,927
Conan will you take care of
you know what, like I told you to...

360
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,430
h... you mean this fishing lir
that you told me to go buy...?

362
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,001
But, can you... really do
something like that with this?

364
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,937
Never mind. just do as I told you to, okay...

365
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:09,173
n... everything wil become clea

366
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,608
OKay!!

367
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,416
First. hook the fish line
around Officer Takagi's neck,

369
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,485
who is sitting down...

370
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,155
Then pull the string through
behind the head rest...

372
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,425
Get off still holding the string
and close the door.

374
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,262
Hold both ends of the string...

375
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,832
and pull it through the Porsche 928
that is in between.

377
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,201
Go back to Ms. Taeyama's car...

378
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,972
and hook it on to the groove on
the window of the driver's seat side,

380
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:44,242
that was made beforehand,
and then go back into the car, right?

382
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,680
But... he marks left on Mr. Banba's neck

383
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,050
showed signs of him being
strangled with great strength...

385
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,351
You probably want to say...

386
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:57,322
that the string was pulled secretly
from inside the car but...

388
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,158
I don't think it's possible with
the strength of a woman...

390
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,092
Right...

391
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,529
That's why Ms. Yasuyama used the...

392
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,366
the strength of the power window...

393
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,269
Ms. Yasuyama probably

394
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,237
wrapped the stringaround
the neck of Mr. Banba who was asleep,

396
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,206
Iike Conan just did.

397
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,524
Then she got off the car.

398
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,359
Pretended to go get her wallet

399
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,211
and got into this car...

400
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,146
She then opened the door

401
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,415
And tied the string pulling it tight,

402
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,085
then tied it onto
the transmission lever or something...

404
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,722
All she had left to do, was push the switch
of the power window and close the window.

406
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,958
The string would be pulled by
the strength of the power window and...

408
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,303
This way, she can choke his neck
even if she's at a distance from him!

410
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,305
Hey. Sonoko?!

411
00:16:49,024 --> 00:16:49,741
And, besides.

412
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,943
Since this parking lot is dark to begin with

413
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,878
it's hard to see the string.

414
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,714
If the key is stopped at the first level,

415
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,884
she can move the power window
without having to turn on the engine,

417
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,286
so there would be no loud sound.

418
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,654
Okay. I have a question.

419
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,307
How did she retrieve the string?

420
00:17:06,308 --> 00:17:07,825
That's easy...

421
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,728
if she uses this radio controlled car...

422
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,233
She leaves the string that is tied
beforehand to the axle of the rear tire of

424
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,201
the radio controlled car outside the box

425
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,070
cuts the string that had
finished strangling his neck,

427
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,641
then ties one end of the string to
the string that is outside the box,

429
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,444
and left the radio controlled car
running inside the box,

431
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,813
and left the car.

432
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:33,084
It's true that if left that way the string
would automatically rewind, but...

434
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,570
If she left the car running,

435
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,655
I would have heard the sound
of the motor running

437
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,258
when I checked this car.

438
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,726
Oh, don't you know?

439
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,396
The battery of a radio controlled car
keeps only for about 10 minutes...

441
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,433
By the time you got here
it would've been stopped...

443
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,435
Why don't you try checking out
the radio controlled car?

445
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,072
I'm sure you'll find the string
wrapped around the axle.

447
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,674
If it's just to roll up the string it would be

448
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,610
possible to do so using
r. Hotel's electric reel 100...

450
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,512
but, I knocked him off
the suspect's list because...

452
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,449
of the power window...

453
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,753
Out of the three of us...

454
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:13,558
my Boxter's the only one with
the power window, right?

456
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,493
I thought I did a pretty good job...

457
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,864
But, I didn't think that such a cute detective
ould see through my trick...

459
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,933
So. you're the one who
killed him after all...

461
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,534
but, why?

462
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,036
Why ?

463
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,640
I'm sure that he's thinking
so in the world beyond too.

465
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,210
He's probably wondering,
Why the hell was I killed...

467
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,679
I'm sure you've heard from him
before that he competed

469
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,682
with a yellow Ferrari at
a mountain path before...?

471
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,952
Come to think of it, yeah,
some time in the past...

473
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,154
But. he said the driver of
the Ferrari picked on him...

475
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:44,454
That's a lie...

476
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,091
He's the one who picked a fight...

477
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,228
I guess all he wanted to
do was tease a couple...

479
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,197
But the one driving was
my younger brother...

481
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,099
After a heated battle,

482
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,336
our car went over the cliff...

483
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,338
I was saved.3 hours-later

484
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,107
by a person who, happened to pass by...

485
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,776
But, my younger brother didn't make it...

486
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,680
I couldn't remember
the number plate of the man...

488
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,249
But. I remembered his face and

489
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,002
that his car was a red Porsche 928.

490
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,490
I remembered that
he had a golf bag in his car...

492
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,193
$0. I bought a Porsche and

493
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,929
searched around the golf courses,
finally found him and

495
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,798
was waiting for a chance to take revenge.

496
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,236
Why didn't you report
the incident to the police?

498
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,572
I had no mind of telling the police about it...

499
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,575
Because my younger brother was also at
fault to for being provoked into competing.

501
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,945
And my purpose for meeting him
was not revenge to start with...

503
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,680
Huh

504
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:47,518
If that man had called the ambulance
right away for us back then,

506
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,687
my brother would've been saved...

507
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,055
I wanted to know

508
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,491
why he didn't call the ambulance...

509
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,327
If he said that he was
afraid of getting caught or

511
00:19:56,628 --> 00:20:00,198
if he said that he still regrets that day,
I was going to forgive him...

513
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:03,733
But. he continued to play golf after that too,
just as if nothing had happened.

515
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,103
That's when I decided to take revenge...

516
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,110
Make sure that all you guys
make speed rounds only

518
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:16,079
with your golfing and
never with your cars...

520
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,820
Okay, the case has been solved.

521
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:27,692
I've got to get a hold of Doc right away
and get Ai out of here fast...

523
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,394
Quick, quick, hurry!!

524
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,697
Huh? Ran... where's Jodie?

525
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,165
She went home

526
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,233
saying she had something
urgent to attend to...

528
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,069
What the...!

529
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:39,971
Agh, Conan!

530
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,458
T-They're not around?!

531
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,810
Doc and Ai are both gone....!!

532
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,963
Don't tell me...

533
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:49,764
hno...?

534
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,147
H no...

1, ve )een wan mg or your ca .

583
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,172
What do you mean you've been waiting!!!

584
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,708
I told you not to move and yet
why'd you go back home?!

586
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,543
You don't have to shout...

587
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,212
This is Dr. Araide's suggestion.

588
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,680
Dr. Araide?

589
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,082
Is he there?

590
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:34,752
Yeah, Ail is being examined now...

592
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,054
You said that he wasn't in.

593
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,006
But:-when I called him he was at home...

594
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:42,560
I told him that we can't seem to move from
where we are since there was a crime,

596
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,629
he said. The police know
who you are, and moreover,

598
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,265
with a sick child, if you
ask them to let you out

600
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,568
I'm sure they'll let you out.

601
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:53,070
They gave us a lift in the police car
and helped us get out.

603
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,272
But just when we got out
of the department store,

605
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,108
she happened to pass by...

606
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,911
ey... Don't tell me that she's...

607
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,012
Hi! I cut a lot of fruit.

609
00:23:03,013 --> 00:23:05,049
Hi! I cut a lot of fruit.

610
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,252
Vitaimin C is best for colds!!

611
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,489
Shh! She just fell asleep.

612
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,257
Ah . Sorry .

613
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,159
Jody...

614
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,396
She's the one who brought us here.

615
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,166
Thank God. she had parked her car
in a different parking lot

617
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,736
It seems that Ail has just
come down with a cold,

619
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,538
so there's nothing to worry about...

620
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:28,906
Seven...

621
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,427
Eight...Nine...Ten...

622
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,781
Ready or not...

623
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,685
Are you ready?

624
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,456
Here I come...

625
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,024
I'm going to go look for you.

626
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,230
I see you...

627
00:23:54,532 --> 00:23:57,101
I've found you...

628
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:22,493
