1
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,653
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,154
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,190
Be attentive today and listen well,

5
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,092
because it is a unique mystery that
can be experienced only with Conan...

7
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,760
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,328
A child in appearance with
the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,497
no case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan

12
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:58,017
AN OVERLY SUPERB DEDUCTION"

13
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,954
Beika Station

14
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:07,259
Hey Ran,
walk a little slower, will you

16
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,129
I tell you!!
Since it is a hassle having to pick you up,

18
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,232
if you have to drink, don't go and drink
on the other side of the station!

20
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,299
Ell, well...

21
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,802
Huh?
Talk about hopeless...

23
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:23,109
From 20-00 to 22:00 all you can eat.
All you can drink, it says!

25
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,644
You're always going for ads like that!!

26
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,613
What do you mean!

27
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:31,650
I got to eat three times the amount
I paid and drank five times the price too,

29
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,486
gah, ha, ha, ha ha!!

30
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:42,293
Hey, stop throwing things! Go on home!!
Takayuki Irie
tr oB

33
00:02:42,294 --> 00:02:42,595
Hey, stop throwing things! Go on home!!

34
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,698
Go on home? What do you mean
go on home, you bastard!!

36
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,900
Whaaa
J, Just what do you think you're doing?!

38
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,335
L.Let me go, Nakamoto!!

39
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,102
Shut up!!

40
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,804
What shall we do, dad...?

41
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,540
We can't ignore them, can we?

42
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,808
I'll go stop them!

43
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,244
Oops!
Ah, dad...

45
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,648
Ha, ha, ha...they"ll be fine.

46
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,318
Hey always fight like that...
But, the next minute

48
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,522
they'll be smiling at
each other and make up.

50
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,756
Right?

51
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,324
That's a good boy.

52
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,062
Uh, shucks, I worried for nothing.

53
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,830
Let's go home!

54
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,432
Hey, dad!

55
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:23,202
Wait for me!
You've got to watch your step.

57
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,205
Come on, get a hold of yourself!!

58
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,874
Something bothered me,

59
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,410
so I went to check the apartment out
the following morning...

61
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,085
We'll get the details
after the autopsy but...

63
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:44,256
the estimated time of death-is between
22:00 to 23:00. last night...

65
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,959
H,Hey, you're joking, right?!

66
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,197
Not you-again!

67
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,465
Well, you:see...

68
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,266
Then, how else would you explain this?!

69
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:58,804
Inspector Megure!
It's just as Mr. Mouri says!

71
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,640
The residents of the apartment
also heard them!

73
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,143
It seems that at the time in question,
a man called Nakamoto was having

75
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,712
a heated argument with the victim,
Mr. Irie.

77
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,214
Hmm...

78
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,816
and who is the guy called Nakamoto?

79
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,718
I'll go check!

80
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,356
To think that a detective as renown
as Kogoro Mouri was not able to

82
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:21,160
stop a murder that happened right
efore his eyes...

84
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,828
I'm truly ashamed...

85
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:27,433
Damnit! Only if that old man who was
taking a walk didn't say what he did

87
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,136
I would've gone in to stop them!

92
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:34,273
& WW &

94
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,278
P,Please help me!
Mr. Mourn!

U Uh...l used to be a member of

00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,387

My name is Nakamoto.
Hiroshi Nakamoto
U3 UL

106
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,321
research lab together with the victim Irie.
My name is Nakamoto.

108
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,123
What?!
Nakamoto.

110
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,124
What?!

111
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,461
Y, You're the one who killed him last night?!

112
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,396
N No!

113
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,667
I was summoned by the policejfor
testimony, but didn't do anything!!

115
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,405
I didn't go to Irie's room last night.
Please believe me!!

117
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:06,972
Huh...?

118
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:07,306
Huh...?

119
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,410
Listen!!

120
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:16,549
We definitely heard you arguing with
the man who was killed.

122
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,152
So, what do you mean
by you didn't go there?

124
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,787
A tape!

125
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,491
Somebody recorded it on tape to make
it look like I went there!!

127
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,725
What?!

128
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,961
Made it look like you were there?

129
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:30,462
CC Pee eo

130
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,634
Irie set the time...
and probably pressed the play button...

132
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,876
Hey, don't throw things! Go on home!

133
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,213
Go on home?! What are you
talking about, you bastard!!

135
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:50,516
You mean he acted it all out alone?

136
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,153
Yes...he was creating my alibi.

137
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,521
Alibi?!

138
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,657
For what purpose?!

139
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:04,330
He snuck into the house of our mentor,
Professor Demura...

141
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,366
In order to murder him!

142
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,901
What?!

143
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:15,474
The professor is secretly selling the fruit
of our research off to businesses!!

145
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,911
Even if we were to file charges against
him, he has tremendous authority,

147
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:23,515
and we'd be ousted!
That's why! . . That's why...

149
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,619
We decided to break into his house
when his family was away

151
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,987
and make it look like a case of robbery
Nd homicide...

153
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,962
B,But, it didn't work out as planned!

154
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,232
We snuck in but,
the professor wasn't home!

156
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,168
I waited one hour but he didn't come home

157
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,170
So, I eventually gave up

158
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,907
I went to the professor's house at 22:00

159
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,043
and left at 23:00.

160
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,246
If what you're telling us Is true,

161
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,915
you could not have
Killed Mr. Takayuki Irie.

163
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,587
But! The professor seems to have testified
that he was doing some writing

165
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,189
in his study all last night, and
never left his home!!

167
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,994
That sure is strange...

168
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,133
Yes... don't know why
the professor is lying!!

170
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:17,202
But, if things go as is
I'll end up being a murderer!

172
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:22,207
I wonder why the police let you,
who happens to be a prime suspect go...

174
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:26,211
I heard at the station that you,
the renown Detective Kogoro Mouri,

176
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,480
was also nearby the scene of the
crime last night

178
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,482
This is probably no coincidence,

179
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,618
please I beg you, help me!!

180
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,890
It's true that I am not
totally uninvolved in this case, but...

182
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:43,062
So, you don't believe me either,
do you, Mr. Mouri...

184
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,531
If only I can find that recorded tape!

185
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:49,134
Are you sue there really is something
Iike that to begin with?...

187
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:54,306
Well...ll was told that there was no such
tape anywhere in Irie's house!

189
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,975
I'm sure the killer took it with him.

190
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:02,081
If that cannot be found,
the killer can frame me!

192
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,951
What shall I do... .I'm sure that the killer
has gotten rid of the tape by now, too...

194
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,423
Dad, why don't you at least
try searching for the tape

196
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:17,229
If you solve this case, you'll regain
your reputation again, won't you, Pops.

198
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,936
Regain my reputation! Okay, why not!!

199
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,575
There is only one way
in and out of the apartment. .\\

201
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,677
The exit after the crime was committed is

202
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,948
this street which leads to thegstation

203
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,985
The killer is sure to have
wanted to get rid of the tape

205
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,187
which would serve as evidence
as soon as possible

207
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,396
Wait! Wait up! That trash!

209
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,366
W,What is it?!

210
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,137
It can't be...this is too close.

211
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,639
I found it!!

212
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,775
1, That's the tape!

213
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,013
Talk about duck soup!

214
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,815
Thank you for your cooperation.

215
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:11,917
Officer Takagt!

216
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,319
I'll take the evidence.

217
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,222
So, they were keeping watch
over the prime suspect...

219
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,960
Wait! You re not on 10 take that
tape with you, just like that, are you?

221
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,233
Go home? What do you mean,
go home, you fool!

223
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,904
This is the same remark we heard last night!

224
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,238
Right, Conan!

225
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:33,939
Yep.

226
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,442
- ) - a.
I...

228
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,278
Now, It's been proved.

229
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,114
Mr. Nakamoto is not lying!

230
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:46,985
I'm glad! I've finally found
someone who believes me!

232
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,088
But...l wonder why the professor lied

233
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,390
You can say that again

234
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:57,863
I wouldn't have been suspected at all if
the professor didn't lie in the first place!

236
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,332
That's just it!! He wanted
to set you up as the suspect!

238
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:06,404
But, what advantage would the professor
have doing something like that?

240
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:15,347
Oh? It could be that the professor was
somewhere he didn't want anyone to know

242
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:21,320
Could it be that he was
on his way to kill Mr. Irie...?

244
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,058
That's a possibility...but

245
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,628
That's not possible!

246
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,398
It'd be a different story if he knew
about our plan!

248
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,803
We planned everything out in lrie's room.

249
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,639
The professor couldn't have
even eavesdropped on us!

251
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,076
Avesdrop...
Oh, maybe?!

253
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,182
This?! The screws of the lid are loose

254
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,651
It's probably in here

255
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,654
Oh, is that right, I see... Thank you.

256
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,193
There seems to have been evidence
of a wire tap being set, after all?

258
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,363
So, now we know!

259
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:08,200
Although Professor Idemura had been
making money stealing the research

261
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,801
by Irie and Nakamoto

262
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:14,206
He became wary that maybe
one day you would take revenge

264
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,211
Therefore, he set up a wire tap to keep track
of what you were both doing.

266
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,047
I wonder how he snuck in?

267
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,918
If he stole the key from
Mrairie's locker in the lab,

269
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,921
he could've easily made a spare key, right?

270
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,255
Exactly.

271
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,459
And, while he was tracking your
conversation through the wire tap

273
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,664
He found out of your plan to kill him

274
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:42,401
That's when he thought about using the alibi

275
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,404
that you had both made up,
his advantage...

277
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,172
Last night,

278
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:52,644
Mr. Irie went on with his one man act

279
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:57,916
of creating the alibi tape
as usual at a little past 22:00

281
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:02,521
Then the professor sneaks in using the
spare key and Kills Mr. Irie.

283
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:07,259
He then steals the tape, retrieves the
wire tap and leaves the site.

285
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,397
If Mr Irie's body is found, the police would
naturally take it to be a crime committed

287
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,401
committed by Mr Nakamoto, from the
testimonies of the people in the area.

289
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:21,073
In other words, Professor ldemura,
after killing Mr. Irie, set it up so that it

291
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,810
would look like Mr. Nakamoto
committed the murder!!

293
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,680
Our plan was used to his advantage

294
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,550
Very skillfully indeed. BUT,
he was unable to fool

296
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:36,755
the eyes of the top-notch,
renownwDetectiveKogoro Mouri's eyes!!

298
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:43,495
Hey, hey, what's up Pops?
Your deduction is perfect.

300
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,632
I guess I'm not called for this time

301
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,834
What are you bragging about?!

302
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:51,103
If you went into Mr.
Irie's room last night,

304
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,972
you could've stopped the murder
from happening, you know!

306
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,576
Ah, come on don't say that

307
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,912
Oh, I heard from Inspector Megure that a man

308
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,516
who was walking his dog
stopped you from going inside

310
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:09,454
Right, only if that old man
didn't say what he did

312
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:14,993
True, but that old man didnet
have any bad intentions either

314
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,129
Don't tell me that 7?

315
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,599
But, if thought of it that way,
t is convincing...!

317
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,202
Even Pop's superb power of deduction

318
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,979
Okay! So, I guess I ll go tell Inspector Megure
of my superb deduction,

320
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,380
of my superb deduction, in order
to regain my reputation!

322
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:38,450
Not That!

323
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,219
What?! What's not that?!

324
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,856
W. Well, it's a superb deduction after all,

325
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,459
why go all the way out there
and tell him about it?

327
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,195
Why not have him come here from his side.
It's cooler that way

329
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,798
I guess so. Okay!

330
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm going to go out play until then!

331
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,874
So, the alibi scheme was used against
the very ones who made it up

333
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,677
I see just as expected of you, Mr Mourn!!

334
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,715
Well, I'm just being my usual self,
gah, ha, ha, ha

336
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,683
I'm sorry for having suspected you,
Mr. Nakamoto.

338
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,820
Oh, don't be,
so long as you find out the truth

340
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,491
Besides, I'm still to be charged for
sneaking into the professor's house

342
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,160
Well, we'll take care of that later

343
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:27,065
Officer Takagi, get an arrest warrant for
Professor Idemura on the double!

345
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:27,799
Yes, sir!!

346
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,409
Please wait a second Inspector!

347
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:42,214
However, the deduction that I have
presented you is;just one possibility.

349
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,350
The one that the real killer
wished the case to look like.

351
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,286
What the real killer wished...7?

352
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,422
Just what do you mean, Mr. Mourn?

353
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,558
Please sit down once again.

354
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,428
What I am about
to say from now is the real truth.

356
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,667
The testimonies of Mr. Nakamoto and
Professor Idemura are really different

358
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,938
That is, one of them is lying!

359
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,409
At a timelike that, if the tape ah,
that Mr. Nakamoto mentioned is found,

361
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,613
his testimony would naturally
ound to be the truth. .!

363
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:19,618
On the otherhand, suspicion against
Professor Idemura would grow!

365
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,221
At that needs to besdone next, is to lead
the deduction in the preferred direction.

367
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,726
And, make, everybody
fall under the illusion

369
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,795
that Professor Idemura had
indeed killed Mr Irie.

371
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,496
An illusion?!

372
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,733
Lead the deduction...Are you saying
that somebody lead everyone

374
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,735
to think that it happened that way?!

375
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,404
It is indeed possible

376
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,473
As for the recorded tape

377
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,277
The killer probably got rid of it too

378
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,947
Because Mr. Nakamoto had mumbled so,

379
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,851
I was lead to check inside
the trash can near the site...

381
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,021
The reason I turned my attention to
Professor Idemura was because...

383
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,858
I wouldn't have been suspected at all if

384
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,460
the professor didn't lie in the first place!

385
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:06,631
Mr. Nakamoto said what he did! And

386
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,803
Oh? It could be that
the professor was somewhere

388
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,306
he didn't want anyone to know he was...

389
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:20,345
From his remark, I was lead to think
that maybe Professor Idemura had set

391
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,348
off to kill Mr. Irie. Furthermore...

392
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,219
The professor couldn't have
even eavesdropped on us!

394
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,590
I was lead to imagine a wire tap from
his remark "eavesdropping"!

396
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,963
In other words, by deliberately casually
remarking the things that he did

398
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:42,033
about the essentials,
Mr. Nakamoto lead me to deduce

400
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:46,338
that Professor
Idemura had committed the crime!

402
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:51,776
That is, I did not make a deduction,
but rather was lead to make a deduction!

404
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,880
By who else, but Mr. Nakamoto himself

405
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,716
I see...

406
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,385
Needless to mention,

407
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,022
you never snuck
into Professor Idemura's house

409
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:09,027
The one who snuck in when Mr Irie
was putting on his one-man act,

411
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,862
and killed him,

412
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,364
Is you!

413
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:18,737
Professor Idemura was probably
in his study just as he said he was.

415
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,441
Of course. there was
no wire tap to begin with either.

417
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:28,546
You were the one who loosened
the screws of the outlet.

419
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,883
Is that not right, Mr. Nakamoto?

420
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,623
First of all, the story about the
recorded tape is strange to begin with.

422
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,559
If it were disposed of
Iast night 'right after the crime,

424
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
it would never have
been found.

426
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,600
Because the trash of that
convenience store is collected daily

428
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,103
before dawn by the trash collectors.

429
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,308
However, the tape that
wasn't supposed to be there, was there

431
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:00,111
Which means the tape was not disposed
of last night, but rather, today

433
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,579
after the trash collectors came

434
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,751
With the tape gone you
wouldn't have been able to lead us to it

436
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,286
right, Mr. Nakamoto?

437
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:13,058
You have no evidence
of anything, Mm Mourn.

439
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:17,095
That's all mere paper plan, that
detectives are known to be good at.

441
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,464
This is no paper plan! Unfortunately,

442
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:22,901
Mr. Nakamoto there ls a witness!

443
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,135
A witness?

444
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,677
Uh. I was asked to come here,
a while ago by Conan

446
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,147
I asked him to ask you to come here.

447
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:40,952
So, Mr. Nakamoto had to figure out
who he would let make the deduction

449
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:48,159
And that person had to be someone
that the police would listen to

451
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,499
So, you turned your attention to me,
the renown detective, Kogoro Mourn,

453
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,971
But, you were worried that I may turn
you down if you came to me just like that

455
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:07,545
To make sure that I would listen to you,
you deliberately got me involved

457
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,015
by setting me up as a witness!!

458
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,750
H, How?

459
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:18,189
Knowing that I love to drink, you left an ad
for an all you can eat and drink between

461
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,093
20:00 to 22:00 in my post box

462
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,498
I see! Mr. Mouri would undoubtedly fall for it!

463
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:32,971
Therefore, I would pass by Mr. Irie's
apartment after 22:00 on my way home

465
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,908
But, in order to get the timing right,

466
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:42,180
Irie probably started his one man act
after confirming us passing by.

468
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,418
He had% no way of knowing that he was going
to be murdered, so he did just as planned

470
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,424
But, then why is Azusa from
the restaurant below a witness?

472
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,828
Mr. Nakamoto,

473
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,899
you put this ad in the post box yesterday
morning, didn't you?

475
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,169
She saw you do so.

476
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,206
How about it, Azusa?
Are you sure it was him?

478
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,575
Yes! He's 'the one!!

479
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,278
When I came to the shop in the morning,

480
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,681
he was putting a red
ad sheet in the mail box.

482
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:19,217
I think it was the same
as that one over there.

484
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:23,887
Your fingerprints would most naturally
be found on the ad if checked for.

486
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,660
That ad was only distributed on the
other side of the station in the first place.

488
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:34,599
Why did you have to go out of your way
to put that ad in my mail box,

490
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,533
Mr Nakamoto?

491
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,241
And I thought everything worked out perfect.

492
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,044
How did you figure everything out?
When did you suspect me?

494
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,847
You just talked too much...

495
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:52,350
Oh, I heard from Inspector Megure that

496
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,020
a man who was walking his dog
stopped you from going inside

498
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,757
I told the Inspector A man taking a walk,

499
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:04,395
but I didn't give him the details
about the old man walking his dog.

501
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:09,200
I probably would've given him more details
£ "if no witness was found, though

503
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,670
what a klutz I am!

504
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,875
If I went in there and
stopped you both from fighting,

506
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,576
everything would go down the drain.

507
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,480
So, you kept me from going into the room.

508
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,985
The old man who was
walking the dog was you, wasn't it?

510
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:36,394
I was right after all ..Mr. Moun,
you are a renown detective after all...

512
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,164
No, rather you are too renown

In the battle for the rights and fame
of the research they were developing,

00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:24,868
Mr. Nakamoto deceived his colleague,
Mr. Irie, and eventually killed him.

564
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:30,108
He then tried to frame Professor Idemura
as the killer and take everything for himself.

566
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,213

00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,256
Give it back! If I drink chap liquor it'll

573
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,258

00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:53,631
Hey, hey, don't you ever get

578
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,745

00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,214

00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,684
