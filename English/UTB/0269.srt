Youth Detective Squad is looking for
a lost wristwatch.

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,708
We encountered a big case.

He sees through the one and only truth,

00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,211
a child in appearance

00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,013
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

11
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,650
Wow! It's 'so mute!

12
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,418
This is me!

13
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,087
All of them look just like us!

14
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,057
Are you sure
it's okay for us to take these chocolates?

16
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,192
Yes!

17
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:10,963
I made it with all my skills at the lodge
just for all of you!

19
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,499
When did you make this. though?

20
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,335
I didn't see it on the desk of the lodge.

21
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,506
I made it as I try-out at first
and kept it in the refrigerator!

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,909
I'll go make you some tea,
so» wait here. okay?

25
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,578
Okay!

26
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,483
Judging from the way she's acting

27
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:34,387
it seems you somehow succeeded In
getting the chocolate

29
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,022
from Ran who was in tears. huh...

30
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,089
Huh?

31
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,159
How'd you know she was in tears?

32
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,529
A creation reflects the heart of
Its creator.

34
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,698
Just take a look at this chocolate.

35
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,068
It's laughing but it has a sad face...

36
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,470
Now that you mentioned it...

37
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,341
Really, a face so ad that

38
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,711
it seems as if it's going to
break out in tears any minute.

40
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,613
She's trying sea hard.

41
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,885
You sometimes talk like a girl. don't you?

42
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,255

It's like chocolate that re sold in stores!

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,741

down a bit more?

55

I see...

92
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:33,405
so the watch you're looking for
is your late wife's...

Vi=@

95
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:39,612
It's an old hand-wind type wristwatch
that I sent my wife some time ago.

97
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,081
Why do you need the wristwatch now?

98
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,350
Your wife died. didn't she?

99
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:45,618
Oh, I get it!

100
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,186
You want to take it to the pawn shop?

101
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,087
No...

103
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,891
my wife comes to my, bed side
night after night...

105
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,295
and asks me,
What time is it now: dear...?"

107
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,167
I'm sure you're just tired

108
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,137
I think so too, but...

109
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,941
Did you lose it
when you went out somewhere?

111
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,644
Or, was it a thief or something?

112
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,647
Well, I think it's somewhere in the house.

113
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:15,648
Huh

114
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,117
She was quite scatterbrain.

115
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,653
There were times when she was looking
for her lipstick

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,621
that she left under some magazines
for a whole day...

119
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:26,458
Therefore, I think that if I find the watch,
she'll be able to rest in peace...

121
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,194
You gotta be kidding!

122
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,663
If it's in the house, go look for it yourself!!

123
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,931
On, but...

124
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,234
I'm just as bad as my wife
when it comes to being scatterbrained...

126
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,802
I'm the renown detective Kogoro Mouri!

127
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,673
I can't be bothered with trivial
stuff like'that!!

00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:43,509
Huh? K.Kogoro Mourn?

130
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,611
You mean that famous Sleeping Kogoro"?!

131
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,049
He's planning to slack off!

132
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,418
He's like those snobbish shops
that refuse entry to customers

134
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,186
depending on how they feel about them!

135
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,156
There shouldn't be a case that's too big
or too small to take on. should there...

137
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:02,828
Oh, but if you insist you want to look for
the wristwatch at all costs. then...

139
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,264
No. I'll look for someone else
to do it for me.

141
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,802
I just happened to come across
your sign outside

143
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,337
and kind of just dropped in so...

144
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,346
Oh. .7?

145
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,515
Where'd everybody go?

146
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,119
They've all disappeared some Mere.

147
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:34,860
Hello!

148
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:35,861
Huh

149
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,564
Shall we help you look for
the wristwatch youllost?

151
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:40,299
Huh?

152
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,203
Of course we won't charge you fort.

153
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,138
Oh...

154
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,908
we are coming in!

155
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,546
What beautiful flowers!

156
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,883
But, some of them are bent...

157
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:58,884
Yes,

158
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,854
These are flowers that my wife arranged
before she died.

160
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,423
So even if I change the water everyday.

161
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,191
The more days pass. the more they bend

162
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,329
Which means that it hasn't been that long
since your wife passed away yet?

164
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:15,301
She passed away just 3 weeks ago
in a traffic accident.

166
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,870
What's with this room?

167
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:18,637

Never mind this room for now.
Please search another room.

Oh, after you finish watching it

233
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,014
can you please return it to the manager
of the video shop in front of the station?

235
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,485
It seems to be a valuable video tape
that they don't even have at the shop so.

237
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:15,487
Oh. okay,

238
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,456

I'll watch this enjoy myself thinking it
to be the interest for the money I lent you,

241

242
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,676
Oh, how about the living room then

243
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,454
That lady is sure blasting
the volume while watching

245
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,290
It sure sounds like
an interesting movie, though!

247
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,860
Come on, no more talk and start looking.
Or the sun will start-setting.

261
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,867
No thank you. I can handle it alone.

262
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:40,105
Okay then: I guess we'll give,it one last
search until the sandwiches are made

264
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,507
Okay.

266
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,376
Here you go. eat to your heart's content.

267
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,079
It l0ooKO Super delicious!

268
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,880
Clubhouse sandwiches!

269
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,183
Just as would*be expected
of a professional!

271
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,152
Wonder if anyone of you can
take some sandwiches

273
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,221
over to Ms. ldezuki
who 1s watching the video?

275
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,590
I'll take it to her!

276
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,092
Oh, I'll go too then!

277
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,527
Thank you.

278
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,641
We brought you your tea and sandwich.

279
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,846
This is the best-part!

280
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,315
Just leave it on the desk, will you!

281
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,117
OO. Okay.

282
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,257
Did Ms. Idezuki say it tastes good?

283
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,492
No...

284
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,061
She said she's watching the best part.
SO she'll eat it later

286
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,462
Oh well

287
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,132
she's a movie-lover
so I guess it can't be helpled

289
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,569
Huh?

290
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,338
What're those clothes in the plastic bag?

291
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,240
The laundry

292
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,875
I'm going to the coin laundry
to wash them.

294
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,945
But there was a washing machine
in the bathroom!

296
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,880
I don't know how to operate
that washing machine without my wife

298
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,849
because it's spit of difficult to use.

299
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,552
Uh, you know
the wristwatch you're looking for,

301
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,688
did your wife wear it all the time?

302
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,091
Yes. she liked it so much

303
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,628
that she had it on until the day
before she got into the accident.

305
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,331
She virtually never took it off...

306
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,634
But. she'd take it off
when taking a bath. right?

308
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,409
Conan!

311
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,745
Huh

312
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:28,647
Agh!

313
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,449
Here's the wristwatch!

314
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,250
It's, moving just find too.

315
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:32,851
What?

317
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,653
.88.

318
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,658
Thank you! This is my wife's watch!

319
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,327
I see.

320
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,930
She probably took it off
before taking a bath

322
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,400
and threw it inside the washing machine
together with her clothes...

325
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,138
that watch wasn't lost to begin with!

326
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,874
Then. what is it?

327
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,710
Why is ihe making up a lie like this?

328
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:04,149
It's the sound of something cracking.

329
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,284
That's the sound of somebody running.

331
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,820
D.Don't tell me that!

332
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,657
Hey, what was that sound?!

333
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,659
N Xt, it's the sound of the
front door closing.

335
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,330
The flower vase is gone!

336
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,265
WwW. What happened?

337
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,100
Hey, Conan?

338
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,076
M.Ms. Idezuki?!

339
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,552
The murder weapon is the vase
that had water and flowers in it.

341
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:46,191
The killer probably took the vase
and snuck up from behind,

343
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,127
then attacked the Victim with the vase.

344
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,996
Beaten to death.

345
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:58,135
It seems the victim Ms. Eiko lldezuki, 46,
IS a resident of this condo

347
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,272
And.

348
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,041
Mr. Hideo Morita, the owner of this room,

349
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,711
What is the relationship
between you. and Ms. Idezuki?

351
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,282
I borrowed some money from her.

352
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,784
She came here today
to get some of it back.

354
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,522
When I gave her the money together
with the video she had been looking for,

356
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:21,660
she said she wanted te watch it and
that's why she was in this audio room.

358
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,964
And you came to this room
after you heard the vase crack.

360
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,502
Then found Ms. Idezuki lying here
bleeding from her head?

362
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:31,470
Y, Yes...

363
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,676
The movie Ms. ldezuki was watching is
the video she was.holding,

365
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,414
judging from the manufacturer of
the remoté she was holding in her hand,

367
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,883
the video deck she was using
is this deck...

370
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,221
Oh, it's Sakura Sanjuro!

371
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,922
How nostalgic.

372
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,059
Inspector Megure, you know this story?

373
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,393
Yeah...

374
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,430
If I remember correctly
it started off something like,

376
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,234
the path you are to walk along
IS as beautiful as a flower

378
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,170
and you are to live as strong
as the trunk of a tree!

381
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,272
Right?

382
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,974
We heard the movie!

383
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:12,210
Because the lady was watching
the movie full blast!

385
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,013
WwW. Why are you all here?!

386
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,817
We came:to help to sea ch for
s rmething that was lost!

388
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:23,221
We came to help look for
Na hand-winding wristwatch

390
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,423
that Mrs. Morita had misplaced
the day before she passed away!

392
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:30,162
Although Conan already found that
wristwatch in the bathroom already.

394
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,199
Why did you ask the kids to help
you look for something like that, though?

396
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,036
I asked Detective Mouri
to help me search for it at first,

398
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,404
but was refused...

399
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:44,176
So. I had the children and Dr. Agasa
who at the office to help me search.

401
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:48,380
I see... so Mr. Mouri's not here.-then.

402
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,151
Huh? Bid you want anything with him?

403
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:53,618
Oh . no.

404
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:54,653
Oh. no.

405
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,856
I just had something I wanted to
confirm with Mr. Mouri, that's all

407
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,660
\\ 73

408
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:05,063
1258
The tape's been rewound to the beginning.

410
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,500
It seems that
she finished watching the video

412
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,303
and took the tape out of the deck.

413
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,672
Which after
she was attacked from behind.

415
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,542
I don't mean to be rude,
but where were you at that time?

417
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:20,378
Oh. think lw 3 in the bathroom...

418
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,681
He's telling the truthrand the whole truth!

419
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,185
We heard the vase crack at the
same time that Conan found the watch

421
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,254
and Mr. Morita was
with us in the bathroom!

423
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:34,159
And we heard the sound of someone
running and the front door closing to

425
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,162
the Killer must've come from outsid 1

426
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,166
Which means-that Mr. Morita was
with you and the children right through?

428
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,270
No. he went into the kitchen
to make some sandwiches part way.

430
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,572
The kitchen? Where's that?

431
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,809
It's way inside beyond this living room.

432
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,614
Over here.

433
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,720
Where were you then, Dr. Agasa?

434
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:05,190
I was in the living room
here with the children

437
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,229
If you open the door
on the corridor side of this kitchen,

439
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,599
it is one straight line to the audio reom
where the corpse was found.

441
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,201
Np VA 3

442
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,272
Besides, it's a blind spot
from the door of the living room.

444
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:24,608
It's possible to sneak out
for a while in this situation.

446
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,845
WwW. What do you mean, Mr. Inspector...?

447
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,413
In other words

448
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,383
the sound of the of the flower vase
cracking. the sound of footsteps

450
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,551
and the sound of the front door closing.

451
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,255
If these were all sounds
recorded beforehand by you...

453
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,458
you could've pretended
to go kitchen to make sandwiches,

455
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,694
and after beating Ms. Idezuki to death,

456
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,730
could've played the pre-recorded sounds!

457
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,768
It's net strange that nobody heard
her being beaten to death

459
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:54,806
if she was listening to the movie
with the volume turned up high.

461
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,275
O.Oh come on...

462
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,377
But, that's not possible!

463
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,045
Huh

464
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,349
Well, you saw the tea and sandwich
in the audio room, didn't you?

466
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:09,354
Ayumi and I took the tea and
sandwich to Ms lldezuki,

468
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,725
but at that time she was watching
the video and nothing was wrong!

470
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:18,530
It was after that when we heard the flower
vase crack and found the corpse

472
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:23,168
Mr. Morita was with us
right through until then.

474
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,737
Oh. I see...

475
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,908
Inspector Megure!

476
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,445
I've finished asking around the people
of the condo just now!

478
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,447
Okay.

479
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,683
It seems that Ms. Idezuki
had been lending money

481
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,020
to some other residents of this condo,

482
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,989
and if they couldn't pay her back on time,

483
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,360
she would take the valuables
that thosegpeople owned as interest!

485
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:52,731
Which means she didn't have
that great of a reputation.

487
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,301
Besides, it seems that
the people of the condo knew

489
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,037
that she was going to come here today!

490
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,338
What?!

491
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,173
The sound of the video.

492
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,342
It seems that she used to watch videos
in this audio room

494
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,344
with the volume turned up full blast.

495
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,213
Hmm ae

496
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,783
If they knew that{
she was going to be here,

498
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,386
it could be that
the killer came from outside.

500
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,887
Okay

501
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,224
chec everybody"
who had borrowed from Ms. Idezuki!

503
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:19,991
Yes: sin

504
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,358
Yes, sir!

505
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:26,498
If its a killer fromfoutside, I guess there
won't be anything for you to do this time.

507
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,199
NO...

508
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,502
I think that the killer is Mr. Morita.

509
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,435
What?

510
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,137
But you just mentioned a while ago that

511
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,339
it was impossible
for him to commit the crime.

513
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,742
Don't you think something's fishy?

514
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,280
A hand-winding type wristwatch
that was lost 3 weeks ago

516
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,416
was still moving accurately
when we foun it.

518
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,219
The longest a hand wound watch
can keep on operating

521
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,320
continuously is at most 50 hours...

522
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,458
It could never go on ticking
for 3 weeks if left as is.

524
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,362
Then don't tell me
that the wristwatch is...?

526
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:58,695
Yeah,

527
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,332
An excuse to get us to-come here.

528
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:04,402
Probably to set up an alibi.

529
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,272
But. it's for sure that
Mr. Morita didn't enters

531
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,742
the audio room
during the time of the crime.

533
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,313
I looked in on the kitchen
in question every 2 to 3 minutes

535
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,482
but he was
where he was supposed to be

537
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:22,454
He hasn't made any funny moves
even after the corpse was found.

539
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:27,392
He could ever have
committed @ Crime like that...

541
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,461
By the way, Mr. Morita.

542
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,397
When you went to Mr. Mouri's office

543
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,500
did you run into anyone
suspicious in the vicinity?

545
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,502
No. not that I recall.

546
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,804
I see. thank you.

547
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,410
Officer Takagi. what was that about?

548
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,078
Oh. nothing...

549
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,418
I'm still considering whether
I should tell himbin person

551
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,620
about this or not with the Inspector,

552
00:20:56,222 --> 00:21:00,925
But it seems that someone is secretly
checking up on Mr. Mour.

555
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,232
A whole bunch of investigation records
that Mr. Mouri handled up to now

557
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:12,003
disappeared from the police department.

558
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,709
Since Officer Matsumoto had copies of
the investigation records stored,

560
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,645
no problems arose during the trial, but...

561
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,280
The surprising thing is

562
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,117
that all the investigation records were
sent back to the station last night.

564
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,987
They were all in a sealed envelope
with no return address on it.

566
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,957
And. when did the papers disappear?

567
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:40,698
I think it was the day when you and
the others got messed up in a bus-jack.

569
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,304
We're investigating the case
because it may be a crime

571
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,706
that was committed
by the relative of a suspect

573
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,875
who is after Mr. Mouri's life
out of hate for him

575
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:53,178
But, we haven't been able to
come up with anyone for a while,

577
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,846
SQ we're trying to decide

578
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,815
whether we should protect
Mr. Mouri with bodyguards or not.

580
00:21:58,217 --> 00:22:01,586
Oh, but then it could be
a simple prank too.

582
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,891
At any rate, if you see anybody
suspicious around Mr. Mourn,

584
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,194
make sure you call the police night away!

585
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,296
Okay. I got it!

586
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,169
No, the one they're after is not Pops...

587
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:19,771
but maybe...

588
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,406
And,

589
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,476
maybe the killers are...

Now that you mention it. a burnt smell

636
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,112
Maybe that microwa ¢€

637
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:12,283
There is no question its coming
from this microwave oven

639
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,987
Yes! Some leftover sandwiches!
It's okay to have some right?

641
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:22,360
