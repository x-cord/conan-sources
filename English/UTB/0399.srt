n alibi relying on these three sense.

00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:13,084
The clue to invalidating the alibi
IS a past incident!

In other words. the suspects are

17
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,016
Daisaku. the head of the household that
was confined to his room blowing the f ute.

19
00:02:08,017 --> 00:02:11,152
Tsugutakn, the oldest son
who was illustrating...

21
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:14,489
ind the second son, Shigehide
who was writing a novel

23
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,757
These Lures men

24
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:17,892
No...up to now

25
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:21,963
all the deductions were made based on
Conan leading everyone to them.

27
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,365
It's as if the thoughts
that cross an innocent child's mind

29
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,868
coincidentally serve as hints
to reaching a conclusion,

31
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:28,686
but it can only be done

33
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:32,156
because he is secretly having Shinichi
make the deductions...

36
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:37,144
Even up to now, I've never seen him making
phone calls before coming up with an idea.

38
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:40,548
Which means,
there is only one thing I 'can, think of...

40
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,716
That this child

41
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:43,017
That Conan himself

42
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:45,353
Is Shinichi.

43
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:50,658
That's why all the calls from Shinichi
come in with no number display...

45
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:52,760
So that I can't call him from my side...

46
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:54,195
But...

47
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:56,930
During the school festival,
they were-both togcther.

49
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:59,067
Am I taking my Imagination too far after all

50
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:02,236
No. don't be deceived!

51
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:05,305
I'm sure Shinichi used some kind of trick!

52
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:07,208
What's the matter. Ran?

53
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:08,943
Oh no it's nothing.

54
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:09,444
Oh...?

56
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:11,946
I've got to mako sure...

57
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:15,416
C.Come to think of it, right after
I sent the mail to Shinichi

59
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:17,218
Conan's cell phone...

60
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:20,455
I'l send that mail once more...

61
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:22,190
And this time for sure

62
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:26,778
I'll get held of conclusive evidence
that he can't get away with!

65
00:03:32,434 --> 00:03:33,768
It's not . responding.

66
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,904
A visitor?

68
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,406
Were you expecting somebody?

69
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:39,640
N.No...

70
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:42,210
It says my mail's been-sent...

71
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,945
So. was what happened 'this-morning
a coincidence after all?

73
00:03:44,279 --> 00:03:45,313
Well, I guess so

74
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:47,548
Conan couldn't possibly be Shinichi...

75
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,850
No...it's Shinichi!

76
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:53,755
He could be using seme method that Is
unthinkable for ordinary people to think up

78
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:57,592
If you're going to be that way.
Mm Not going to take my eyes off ou.

80
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:59,977
Not even for an instant,
until you expose yourself...

82
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:02,597
So. you'd better be ready,
Shinichi!!

84
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,733
My... wonder if it's just another prank?

85
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:07,385
A prank?

86
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:07,435
A prank?

87
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:10,538
There are times when the doorbell rings
but therc's no One there

It usually happens only ence a week

92
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:19,379
But. M's already this, time of day
to be a prank by children

94
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:23,985
One of the three probably rang the
door chime using some method.

96
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:27,422
And rigged up some alibi trick
while the door was being answered

98
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,424
It's true that the alibi of the three 1s being
supported b the housekeepers

100
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:32,093
who have brought the dinner and placed
the dinner tray outside each room

102
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:35,229
during the time of the crime,
which was around / 30.

104
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:38,399
But. they did not directly sce
any of the three...

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,153
If so, the most suspicious would 'be
Tisugutaka: 'the husband of Tomoko

108
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:44,188
who had been killed

109
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,073
If he saw. the mail in her cell phone

110
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:48,659
that came from the one
she was having an affair with.

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,177
That would be a motive too.

113
00:04:50,178 --> 00:04:52,396
If Mrs. Kariya was having an affair.

114
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:55,483
(Conf it is Bal Ben soon Wega)

116
00:04:55,484 --> 00:04:57,185

for Motoka to come on the phone.

Was the police notified?

138
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:39,326
I only know that there was 2 phone call.

139
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:42,263
Shigehide told us that it had nething to do
with the case.

141
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:43,998
So that it wasn't necessary to report it...

142
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:45,665

We heard Tomoko and Shigehide arguing in

00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:59,180
Something about "It's ternblo to
Mf. to,
AVES rop...

151
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,915
It was about the dialogue of the parents of
the main character that

153
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,917
appear in the novel which is to be
dramatized soon

155
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:05,552
being very similar to their own .

156
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:09,490
Mr Kanya was outraged sayimg that
if the dialogue is not changed

158
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,292
before the dramatization, shewould sue
him...

160
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,528
s a result, Shigehide agreed to change
the dialogue

162
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,163
and everything seems to have been
settled .

164
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:19,584
What. you're all still here?

165
00:06:19,585 --> 00:06:21,201
)id you find the killer...?

166
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:23,104
Oh. well...not yet...

167
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:26,641
By the way. at around 730 when your
dinner was delivered to you

169
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,276
you answered through the siding paper
door that.

172

It's been azlong*time since we've had
Curr

175
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,648
But. how did you know it was curry?

177
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:37,051
Tae aroma ." Théssliding door was slightly
opened

179
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,420
Um... what's this used for?

180
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:43,357
I use it to...listen to my flute teacher play
and practice

182
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,526
I'm making process day by day!

183
00:06:45,527 --> 00:06:47,061
Now that I don't go out often,

184
00:06:47,062 --> 00:06:49,931
playing the flute is my only favorite
pas ime...

186
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:56,070
Oh~so you hurt you leg at work and you
haven't gone out much since then...

188
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:58,906
Yes, since he used to stay at home all
the time,

190
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:01,876
he found out that his wife was having an
affair with someone else.

192
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:03,911
And the like...and got a divorce .

193
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:08,749
I sce. that's why he 1s very sensitive to
extra-marital.

195
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:11,852
Curry. was one of the dishes that his wife
was good at making...

197
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:12,787
Curry was one of the dishes that his wife
was good at making...

199
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:15,156
That's why you didn't make curry too often?

200
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:17,592
Out of consideration for Mr Kariya...

201
00:07:17,593 --> 00:07:20,761
Yes. we were actually thinking of making
beef stew. but...

203
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:23,531
we decided to change it to curry just
10 minutes before serving it...

205
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:26,200
Hey. come on! hat'stlenough!

206
00:07:26,201 --> 00:07:29,937
I just finished telling you that I was in this
room at around 7430!

208
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:33,708
When you were served dinner, you raised
your hand and responded.

210
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:36,477
She saw your silhouette through the sliding
paper door

212
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:38,479
but she didn't actually see you in person...

214
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,914
You mean you think I rigged it so that Ay,

215
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,749
my silhouette would be reflected on the 7
paper door

217
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:44,452
I don't think that's possible...

218
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:46,487
I can tell whether it 1s actually
the silhouette of a person or not...

220
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:47,521
0 see

221
00:07:47,556 --> 00:07:50,758
So, now that you'ne«one,
go on home. will you!

223
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,727
Thanks to you. the police coming here

224
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:56,497
I haven't been able to concentrate nd
haven't made any progress in my work!

226
00:07:57,733 --> 00:07:59,300
One of his family members has died

227
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:00,768
and yet he doesn't shed a tear at all.

228
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,005
It's a wonder
he's a writer of pure love novels.

230
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:05,740
He sure doesn't look to be one.

231
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,775
Talking about not looking to be one.

232
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:09,510
When we first met them you were saying .?

233
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:11,078
He . Ran?!

234
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,979
Huh? What?

235
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,816
You were saying that you thought he
was much older...

237
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:20,688
Oh, that's because the peop e who come
out in his novels don't dye their hair...

239
00:08:22,024 --> 00:08:24,358
Even if people with dyed hair come out,
they're treated as delinquents...

241
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,460
That's why I thought he was pretty old...

242
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,695
Besides

243
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:30,665
His story usually has scenes in which the
main characters are at the place

245
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,034
the 're supposed to meet, and et,
they don't get to see each other

247
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:35,369
because a pillar IS In the way. just lake In
some old movie...

249
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,838
It's so sad watching the characters waiting
and worrying ~

251
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,841
concerned about their loved ones that
don't show up

253
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:43,044
They're so different fromisomebody I know,

254
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:46,847
that's«always close by? yet insists on
secretly watching his partner...

256
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:50,451
You think so too! don't you. Conan?

257
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:53,020
Loan t really tell because I'm just a child.

258
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,156
You think so. don't you?

259
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:56,223
\ res...

260
00:08:57,426 --> 00:09:02,129
nough I have nothing more 10 say than
that I was here. right through

262
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,033
But, smolling the aroma of the pipe
when dinner was brought here

264
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:08,069
Is not enough to serve as proof of an alibi...

265
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,870
Then. who was smoking the pipe?

266
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,972
A double or something?!?

267
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:13,140
A double

269
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,027
You ate the curry

270
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:18,846
By the way. d d somebody come again?

271
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,715
I heard the doorbell ring a while ago...

272
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:23,884
No It seems that somebody played a
[Ar al LY An,

274
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:30,191
I think that Tsugutaka is quite upset over
this prank...

276
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:35,329
Each time he returned from outside,
he used to ask if any pranks were played...

278
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,365
When we told him there were, he used to
get into a foul mood

280
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:42,303
Oh, and he used to get really upset over
crank calls too

282
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:45,406
Yes. it rings once. and hangs up.

283
00:09:45,407 --> 00:09:48,909
TL rings tor somo Lime and thon hangs up.

284
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,377
We got a one today too!

285
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:53,047
When you came. a little after 8-00.

286
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:54,348
Was it an undisplayed number?

287
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:55,683
No... the thing is...

288
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:58,986
although the phone call came In it wasn't
displayed in the incoming call history...

290
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:00,988
Don't tell me that the chime we heard just
a while ago...

292
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:02,590
Uh, Ran!

293
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:03,924
What?!

294
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,292
You sent mail out a while ago. didn't you?

295
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:05,926
What?!

296
00:10:05,927 --> 00:10:06,360
What?!

297
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,161
You did. didn't you?

298
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:07,428
You did. didn't you?

300
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:09,396
Yes?! I did!

301
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:09,663
Bug ou?

302
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:10,164
Bug your

303
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:10,531
Bug ou?

304
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:12,533
Did you verify the address?

305
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:16,103
I didn't have to verify it because all I did
was re-send the mail

307
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:17,571
I sent out this morning...

308
00:10:17,572 --> 00:10:21,342
Huh? Oh. no?! Who did I mail this out to?

309
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:22,710
(Just as I thought after all...

310
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:25,579
hates why she found the cell phone «.o
Caslily.

312
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:28,749
Which means that person is the killer...

313
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,419
The killer used the case of 12 years ago to
hide his shadow within the dark...

315
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:36,791
So that he alone could continue to stay In
the light...

317
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:45,800
I guess it's about time we call it a day
then...

319
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:50,571
Yes. I think it'll be difficult to undo their
alibi unless we use some sort of magic...

321
00:10:50,572 --> 00:10:52,206
Magic?!

322
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:56,143
I saw a fantastic magic show on TV
the other da!

324
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:59,279
This lady 1511 a reotangular-box.

325
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,950
Her face, hands nd legs are sticking, out,
but her body splits into-three!

327
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:04,351
Talk about shocking!

328
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,389
You fool! There are three people in there!

329
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,192
Oh, really?! I guess you can t deceive
people carrying it out alone

331
00:11:11,193 --> 00:11:14,028
but if there are others to help you
it's possib e!

333
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:16,080
So. what'!

334
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:21,635
Mm If one of the three helps out,
then the alibi trick will work?

336
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:27,942
It's not possible, because the meals were
delivered to three rooms that are apart

338
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,048
Forgsome reason Mrs. Kariya finds the cell;

340
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:36,483
and as soon as she does so she is killed...

341
00:11:36,484 --> 00:11:40,354
The three men who live in this house are to
be suspected. that's for sure...

343
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:44,725
Yes... «the cell phone was also missing from
the scene of the murder...

345
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:46,260
But. Ran...

346
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:50,297
Don't you think that the person who is
hiding that cell phone is really stupid?

348
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:50,798
Huh?

349
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,067
Because while we were looking for the
cell phone.

352
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:54,902
no matter how many times we cal ed.

353
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:57,638
The person on the other side kept answering
andishanging up right away. right?

355
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,005
Of course.

356
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,209
Heecause once his voice 1s heard,
it would be obvious who he is!

358
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,947
But. if it were me. If I knew that such an in
convenient phone call would be coming

360
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:09,582
would swit€h off my cell phone.

361
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:14,188
Which means that Shinichi did have
his cell phone switched off!?

363
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:15,522
You Fool!

364
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:19,627
He was waiting for Tomoko's man
to call or mail her.

366
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,678
That's why he didn't switch off her phone!

367
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,165
If so, he could've adjusted the volume of
her cell phone

369
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,519
v because ho was getting repeated calls

370
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,640
4@r, was it that he didn't know how to
operate the phone?

372
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:34,341
I'm sure he knew what he was doing

373
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:36,644
because he knew how to unlock
the cell phone!

375
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:39,914
But even if the cell phone were to he
Iocked. it would be obvious

377
00:12:39,915 --> 00:12:42,416
that 4 digits would have to be entered
In order to unlock the phone

379
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,485
herefore, even If the killer had no ide
how to use the phone.

381
00:12:44,486 --> 00:12:47,288
So long as he had lime, I'm sure he
would've been able to unlock it...

383
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:49,556
Using a cell phone Is not all that hard, so
just touching a little here and there

385
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:50,991
would give anyone an idea of how to
work it...

387
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,927
It took me a while to get used to at
though...

389
00:12:52,994 --> 00:12:57,531
You're talking about back when you first
bought your cell phone. aren't you?

391
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:00,433
Right, right, there aren't too many people
who do not know

393
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,236
know how to use a cell phone in this
da and age

395
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:05,639
If that person were to be locked up
somewhere

397
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,007
for about 10 years or so. well, maybe...

398
00:13:07,008 --> 00:13:08,075
10 ears?

399
00:13:08,076 --> 00:13:12,178
Come to think of it, the use of cell phone
became widespread about 10 years ago...

401
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,249
Hey...wasn't it about 12 years ago?

402
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,653
That the 3rd son Eisuke's fiance was killed
and his whereabouts became unknown...?

404
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:23,891
Could it have been Eisuke that had
Tomoko's cell phone?

406
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:26,726
Don't tell me that he's somewhere In
this house?!

408
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:30,630
Which means that one of the three was
hiding him. .?

410
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:31,765
It's understandable

411
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,768
that after being separated from
the outside world for 12 years

413
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:39,039
he finds the cel phone and becomes
interested in it. and takes it away...

415
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,711
It was after all, Eisuke's friend who got a
call from the cell phone that was lost...

417
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:46,747
If it were him, he probably had a lot of time
to figure out how to unlock the phone...

419
00:13:47,881 --> 00:13:50,484
And, when he went to return the phone,
Tomoko found him,

421
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:54,989
so he killed her along with whoever was
hiding him in order to keep her from talking

423
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,257
The alibi would become invalid...

424
00:13:57,258 --> 00:14:00,194
Okay! Go get a search warrant!

425
00:14:00,195 --> 00:14:04,031
Eisuke could be the killer of the incident
that happened 12 ears ago!

427
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:05,699
Yes, sir!

428
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,402
The problem is. who's sheltering him?

429
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:11,221
I think the most suspicious is the head of
he household. Daisaku...

431
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:13,340
There was a radio cassette recorder in his
room, right?

433
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:17,945
He probably recorded his voice, "It's been a
Iong time since we've had curry *

435
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:22,549
And. at the time of the crime around 730,
he made Eisuke that

437
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,620
he was sheltering push the button
in order to establish his alibi...

439
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:30,991
I think I'm kind of hungry

440
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,961
Would you like to have some curry then,
because there's some more left. «+. 7?

442
00:14:33,962 --> 00:14:37,064
Oo It was supposed to be beef stew,
right?

444
00:14:37,065 --> 00:14:39,533
And you changcd it to curry 10 minutes
before you served it. right?

446
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:43,937
10 minutes ago... means about 7:20...

447
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:47,808
It takes more than 20 wnutes to the
murder site from here...

449
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:53,013
He'll have to leave by a little after 7:00
to make it in time

451
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:56,316
Then, it's Tsugutaka who was smoking
his pipe in the room

453
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,818
and illustrating In his room!

454
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,156
As for the aroma from the pipe ll he had to
do was make Eisuke smoke it VY

456
00:15:02,157 --> 00:15:05,692
Oh, well, curry as my favorite. so maybe
I'll have some after all

458
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:06,794
Huh?

459
00:15:06,795 --> 00:15:09,696
In fact I was, thinking of taking the curry
that was outside the man's room

462
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:12,599
Somewhere and eating it...

464
00:15:13,635 --> 00:15:14,902
But. I decided against it...

465
00:15:14,903 --> 00:15:19,606
Because if the plate of curry disappears,
it'll be easy to figure out who ate the curry!

467
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:20,774
Waits isc

468
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:24,778
If Tsugutaka made Eisuke stay
in his room to serve his double

470
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,514
why didn { he make him take the curry
into his room?

472
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:29,249
That would make it 10OK more like he was
in the room...

474
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:34,254
He probably couldn't come out because
he's someone that shouldn't be around...

476
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:38,325
Even so. Tsugutaka would've noticed the
dish after coming back

478
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,627
from the murder site and would've taken
it inside!

480
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:42,262
F he left it outside his room,

481
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,698
it would only-give way to suspicion that

482
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,101
he wasn't in his room during the time of
the crme...

484
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:51,538
Besides, sugutakahad eaten:the:wcurnry
after it had gotten co d:

486
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:53,774
There as no reason why he wouldn't
take it into his room...

488
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:57,744
If so. the remaining suspect would be. the
one who was writing a novel in his room...

490
00:15:57,745 --> 00:16:00,447
Shigehide...

491
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,518
I killed Tomoko?

492
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,753
I'm sheltering my kid brother Eisuke?!

493
00:16:06,754 --> 00:16:08,589
You've gotta he kidding!

494
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,925
But. if so. everything falls into place...

495
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:16,296
You made Eisuko have his hair done
Iike yours

497
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:20,567
Then to make him respond through the
sliding paper door isn't all that difficult...

Were you making your kid brother writo"

525
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:50,297
That's why there weren't too many people
who dyed their hair in the novel...

527

12 years ago not too many people uscd I
to dye their hair yet...

529
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:55,235
Which means that

Mrland Mrs. Kariya were used too

It's enough.

567
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,685
Shigehide...

568
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,754
YOU ro

569
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:16,890
Yes... I'm Eisuke Kariya, who killed my
fancé 12 years ago.

571
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:20,327
And was beingsprotected by my older
brother all this time.

573
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:23,864
Because of the words of my father that I
heard back then through the phone...

575
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:28,101
If a slut like you ever dare ¢ome through
the door of the Kenya residence.

577
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:30,053
I ll see to it that yousdo not live!

578
00:17:30,888 --> 00:17:34,975
We got into an argument, I lost my temper
and killed Motoka...

581
00:17:34,976 --> 00:17:37,211
Was pp Inning o 1 mysoe 00...

582
00:17:37,212 --> 00:17:41,048
But I was in shock and found myself
at home. when Shigehide found me...

584
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,416
Shigehide. I'm in trouble. I... killed Motoka*

585
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,786
Don't worry! I'll work something out...

586
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:47,654
And 'you've stayed in the attic ever
11%)

588
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:50,691
Yes I thought of turning myself in many
times

590
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:54,428
but just couldn't find the courage to do so
I had no intention of killing her...

592
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:58,649
Then, why did you hit Her after you
stabbed her?

594
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,700
You hit her. didn't you?

595
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,702
No...l only stabbed her...

596
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:07,307
So, it's you who killed 'Motoka
12 ears ago...

598
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:08,375
What the

599
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,478
WéWait! Why would Shigehide kill Motoka?

600
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:17,150
Maybe because he was the one who was
having an affair with Motoka?

602
00:18:17,151 --> 00:18:20,420
I see! If it's ah affair within the same
household. it's understandable that

605
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:23,123
Daisuke who didn't go out often,
would find out about it too...

608
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:27,694
Yes, "1nd you killed Tomoko
who found out about it to shut her up

610
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:29,863
Using the same method you used
172: years ago

612
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:33,650
You figured if push came to.shove you
would put all the blame on Eisuke!

614
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:35,035
That's ridiculous.

615
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:38,655
Shigehide protected me for the past
12 years 1.

617
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:41,942
No. . he protected youvbecause
If the police 'arrested you

619
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:43,710
everything would bo disclosed!

620
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:46,129
The facts that tafter yousEisuke «
stabbed Motoka.

623
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,781
he killed her with a finishing blow!

624
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:50,983
1. That's not true. is It. Shigehide'?)!

625
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:54,354
No...Why would lifdo something like that?

626
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:56,690
Oh. I remember Mrs. Kariya saying...

627
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:59,259
that the ringtone of the cell phone was
1 strange one

629
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,295
Bo quiet!

630
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:04,931
If you want to set me up as the killer that
badly. show me proof that I did it...

632
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:05,799
If you want to set me up '18 the: kllléf that
badly. shew Me proof that I did it...

634
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:08,735
Guests again?

635
00:19:08,736 --> 00:19:11,872
O. I think It's the sound for incoming mail

636
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:17,810
Remember, 'Mrs. Kariya disappeared while
Iooking for the cell phone?

638
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:21,081
She had my cell phone at that.time...

639
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,884
So 'she sent mailmo her cell phone
repeatedly

641
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:26,053
and found her cellphone
with the sound of incoming mail!

643
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,088
L's@e...

644
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:31,158
No matter what button I pushed,.
I couldn't stop this sound.

646
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:34,294
I got all flustered when Tomoko showed
up at the attic...

648
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:36,262
I was able to std} the sound
of the cell phonesbut...

650
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:43,403
The ringtone is the same as that
of the Kariya family...

652
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:45,872
I see If left that way,
no matter where in the house you are

654
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:48,809
you have an excuse to eave,
SO you can answer the call or ee mails

657
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,610
from tie one. ou're having an affair with...

659
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:50,844
From the one you're having an affair with

660
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:52,312
from the one you're having an affair with.

662
00:19:52,313 --> 00:19:55,682
And the fact that the sound as ranging
NOW means

664
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:58,218
that the cell phone is somewherewnsthis
room...

666
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:01,488
Shigehide, the cell phone that you carried
away from the scene of the murder...

668
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:03,990
Tomoko s cell phone...

669
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:10,430
You should've thrown it away immediately.

670
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:12,733
He wns probably (00 scared to throw it
away

672
00:20:12,734 --> 00:20:16,770
until he confirmed whether or not she told
anybody about his kid brother...

674
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:19,539
Well, the truth will come out as soon as we
check out the fingerprints

676
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,141
on the murder weapon and the blood on it

677
00:20:21,142 --> 00:20:25,945
If only"she didn"t-say what she did

678
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,682
Where do you think:I found this cell phone?

679
00:20:28,683 --> 00:20:31,084
Your very curious kid brother had it.

680
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:31,752
Huh?

681
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:34,988
The one inside the dark attic. made to write
novels to past his time away.

683
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:39,226
So that his;older brother could get, all the
glory 'that poor kid brother of yours.

685
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:42,312
Okay, to start things off, give me
10.000.000 yen...

687
00:20:42,313 --> 00:20:45,432
We'll talk over the, details thoroughly
in a different place...

689
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,137
That's why you told me to write the novel
here tonight and went out?

691
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,539
Yeah... Momoka 12 years ago too

692
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,710
I first went to see if she was okay
because she was stabbed...

694
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,913
Her wound was not serous. so I was going
to take her to the hospital... But she said...

696
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:02,115
Take responsibility, will-you...

697
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:03,550
Take responsibility and get married to you?

698
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:07,587
You idiot! I would never marry into a house
with such an old fart living there!

700
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:09,222
Money

701
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:11,525
Now that things turned out
the way they did.

703
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:14,661
I'm going to leech you till you die and suck
YOu Lo Ihe Hones. SO He prepared!

705
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,164
Shigehide...

706
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:20,400
Phooey. I'm not worthy of being your
brother...

708
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,935
If you didn't have the writing talent you did

709
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:26,206
I probably would have killed you the first
chance I had...

711
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:27,507
Ik Olek

712
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:29,843
Wellfguess I didn't do so

714
00:21:29,844 --> 00:21:35,982
because , myself wanted to read the
continuation of your novels most of all...
