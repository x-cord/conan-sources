Okay!

271
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,341
What?!

272
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,443
A BiBomb?!

273
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:15,478
Is that true Mr. KBZUHibH?

274
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,081
Yeah... .as for the details
I can't say for sure

276
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:20,416
I see the reportsof the firefighters after

277
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,919
they put out the fire,
but it seems to be so...

279
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,723
A companycalled Takano Transport
seems to have caught fire.

281
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:30,093
According to what the neighbors aro saying.

282
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:34,230
Before that place caught fire, a loud boom
seems to have been heard...

284
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:35,698
I see

285
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,668
Fortunately. that company was off today

286
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,505
SO there seems to have been
no casualties what so ever.

288
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,508
They think a bomb went
AN rere To co ay

290
00:14:45,543 --> 00:14:48,478
came from a building that
was supposediyempty...

292
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:51,498
And. do you know when
the building caught fire?

294
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,016
Well'!

295
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,884
We Numaita?

296
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:55,885
Yes, sir?

298
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:59,322
You know that fire that's
being put out now...

300
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:02,058
Do you know what time it stanted

302
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:06,429
I think it was about

303
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:07,730
Just around when...

304
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,201
Around when the bottom
of the 2nd inning ended!!

306
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:15,171
Looks bad, Hattori... ..If the
evidence that the guy warned I's~

308
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:18,274
about over the shone was that
explosion that caused the fire

310
00:15:18,275 --> 00:15:20,777
Maybe the way he's
going to commit suicide is...

312
00:15:20,778 --> 00:15:22,412
M.Moron...

313
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:25,281
If he commits suicide with a
bomb in a Place like this

315
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:28,051
with so many people,
It wou d cause a grave disaster!!

317
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,500
Hey."O@htak:...

318
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:48,054
come to think of it, arenst you
at Koshien teday

320
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:49,906
How do you know about the fire...

321
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,708
Oh. well

322
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,943
HH. Heli-ehan, what do you want te do?

323
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:56,179
Do you want to tell the police about this?

325
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,049
The guy who called is saying
he's going to commit suicide

327
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,020
when the ball game ends" We don't
want to start useless commotion here

329
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:07,557
and end the game, because
the minute it ends we blow up!

331
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:11,327
I think it would be better to just
Iisten to what the man

333
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:15,131
has to say for now and solve
the codes one after the other.

335
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,834
Trace the three cell phones
and arrest the man

337
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,370
Eithor way, wel have to
solve the codes before

339
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:22,772
the bottom of the 3rd inning ends

340
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,975
and find the 1st cell phone that is hidden

341
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:28,278
somewhere in the stands of Koshien,

342
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,480
or we're finished'.

343
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:45,695
The top of the 3rd Inning, one out
and runners on 1st and 2nd base.

345
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:51,367
Theretis asmap of the stands: right behind
the back net of gate number 8 here

347
00:16:51,368 --> 00:16:55,571
I guess I'll go outside, look at the map,
use Mm head and decipher the code...

349
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,176
The meaning of these fumbers*96, 7, 13!!

350
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,115
I'll go borrow the radio from Pops then!
We need to know

352
00:17:06,116 --> 00:17:08,785
ow the games progressing,
otherwise. we'll be in trouble. right?

354
00:17:08,786 --> 00:17:10,687
Yeah! Do so. will you!

00:17:16,894 --> 00:17:17,527

359
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,235
I guess this game is
going to be a long one...

361
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,537
Lets go. Hei-chan.

362
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:28,805
Okay

364
00:17:58,135 --> 00:18:02,739
It's clean up. but the pitcher
Is not quite an control of the balm

366
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,315
then it'll be one out. with the bases loaded

367

Heiji and the others sure are late .

371
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,825
Maybe they can't find the
owner of the cell phone yet.

373
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:26,896
If so, wi¥ don't give up already
and hurry on back here?!

375
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,967

Searching for that man

385
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,555
we won't be able to tell
how the game is progressing...

387
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:54,891

388
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,693

I borrowed the 'radio!!

432
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:36,092
How's the game going?

433
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:39,629
The top of the 3rd inning just finished,
and the score's still zero-zero!

435
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:41,848
Hree outs left...

436
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,301
You know what is there such
a wing in this ball field?

438
00:20:47,604 --> 00:20:50,473
Pp because heard them sa . Koshie

439
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:53,276
with both wings 96 meters on the radio...

440
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,969
You really don't know a thing
about baseball. do you...?

442
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,570
Well, they don't say
both wings in other games

444
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:07,557
so I guess it can't be helped. but...

445
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,444
Kiddo...Both wings 96 meters
means that the distance

447
00:21:11,445 --> 00:21:15,031
from the home base
to the pole is 96 meters.

449
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,504
D.Don't tell me that this code
The first 96 means...

451
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:23,906
the seats by the end of the pole?

452
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,742
But which way. Hei-ehan??

453
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,812
There are poles
on both sides. the right and left!

455
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:34,283
