00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,533
Is not that we wanted to report this,

664
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:51,303
but we figured we had to cooperate
with your investigation

666
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:53,205

hey hid their time capsules 15 year go.

673
00:20:05,051 --> 00:20:07,352
15 years ago, all of them put things that were
recious to them inside a time capsule and

675
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,754
after shuffling, exchanged them,
each person burying a capsule

677
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:10,555
other than his own

678
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:14,026
They tried to make it so that the owners of
the capsule didn't knbw where it Was buried.

680
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:17,496
And. that's the very reason
why they were able to le. ve

How would you explam this dymg message!

739
00:21:19,926 --> 00:21:22,194
It seems that you were holding «1 grudge
against the victim

741
00:21:22,195 --> 00:21:24,496
since she wrote an article
about you that you didn't

743

766
00:22:18,451 --> 00:22:20,952
If so, the contents of the
