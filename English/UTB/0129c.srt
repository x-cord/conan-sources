Was quite fun...

52
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,353
She deceived me!!

53
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:53,125
#Well, you can't blame her for the fact
that you didn't know my address.

55
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,261
How should I knew

56
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,698
never sent anything to your house.

57
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,600
I even brought the New.Year's
greeting card over in persen.

59
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,003
Never mind that. Who on earth is she?

60
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,472
Didn't-she tell yeu'?

61
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,108
That she us a member
of the black organizatien,

63
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,811
drank the same poison as you
nd became small...

Strance

67
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:18,050
She told me she'd tell you herself,
so not to say anything to yeu...

69
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,386
WwW Wait, Doc.

70
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,389
Oh, I thought up the name
Ail Haibara with her.

72
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,326
We took it from the name
of a woman detective!

74
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,063
The 'Hal of her name meaning "gray" in
Japanese, was taken from Cordilia Gray...

76
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,534
Ail" was taken from,/the "I" in Vioshosky.

77
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,138
1 advised her that the
Japanese character for love "Ar"

80
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,939
YWoOullu Ue LuLler Lali 11 Ml
of the character for sadness, but...

83
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,545
Why is a weman involved with
the men in black living in your house!

85
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,879
He rescued me

86
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:57,023
in the rain outside your house where I had collapsed

87
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,860
Dr. Agasa found me

88
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:03,930
In front of my heuse?

89
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,465
Did you know?

90
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,934
The organization had sent investigators

91
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,002
to your house about twice.

92
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,939
Out of the people who drank that poison,

93
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,775
only your death wasn't verified.

94
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,612
1. the inventor of the peison, naturally
ame along on the investigation

96
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,983
But, the house was dusty

97
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,852
and there didn't seem to
be anyone living, there,

99
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,521
so the first time, we left right away

100
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,125
We went on our second
investigatien a month later...

102
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,061
It was dus. as usual

103
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,963
and it didn't seem different
from what. we saw before...

105
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,132
I was starting to think
that you had died after all.

107
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:45,271
1 got goose bumps hen I saw
the strange thing in your clothes drawer.

109
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:49,641
Your childhood clothes hat was
in the drawer a month ago was gone.

111
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,978
Whole lot of it too

112
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,282
During -theJstage of animal experiment,

113
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,885
only one mouse regressed
to childhood without=dying,

115
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,320
s@ it 'was easy to establish
the following hypothesis.

117
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,556
The possibili. that Shinichi K do was

118
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,725
given APTX4869,

119
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,462
and regressed, becoming) a child!!

120
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:14,867
Then the guys of the organization
know of my having became a child...

122
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,435
Thank me...

123
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,639
I rewrote "Confirmed deadgionyyour data.

124
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,643
I decided to let you live because
you're very interesting research material

126
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,478
If 1 report you to the organization,

127
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,282
the chances of yeu being killed
before getting to me are.greater...

129
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:34,020
Well, if they find out that the one
who rewrote your data is me

131
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,489
the one who betrayed them, they may
start getting suspicious again but

133
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,524
BB. Betra. ed?!

135
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,659
1-5.

136
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,829
One of the reasons why I gave that
peisen that was still in the testing stage,

138
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,566
to a human on my own aecerd,
was beeause I was getting sick of them. but,

140
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,236
the real reason, was my older sister...

141
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,237
Ider sister?

142
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,541
He was killed...

143
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,947
She was killed by the hands of
the men of the organizatien.

145
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,584
No matter hew much I asked them

146
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,320
they wouldn't tell me why hey killed her...

147
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,891
And. I went against them saying
that I was going to pestpone my research:

149
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,228
until they gave me a formal explanation...

150
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:17,530
Naturally, since I went against the organization

151
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,999
they confined me to a certain room in the lab

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,902
1 was to wait until the higher ups
decided what to do with me.

154
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,938
Thinking that I may as well drink the poison

155
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:31,244
if I was going to Be killed anyway,
§ drank the APT X4869 that 1 had hidden on me.

157
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,614
Fortunately. the pois 1 tee in
ap attempt te ll myself

159
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,821
transformed my body to that of a child's

160
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,624
and freed me from
the handcuffs that were on me.

162
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,628
And, I escaped from the tiny dust shu &

163
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,865
Having no place to go,

164
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,901
the only person I could
think efsgoimg to was

166
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,003
hinichi Kude...

167
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,572
onl \ ou

168
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:05,411
I figured-since-we~wereni'n¢the*same boat.

169
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,880
You'd be-able-te-understand-my predicament

170
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,816
You've get to be kidding!!

171
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,052
Just how am I supposed to
understand somebody whe

173
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,587
made peison to kill people?!

174
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,990
H.,Hey, Shinichi...

175
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,759
Do you know what you did!

176
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,894
Are you aware of just how many people died

177
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,729
because of the peisen you invented

178
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,464
I couldn't help it

179
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,568
I hadvno intention of making peison...

180
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:29,802
What?!

181
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,736
Well, come now,

182
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,272
she left the erganizatien already.

183
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,375
Since she's the one who made the poison,

184
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,311
she ceuld'come 'up with 'an antidete
without difficulty too, right?

186
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,315
The data for the poisen is all in the research lab.

187
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,251
I couldn't pessiblk remember
Sue massive amount of data!

189
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,488
Tell me where that researeh lab is then!!

190
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:50,990
O use...

191
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,560
Look at the evening paper 3 days ago.

192
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,230
This is about the mysterious fire

193
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:59,098
that burned down. the pharmaceutical cempany!

194
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:02,368
So. there would be nothing left
even if wejgo there!

196
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,936
W, what?

197
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:10,009
The organization get mid of it fearing

198
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:14,614
At this rate, everysfacility that I was
involved in wouldebe closed down...

200
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,116
Which means that these guys are after you...

201
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:21,721
Yes, they're probably going
berserk looking for me...

203
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,957
Without even knowing that
I've transformed this way

205
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:30,129
But, if they keep using
this peisen €& ill poeple,

207
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,200
there is no guarantee that people who
will regress-like us will eventually appear.

209
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:38,137
The organ: atien who has
a pieture 6 my childhood ays

211
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,005
will definitely find me

212
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:42,041
What will you do?

213
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,877
Will you chase me out of here
because I pose a threat to all of you?

215
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:48,447
High school detective,
Shinichi Kudo...

217
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:55,955
What will you do?

218
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,758
Will you chase me out of here
because I pose a threat to all of you?

220
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,495
Igh schoel detective, Shinichi Kude...

221
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:07,466
s... 1 made the poison
am-an accemplice to murder.

223
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,901
The organi -atien is also after me.

224
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:13,105
1 am an.extremely dangerous
€rson to have amund...

226
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,976
Theregis no reason why you
should keep me near you.

228
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,545
If they find out about you,

229
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,114
it'll be a matter of time before
they find out about me.

231
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,150
I hate to impose on Doc,

232
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,819
but I'll have you stay here as a grade
schooler whether you Ike it or not.

234
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,323
It's more bothersome to have
you hanging around outside.

236
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,959
H my, how nice of you...

237
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,329
How about the safety of your parents?

238
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,064
No need for worry,

239
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,332
they are also members of the organization

240
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,836
I was told.they died of an accident
oon after I was born...

242
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,039
hich means your family is...

243
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:51,444
Me and my older sister who
I didn't get to see too often

245
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,282
Unlike me. who was studying in the US
roug or ers 0 e organiza ion,

247
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,920
My si ter was, constantly under surveillance
because she was living in Japan...

249
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,259
until my sister started
working for the organization,

251
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,528
in an attempt to set me
ree of them, she was...

253
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,696
geing to an ordinary school. 1 .

254
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,634
Wad esdinary fiends,

256
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:21,240
Come to think of it. several
years before:-she was killed...

258
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,476
She sent me 2 or 3 floppies

259
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,746
with. pictures of whensshe went on a trip...

260
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,515
1 looked through them at the research lab

261
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:31,717
and sent it back to her right away but...

262
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,354
the floppy that I» lad aha data of
the poisen in. get lest after that.

264
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,091
I looked all over for it but couldn't find it.

265
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:40,927
I see

266
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,963
So the floppy with the data of
the peisen may be mixed up

268
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:48,134
ameng the floppies that you
sent back to your sister.

270
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:51,737
So, if we search the place
here your sister used to live...

272
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:52,572
No use!

273
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,273
The condo that my sister was living in

274
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,677
was gotten rid of by the organizatien
ight after her death,

276
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,779
not everything was cleared out...

277
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:03,549
But, she said that the person
who put the pictures into the. floppies,

279
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,086
was the professer that went
n the tnp together with her...

281
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,120
so, maybe...

282
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:11,057
Youtdon't know who that professer is?

283
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:15,260
Asami Hirota of Nanyo University...

285
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,200
But, I don't knew where he lives...

286
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,770
All we have todo is ask at the universi...

I'm sorry. Ran!

335
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,845
Hey, Wait!

336
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,317
You're sure good at acting like a child.

337
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:49,055
Yeah... but, I'm net as geod as you
who can fake crying like a baby...

339
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,995
It's 150 kilometers to Shizuoka...

340
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,930
I wonder if we can get there in 3 hours

341
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,300

That chick, you mean AI?

344
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:11,677
Yeah, although shes saying
she fledMrom the organization,

346
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,680
she's not telling us her real name or age,

347
00:15:14,815 --> 00:15:18,384
and even if we ask her
what the orgamzation us after.

349
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,453
She insists on net knowing a thing...

350
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:24,056
What she said a while ago,

351
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,293
could be a lie to lure us into a trap.

352
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,996
She doesn't look that way, though...

353
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,332

Officer Yokomizo!!

394
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,666
The cause of death seems
o have been this object #.

396
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:16,002
It may have hit him when he fell...

397
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,737
Just as I thought...

398
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,972
He fell?

399
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,008
In other words

400
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:24,177
Mr. Masami Hirota wanted to take
something that was on the bookshelf,

402
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:27,547
and placed his foot on the shelf.

403
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:30,416
He lost his balance and fell, beekshelf and all.

404
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,985
Then, he bumped the back of his head onto that

405
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:36,856
object that had already fallen to the floor

406
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:38,724
and it killed him As proof of that

407
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,194
The door of this room, and the windows located

408
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:45,097
above the door were all locked securely!

409
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,232
Besides,

410
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,935
the only key there is to this.room,

411
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,137
was scattered over the floor with the books

412
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,406
under the notebook...

413
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:57,677
Professor Hirota, locked the door himself,

414
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:01,647
and died because of
the accident, right after that?

416
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:03,749
No matter how you look at 1

417
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,952
He could've been killed by someone.

418
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,654
It was just made to look likeran accident.

419
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,723
You're the boy

420
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:12,058
that's staying with Mr. Moun, right...

421
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,527
Oh, yes. That's right.

422
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,029
He's the son of a relative of mine.

423
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,897
See, look at this phone,

424
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,266
it's toppled on the floor, right?

425
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,338
That's because

426
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,242
the phone.book fell togetherwith the bookshelf

427
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:32,979
\ Then, why is the reeeiver not off the heo «.

428
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,481
Although the phone is upside down

429
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:38,251
and it is camouflaged with the book on top of. it.

430

441
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,277

to be called grandpa, den't y Tahink...

474
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:14,680
Hey,

475
00:20:14,748 --> 00:20:16,849
don't tell me they took the fleppies?

476
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,985
Very likely.

477
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,954
Because the lest record of
the data of the poison,

479
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:27,393
as well as the record of the parcel that
I sent back to my sister about the same time.

481
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,095
Are all left behind at the organization.

482
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,296
I see

483
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,131
So, they could ve predieted that

484
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:34,367
since you fledifrem the organization,

485
00:20:34,468 --> 00:20:37,170
you would stop by here
to come get the data...

487
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:40,373
The organization came+here to look fer the data,

488
00:20:40,374 --> 00:20:41,774
and shuck in here,

489
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:44,410
but was seen by Professer
Hirota, so they killed him

491
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:46,279
Not bad.

492
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,881
No, let's not jump to conclusiens 00 fast!

493
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,685
First, let's ask about the people
who came here tenight.

495
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,687
We'll think about everything else later!!

496
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,625
You were at a community meeting?

498
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,497
together with a neighbor of mine,
- pp em ee a
HON LU. UV 0 £0.UVU, 101 ee mould...

501
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,333
Which means that you
haven't met the guests who,

503
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,335
came to see your husband tonight?

504
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,672
No, all except the first persen who, came.

505
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,575
Who came just when I was ready to leave

506
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,910
My husband said it was: one of his students.

507
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:20,579
I think he said the
person's mame was Hosoya

509
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,214
Okay!

510
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,817
Bring that persen called Hosoya who
is a student of Prefesser Hirota,

512
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:27,086
and was here tonight!

513
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:27,653
Yes, sir!

514
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:32,258
Do you know the names of
the other people who came here?

516
00:21:32,526 --> 00:21:33,392
I wonder...

517
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:37,864
1 have no idea, exeept fer Dr. Agasa who
called just before I was ready to leave...

519
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:41,868
Although, my husband did say
2-3 of his students were coming

521
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:47,607
Which means that we have no cheice but to
check on all of his students who were here...

523
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:50,877
Hey, blin ing on this phone here.

if we listen to this, right?

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,086

00:23:21,268 --> 00:23:23,169

576
00:23:24,805 --> 00:23:26,005
Oh. all right

577
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,509

589
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,433
his velee IS

590
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:57,570
odka...

591
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:05,978
Sigh... Now

592
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:08,381
H.Hey

593
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,449
hen this case involves
hese guys, after all

595
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:13,719
No he possibility of them having
donefanything have decreased...

597
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,889
If they had came here to get he floppy,

598
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,691
they wouldn't have done
something as stupid as to leave

600
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,860
their voices on tape at the scene of a crime.

601
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,097
It would be a cinch for them to pick up the floppy

602
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:26,799
without even creating such
a locked-in-room situation...

604
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,101
They left the message on
the answer phone so that,

606
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:32,204
in case Professer Hirota was heme,

607
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,073
it would ease-his suspicion of them,

608
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:36,843
and make it easier fer them
to carry out"their purpose.

610
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll bet they're all panie « now.

611
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,316
Because they can't come get the floppy.

612
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,485
If so, then they'll be here seen

613
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:47,320
Yeah...

614
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,957
we were right to move
your Velkswagen elsewhere.

616
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:55,261
They may be somewhere near here already.
