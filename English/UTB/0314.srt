Not a soul, as far as I can see, man

00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:52,404
Well, the guidebook says this place
IS quite popular among school girls

Those reporters are so
irresponsible and disgusting

Good morning. everybody

00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,981
There is a broken fence
at the scenic view point

00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,849
Please be careful

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,451

We took asrest just a while ago

62
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,415
Be nice guys.
We're not in a hurry

64
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,485
Like we said, it's too much for you,
old. man. wasn't it?

66
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,419
Thanks for nothing

67
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,489
I just worked too much lately
and worked myself out

69
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,957
Sure!

70
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:24,296
Well, Ran, let's leave the old man alone
and go. shall we?

72
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,164
A good idea

73
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,165
No you don't! Hey

74
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,706
Wow. What a beautiful sight

75
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,174
Yeah

76
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,112
He's the man we-saw down there

77
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,782
Right. What is he doing, there?

78
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,720
They said there's a broken fence
He-s probably working on it

80
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,588
You're right

81
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,391
Finally

82
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,993
Oh. Hi. Pops

83
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,728
You finally made it. dad

84
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:02,600
He...fell off. \

85
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,736
Darn it!

86
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,272
Conan!

87
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,675
Hey. Watch out!

88
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,410
What're you trying to-do, «q
You want to fall off the, cliff?>

90
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,076
But...

91
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,579
Go down to the office
and tell them about this, Ran

93
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,280
Yes, dad

94
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,153
Is anyone there?

95
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,689
What's the. matter?

96
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,824
A man fell down the cliff

97
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,360
What!? Could it be Hirai?

98
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,629
Could be

99
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,932
Anyway, how do we get
below the view point...

101
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,167
This... this way

102
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,703
Ran, call an ambulance:and the police

103
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,037
Sure.-dads

104
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,179
No good. He's already dead

105
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,915
Hirai! Hii-ra-ii!

106
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,786
It's all my fault. My fault...

107
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,055
What do you mean, may I ask?

108
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,124
I asked him...

109
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,462
I asked him to fix the broken fence
at the view point

111
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,698
I should have gone
I should have gone and done it myself...

113
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,701
then this wouldn't have happened...

114
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,310
Huh

115
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:27,886
Why is it?

116
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,788
The two ropes that
were. left here are twisted

118
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,658
as if they had been tied to O
something for a long time

121
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,600
Da-a-ad

122
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,338
The police and ambulance will
be here soon, they say

124
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,672
Good

125
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,475
Anyway. this seems to be an accident

126
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,344
Let's leave everything here as is,

127
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,879
go back to the office
and wait for the police to come

130
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,016
Conan. We are going back to the office

131
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,085
Yeah

132
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,963
What's this?

133
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,035
This...

134
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,904
is a spider's web and threads

135
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,440
Why on earth is it here?

136
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,977
And when did he get it?

137
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,351
Lo TIN,
Just as I thought.

140
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,340
There was no spider's
web around here and

142
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,759
At the place where Mr. Hirai fell,

143
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,361
there are no traces of slip
marks made by his boots.

145
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,731
It's as if he had jumped] off the cliff:

146
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,503
Another thing puzzles me.

147
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,672
The ropes that were left beside the body

148
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,107
were twisted at both ends as
if they had been tied to something.

150
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:02,948
If the rope was tied, then why
Mr. Hirai fall to the ground?

152
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,017
And the way the ropes are twisted.

153
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,905
Are as if they have been tied
in a knot for many hours...

155
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:15,160
Why did Mr Hirai use that
kind of rope?

157
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,335
It's just a hare.

158
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:27,739
A animal trail?

159
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,116
Conan is still out somewhere. Dad.

160
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,587
Don't bother.
He is playing around somewhere nearby.

162
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,588
But...

163
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,157
Well. I'll go look for him.

164
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,728
There could've been an
accident or something...

166
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,062
But um...

167
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:54,032
Please stay here and
wait for the police.

169
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,002
Don't worry.
I'll be back with him soon.

171
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,537
Thank you.

172
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,541
He's a nice person.

173
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,707
Oh. dad!

174
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,320
This tree was...

175
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,757
the one that is sticking out
from beneath the view point.

177
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,529
What's that?

178
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,036
A piton and a ring.

179
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,122
It's a mountain
climber's spike and a snap ring.

181
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,642
Something strange is going.on.

182
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,683
Why. they're white-eyes.

183
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:48,385
What's that?

184
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,956
Darn!
I can't see clearly.

187
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,359
What're these?

188
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:59,164
Traces of spikes.
They're still new.

191
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,542
A rope can leave traces of
scratch marks lik) this .

194
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,812
I see what it is.

196
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,513
Hey. Conan!

197
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,551
What are you doing up there?
It's not safe up there.

199
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:22,721
I was looking at the
nest of white eyes

201
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,688
Oh. you were.

202
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,759
The white-eyes are protected birds
do you better leave them alone.

205
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
Yes, Sir.

207
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,029
You'd better come down right away.

209
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,664
I will, ric ht now.

210
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,303
They are worried about
you at the office.

212
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,838
Say. Mr. Kondou.

213
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,742
Your boots look very old, how come?

214
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,510
Oh. you mean these?

215
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,813
I got these when I was in college.

216
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,250
These are so comfortable so I don't
ant to change them for new ones.

218
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,387
The only thing is that they re heavy.

219
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,826
Now I see it. Just as I thought.
This is a murder case.

223
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,803
Mr. Kondou pushed Mr. Hirai to and
made it look as if he fell off by accident.

225
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,606
He used these tricks

227
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:30,271
Since there are
eyewitnesses to this incident,

229
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:34,642
we can assume, as Mr. Mouri says,
that this is an accident.

231
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:35,409
Yes. officer.

232
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:40,981
But if people keep
falling off by accident,

234
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:45,587
you could be held responsible for the
safety of the park, "Mr. Kondou.

236
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,522
I apologize

238
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:49,891
What are you. talking
about, may I ask?

240
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,594
Well- About a month ago.

241
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:56,231
Another worker of this office had an
accident: She: fell off the cliff and died.

243
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,832
Oh, she did.

244
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,872
Excuse us.

245
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,409
We want to move and carry
the body out, if you don't find.

247
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:11,446
Sure, guys.
Well, everybody,

249
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:14,449
We need to draw up a report
at the police station.

251
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,683
SO please come with us to the station.

252
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:18,052
Yes, officer

253
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,898
Wait a while. everybody.

254
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,199
Dad?

256
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:33,401
What's the matter, Mr. Mourn?

257
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:38,239
There is some doubt about
Mr. Hirai's death being an accident.

259
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,241
What's that, Mr. Mourn?

260
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:46,548
Ran, when the man fell off the cliff,
did you see his face?

262
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,183
Uh. No. I didn't. dad.

263
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:54,755
You didn't. Conan says
he didn't either And I didn't either.

265
00:12:55,724 --> 00:13:01,896
That is. the manithatsfelljoffiimay
not have been Mr. Hirai.

267
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:09,504
But if he was not Mr. Hira,
where did he disappear to?

269
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,707
Mr. Kondou,
you probably know that there

271
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:17,946
IS a tree sticking out just
below the view point.

273
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:19,880
Is that right?

274
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:25,153
Yes, there is a tree but
it's not a large one and

276
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:27,322
I don't think it can hold
a falling man by any chance.

278
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:32,393
True. It's unlikely that the man got
stuck to the tree by chance.

280
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,263
That is, if that someone actually fell off.

281
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,465
What do you mean)by that?

282
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,638
The man at the view point did not fall off,
he jumped off deliberately,

284
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,609
so he could make the
people who witnessed the fall,

286
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,645
think that they saw
Mr. Hirai fall to his death

288
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,715
So, this is a homicide

289
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:59,553
Right. This is not an accident,
but a case of murder.

291
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:10,632
Then. whe on earth is the culprit?

292
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:14,269
The culprit is the person who knew that

293
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,171
Mr Hirai was expected to
go repair the fence.

295
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:22,877
He.is also someone who could prepare
the: same clothing that Mr. Hirai wore

297
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:24,779
In other words

298
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,481
It's

299
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:30,585
none other than you, Mr. Kondou.

300
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:38,326
Then it's like this, you say. Mr. Kondou
pushed Mr. Hirai off the cliff.

302
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:43,965
Then waited for Mr. Mouri
and the others to arrive,

304
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,867
which after he jumped
down on to the tree.

306
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:50,772
No. that way the time that
Mr. Kondou jumped off

308
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:54,409
would be different from
the time Mr. Hirai fell off.

310
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:59,180
Since we came up here as tourists.

311
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,350
We were approached
the view point completely

313
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,452
irrelevant of what
Mr. Kondou had in mind

315
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,190
That is. we could've arrived five
minutes after Mr. Kondou pushed

317
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:14,712
Mr. Hirai over the cliff,
or it could've been an hour later.

319
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,684
Then, how on earth
was he able to do that?

321
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,520
The tree.

322
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,421
The tree?

323
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:23,888
The tree?

324
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:31,062
Yes: Mr. Kondou jumped onto the tree,
where Mr. Hirai was already was.

326
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:36,901
Mr: Kondou jumped down onto the tree
1, and pushed Mr. Hiraa off the tree.

328
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:38,903
That explains it.

329
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,241
That way, there would be practically
no time difference what so ever,

331
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:47,211
But how could he dare
do something like

333
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,982
risk his life jumping off
the view point like that

335
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,016
Well.

336
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,320
I wouldn't say it was such a great risk.

337
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:01,826
Conan found a mountain climber's spike
with a snap ring driven into the rock

339
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:06,531
above the tree, just below the
edge of the cliff at the view point.

341
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,336
Probably, early this morning
or last night,

343
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:15,556
Mr. Kondou prepared two ropes
and tied them to the snap ring

345
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,409
He put one of the ropes through the tree

346
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,012
below and fastened the rope in place,

347
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:26,584
then he wound the other rope to the
pole of the fence and tied it in place.

349
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:32,991
When he saw us coming to the park,
he chose us to be witnesses.

351
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,793
And told Mr Hirai to go
repair the fence.

353
00:16:37,046 --> 00:16:40,264
Mr. Kondou saw us go. and then,

354
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:45,570
he ran into the path in
the back of the, office to short cut us.

356
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:50,842
The climbers' path to the view
point is the long way around

358
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,644
so it wouldn't have been
difficult for him to get there

360
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,781
there before us if he ran
straight through the mountain

362
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,586
Then he ambushed
Mr. Hirai. knocked him out.

364
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,055
And put him on the tree
beneath the view point.

366
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,625
He waited for us to arrive. then took
the rope that he had tied onto the fence,

368
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:13,498
tied it around his body as
his lifeline. and jumped off.

370
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,504
Mr. Kondou who was
suspended in air with the lifeline,

372
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,607
next took the rope that
was tied onto the tree,

374
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,377
untied the lifeline,
Iet go of it,

376
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,047
then climbed up the rope he was
holding and landed on the tree.

378
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:35,486
He then untied the rope as he previously
did with the other rope and let go of it.

380
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,654
In the end. he pushed
Mr Hirai off the tree

382
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,161
You're talking nonsense!

383
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:49,801
Everything is your imagination.
There's no proof

385
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,537
I knocked him out and
kept him on the tree, you say?

387
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,572
You're talking nonsense.

388
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,675
If you have any proof. show me!

389
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,777
The nest of the white-eyes...

390
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,615
You know that there's a nest of
white-eyes, don't you, Mr. Kondou?

392
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,416
Wha. what about it?

393
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,553
When the white-eyes make their nest,

394
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,957
they collect twigs and weeds
and bind them using spiders' webs

396
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,462
There was a web on the right
side of Mr. Hirai's body.

398
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,496
What!

399
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,267
I see a spider's web.

400
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,271
So. it's there, but what does
it have to do with me!

402
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,906
I said. show me proof that I did it!

403
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,310
There were traces of metal
spikes on the trunk of the tree,

405
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:36,280
Mr. Kondou.
The spikes of mountain climbing boots.

407
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,286
I've heard that because
of improved quality.

409
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,387
Mountain climbers' boots
nowadays have no metal spikes

411
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:47,791
since they are slip-proof
even without them

413
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:53,464
Mr. Kondou, you've been using your
boots since your college days,

415
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,999
Is that. right?

416
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,703
Are your boots spiked. Mr. Kondou?

417
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,950
Darn it!

418
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:23,161
That Hirai, he kept on picking
alpine plants and capturing

420
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,797
the protected animals to sell
them at premier prices

422
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:32,236
She. I mean the worker who died,
and I were after him

424
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,206
wanting evidence of what
he was doing.

426
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:41,512
And that evening. we
caught him in the act...

428
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:50,221
But, while I was struggling
with him, my arm, hit her and

430
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,342
She fell off the cliff.

431
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,418
Since then. Hirai has
been blackmailing-me

433
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,088
I couldn't put up with him any longer.

434
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:34,498
But. maybe this was all for the better...

435
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:42,940
I can finally amends for
what I did to her.
