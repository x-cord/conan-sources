Therefore. the bddy skeletonizes
In a very short time

But, he.senbovarybody
the invitation card. didn't he . ?

385
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,004
It could be the man called Kono

386
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,039
What?!

387
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,492
A ring and a cigarette case
Is under the rock.

389
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,245
The letters carved on the ring are

390
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,614
ETSUKO to ASAO...

391
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,418
It's most hikoly that
Mr Kono left these hore,

393
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,970
before the killer camegback down here,
after pushing him off'the cliff

395
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,858
Hoe loft these horo most probably
'S evidence that he wars killed

397
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,994
But, maybo tho killor Toft thom
herc¢ deliberately

399
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,730
If so. I think he'd leave it on Mr Kono's
finger after stripping him naked...

401
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,349
Why would a killer who
attempts to hide the identit

403
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,885
of his victim deliberately hide

405
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,570
something like that under a rock!

407
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,372
Will somebody
Iend mo a handkerchief . ?

411
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:54,906
Okay...

416
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,512
"Then. what's this cigarette box...?

417
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,447
If my deduction Is correct,

418
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,115
this is probably

419
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,990
y All there isin here are cigarettes!

420
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,057
Just as I thought

421
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:14,125
Huh

422
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,860
DJDonfltelfl me that .

423
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,995
Yeah

424
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,097
this Is what Mr. Kono left behind

425
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,349
Its .)dying message!!

426
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,217
Die!

427
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,302
% OYihg message?!

428
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,242
What about this cigarotto

429
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,696
It's very likely that
the man called Asao Kono

431
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:38,116
Ieft clues Aboukwho
the killer before he was killed

433
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:43,254
But, isn't it just that
2 cigarettes out of 6 arc torn?

436
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:44,856
Watch closely

437
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:45,590
Huh"

438
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:49,027
The two short cigarettes
have filters on them, don't they?

440
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,229
It goes to show that the cigar atte
were dolibarately torn short

442
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,498
and put into the cigarette box!

443
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,699
And besides. look

444
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,702
If you take a close look under the rock
where the cigarette box was hidden

446
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:01,755
it's »rett rotted
But the rest of the cigarettes and

449
00:14:01,756 --> 00:14:04,042
the cigarettes that ware lorn apart
then are disposed of! right?

451
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,911
In other words.
Mr. Kono who left this behind

453
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,714
wants {ys 00Ok a
only the 4 long cigarettes and

455
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,634
2 shor cigarettes

457
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,222
We've got to go back and tell
thefpbeople at the pension about this

460
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,156
Hold it. Doc!

464
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,093
Call the police first...

Tho guests at tho ponsion right now

because they received
Invitation cards from Mr. Kono!

473
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,438
If these bongs are reall, Mr Kono's

474

it's obvious that
someone el§é sent them, right?

done on the lower jaw central incisor...

556
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,864

OO. Oh no

566
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,031
Which means that Asao is.

568
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,699
Asao is...

569
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,652

Lot's hurry and call the police

572
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:25,108
B'.'But
the phone doesn't seem working right.

575
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,881
this phone only connected to
Nn electric cord and

577
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,983
doesn't have a module cable.

578
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,085
Aaaagh!

579
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,019
What?!

581
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:39,424
Strn mo,
I used this phone just a while ago

583
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,826
Do you have any other phones
Or a spare cable

585
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,961
This is the only phone and

586
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,230
I haven't bought any spare cables

587
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:47,498
Then,

588
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,033
we can't call the police.

589
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,301
You gotta be kidding!

590
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,037
I'm going home by car!

591
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,639
But. editor!

593
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:59,243
I don't think that's. possiblo oithor...

594
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,178
What?

595
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,579
I just went outside and checked

596
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,217
but It seems all the cars that
are parked here have flat tires...

599
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:10,338
Somabody probably loosened
the air valveand deflated the tires

601
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,024
So that no one could use the cars,

602
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,493
mm order to keep everyornd
confined here...

604
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:16,227
T.That's absurd...

605
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:16,993
T.That's absurd...

607
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,633
don't tell moe this has
something to do with the guy Keno?!

609
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,768
