00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:03,903
Even destiny serves
as a clue to deduction

3
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:05,571
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,642
Wis case takes place in Osaka.

00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,377

12
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,752
A party for a restaurant's opening?

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Yeah, that's right .

14
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,757
Actually, it was my mom
and dad that got invited,

16
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,493
but they both came down with a cold
and said they can't go,

18
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,229
so I thought I'd invite you guys...

19
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:12,598
I mean, after all,

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,703
three famous athletes from America
are opening a restaurant here in Japan,

22

40
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:50,536
What's the matter?

41
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,570
Did somebody come back?

42
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:55,007
If this is a bad time,
you want me to call you back later?

44
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,248

I'm mean there's so many
famous people here

71
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,391
and we weren't officially invited,
should we be here at all .

73
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,393
Don't worry about it!

74
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,296
Besides, your dad's a famous person too!

What do you mean

80
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,243
He was whispering to someone
on the telephone

82
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,811
and he said Are you alone now?

83
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,579
Are you sure no one's caught on?

84
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,814
and If this is a bad time, you want me
to call back later? things like that...

86
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,917
You don't mean...

87
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,120
I do, he's having an affair!

89
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,525
that Heiji. I'm sure he's been taken in
by some stranger.

91
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,295
Maybe he's told her to come here. I

92
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,732
that was me, he was talking
to me on the phone...

94

Yeah

139
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,492
And now I'd like to ask
these three men some questions!

141
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:05,129
Why did you decide to
open a restaurant in Japan?

143
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:16,208
The reason is. to the three of us,
Japan is our second home!

145
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,044
Wow, he speaks Japanese...

146
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,280
My wife,

147
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,115
as well as Mike's...

148
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:23,915
IS Japanese!

149
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:29,221
And as for Ricardo,
-- He's. crazy about ninjas and samurais!

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,159
By the way,

152
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,262
about the K in the restaurant's name,

153
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,030
I imagine it stands for king, doesn't;it?

154
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,765
No, no

155
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,000
you're mistaken

156
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,669
The first K stands for knock out.

157
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,638
It's the K from K.O.

158
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,308
The second K is for strike out.

159
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,509
K for strike out!

160
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,513
The third K is for goal keeper.

161
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,483
It's the K in keeper!

163
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:58,850

You know, right...?

169
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:11,196

famous athletes are involved in.

Uh huh...

204
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,346
I guess you should
be careful then huh, Heiji.

206
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:01,847
What do you mean by that?

207
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:02,748
Gee, I wonder

208
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,217

00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:46,885
You better give her a call later.

253
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,254
Yeah. .you don't have to tell me...

254
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,823
Isn't it strange though?

255
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:51,957
What do you mean?

256
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,359
The goal keeper usually wears number 1,

257
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,994
why is his number 87

258
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,431
Ray was originally a mid-fielder!

259
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,767
But during the Woinld Cup Series,

260
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:05,137
both goal keepers were thrown out of
the game and the team was in a bind,

262
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,272
so Ray had ngschoice
but to go in as a keeper...

264
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,177
He performed super saves
one after the other

266
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,979
and the team managed
to come in second place!

268
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,581
From then on,

269
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,683
even when he was a goal keeper
for a league in Spain in the Serie A,

271
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,519
he kept the number 8!

272
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:24,957
And he's continued wearing it even now
when he's in the Major League Soccer!

274
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,457
I see .

275
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,260
Then answer me this...

276
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,362
What about the number 99? 7

277
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,930
He's-a pitcher, isn't he?

278
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,566
Isnt that too big a number?

279
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,069
That stands for 99 miles.

280
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,705
In Japan, it's equivalent to 160 kilometers!

281
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:43,709
His goal was to pitch balls that fast,
that's why he wore the number 99!

283
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,377
And what about the number 47?

284
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,882
See, it's written on the boxing gloves
along with the signature!

286
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:55,587
That's because Ricardo always scored
a KO win in the 4th round.

288
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,024
So he added the 4
along with his signature

290
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,326
Ah. I didn't know that

291
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,928
You should've done your research
before you got here!

293
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,397
Well excuse me.

294
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,567
Telephone numbers interested me
more than uniform numbers...

296
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,635
What's wrong with you?
You keep mentioning that!

298
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,537
You figure it out!

299
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,171
Sorry to keep you waiting!

302
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,976
You,did this for some guy who's %
gallivanting who knows where...

304
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:21,046
That's my business, not yours.

305
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,281
Oh yes!

306
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,348
It's for you, Conan!

307
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:23,749
Jd on 4

308
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,351
It's a ticket for the special game.

309
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,354
Ray will be playing
in tomorrow at Nagai Stadium!

311
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,224
He gave it to me
just now but it's a secret!

313
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,191
You will go, won't you?

314
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,394
Of course I'll go!!

315
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,797
That was generous.

316
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,166
But I had to agree to their one condition.

317
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,234
Here, look at this...

318
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,169
A transceiver?

319
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,505
They said they want to surprise everyone!

320
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,178
Ray, it's okay I'm here!!

321
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,782
No, Ricardo, that's the wrong place

322
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,317
Left, to the left!

323
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,719
Oh, I get it now,

324
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,723
they're trying toiform the: letter K
bysturning 'on the lights

326
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,392
in the hotel roomstabove the restaurant
before the hotel opens!

328
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,262
When the guests
come out of the restaurant,

330
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,396
they re really going to be surprised!!

331
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,933
But they don't have to do it themselves...

332
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,303
They thought it up themselves,
that's why they want to do it on their own!

334
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,137
Uh huh.

335
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,042
If even one of them is seen outside,
it would cause quite a commotion,

337
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,579
that's why they wanted us to stand outside
and see if the letter is formed right!

339
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,650
Ran? Are the lights I'm supposed to
turn on all on already?

341
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:35,687
Oh, the end part of the last row
of the vis stillloff

343
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,457
Okay! I'm going right now!

344
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,628
Mike, open the curtains, open them.

345
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,229
Okay?

346
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,998
Okay!

347
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:47,399
Ricardo, you're good too!

348
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,266
Ricardo, you're good too!

349
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,568
Okay!

350
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,370
Ran. it is on?

351
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,803
Let's seed.

352
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:54,272
Yes, it's on!

353
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,108
All right!

354
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,545
The K is completed!

355
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,516
The window

356
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,485
And there were gunshots too

357
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,154
FAT?

358
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,622
ESL?

359
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,128
Hey¥fwait!

360
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,529
Kazuha! Tell those three
not to leave the rooms!

362
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,634
Hey! Wait up!

363
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:35,781
That's the room!

364
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:36,415
Yes!

365
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,390
This is the guy,
he's that reporter from the party!

367
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,060
He must've been shot with this gun!

368
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:48,827
Huh?

369
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,830
He's holding something in this left hand...

370
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,498
What the...

371
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,068
ab, belt?

372
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,110
The window

373
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,945
And there were gunshots too...

374
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,415
Hey, wait!

375
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,085
Kazuha! Tell those three
not to leave the rooms!

377
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:15,821
That's the room!

378
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,421
Yes!

379
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:25,330
This is the guy,
he's that reporter from the party!

381
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,233
He must've been shot with this gun!

382
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:28,767
Huh?

383
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,570
He's holding something in this left hand...

384
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,238
What the...

385
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,940
ab, belt?

386
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,781
The victim is an American
Iiving in Chicago

388
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,383
He's a reporter,
name Ed McKay, 48 years old.

390
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,887
He was shot in the chest
and died almost immediately.
Inspector Otaki
EAT OE

394
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:54,025
The weapon used was
a Smith & Wesson revolver.

396
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,661
There are signs of a slight struggle,

397
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,698
so he must have.been alive
for a short time after being shot...

399
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,436
Heiji. do you know
what time you heard the shot?

401
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,337
Sure...

402
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,139
I'm sure it was a little past 8:05 PM.

403
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,309
AKazuha and the rest of us
were outside the Ih otel when we heard itd

405
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,579
and we saw the window crack
so I'm pretty sure about it!

407
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,115
What do you Mean, outside the hotel...

408
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,784
where you ledOing the party so soon?

409
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,719
No, no!

410
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,954
Those threeftguys
asked us to do them a favor.

412
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,590
They asked us to check to see

413
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,959
if the lights in the hotel
formed the letter K

415
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,362
Iike they planned!

416
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,330
Those three?

417
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,033
Of course.
They own the K3 restaurant...

419
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:38,236
Ricardo Balera, former pro boxer,

420
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,705
major leaguer Mike Norwood,

421
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,742
and pro soccer player, Ray Curtis.

422
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,445
And by chance, were they the ones
who turned the lights on too?

424
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,381
Yeah, that's right!

425
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,250
Ra was in charge of 5,
the first and second rows,

427
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,187
Mike was in charge of 4,
the third and fourth rows

429
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:59,658
and Ricardo was in charge of the two
on the very top fifth row!

431
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,196
So that means its possible for
those three to have committed the murder.

433
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,731
It sure is possible.

434
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,968
Especially since it seems;
they all didn't like that reporter

436
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,937
But they couldn't have done it.

437
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:12,537
Huh?

438
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,640
This room is in the center
of the second row. isn't it?

440
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,277
When the shot was fired,
the three of them were in different rooms!

442
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,345
Isn't right, Ran?

443
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:20,745
Uh huh

444
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,282
Do you which.rooms:they were in?

445
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,420
I'm positive Mike was in the room
directly above this' one.

447
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,455
He opened the curtains
that were partially drawn.

449
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,957
Right after that,

450
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,360
Ricardo turned off the light
in the second room from the left

452
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,395
on the top floor
which he'd turned on by mistake...

454
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,730
and right after that,

455
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,066
Ray turned on the light in the room

456
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,168
on the right of the very bottom
which he'd forgotten to turn on...

458
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,871
Just when we thought
the letter K was complete,

460
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,673
we heard the gun shots
and the window shattered.

462
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,409
Did you see
the three of them at that time?

464
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,477
No}:

465
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,313
but only 5 seconds had past
since Mike opened the curtains

467
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,416
and Ray poked his head out the window.

468
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,620
And it was only about 3,seconds later
that we heard the gunshots.

470
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:02,888
And right after that,

471
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,458
all three of them looked outside
and asked what was going .on...

473
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,461
Then who is the Killer...

474
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,864
Mabe it was
one of the guests at the party?

476
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,099
What?!

477
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,003
Remember, when Heiji and I got here,

478
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,171
the place-was crowded
with people already!

480
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,643
I'm sure the killer was hiding
in one of the rooms close by

482
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,079
and got away
in the midst of the commotion!

484
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:33,018
But: if that's true 4
then all the party guestsfare suspects

486
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,086
and it's going to take a lot of time
of question all of them

488
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,154
Hey, what's this?

490
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,391
Look, look at this guy's left hand

491
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,192
He's holding on to something!

492
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,762
A belt?!

493
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:47,732
And look at this man's finger
on his right hands

495
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,036
His baby and ring fingers are bent!

496
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,506
Do you think he and the killer were playing
janken (paper. rock & scissors game)?

498
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,373
Conan!!

499
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,442
Hey Hell

500
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,843
are you thinking what I'm thinking?

501
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:02,047
Yeah...l think that as he was dying,

502
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,616
he tried to leave a clue through the belt
and the shape of his hand...

504
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,017
it's his dying message!!

505
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:10,722
But you don't know for sure that he was
indicating the belt is the clue, right?

507
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,691
He might have meant his pants,

508
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,961
he might have wanted to remove
his pants and show something!

510
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,896
Fool!

511
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,031
If he meant his pants, he'd put
his hand on the edge of his pants

513
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:24,402
if he meant to take his belt off, he'd have
put his fingers on the edge of belt, right?

515
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,372
I don't think any guy would clutch his belt
Iike that if he wanted to take it off...

517
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,208
All right then I'll take this as a hint
and keep it in mind

519
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,078
when I question all the guests who's been
waiting in the restaurant downstairs...

521
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,447
No...that won't be necessary!

522
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,548
Huh?

523
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,452
I've figured it out!
The Killer is one of thoseithree...

525
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,154
the belt... that 'sf right

526
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:47,559
only one who has fought bravely has
the honor of wearing it around his waist,

528
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,027
it proves he is a champion...

529
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:53,964
which means the killer is former middle
weight champion, Ricardo Baleral!

531
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,767
So what do the fingers mean?

533
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,404
If Ricardo always knocked out
his opponent in the fourth round,

535
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,439
shouldn't his fingers indicate four?

536
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,676
All right then it's Ray,
the pro soccer player!

538
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,645
He's played in 3 countries,
Italy, Spain and America,

540
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,382
and always led his team to victory...

541
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,185
Ray also played.in a premier league
in England and they became champions

543
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,320
Oh, I see...

544
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:15,754
Oh, I see...

546
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:16,887
no «ee

547
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:20,925
maybe it doesn't mean 3, maybe
it has something to do with baseball...

549
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,428
you know, when the pitcher
throws his pitch,

551
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,296
he holds the ball
with three fingers, doesn't he?

553
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,431
That's it!

554
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,601
The Killer is #
major leaguer Mike, it's settled!

556
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,202
«ou don't know anything about baseball!

557
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,972
Mike's team never won a championship

558
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:36,674
and even if they did you don't get
championship belts in baseball!

560
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,411
And that goes for soccer too!

561
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:40,712
Hmm.

562
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,848
The key to this case
is the fingers on his right hand

564
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,650
and the "white band"
gripped by his left hand

566
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:49,154
I guess we're going to
have to solve this puzzle first...

568
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:50,588
Band?

569
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:54,259
Oh? Don't some people
ireferto-a belt as a band?

571
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,761
The only people:who do are old fogeys...

572
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:01,299
Bands three band. .three...

573
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,233
Band three

574
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,335
bandthree!!

575
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:07,572
That's it, he meant
someone named Bandthreel!

577
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,506
All right!

578
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,944
Locate the guest named Bandthree
and:the-case will be solved!!

580
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,914
Hey. Hew

581
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,084
are ou that's the famous
Sleeping Kogoro™?

583
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,420
I know what you mean,
I think he's a little drunk tonight...

585
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:23,988
Well,

586
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,357
I guess we don't have a choice, let's
forget about the dying message for now...

588
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,527
Shall we start testing
everyone for powder burns?

590
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,462
I guess you're right,

591
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,565
we'll start with the guests waiting
INthe restaurant downstairs

593
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:37,702
And of course those three men
waiting in the room...

595
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,381
Okay, next...

596
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,952
Um, excuse me.

597
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:54,618
Yes?

598
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,188
Is your name Bandthree, by any chance?

599
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,790
No, it isnt!

600
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,558
Oh, pardon me...

601
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,998
Well? Did anybody
test positive, Inspector Otaki?

603
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,166
No, not yet...

604
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,969
How about those three?

605
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,839
We tested them first
but they all,came out negative...

607
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:16,541
Did you do a body check?

608
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,743
Yeah...we did a simple body check but..\

609
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,714
those managers they have

610
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,717
they've been giving us a hard time...

611
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,018
But never mind that

612
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,689
is«it true what Mr. Mouri said.
Did 'those three really hate that reporter?

614
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,992
Yeah, seems that way

615
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,262
Ricardo was suspected
of throwing a bout

617
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,230
and forced to retire
while he was unbeaten...

619
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,469
Ray was thrown out of the European,
Ieague on suspicions of drug use...

621
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,406
Mike got divorced
because he was having an affair

623
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,009
but he's married to a Japanese girl now

624
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,243
and they seem to
be getting along just fine.

626
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,713
And all of their problems were caused by

627
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,448
th murdered
reporter's unsubstantiated articles!

629
00:21:57,715 --> 00:21:58,916
But Hem,

630
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,286
how do you know
they were unsubstantiated?

632
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,389
They took him to court and won!

633
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,791
They proved they weren't
involved in the scandals.

635
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:09,093
,» &
I DUB...

637
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,631
That's why I don't think
they had any motive for killing him!

639
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,866
I think you're right

640
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,137
Come on, Kudo

641
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,772

642
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,211
you're acting kind of strange...
