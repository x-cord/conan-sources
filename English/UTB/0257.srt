1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,002
Even destiny serves
as a clue to deduction

3
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,771
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,640
Even if you put a lot of money
in the offertory-box,

7
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,141
your prayer won't be answered
if it's for no good

9
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,009
He sees through the one and only truth,

10
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,845
a child in appearance with the l1.Q.
of an adult,

12
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,147
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:58,684
At 2:05 AM.

15
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:01,887
In the middle of the night,

16
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,757
when everyone was fast asleep...

17
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,625
the earth shook violently.

19
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:14,834
LJ oS =

20
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,136
sect
«Pe 45

23
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,311
Yawn...

24
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,015
Iast night's earthquake was a big one...

25
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:30,850
Huh

26
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,853
WH. 'What in the world ?

27
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,357
Hey you,

28
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,225
are you all right?

29
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,059
Huh?

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,327
The bell...?

31
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,299
Last night's earthquake
must have caused the bell to fall

33
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,434
Nd hit him on the head.

34
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:49,635
Huh

35
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,172
Someone was trying to break into
the offertory box...

37
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:54,640
Ah hah!

38
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:56,976
It must have been this fellow...

39
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:07,153
Strange Punishment"

40
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,089
Someone tried to steal the offerings?!

41
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:10,890
Yes,

42
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,958
this morning at Teitan Shrine.

44
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,196
I bet he's really going to be punished.

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,097
Listen,

46
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,368
why don't we go and catch the guy!

47
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,004
I'm not finished,

48
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,439
the thief's already been caught...

49
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:26,972
Eh!?

50
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:29,642
What do you mean?

51
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,547
Aw shucks...

52
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,817
thenrhe was arrested
by the police, just likefthat .

54
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,454
So you should always-listen to
the whole story Genta.

56
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,990
I guess coincidences
Iike that do happen, huh...

58
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,862
The earthquake struck
while he was trying to steal the money.

60
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,299
Then the "garan garan fell on his head...

61
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,269
nd he got knocked out...

63
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,238
What's 1 s5gara Ygaran'?

64
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,639
Good grief Conan,

65
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,242
that's what they call the shrine bell
didn't you know that?

67
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,344
Don't tell me you didn't even know that.

68
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,247
I don't knowaanybody who says that...

69
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,053
Heaven certainly punished him,
that's why you shouldn't do bad things.

71
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,126
He certainly was an unlucky; thief,
wasn't he?

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,361
Yeah, what a loser

74
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,028
Hey. Conan...

75
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,432
Conan?

76
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,871
Why do you think thief chose
this small shrine?

78
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:32,671
Huh?

79
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,273
What do you mean?

80
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,708
Just look at this place...

81
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,480
hat am I going do...
there's no money for the repairs...

83
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:45,618
Even if he managed to get
the offertory box open,

85
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:49,088
it doesn'tylook like there'd be
much inside, does it?

87
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,689
I see what you mean...

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,626
I'd understand him trying to rob
Beika Shrine,

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,262
a lot more people go to pray there.

91
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,564
Maybe he didn't know
about Beika Shrine.

93
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,799
That's right,

94
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,569
I bet he's from some place far away!

95
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,171
Let's forget about it.

96
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,841
There might be other cases to solve
because of the earthquake!

98
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,775
You're right,

99
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,810
there might be other people
who need our help!

101
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,013
Then we)shouldn't let them down!

102
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,213
Alright)'-

103
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,050

105
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,585

Wh, what was that?!

107
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:31,597
A scream?

108
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:33,799
Ta, Takeo?!

109
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,700

110
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,268
Talk to me Takeo!

111
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,102

112
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,240
Takeoisdon't die!

114
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,743
WEG IR

115
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,412
Takeo!!

116
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,514
Genta, call an ambulance!

117
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,215
Okay!

118
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,818
Hang on, Takeo.

119
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:53,953
Takeo!

120
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,422
I see.

121
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,325
SO you two are getting married
next month.

123
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:00,793
Yes,

124
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,196
he and I were supposed to go to
our "nakodo's' home today ™

126
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,699
but he didn't arrive
when he said he would

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,369
and I tried calling him several time
but there was no answer, that's wh

130
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,772
So you came here
because you were worried...

132
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,473
Yes,

133
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,909
when I got here. he was on the floor

134
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,177
and I was so scared.

135
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,479
How is your head?

136
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,713
Luckily

137
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,549
I suffered jus Va Minor concussion

138
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,484
and the x-rays show no brain damage.

139
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,986
I see...

140
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:28,653
Then

141
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,223
I'd like to get all the details
Mr. Takenaka.

143
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,925
Please tell me about the attack.

144
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,993
Of course.

145
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,362
I had a meetinghto attend last night

146
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,664
so I got back late, lit was about 2:30 A.M.

147
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,667
after the earthquake.

148
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,872
Oh brother...

149
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,641
what a mess...

150
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,776
That earthquake sure shook things up

151
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,244
this is terrible.

152
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,182
Hey. who're you!!

153
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:58,917
Stop!!

154
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,186
You're not getting away!

155
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,221
Argh!

156
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:03,355
Ugh It

157
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,494
Ugh oh...

158
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,829
Oh no.

159
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,698
This can't be happening. is he dead...

160
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,133
I don't believe this!

161
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,636
C..come back here...

163
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:26,578
you're the saying he ran away
because he thought he killed you?,

165
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:27,980
Probably...

166
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,683
but I was only knocked unconscious.

167
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,919
What a panicky fellow.

168
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,555
That's the second loser today.

169
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,589
You're so right.

170
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,092
And was there anything stolen?

171
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,696
The 200,000 en
I had in the chest was taken

173
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,331
All he took was the cash?

174
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,231
Yes.

175
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,001
This is going to be difficult...

176
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,603
cash is hard to trace...

177
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,005
Excuse me

178
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,240
does that mean heswon't be caught?

181
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,877
Dont worry. You can rest at ease!

182
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,413
If we find his fingerprints,
he's as good as caught!

184
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,116
He was wearing gloves...

186
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,023
I guess

187
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,125
I'll stant questioning the neighbors first...

188
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,730
Hello Mr. Takag:.

189
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,165
SO it's you, Otani,
what're you doing here?

191
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,167
We're going over the crime scene.

192
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,002
At Teitan Shrine over there.

193
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,070
Oh yes,

194
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,071
I heard about that's

195
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,272
Offertory thief, eh

196
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:27,806
Rokusuke Urasawa

197
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,241
Rokusuke Urasawa
If Il\ I\TIU \UUI

200
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,245
that's the stupid thief.

201
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,447
He does look stupid.

202
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,250
You shouldn't say such things,
it's not nice.

204
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:43,455
His name's Urasawa, he lives
on 4th chome just down the street.

206
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,623
4th chome?

207
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,726
He's a real coward
but he just won't stop stealing.

209
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,730
He's been arrested twice
before for breaking and entering.

211
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,366
I guess we've both got
unpleasant work to do

213
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,735
I'm working on a burglary

215
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:58,637
Huh?

216
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,838
Is something wrong?

217
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,341
Oh, uh...no...

219
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,081
seeings as they've got Tékagu
from the head office on the case.

221
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,483
I'm sure you'll get it
wrapped up in no time.

223
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,488
Well. I've got to be going.

224
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,424
I'll see you later.

225
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,495
I hope he's right...

226
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,229
Huh?!

227
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,099
Uh, yes,

228
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,135
well I'd better go look for witnesses!

229
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,409
I'd really like to help
Detective Takagi solve the case.

231
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:42,781
Especially since I heard he messed up
Iast time and was punished

233
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,716
Don't worry,

234
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,286
this case is simple, there's no trick to it

235
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,687
isn't that right...

236
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,355
Conan...

237
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,490
Conan?

238
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,560
What are you doing Conan!

239
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,296
I knew it, something's fishy.

241
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,265
What's fishy?

242
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,302
That offertory thief Urasawa...

243
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,437
take a good look at this map.

244
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:09,608
4th chome is right next to Beika Shrine.

245
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,946
He lives sO close and yet he chose
to rob Teitan Shrine

247
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,181
which farther away and not as popular

248
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,582
it's just not logical, is it?

249
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,619
Who cares about that.

250
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,089
He got punished by heaven for
trying to steal from that old shrine,

252
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,356
so what's the big deal

253
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,725
Punished by heaven?

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,961
1jhe~'garanrgaran'.

256
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,231
ey usSua yeon a you now,
even in arrearthquake

258
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,600
I wonder...

260
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,369
if you think about it that way.

261
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,005
Then that'll be reason
enough to choose that place.

263
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,041
And if that is the case...

264
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,010
Where're you going?!

265
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,214
It should be here...

266
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,117
If my theony is right.

267
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,654
It should be somewhere
between there and Tieitan«Shrine!!

269
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,597
What's the matter Conan.

270
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,366
Why dosyou run off like
that all of a sudden?

272
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,033
If found it!

274
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,235
Conan!

275
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,303
Is that what I think it is. 7?

276
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,505
Yes.

277
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:14,505
Probably.

278
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,575
I'm pretty sure.

279
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,177
They belong.to. whoever: attacked
Mr Takenaka.

281
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,647
Good work Conan! Bravo!

282
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:24,316
We've got to let
Detective Takagi know right away!

284
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,484
Yes, let's go!

285
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,423
But the money's not here...

286
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,126
and I doubt he has it on him...

287
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,095
See.

288
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,797
Its in there!

289
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,802
Come on-sir hurry, please...

290
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,038
I was going to put some money in

291
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,907
but I threw my favorite badge
in by mistake!

293
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,776
All right. I understand...

294
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,411
I'll get it open soon.

295
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,183
Oh my!!! v

296
00:11:58,418 --> 00:11:59,751
Wh. what in the world?!

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,753
There it is!

298
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,356
Thank you very much, sir.

299
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,859
Look at all that, aren't you luck sir!

300
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,230
Th. there's $6 much money in here...

301
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,633
this has never happened before...

302
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,344
What happened, Detective Takagi? *

303
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,346
Yes, there's no mistake about it.

304
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,916
That money was stolen
from Mr. Takenaka's home.

306
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,353
His fingerprints were on them.

307
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,221
I knew it.

308
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:40,826
And we also found fingerprints
from somebody very unexpected on them.

310
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,327
Who are you talking about?

311
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,029
Urasawa.

312
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,764
That offertory thief is.

313
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,301
So thattmeans he stole money!

314
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,969
What a bad guy.

315
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,572
Waittjust 2 minute, Genta!

316
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:54,072
Huh

317
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,476
Mr. Takenaka was attacked
at about 2:30, isn't that right?

319
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,344
Yes.

320
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,412
Huh?

321
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:03,481
But the earthquake was at 2-15, wasn't it?

322
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:04,449
That's right...

323
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,287
Then at 2:30, that man must have been
unconscious at the shrine by then.

325
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,489
That's right!

326
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,091
The=garan garan hit him on the head

327
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,360
and he should have been
unconscious by then!

329
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:16,561
That's right...

330
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:21,566
it's not possible for an unconscious
person to be breaking into another place...

332
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,836
I don't understand it at all...

333
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,116
I just can't figure it out...

334
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,520
I thought it was just a simple burglary...

335
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,489
Detective Takagu...

336
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,093
Detective Takagi, excuse me...

337
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,094
Huh?

338
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:52,664
Why don't you.ask
Inspector Megure to help you?

341
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,767
I think that would be best...

342
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,270
You...you've got to be kidding.

343
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,807
I can handle a case like this myself,
just you watch!

345
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,008
But...

346
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:04,876
What do you think, Conan?

347
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,244
Hey? Conan?

348
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,546
Conan?

349
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,118
Yes, Takagi here...

351
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:15,620
Inspector Megure!

352
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,423
Uh, well,

353
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,826
truth is, Inspector Megure...

354
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,861
I don't want to hear any feeble excuses!

355
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,865
Otani called me just now
and gave me all the details...

357
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,467
Listen Takag:...

358
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,103
This is where you show us
what you can do

360
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,071
don't lose your confidence!

361
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,207
But Inspector Megure

362
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,943
You're a top notch detective.

363
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,612
You're a top notch detective.

364
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,416
You just lack self-confidence, that's all

365
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,017
elf confidence...?

366
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,686
That 's/ right

367
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,587
Self confidence!

368
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,022
You) can solve this case. I Khow you can!

369
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,525
Jake pride in yourself Detective Trakagit!

370
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:54,793
Yes sir!

371
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,929
Good! I'll be waiting to:hear * *
the good news from you!!-«

373
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:58,830
Inspector Megure!!

374
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,398
Thank:you very much.sir!!

375
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,203
Hey what happened to Detective Takagi?

376
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,272
He's so happy all of a sudden.

377
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,542
He just got a call from Inspector Megure!

378
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,145
He told Detective Takagi to do his best.

379
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,012
You don't say...

380
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,548
Hey Detective Takagi, listen.

381
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,616
What is it?

382
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:23,054
Are you sure that guy Urasawa
got knocked unconscious at 2:15?

385
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,458
What are you talking about!

386
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,628
That's when the earthquake occurred,
right?

388
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,832
That's when the garan garan
fell and hit him on the head...

390
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,169
But nobody saw it happen, right?

391
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:39,671
You're right...

392
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,973
we've just got his word for it...

393
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:42,741
Ah hah!!

394
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,276
That's right...

395
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:45,577
Okay!

396
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,247
Let's find out what Urasawa was doing
at around the time of the attack!

399
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,952
was the one who attacked Mr. Trakenaka!

400
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,453
Okay!

401
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:00,258
Urasawa hated to work

402
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,458
Urasawa hated to work
Urasawa's apartment

404
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,960
Urasawa hated to work
Urasawa's-apartment
RADIX

407
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,863
and he was completely broke.

408
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,101
SO he decided to steal some money...

409
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:14,539
he walked around looking for
a place to break into...

411
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,710
And then.

412
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,514
He decided to break into
Mr. Takenaka's place...

414
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,851
I wonder why he chose
this house though...

416
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,520
there's so many other houses
around here.

418
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,155
Ho knows...

419
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,924
It was probably
because nobody was home.

421
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,826
But if it was in the middle of the night

423
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,096
iewouecnt NOW ile 1@ ousewasempy
or if everyone was asleep. would he?

425
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,598
Well, that's...

426
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,534
{ He probably just took a chance.

427
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:43,568
That's right,

428
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,837
who cares about that anyway.

429
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,739
0. it is important...

430
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,775
he must have had a reason...

431
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,711
He must have.

432
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,080
He's right

433
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,449
there's got to be a good reason for it...

434
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,251
I don't get it...

435
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:04,256
how did Urasawa know no one
was home in Mr. Takenaka's house...

437
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,958
Come on Detective Takagi. think...

438
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,228
Did something happen
in that house at that time...

440
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,933
no. that can't be right, no one was home,
nothing could have happened.

442
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,469
Wait a minute

443
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,703
That's it!

444
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,604
The earthquake!!

445
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:20,872
Huh

446
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:26,177
The earthquake occurred just when
Urasawa was passing by the house!

448
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,613
The strong earthquake occurred
in the middle of the night.

450
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,583
It would've woken éverybedy up.

451
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,251
They would have been scared
and turned on their lights.

453
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,622
But only Mr. Takenaka's home
remained dark...

455
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,961
And realizing no one was home,
he broke in...

457
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,832
But while he was looking for
things to steal,

459
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,268
Mr Takenaka came home...

460
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,003
Oh brother...

461
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,939
hat a mess...

462
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,707
did that earthquake do this...

463
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,776
Good grief...

464
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,345
Wh, who's there?!

465
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,247
Come back here!!

466
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,249
You're not getting away!

467
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,418
Aught!

468
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:11,456
U...uuuu...

469
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,560
1. I don't believe this...is he dead...

470
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,395
this can't be happening!

471
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,133
Urasawa thought he killed Mr. Takenaka,

472
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,935
he panicked and ran away.

473
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:30,175
He had to find a place to get rid of
the mask and gloves in aJhurry!

475
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,413
He sees the garbage collection area,

476
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:36,982
so he throws them away there.

477
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,517
So that they wouldn't be found.

478
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,520
Criminals are very nervous
at times like that, aren't they?

480
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,621
I'm-pretty sure they are.

481
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,191
He's actually a very timid man.

482
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,291
And although

483
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,529
he just made the wrong assumption,
thinking he committed murder...

485
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,498
He must have been in a panic.

486
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,601
He knew that the police
would get-high and low

488
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,303
for him now that the charge was murder,

489
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,772
and he didnrt have an alibi...

491
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:03,975
Alibi?

492
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,245
Alibi...

493
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,151
I'm pretty sure he would have thought...

494
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,853
if only I could come up with an alibi!

495
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,257
That's right!!

496
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:20,725
GS $ 10 BIN 8 sa3ft

498
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,594
That'sswhen Urasawa.found..it!

499
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,797
He saw the bell on the ground!!

500
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,336
And he decided to make himself
Iook like an offering thief,

502
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:32,670
he staged it.

503
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:35,906
What I'm trying to say is.

504
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,043
His goal wasn't to steal the money,

505
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:41,579
itfwas to get caught trying to stealing it.

506
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:46,084
That way he'd have an alibi
for the time Mr. Takenaka was killed!

508
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,719
I get it!

509
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,887
Detective Takagi. that was brilliant!

510
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,823
See. you can do it if you try!

511
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:57,562
But...

512
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,165
Why did he put the money
he worked so hard to steal,

514
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,232
inside the offertory box?

515
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,068
He didn't have a choice.

516
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,937
No one would believe
[he was an offertory thief

518
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,807
if he had 200.000 yen in his pocket.

519
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,041
Oh, I get it...

520
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,344
And besides. maybe...

521
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,019
I just killed somebody.

522
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,423
But I don't want to stay in prison
for who knows how long.

524
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,724
Please,

525
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,093
oh please God.

526
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,028
Please help me!!

527
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,964
Maybe he prayed to God for help.

528
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,233
Prayed to God-7?

529
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,069
It's possible!

530
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,472
She's right, he might have.

531
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:44,008
It just goes to prove
how: desperate he was.

533
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,644
And then he...

534
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,097
It went exactly like you said...

535
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,665
Detective Takagi!

536
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,334
What you're saying Urasawa

537
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:13,104
is that you tried to hide one crime
by committing another crime, is that it?

539
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,207
Other people would think
the same thing wouldn't they?

541
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,810
I mean it's much better to be arrested
for something small like minor theft

543
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:24,816
than to be arrested
for something big like murder...

545
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:25,983
don't you think...?

546
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,552
You idiot!!

547
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,353
Sorry.

548
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,954
Listen to me Urasawa...

549
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,025
There's no such thing
as a small crime or a big crime!

551
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,295
A crime is a crime and
the perpetrator shall always be punshed!!

553
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,297
Yes, you're right...

554
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,299
I'm sorry...

Hey Takagi!

599
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,630
Inspector Megure!

600
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:21,766
I hear you did a good job
solving the case.

602
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,101
Inspector Megure!

603
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,303
I've gained a lot of confidence
from this experience,

605
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,471
I know I can do my job well!!

606
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:27,739
I. I'm glad:to hear that...

607
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,807
I owe 1t}all to you,

608
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,410
you always encouraged me!!

609
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:33,645
Huh???

610
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,180
I'll be seeing you InspectoriMegure!

611
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,281
Excuse me!!!

612
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,290
What was that 4
Takagi talking about anyway,

614
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,424
I don't get it...

615
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,895
Don't be shy, you thoughtful boss you.

616
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,634
It's not bad.

617
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:00,637
Hey.

618
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,674
Do you think that guy forgot all about us

619
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:08,079
and went to go eat with his friend?

620
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:09,414
I don't believe it

621
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,582
No. I don't think he forgot.

623
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:13,985
Most likely...

624
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,689
he got himself mixed up in something...

626
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,089
VEG.

627
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:19,857
Look at this strap!!

628
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,291
Eh!?

629
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,761
Next case is...
