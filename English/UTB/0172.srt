00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:02,368
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,970
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,638
deductions take all shapes and styles
In each and every case to be solved.

00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,640
Sonoko makes an appearance
\@ after a.long absence today.

7
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,442
A man and crime at the skating rink.

8
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,509
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,246
A child in appearance with
the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,982
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene

Dying Message Revives" Part 1

15
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,836
There they are! Loads of them!

16
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:24,643
More and more of them!!
Loads and loads of them!!

18
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,313
Wow take a look at all of them!!

19
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:31,117
Look at all those choices of good looking
men. We've gotÂ«big catch.

21
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,852
Hey, Sonoko?

22
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:38,858
Sonoko!! What about Mr. Kyogoku?

23
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:46,866
Ell... Makoto is more like a scarred al
over the place samurai, than a prince.

25
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,936
Besides, he hasn't contacted me at all
after he's gone abroad too...

27
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,406
I've kind of lost my passion for him...

28
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,374
Oh, come on, talking like that again.

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,545
He's got a lot of girl fans who'll beat you
to a pulp if they hear you saying that...

31
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,815
Please don't put me in the
same boat you're on, will you?

33
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:03,682
What?!

34
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:09,221
You're the type who'll wait patiently forever
for your husband to return home, aren't you.

36
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,324
I, I'm not waiting for Shinichi!!

37
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,162
My, my, I never even said
a word about Shinichi, did I?

39
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,763
Now, you listen, Sonoko...

40
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,636
Besides, didn't you choose this rink
because it's a memorable placesa. .#

42
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,305
that you two used to always
come together to: right?

44
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,741
L'have no good memories!! s

45
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:32,945
Shinichi looked down on me because
I had a hard time learning how to skate.

48
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:34,947
Aha...

49
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:40,453
So, he taught you holding your
hands, feet and hips, right?

51
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,357
What's with you today, Sonoko?
Cut out teasing me.

53
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,630
Ah, so what I'm trying to say is, today
it's your turn to teach him how to skate!

55
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,533
Oh, no, don't bother...

56
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,069
Huh? What? Can he skate?

57
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,173
I wonder, because this is the
first time I've come skating with Conan.

59
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,242
Can you skate? Conan?!

60
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,581
Oh my God!

61
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,983
Maybe this is his first time?

62
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,125
Maybe I'll teach you.a lessonstoday
because you'retalwaysracting so'sassyl...

64
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,893
Cut it out, Sonoko...

65
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,828
Sonoko...

66
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:27,665
Out of my way!!

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,504
Out of my way move!!

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,209
Out of my way, move!!

Are you all right?!

Yasuharu, it hurts!

You're not going to be able
to attract the attention of men by

91
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,071
acting cute like that
for very long anymore!

after 30 years of age, you know...

101
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,715
How rude!! Why do you
always say things like that?

103
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,451
You annoy me.

104
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,588
Okay, that's enough you two. It's been a
Iong time since we've seen each other,

106
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:25,524
and, we're all Clay comrades,
aren't we? So let's not argue, okay!!

108
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:29,528
Wow, are you all Clay shooters?

109
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,696
What is that?

110
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,935
The game in which you throw a small
plate and shoot it down with a shot gun!!

112
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:42,074
We just went this afternoon
and finished a shooting!

114
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,810
A group is more fun than one after all...

115
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,447
We haven't seen each other
since that accident 6 month ago.

117
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,550
The accident 6 months ago?

118
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:57,223
Right! Will you hear me out, boy?
It's a sort of stupid and scary story...

120
00:05:58,858 --> 00:05:59,290
Huh?

121
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,062
Are you nuts?
Why tell a kid something like that?

123
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:04,997
Besides, I already told you that if you
talk about him, I'm leaving on the spot.

125

Besides, I already told you that if you
talk about him, I'm leaving on the spot.

134
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:12,403
Wow, what a handsome guy.

135
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,040
He's as much a samurai as you can get.

136
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,645
Hey! Oda, are you really going to leave?
Aren't we going to drink up?

138
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,448
I'm,just going to:take.a puff
somewhere nearby,

140
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,586
since some idiot made me recall
something unpleasant.

142
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,588
What's with him!!

143
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,024
Just because he's a bit handsome
it doesn't mean he can act like that.

145
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,594
But, it's your fault for bringing that out.

146
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,129
My tongue just happened to slip!

147
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:42,201
And he has the nerve to call me stupid,
don't you think?

149
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,903
I hate that guy!!

150
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,439
He's not cheerful, and has a foul mouth.

151
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,875
He's always not part of the group.

152
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,510
Not part of the group?

153
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,681
Hey, I've always been wondering about

154
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,816
Isn't it about time you explain things?

155
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,586
Huh? You mean you still don't know?

156
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:01,720
Uh...

157
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,823
I don't really understand either.

159
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,258
Same here.

160
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,961
Why isn't he part of the group?

161
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,398
Are you serious?
I don't believe it!

163
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:16,368
So, why don't you hurry up and tell us.
Talk about annoying!!

165
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,936
No way!!

166
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,873
You're the last person I'm going to tell!!

167
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,411
So there! ,
Since you guys are not curious and young,

169
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,880
I guess you'll never find out!

170
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,415
Where are you going?

171
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,250
To the ladies room!

172
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,388
If you can't figure it out till the time
I come back, I'll drop-you a hint.

174
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,191
She makes me so mad!!

175
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,896
And?
Curious lady of Suzuki Financial Group,

177
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,131
do you happen to know what it's about?

178
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,499
Beat me.

179
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,570
Don't you think this place is
getting crowded?

181
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,605
Probably because of the fireworks!

182
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,942
Oh, you mean the one that goes up
every night at 7:00?

184
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,312
Yep! This rink is a special place where

185
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,148
you can see the fireworks and

187
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,517
Oh, you're quite knowledgeable!

191
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,489
I'm not going to watch it like always.

192
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,224
I'll go get a cup of coffee nearby.

193
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,693
I've seen the fireworks many times.

194
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,496
Huh? You're not going to watch either?

195
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,331
I'm a bit hungry

196
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,468
I'll come back before the fireworks start,
so wait there for me.

198
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,840
Wait here? I've been waiting to go to
the restroom for a while now

200
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,541
You may go!

201
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,111
We'll be skating nearby
for a while yet so.

203
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,115
When your friends come all we have to
do is tell them to wait here, right?

205
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,082
Yes, I'm sorry to trouble you.

206
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,553
I'll be:right back,
so could you do.that for me...?

208
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,821
Sure!

209
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,594
Hey, hey...

210
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,829
It's already 6:55pm.

211
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,868
What oniearth are .you'doing?

212
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,071
The fireworks will start
If you don't hurry up!

214
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,976
They're all so late.

215
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:04,810
Uh-huh

216
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,546
Sorry, Ran,
I gotta go to the restroom too.

218
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,487
Oh no!!

219
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,657
You're late!

220
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:19,957
Huh?

221
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:32,738
To the restroom, restroom.

222
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,174
Huh? What's wrong?

223
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,675
Look at this!

It can't be...

231
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,385
Wait a sec...

232
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:52,124
What's the use of saying the accident
back then was my fault at this point.

234
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:56,962
Aha, ha...

235
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,797
besides,

236
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,332
no matter how much you hide
your face with that outfit, if you shoot me

238
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:07,372
people will hear you and gather here,
then you'll be:arrested right away.

240
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,707
Huh!

241
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:10,876
Don't tellfme that...

242
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,116
Uh, excuse me.

243
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,020
Are you going to take a while longer?

245
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,221
Are you going to take a while longer?

246
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,524
Are you going to take a while longer?

247
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,097
If it's not this toilet, I'll have
to change shoes.

249
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:34,600
Huh?

250
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,005
Oh, no...

251
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,207
Hey, the fireworks have started already!

252
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,909
Where? Where?

253
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,010
Oh, well...

254
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:48,814
Hmm?!

255
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,956
Huh?

256
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,796
Wow, how beautiful!.

257
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:06,064
Really,

258
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,067
the first ones are the most fantastic.

259
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,637
Huh? So, you came to watch after all?!

260
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:12,471
Yes...

261
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:16,074
I thought it'd be nice to watch fireworks
once in a great while.

263
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,278
I made it!!

264
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:22,414
I thought I wastgoing t $miss it...

265
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:23,448
\Hey!

266
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,051
Where are Chihiro and your friend?

267
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,287
Huh?
Didn't you see them at the restroom?

269
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,156
I wonder if I missed them?

270
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,791
They were.cleaning-the restroom,

271
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,662
so I changed shoes and went to a
different restroom.

273
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,432
Sonoko sure is late, though...

274
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,900
Kyaaaah...

278
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,140
Hey, that scream just now sounded like...

279
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,608
Sonoko?!

280
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,243
Hey!

281
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,082
Sonoko!

282
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,686
What's up?!

283
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,659
What's the matter, Sonoko?!

284
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,797
T...That...

285
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,001
Ah!!

286
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:23,542
,- 3000000

288
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:57,075
Dad!!

289
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,979
Huh?!

290
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,215
Dad! Get:up!

291
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,683
Dad!!

292
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:05,617
Hmm?

293
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,287
What is it, Ran?

294
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,923
I thought you wanted to
Ieave after watching the fireworks?

296
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,192
There's no time for that!!

297
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,361
There's been a murder!! Homicide!!

298
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,033
A person's been killed in the restroom
near the skating rink!!

300
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,200
Huh?

301
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,205
Someone slipped and fell in the
restroom near the skating rink?

303
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,545
Hmm?!

304
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:37,783
Just come!!

305
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,183
Hurry!!

306
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:53,832
Why was Chihiro killed?

307
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:55,734
Police is here!

308
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,437
Please let us through!!

309
00:13:58,905 --> 00:13:59,471
All right! All right!

310
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,641
Everyone except authorized
personnel move back!!

312
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,077
Whaaa!!

313
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,980
How ruthless...

314
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,515
Yes indeed...

315
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,653
There's nobody inside, is there?

316
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,890
No, when we got here
this boy was in here...

318
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,225
Hmm?

319
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,729
Conan?!

320
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,064
Which means? Don't tell me that...

321
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,801
Well, this is a coincidence,
Just a mere coincidence!

323
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,204
Please don't get angry,
Inspector Megure!

325
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,673
Ha, ha...
I don't have the energy to get angry.

327
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:35,640
Inspector!

328
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,444
It seems that this shotgun is the
murder weapon!

330
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,146
Right, okay,

331
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:45,250
check the registration number
of the gun and find the owner of the gun.

333
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:47,152
That gun is mine.

334
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,188
It's the shotgun I use for Clay shooting,

335
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:55,560
I left it in the electronic
Iock locker with everyone else's...

337
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,463
Everyone else's?

338
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,231
Yes,

339
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,235
the three behind you are members of
the Clay shooting.

341
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,773
Who locked the electronic locker?

342
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:09,908
Hmm...

343
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,677
Everybody knows the number to locker.-

344
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,646
When we all came here before,

345
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:20,519
we all decided on the number together.
T's"9017".

347
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,790
Well, checking you four,

348
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,326
for gun powder reaction,
we'll find out soon enough.

350
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,896
All four of us will definitely have reaction!

351
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,033
We all went Clay shooting this afternoon.

352
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:39,604
Besides, maybe the locker wasn't locked
as it should've been too.

354
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,809
If so, somebody other than us could've
taken the shotgun out of the locker and...

356
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,477
No, I don't think that's possible.

357
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,112
Have you forgotten?

358
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,182
It's our duty to make sure
that the case with the shotgun inside

360
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,618
doesn't look like something
that contains a gun.

362
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,788
Izumi's gun case is a plain leather case.

363
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,758
Moreover the shotgun is disassembled,

364
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,195
so it's not something
just anybody can handle.

366
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,497
I see

367
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,967
so it has to be someone who knows
that there is a shotgun inside the case

369
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,403
Moreover, it has to be one who can
assemble the gun...

371
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:15,507
Which means that the most likely
suspect would still be among you four.

373
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,811
Oh well,

374
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,282
go and check immediately to see if
there were any suspicious person

376
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,586
near the toilet around the time
was committed!

378
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:28,386
Yes, sir!

379
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,021
Uh...

380
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,191
I saw someone...

381
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,025
What?!

382
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:34,726
What?

383
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,896
The killer come out of this restroom...

384
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,965
Are you sure, Sonoko?

385
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:40,732
Uh-huh...

386
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:46,671
A sign that read "Cleaning" was hung on
the door of the restroom

388
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,840
There was no answer when I knocked
SO...

390
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,109
I was waiting in front of the door...

391
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,745
Then the fireworks started

392
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,747
I pulled away from the door,

393
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,383
I tried to look at the fireworks from a
window nearby.

395
00:16:58,718 --> 00:16:59,985
It was at that moment!

396
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,255
A strange person wearing a long coat

397
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,891
came out of the toilet!!

398
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,728
Did you see the face of that person?

399
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:10,729
No...

400
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,031
the face was covered with the hood
and a scarf...

402
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,368
If the killer shot the gun and muffled
it with the sound of fireworks and

404
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,504
wore a long coat as disguise
when fleeing,

406
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,673
be planned murder!!

407
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:28,380
Please come to another room so that
I.can separately ask you questions.

409
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:32,784
Then we can figure out who suggested
to come to this amusement park.

411
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,486
Hey, just a minute!

412
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,954
We all decided
togethento come here!

414
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:40,759
Well, you can talk more about
it during questioning...

416
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,961
No, that's not necessary!

417
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:43,328
What"?!

418
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,832
It hit upon me the minute
I came to the scene.

420
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,536
But, Sonoko's remark just now
verified my feelings.

422
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,106
The one who shot
Ms. Itami to death is...

424
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,310
Ms. Sano

425
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:58,610
What!

426
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,545
You.

427
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,381
Don't be ridiculous!

428
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:04,849
Why me?

429
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,687
There are three factors
why you areithe killer

431
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,991
First, is this restroom which is the
scene of the crime...

433
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,027
You got the people to move away using
the "Cleaning" sign.

435
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,363
Then you kept the victim inside.
In other words, you promised

437
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,564
to meet her here...

438
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,099
That:is,

439
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,867
the killer is a woman!!

440
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,134
@@eoecer

441
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:23,401
t@voooe

443
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:24,970
'tecpser

444
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,239
Second is your relationship
with the victim.

446
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,443
You both just couldn't get along with
each other,

448
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,979
isn't that right?

449
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,348
What're you talking about?

450
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,250
Are you going to
set me up as the killer just like that?

452
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,453
Lastly, the most conclusive evidence is

453
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,724
the trace of blood on the wall beside
the face of the victim.

455
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:46,825
Trace of blood?

456
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:51,762
To you, it like the trace of blood that
was made when the victim struggled...

458
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,699
But, it was clearly legible to my eyes.

459
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,069
Left behind before she ceased
to breathe.

461
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,171
Her dying message!!

462
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,876
The "SS" of the name Sano!!!

463
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:09,447
I asked you for your name before the
Inspector got here, didn't 1?

465
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:15,253
The only one who
has the letter "SS" in the name is you!!!

467
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,421
Is that not right?

468
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:17,589
I don't think so!!

469
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,558
Hmm? Huh?!

470
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,495
I think you can tell just by looking,

471
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:27,132
the victim has been shot in the chest
and has died on the spot.

474
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,199
Therefore,

475
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,602
it would've been impossible for
her to write a message on the wall

477
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,904
fter she was shot...

478
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,274
I guess you're right...

479
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,308
Besides,

480
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,179
If one says that a woman had relayed
a message telling him to wait here,

482
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,548
the person could've been a man.

483
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,919
Then, the letter "SS" is.

484
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,387
Yes,

485
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:55,727
someone left it there to set
Ms. Sano up as the killer!

487
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,262
Besides, the shotgun that was used as

488
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,065
the murder weapon was also hers.

489
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,333
But, doesn't something bother you?

490
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:06,971
Sonoko knocked the door just before the
murder was committed, didn't she?

492
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,876
If the killer had the gun pointed at the
victim while before fireworks went up,

494
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,447
why didn't she shout and call for help?

495
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:20,118
The killer was probably hiding
In the toilet next door,

497
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,020
until just before the fireworks went up

498
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,124
Something sticky is on it.

499
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,160
See, at the tip of the gun.

500
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,329
T,This is saliva!!

501
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:36,801
I get it! The killer had the gun
the victim's mouth for a while until the

503
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,903
fireworks went up!!

504
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,640
And simultaneous to the fireworks going
up the gun was moved to her chest...

506
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:43,741
If so,

507
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,412
then we three are not the killer!

508
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,916
Because we were with her at the skating
rink before the fireworks went up.

510
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,886
Isn't that right, Ran?

511
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,154
Uh, yes...

512
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,556
Were they really with you from the start?

513
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,827
It doesn't take 30 seconds from here
IS restroom to the rink...

515
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:07,599
But, all three of them were here when the
fireworks went up the first time.

517
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,669
It was no more than 10 seconds between
the first fireworks and the second...

519
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,806
And,where were you then?

520
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,242
I was by the bench near the rink,

521
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,111
with my back turned against the
fireworks and smoking.

523
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,548
He's the only one without an alibi.

524
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,850
But, we still have no proof.

525
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,987
We don't know his relationship
with the victim yet, either.

527
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,624
But, it's easy to tell that
she doesn't like being cold.

530
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,596
She's about to be shot, and yet she
has her hand in her pocket!

532
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,666
A cellular phone?

533
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,335
Here is nothing on the display.

534
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,338
Maybe she was shot
before dialing 911...

536
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,207
Why don't you try re-dialing?

537
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,178
Then, maybe you can find out
where she called last?

539
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,379
Yeah...

540
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,781
Iet's give it a try...

541
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,084
'Huh?!

543
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,893
Eight "#sin the telephone number row...

544
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:15,767
She probably tried to search her way
through the numbers and failed.

546
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,435
KIX?

547
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,006
K-1-X.

548
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,541
Wait a sec.

549
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:28,680
I remember this from somewhere...

Wasn't that:supposed be an accident...?

595
