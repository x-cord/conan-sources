00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:31,400
It all startec with a nightmare that the

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,935
A.A nightmare...

It's a curse...I'm going to be killed...

His eye became sunken and
his hair turned completely white.

63
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:15,477
It can also be considered a mere accident.

64
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,479
In what way IS an evil spirit involved?

And, when did you get this card...?

123
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:46,475
Around a We alter New Years Day
Iast year. It was in the mailbox...

125
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,145
At first. we thought it was just a prank,

126
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:55,183
hut whon I showod it to tho master
his wife was also very surprised

128
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,685
His wife was also surprised

129
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:57,552
Yes...

130
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:02,557
Then six months later,
the dish cabinet suddenly toppled over...

132
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:07,062
Furthermore, in April this year a queer
sound was heard from inside the house

134
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,931
where only the master and
his wife were supposed to be...

136
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:12,901
Uh... Was there something in common about
the days when strange things happened?

138
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,737
Maybe like things always happened on
Friday the w13th or something like that...

140
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,911
\...no.the days were at random
but the date was always on the 4th...

142
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:27,049
Then, maybe something happened
on the 4th previously?

144
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,219
But. no one has an idea.

145
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,725
U.Uh today is Oct. the 3rd,
so tomorrow is the problem date. the 4th...

147
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:39,927
Oh. that's true...

148
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:46,301
Uh. It seems that stranggathings
happened 5 times so far...

150
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:49,004
Do you remember what
year and what month it was?

152
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,707
Oh. no... don't...

153
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:53,175
I do!

154
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,229
Uh at first...

156
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,778
Uh at first...

157
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:58,313
Uh at first...

158
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:02,417
2 ears ago on Fob
4th the master had a nightmare...

160
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:05,487
Then, he got into an accident I
n the same year on July 4th #

162
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:09,458
A ear ago. on Feb. 4th
a strange card was found in the mailbox

164
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,161
ind on July 4th the same year
the dish cabinet fell...

166
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:17,199
On April 4th this year, a strange sound
was heard from inside the house...

169
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,936
You've taken notes of everything!

170
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:25,007
Yes...l have to write things down
because I'm sorforgetful

172
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:26,508
He's just like you. Conan.

173
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,943
Y.Yep.

174
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,953
Maybemthe sender of this card is
up to something.

176
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:41,623
By the way,
don't you sense anything about this card...?

178
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:44,826
Huh? Sense something?
You mean like something spiritual...?

180
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:50,599
Well, you know...
Oh, well if you don't sense anything...

182
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:56,838
Hey. hey! I heard differently!

183
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,341
I thought
we were going to have just one guest?

185
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:04,713
My daughter insisted on coming so.

186
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:05,713
I'm sorry...

187
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:06,281
R rr 7

00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,284
No. I'm not angry at you people!

190
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,621
I'm angry at this old man here *:
who didn't bother to contact me!

192
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,857
Old man... Namika...

193
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:16,091
Old man... Namika...

194
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,493
I've got to go and shop for more stuff then...

195
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:21,696
You sure have a perky daughter

196
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:24,266
No...she's the chef...

197
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,500
Chef. . 71

198
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:30,572
Her father used to be the
chef for the Kunitomo family.

200
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:34,276
But. he died of an accident.
And she succeeded him!...

202
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:37,145
Oh... she's still so young...

203
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:41,650
Come to think of it,
he also took after his father.

205
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,085
Hat's right, Mr. Watablki!

206
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:47,923
The master will be going to the
University Hospital at 20:00 tonight...

Huh?

258
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:28,690

Oh. that's.

268
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:57,786
The door that a friend of Mrs. Kunitomo
installed after they received that weird card

270
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,539
It's quite some door.

271
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,590
Oh...?

272
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:07,562

285
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,259
T's just like some science fiction movie

286
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,594
It's not science fiction at all.

287
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:40,462
Hmm?

288
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:40,695
Hmm?

289
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:41,830
Huh?

290
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:47,902
There are condos equipped with
fingerprint recognition machines nowadays

293
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:51,306
Although. it's not that all widespread'yet...

294
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:55,877
Right... This is Mrs. Yasue Kunitomo,
and the person to the left is the person

296
00:09:55,878 --> 00:10:00,415
who made the door,
Mrs. Kunitomo's friend. Mr. Sekiguchi...

298
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:05,020
Um, it seems that someone who
was inside opened this door a while ago

300
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,656
but what If nobody Is
on the 3rd floor either 7?

302
00:10:07,657 --> 00:10:09,291
No one can open the door...

303
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,960
Except for my husband
whose fingerprints are set

305
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,728
inside the fingerprint recognition machine

306
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:18,332
Anyone in this house can go out by placing
his finger on the machine though...

309
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,135
So...I'dulike to give it a try...

310
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,504
Don't touchiiit!.

311
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:23,872
Whaaall

312
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,640
When someone from outside places
his finger on the machine,.

314
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,409
the alarm within the house
will go off and the people

316
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,445
from the security office will rush over here!

318
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,212
().Oh

319
00:10:31,514 --> 00:10:31,746
0.Oh

320
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:33,815
I also thought that we should put up

324
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,650
I also thought that we should put up
surveillance cameras too. but...

326
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:35,984
I told him not to do it...

327
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:36,251
IV told him not to do it...

330
00:10:36,285 --> 00:10:38,019
I told him not to do it...

332
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,988
A camera at the front entrance 1s okay but...

333
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:43,291
I have something against setting up
such exaggerated security precautions

335
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:47,195
in this fine house that my father had built...

337
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:50,198
I think it has enough exaggerated
ecurity precautions a ready...

340
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,835
Oh...You're Mr Mouri
the renown detective!

342
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:55,704

I 1111000

354
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:31,005
Are you sure
It's okay calling a detective over. .?

356
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,508
If he finds out about the, you know what.

357
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,979
He won't There's no evidence
of it anywhere anymore.

359
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,015
But from what was written on that card...

360
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,685
That's why we hired a detective.

361
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,755
To have him catch the one
who is blackmail ing us and find out

363
00:11:46,756 --> 00:11:49,491

At the rate you're going. you're going to

370
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,178
Hay, watch your mouth!

371
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:14,082
You're the one to blame for
what happened to begin with, you know!

373
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,985
That's why Ism here. aren't I...

374
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,687
Tomorrow's the «Day in question, right?

375
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:25,226
Yes The day that
this mansion's mouse begins to move.

379
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:41,676
Wow...

380
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,111

Oh. no. I'm not talking about the food.
But. rather the investigation...

390
00:13:01,797 --> 00:13:05,099
I can't say yet, for now...

391
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:07,969
Dram

392
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,672
Even If someo re were to set it up so that

393
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:14,008
the dish cabinet would fall or
queer sounds would be made

395
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:16,277
I'm sure the gadgets
would've been retrieved by now...

397
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:17,712
Hey. not again!

window that's more than 2nd floors high .

418
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:07,327
By the way,
that steward 1s a meticulous perfectionist

420
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:09,464
and hates things that are crooked.

421
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:13,735
Even if it's a tablecloth,
he finds that it's crooked.

423
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,037
See!

424
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,875

425
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:27,649
Neat paranoiac... an acrophobe,
and a meticulous perfectionist.

430
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,985
I took the job only because

431
00:14:30,986 --> 00:14:35,456

Well. there are some queer points
as to his death...

The position of the rope tht
he put his neck through...

546

00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:13,601
all Ye [YT end]
W. Where did yougget that?!

567
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:18,973
I found it in Mr. Sckiguchi's clothes
) ENE O pelts (x

569
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:22,577
You shouldn't do stuff
Iike that on your own...

571
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,813
Yeah
that's why I gave him a good licking...

573
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:26,547
Huh?

574
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,967
Right kd.

576
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:34,989
What is this-card anyway?
Sin of 13 years 140.

578
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,727
Beats me, it kind of looks to be 1
dying message too...

580
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:45,666
But, I guess we can 1sk the three who went
pale when they saw this card for the details?

582
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,503
What seems to be the matter'?

583
00:19:49,504 --> 00:19:52,573
What seems to be the matter?
Does-something 13 ears ago come to mind

585
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,878
t was Just aboeuti13 years from no

586
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,147
Miama a
The master's cruiser had a marine accident

588
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:02,750
Marine accident

589
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:07,488
Yes. back men, every year.
Just about thisgtime

591
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:12,793
It was usual practice for all of us here
to go cruising on Master's boat. but...

593
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:14,896
got strandod off shore the SurugaO?Bay

594
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:18,466
Mr. and Mrs. Kunitomo and Mg. Sekiguchi .
Who just happened to be sailing

596
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,701
that day somehow made it to safety...

597
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:23,437
Ab. go au on
And. what about the others?.

599
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:27,174
Tho whereabouts of everyone
else is unknown...

601
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:30,044
The ship that sunk hasn't been
found yet ether.

603
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:34,982
Could it be that
Mr Sekuguchi caused the ship to sink

605
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,752
SO someone had a grudge against him?

606
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:43,224
Oh, well...I'm not't home at the sea.
And never went cruising with them so...

609
00:20:43,225 --> 00:20:46,460
Since you two were saved, you know
what happened. don't you?

612
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,862
Huh?!

613
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,798
The reason why the ship sank...

614
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,903
No. bocause I was sleeping, when Mr
Sekiguchi suddenly shouted to run for it...

616
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,940
Wee were despornnate to flee that
we didn't know what was going on

619
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:03,377
Is there anybody here that
is the bereaved family of a victim of

621
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,146
that accident and working here?

622
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:06,079
YY %.

623
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:09,884
Which means that
this case may also be connected in

625
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:13,087
some way to the 5 oth x2rs incidents
that happened here...

627
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:15,256
5 incidents?

628
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,791
It happened...

629
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,161
Mr Kunitomo had nightmares

630
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,762
The car brakes didn't function,

631
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:25,666
The dish cabinaot-falls.down
In theynuddle of the might.

633
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:28,970
Ind strange sounds are heard in a house
where nobody else s supposed to be...

635
00:21:28,971 --> 00:21:29,236
Oh...

636
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:30,538
