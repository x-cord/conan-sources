1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,500
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,203
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:06,239
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,107
Lowers hold deep meaning behind them.

6
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,009
Time ls no obstacle
for songs or the will to kill.

8
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,911
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:13,713
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,916
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

13
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,651
We got a request for a job from

14
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:01,454
YoshinorieKana, chairman of

15
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,189
the Kana Amusement Group

16
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,825
He asks us to attend a party

17
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:08,094
and protect his wife, Misaki, who is

18
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,229
being stalked by someone.

19
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,267
There is a black out during the party

20
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,636
Misaki is attacked in her room!

21
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,775
Suspicion falls on Gerald Tenma

22
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,878
the main guest of the party.

23
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,179
However,

24
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,016
Gerald Tenma himself, is killed!!

25
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,457
Nocturne of Red Will to Kill" Part II

26
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,234
The murder weapon is
the sword of:the knight.

28
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,635
Hmm?

29
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,938
A tuning fork used for tuning the piano...

30
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,374
I wonder what this scratch is...

31
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,309
And,

32
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,845
why is the piano chair over here...?

33
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,382
It's stuck under the large sofa.

34
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,083
Huh?!

35
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:04,517
Huh?!

36
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,519
You stay put!

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,787
Please move over to
thetWaiting room so that

39
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,923
we can keep the scene of
the murder as is.

41
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,491
Erald...

42
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,197
Yoshinori,

43
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,866
are you the one who killed Mr. TenmaO?

44
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,235
No! I didn't!!

45
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,271
I was in the waiting room!

46
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,405
Rightdhere!! »

47
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,908
Tenma ignored me

48
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,910
and went alone into the piano room!

49
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:33,479
Without a choice,

50
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,047
Just as I was about to sit in the chair...

51
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,450
I heard a thump and a scream,

52
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,118
so I went to look,

53
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,521
and"found Tenma.dead!

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,590
But, back then,

55
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,027
everyone else was
IN: the large reception room downstairs.

57
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,562
That's right, Yoshinori!

58
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,931
Of all things, what a thing to do?!

59
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,100
I'm telling you, I didn't do it!

60
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,869
You didn't like the fact that I decided on

61
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,205
this whole thing on my own
in the first place!

63
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,740
So, when you found out that
Misaki and Mr Tenma

65
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,943
used to go with each other in the past,

66
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,445
you were enraged. weren't you?!

67
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,380
Well, that's...

68
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,217
So, the Kana family is finished...

69
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,786
t's too bad, chairman...

70
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,353
«un, Wii»

71
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,956
I wonder who is going to be
taking over the

73
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,024
Kana Amusement Group from now on?

74
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,059
I'm innocent!!

75
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:21,326
I'm innocent!!

76
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,395
And, dids ou see the killer?

77
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,032
Well...

78
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,701
when I got there...

79
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,469
there was already no one there

80
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,804
Hey,

81
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,507
when we were guided in there by Misaki,

82
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,742
the lid of the piano was closed, wasn't it?

83
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,111
I wonder if Gerald opened it?

84
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,814
No, in a room this,size,
sound will go around

86
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,350
even without opening
the top of the piano.

88
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,652
Gerald would never open it...

89
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,387
come to think of it...

90
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,725
The top lid of the piano was open

91
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,793
even before Tenma came into this room.

92
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,362
Which"means...

93
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,733
that the killer could've. opened the piano

94
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,571
the top lid of the piano
beforehand to block our view...

96
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,451
The only way out of this room is

97
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,052
to go through the waiting room...

98
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,156
One of the windows was open,

99
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,091
but below it, is the sea way blow...

100
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,760
Even if the killer were to jump in,

101
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,496
it would be difficult to avoid the rocks.

102
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,530
Huh?

103
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,066
There is a scratch on
this window frame too...

105
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,669
It looks like a scratch made from a string
or something that has scraped it...

107
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,703
Huh?

108
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,806
It's the same as when
Misaki was attacked!

110
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,680
If a rope were used, you could flee to
the top forward or bottom?!

112
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,217
Well, that is a possibility...

113
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,587
But, I wonder if one could flee so quickly?

114
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,624
A scratch made by the tip of the sword
piercing right through the floor is

116
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,292
vertical?

117
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,361
His means...

118
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,832
Maybe!

119
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,743
Let's organize the position of all of you

120
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,845
during the time of the crime, once again.

121
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,814
Let's all go to the room next door.

122
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,691
The small chandelier on this.side is

123
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,227
positioned higher
than the big one over there

125
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,197
When we were lead in here,

126
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,132
I'm sure it was positioned lower.

127
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:42,600
Huh?

128
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,837
There is a scratch here too

129
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,838
It resembles the one
that was by the window...

131
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,244
So, this is the chain that moves

132
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,846
the chandelier up and down.

133
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,482
I guess it's easy to roll it up.

136
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,990
Only this box has no dust on it...

137
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,329
Hmm?!

138
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,931
Nocturne of Red Love"!!

139
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,500
That song was one that

140
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,903
Mr. Tenma had written for
Misaki 10 years ago!

142
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,339
Wait a sec?

143
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,875
Sosyswhat does.this mean?

145
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,511
Hmm?

146
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,779
What's that?

147
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,447
On the piano?

148
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,989
Is it blood?!

149
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:39,758
No!!

150
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,428
Inside the piano too?!

151
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,132
Officer Kobayashi.

152
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,001
What is it, Conan?

153
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,170
Lend me. our ear, please.

154
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,574
What? The Inspector said to?

155
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,443
Look for Beethoven?

156
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,577
Yep.

157
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,846
Is it really inside the ocean?

158
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,915
Yep! Good luck.

159
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,722
At any rate, I'll have to have you

160
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,257
come to the station with me.

161
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,759
I didn't do it!

162
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,961
How many times do I have to tell
to make you believe me?

164
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,963
Misaki! Help me!

165
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,098
Dear!

166
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:24,069
If this piece fits into that part.

167
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,874
Just as I thought!!

168
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,776
These are the debris from

169
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,211
the decoration up there!

170
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,847
Only that person could've committed the
murder!

172
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,851
I'll take care of the company, Yoshinori...

173
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,688
You're already thinking of selling

174
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,791
a memorial CD of Gerald Tenma,
aren't you?

176
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,025
How dare you!

179
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,202
That's the one who attacked Misaki!!

180
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,605
Achoo!!

181
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,005
Huh?

182
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,875
Inspector Megure!

183
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,308
Just as you have said,

184
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:06,912
this statue of Beethoven was
found on the beach!

186
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,247
Huh?

187
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,481
I never you asked you to do such a thing!

188
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,582
Shoots!

189
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,519
Um, what's this?

190
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,325
There is a scratch below the railing
that looks to have been made by

192
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,226
scraping a thin string or wire on it...

193
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,163
Huh?

194
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,831
What's this?

195
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,133
What is this string called?

196
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,969
Isn't this the string that
you use when fishing?

198
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,438
It's called a fishing gut.

199
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,573
Inspector, there was a fishing gut and

200
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,242
this stick on this chest statue...

201
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,944
What?!

202
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,312
I see!

203
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,582
The scratch on the railing was made by
the fishing gut scraping against it!

205
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,784
All right, Pops, that's the way to go!

206
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,688
But, why the statue of Beethoven. ?

207
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,025
See, there's Mr. Beethoven
in this picture too!

209
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,294
What is this?!

210
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,464
That was a picture that was taken
secretly of this room last night.

212
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,900
This is just about there...

213
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,204
Oh, the statue of Beethoven is not here?

214
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,172
I see, I've figured out

215
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,707
the trick of the caped monster!

216
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,209
What?!

217
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:13,879
Yes...the statue of Beethoven
belongs in this room!

219
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,380
F this trick were to be used...

220
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,717
Don't you think that beam fits

221
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:21,153
the length of the stick?

222
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,521
Hmm...

223
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:23,856
Hey!

224
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:24,289
Hey!

225
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,191
Doesn't that piece that was found,

226
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,793
fit right into the crack over there?

227
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,228
Right!

228
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,064
Let's try it from the balcony
on the other side

230
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:35,267
Would you please lend us a fishing pole
If you have one?

232
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:35,767
Yes...

233
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,206
The eaves protrude more than
the railing, but

235
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,775
if a fishing pole were used, it's simple.

236
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:49,414
There is a loop at the tip of the string and
a weight at the end to carry this out.

238
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,419
Then, pull this string under the railing...

239
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,787
Officer Kobayashi,

240
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,790
please put your finger through the loop
of the fishing gut and hold it in place.

242
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,062
Inspector Megure,
may I borrow your coat?

244
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,097
Huh?

245
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,634
So, now we're all set.

246
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,836
Officer Kobayashi,

247
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,237
struggle with the monster

248
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,505
and let your hand go when I signal,

249
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,108
then, pull the string.

250
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,543
All right.

251
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,577
Let's begin.

252
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,880
Aaagh, help me!

253
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,921
Now!

254
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:29,988
Pull the string!!

255
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,760
Let the string go!

257
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,303
This is fantastic! It's perfect!

258
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,572
Ugh, hey?!

259
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,707
My coat!!

260
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,076
That movement just now was exactly

261
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,779
the same as the attacker
ho attacked Misaki

263
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,314
Then...

264
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,382
Don:t tell me...it was you?

265
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,819
In a dark room it looked like

266
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,121
the caped monster fled...

267
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:07,259
That is, the victim and the attacker are
one and the same...

269
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,095
The killer lowers the breaker
that is in the corridor,

271
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,597
and goes back to her room right away,

272
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,033
Iocks the door and screams.

273
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,870
Isn't that right, Misaki?

274
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,474
Misaki?

275
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,978
Perfect, just as would be expected of a
renown detective...

277
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,681
However, all the pranks and blackmails
I have experienced up to now

279
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,983
are a matter of fact.

280
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,585
I wanted you to believe me

281
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,987
so I put on an act...

282
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,688
I see...

283
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:39,858
But, this is not directly connected to the

284
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,293
murder of Mr. Tenma.

285
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,461
Yoshinori,

286
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,930
please come with me to the station.

287
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,432
Okay...

288
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,403
This won't do...!

289
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,745
Whaaaa!!

290
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:00,779
What the...?

291
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,947
The piano room?!

292
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,615
Aaagh!!

293
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,851
Conansxwhat's.up?!

294
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,284
Where are you!

295
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:09,955
Huh!

296
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,760
What is it now?

297
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,229
Inspector Megure,

298
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,730
please wait about
taking him to the station.

300
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,065
What?!

301
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,134
Oh, so it's come?

302
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,704
Yes. I've finally figured it out, Inspector.

303
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,106
Please look at the sword mark
on the floor.

305
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,576
The angle of the scratch is perpendicular.

306
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,178
MB The result of the investigation
SNOWS likewise.

309
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,449
And, the railing of the spiral corridor
by the window.

311
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,752
The scratch left on the tuning fork
that Mr. Tenma was holding...

313
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,689
If we connect all the traces left behind,

314
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,625
a certain horrible trap
comes for the surface'!

316
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,126
Huh???!

317
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,230
There is a chandelier right above
the scratch on the floor.

319
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,968
That is in fact, the last point
that connects all the traces.

321
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:58,970
It can't be?!

322
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:00,572
Yes...!

323
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,709
The sword that was suspended
from that chandelier

325
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:07,245
fell straight down, pierced Mr. Tenma

326
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,183
and left a vertical mark on the floor.

327
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:11,883
Oh, no...

328
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:12,718
0O0O0OO0ODO0OO

329
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,820
But, Mr. Mouri,

330
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,855
even if he were to be standing
conveniently right under the place

332
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,090
where the sword descended,

333
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,425
wouldn't he have been
stabbed in the head or shoulder?

335
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,294
However, Mr. Tenma

336
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,296
was lying on his stomach!

337
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,099
No such thing could be done!

338
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:30,368
The answer to that mystery is
the tuning fork.

340
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,337
Tuning fork?

341
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,673
And, the pianos«chair!t

342
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,908
The space between
the piano and the chair is

344
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,711
good only for one person.

345
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,680
This was the trap!!

346
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,917
When;Mr. Ten'ma comes before
the keys of the piano to play,

348
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,854
the chair was toppled beside the piano!

349
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,724
He also finds the tuning fork used for
tuning the piano on the floor.

351
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,661
Well, Mr. Tenma would naturally
go to pick it up.

353
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:02,033
Yeah...if so, he would turn his back
against the sword...

355
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,870
And, the tuning fork that he picked up

356
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,705
Is the very thing
that made the sword come falling!

358
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,774
What do you mean.!

359
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,675
This horrible trap,

360
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,376
This horrible trap,

361
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,913
was set up by setting the sword
in the middle of the long string,

363
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,948
then gathering both sides of the string,

364
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,351
pulling them through
the metal faster of the chandelier

366
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,354
using the railing of the spiral corridor
as support,

368
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,290
one side is wound once
around the large sofa

370
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,859
then the tip of the string is
hooked on to the tuning fork.

372
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,229
The other end of the string is
Ieft outside the window,

374
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,698
with a weight attached to it...

375
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,867
All that's left to do next

376
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,938
is to for Mr Tenma to pull it out
from under the chair.

378
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,340
The string that was hooked
on to the tuning fork

380
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,875
is released by the weight of the sword,

381
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,846
And the heavy sword probably
came falling in an instant.

383
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,618
On the other hand, the fishing gut
that was holding the sword in place,

385
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:57,889
was pulled by the weight
that was suspended outside the window

387
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,693
and dropped into the ocean below.

388
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,728
I see!

389
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,831
And, who is the one~who set all this up?!

390
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,766
Lease recall...

391
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,068
The trick using the fishing gut...

392
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:15,273
The method of throwing the evidence
into the sea by using heavy weight,

394
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,710
is exactly like the one
that used with the caped monster

396
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,645
that was just demonstrated, is it not?

398
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,516
Misaki?

399
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,687
Yes, the killer ls you, Misakl!

400
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,857
After we all drank the wine,

401
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,525
you pretend to go to the kitchen

402
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,260
and set your trap up here, didn't you?

403
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,864
By rolling the chandelier to the very top,

404
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,100
you made harder to find the sword,
as well as

406
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,669
heightened the power of it to kill, right?

407
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,441
I thought.you*were a
renown detective but

409
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,376
I guess. I was wrong!

410
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,812
Do you have proof that I did it?

411
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,881
I'd like you to take a look at the lid of
the top of the piano

413
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,283
and the stains inside it.

414
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,820
Oh?!

415
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,757
This is...wineyp

416
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,560
Judging from the place where it is spilled

417
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,497
it must've dripped
when she opened the lid.

419
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:16,668
The one who spilled the wine is the killer!

420
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,070
How can you be so sure?

421
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,574
Because the wine is
what Michelle brought from France

423
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,310
and one that is not sold in Japan.

424
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:30,615
S...this is unmistakably the wi
that I brought.

426
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,319
We were all drinking that wine.

427
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,889
Misaki is the only one who didn't drink it!

428
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,294
When I bumped into her
and the wine spilled,

430
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:46,665
the wine that was probably left
in the gap of her brooch spilled out

432
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,068
when she opened the lid
on top of the piano.

434
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,140
You not only made it look like
you were attacked by Mr. Tenma,

436
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,076
you set it up so that the picture of
you two in the past would be found,

438
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,412
and tried to frame Yoshinori
who you knew would be

440
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:04,049
enraged as the one
who killed Mr. Tenma, isn't that right?

442
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,885
Misaku, Is that true?!

443
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,822
How are you going to explain
the stalker incidents before all this!

445
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,693
She probably acted it out herself.

446
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,062
The prank call that came a while ago was

447
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,931
probably made by Misaki herself,

448
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,033
using her cellular!

449
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,303
Why would Misaki want to kill Mr. Tenma...

450
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:30,241
The date of the picture that was found of
Misaki and Mr. Tenma was

452
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,810
only six months before her marriage,
wasn't it?

454
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,380
It can't be?!

455
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,751
And the "Nocturne of Red Love" was a

456
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,155
song that was written for you,
10 year ago!

458
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,089
Huh?!

459
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,291
Really? (In French)

460
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,728
The song at first glance
Iooks to be a love song.

462
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,429
But the passions
that the flowers stand for are,

464
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,299
Red roses symbolize passion,

465
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,268
marigolds, hopelessness, roberias evil,

466
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,337
and dahlias betrayal.

467
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,741
In other words, this was a song of hate

468
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,310
written for someone who had
betrayedrone's lover!!

470
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:08,113
Hmm...is that true,

471
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,147
Misaki?

472
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,783
Yes...

473
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,384
Yes...

474
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,985
10 years ago on that day...

475
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,622
He insisted on not leaving me,

476
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,291
so I called him out to a nearby beach...

477
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,294
and pushed him over the cliff...

478
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:33,271
Then, you married Yoshinori.

479
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,975
However, Mr. Tenma miraculously
made it out alive,

481
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,278
and achieved his fame abroad...

482
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,615
When you found out
Gerald Tenma's true identity,

484
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,085
you figured you had no choice
but to kill Tenma again,

486
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,990
In order to keep your previous crime
from being revealed!!

488
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,762
But, why did you try to frame
your husband as the killer?

490
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,964
Because of Masayo!

491
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,335
If I get caught my husband as well as
the company will be taken away

493
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:09,007
But a man who is in prison
cannot be taken away from me.

495
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,977
I was planning to take over the company
until he came back...

497
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,613
Misaki...

498
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:19,084
When Mr. Tenma's body wasn't
found 10 years ago,

500
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:23,188
I was always in fear that
he may be alive...

502
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,724
Because I also knew
the meaning of that song.

504
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:32,197
Well...the fact is, whenever Gerald sang
this song at his concert,

506
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,999
he would whisper .the following phrase
without fail.

508
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,169
Pour compenser ton coeur blesse."

509
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,371
In Japanese it means

510
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:44,409
To compensate your heart that is hurt.

511
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,147
The new arrangement had new lyrics,

512
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,714
but most probably...

513
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,652
Yes! Except for red roses,
the flowers have all been changed to.

515
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,887
Hyacinth, laurel tree and olive!

516
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,493
The flowers stand for,
sadness peace and glory...

518
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,265
I see.

519
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,536
Mr. Tenma having realized that he had
cornered Misaki into committing murder,

521
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,873
continued singing this song
with feelings of compensation,

523
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:17,809
and probably deliberately decided to
sign a contract with the Kana Group.

525
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,880
Yes, he once fell to the pits of grief,

526
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,781
but he no longer hated Misaki

527
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:27,652
and'having achieved success and
happiness himself,

529
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,522
he probably wanted her to hear the real
octurne off Red Love"...

I've been hooked on
what flowers stand for since then!

576
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,697
Okay then Sonoko, bye-bye.

577
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,166
Oh, Conan you're back.

578
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,337
Here, I saw this at the flower shop,
so I bought it.

580
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,574
Huh?! You, Conan? For me?

581
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:30,975
Thank you!

582
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,280
Wow, what beautiful peach blossoms...

583
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:38,149
Uh.\ this flower stands for...

584
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,152
To be...unrivaled... in the world...

585
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:46,724
Hey Conan. just...
what do you mean by this?!

587
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,360
Uh... well you see...

588
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,063
Just what do you mean-to be
unrivaled in the world?!

590
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:54,531
Ha, ha, ha...just that...

591
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,447
Hurry!

592
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,784
Let's get outside
before they get into the elevator!!

594
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,655
No use fleeing!!

595
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,491
What I want to say is,

596
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,227
you're not Misato, but an impostor!!
