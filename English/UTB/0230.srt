1
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,052
With a strong mind and sharp powers
of reasoning, a keen sense of rhythm

3
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,921
that enables one to grasp
the inner meaning of the crime.

5
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,590
Today's episode occurs
inside afbuxis filledkwithadanger.

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,325
Ai'is acting strange.

8
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,261
He sees through the one and only truth

9
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,862
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

11
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,131
No case is left un's'olve'd
with Detective Conan.

13
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,067
Dld you see that? He Just left

14
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,070
The client left with a happy face...

16
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,742
He doesn't realize
that was his last drink...

18
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,612
Isn't that right, bro...

19
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:28,881
Bro?

20
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,688
Oh, so that diva's up next?

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,226
Every time I hear her sing.
It sends shivers down my spine.

23
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,295
And shells good-looking too...

24
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:47,233
She's your type, isn't she...

25
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,545
Dry, martinis for you two

26
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,547
compliments of the diva.

27
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:07,420
Well, well, well...that's mighty kind of her.

28
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,089
Aw...

29
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:13,025
What's the meaning of this?

30
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:13,959
Huh?

31
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,196
I asked you what the heck you're doing.

32
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,432
I already know all about you!

33
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,105

34
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,442

35
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,609

Don't get so angry
Belmot
JbEyh

42
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,490
I was just teasing the guys
who have the hots'for th§t diva.

44
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,559
That's all...

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,695
Sure, but are you sure this is OK?

46
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:54,300
I mean you're a famous actress.
What if someone saw you with us...

48
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,302
Don't worry about it...

49
00:03:56,803 --> 00:04:00,840
everyone's attention is
on the diva who's up next...

51
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,908
Neversmind that,

52
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:06,112
did you find what you were looking for?

53
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,580
We'll...

54
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,316
not exactly what I was looking for, but...

55
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,118
What are you looking for anyway?

56
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,587
Don't you think it's
about time you tell us

58
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,522
where you're at and
what you're doing...

60
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,290
Hah, no use asking...

61
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:23,028
this woman never reveals her secrets...

62
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,432
You just don't understand, do you...

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,236
A secret makes a woman'a woman...

64
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:35,574
A woman becomes beautiful
when she has secrets to hide...

66
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,177
You make me sick...

67
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,250
Never mind about me.
What about you?

69
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,653
Did you find that little kitten
that got away-from you?

71
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:49,788
No...

72
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,458
But it%?won't be Iong'before I do...

73
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,362
my nose can sniff out
a traitor wherever they are...

75
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,635
and when I db.
I'll Show them what real fear IS...

77
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,039
I'll teach both of them.
Her and that boyfriend of hers...

are you sure you're up to ski?

88
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,974
It's his own fault...

89
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,843
I told him to stop because
he-would catch a cold but};

91
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,846
he stayed up all night watching

92
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,515
those How to Ski"
tapes for image training);

94
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,451
I guess you're right...

95
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm in charge of you kids!

96
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,323
I've got to set a good example

97
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,192
But when we get there,

98
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,793
you've got keep still
and Stay in bed at the lodge.

100
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,530
Like they say. the beginning
of a cold is the most crucial time...

102
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,934
You'd better not push
yourself and go outside!

104
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,570
Uh uh...

105
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,740
Aw, come on...

106
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,275
I can't tell who the kid is...

107
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,078
Next stop. . .In front of Beika Park.

108
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,148
N'éxt stop ..In front of Beika Park.

109
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,845
Hey!

110
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,382
The passengers are boarding now.
Please stay in your seats.

113
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,451
Yes sir!

114
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,322
Oh my

115
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,390
you look like you're
about to die from boredom...

117
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,461
you look very sad since you won't
be able to see her for a long time...

119
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:44,330
Huh?

120
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:45,597
Or could it be...

121
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,834
That you're sad because you won't
be-able to see those guys?

123
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,172
You're nuts.

124
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,041
These passengers have
nothing to do with me.

126
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,877
Who'd be crazy enough to want to run
into those guys in a small bus like this?

128
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,512
Especially with
all these kldS on board...

130
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,651
Is he one of those men in black?!

131
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,319
No he isn't.

133
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,390
I can tell, they have a smell

134
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,461
it's an unpleasant smell. only those
who're in the organization give it off...

136
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,065
You don't smell funnfl.

137
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,634
Will you stop kidding around?

138
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,171
But if you have that sixth sense,

139
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,172
what happened with Bisco...

140
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,043
Well. I had my suspicions

141
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,646
Then why didn't you say something?

142
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,449
I wasn't absolutely sure...

143
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,252
I had a feeling there was one more.

144
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,720
That's right...

145
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,189
someone worse than Bisco...

146
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:48,927
I felt an aura
that made my skin prickle...

148
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:58,803
Ku,Kudou

149
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,973
chan'ge'seats with me and hide me...

150
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:03,108
Please!

151
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,177
Ha, Haibara...

152
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,046
Look! It's Mr. 'A'r'aid'e'u

153
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,384
I didn't expect to see
all of you on this bus too

155
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,921
We took our physical examination
at school yesterday!

157
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,055
Yes, I know

158
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:18,323
Hey,

159
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,325
Mr. Mamie, what happened to you?

160
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,994
I just remembered

161
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,263
you werenlt'there yesterday.

162
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,800
Hey. are you on a date, sir?

163
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:28,200
Uh, no,

164
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,001
Uh, no,

165
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,604
she's a teacher at Teitan High School.
I'm the 'school doctor there.

167
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,841
Hi boys and girls!

168
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,843
Oh! You're that cool kid.

169
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,978
So we meet againh!

170
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,847
Do you know her?

171
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,182
Uh, yes...

172
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,652
she teaches English
at Ran's high school

174
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,322
My name is Jody Santemillion!

175
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,593
I'm on a date with Dr. 'Araide.
We're going to the Ueno Art Museum.

177
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,462
Uh, no,

178
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,330
we met at the bus stop
quite coincidentally.

181
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,201
You shouldn't embarrass a lady!

182
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,337
It wouldn't be good for rumors
to go around school about us.

184
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,738
Isn't that right?

185
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,807
Oh, yes'

186
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,409
That would be a problem!

187
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,808
Hey look

188
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,077
Look at those two...

189
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,547
we're not even there yet
and they're already in their ski suits!

191
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,481
They probably can't wait...

192
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,152
But I know how they feel.

193
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,387
I do I00!

194
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:03,595
Good grief. why is he putting
his goggles on in the bus...

196
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,534
Why don't we change too?

197
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,935
Don't you remember...

198
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,671
we sent our bags on ahead...

199
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,473
Ohfl. that's/right!

200
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,675
Genta, you're so forgetful.

201

Nobody move

202
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,150
Move and you're dead

203
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,618
Wh, what is this?

204
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,659
It's them'!

205
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,005
Nobody move!

206
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,808
Move and you're dead!

207
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,279
Wh, what's going on?!

208
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,348
Are they hijacking the bus?!

209
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:58,817

Don't try to hide them...

235
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,433
if you do. I'll make it so you
never make another pho'ne call.

237
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,915

238
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,984

Liste'. we're being...

240
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,659
We've just hijacked
your company's bus]!

242
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,728
We only want 1 thing!

243
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,798
We want the release of
Kunio Yajima who's in prison

245
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,068
Tell the cops that if they don't do it,

246
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,770
we'll kill 1 passenger every hour!

247
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,440
We'll call you back in 20 minutes!

248
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,042
Get things settled by them!

249
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,417
Kunio Yajima...

250
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,853
Kunio Yajima...

251
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,789
one-of the members of a gang
{of robbers, last monttp,

253
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,925
they made a bomb and
tried tb'rob a j'ewelry store...

255
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:24,262
The leader of'the gang.
Kunio Yajima was the only one caught

257
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,933
the other three are still at large

258
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,803
I'm'sure Yajirna
was once a jewelry broker...

260
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,039
gent...

261
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,642
I'll bet the rest of the gang donft know
what to do with the jewels they stole

263
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:43,248
and they haven't gotten rid of them yet
so they're trying to break their 6083 out...

265
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,053
or maybe only the boss knows
where the jewels are and

267
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,056
they're trying to get him out/
of jail so they can get to it.

269
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,792
Hey, you!

270
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,860

Yeah

312
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,907
That's what you should've
done from the start .

314
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,495
Whwwhat happened?!

315
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,629

It's very, very exciting

322
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:37,262
Goodrgrief, is thisifteacher for real. . ._

323
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:45,537
Anyway...

324
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,806
while those guys are over there,

325
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,475
I've get,to contact Inspector Megure

326
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,945
on my earring shaped transmitter to let
him know what's going on in this bus.'...

328
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,088
What are you doing!'?

329
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,226
Why you...little brat...

330
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,897
Try something like that again

331
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,433
you're really going to get it

332
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,838
Oops, almost forgot...

333
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,772
I'm going to hang onto this...

334
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,776
Rats he tooktmy phone...

335
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,045
dnan! Are you alright...

336
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,447
That's strange. . .1

337
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,916
he came straight for me.

338
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,586
But I'm sure he couldn't see me.
I was hiding behind the Seat...

340
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,454
that must mean...

341
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,724
another one from their
gang's on this bus...

343
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,996
It must be one of those three since they
could see what I was doing.

345
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,702
But how'd he let him know?!

346
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,906
HoW'd-he let him know where I Was.

347
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,043
How'd he do it without
anybody noticing...

349
00:18:06,886 --> 00:18:07,519
This is Seton

350
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,257
The hijacked bus is presently
heading towards Takaido!

352
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,726
Travelling at a Speed of
approximately 50 kilometers

354
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:17,062
This is Takagi, we're in position E!

355
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,597
The hijacked,bus has
jUSt come into View

357
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,599
There are two suspects on board!

358
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,935
Both are in ski suits!

359
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,838
If can't make out their faces because
they have hats and goggles on

361
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,309
It appearSLboth suspects arexarmed! ,

362
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,179
What should we do, Inspector! I

363
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,182
The bus-might pass-that way again!

364
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,317
Hold your positions!!

365
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,518
Yes, sir!

366
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,387
Damn!

367
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,990
If both of them have guns,

368
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,258
then we have to move carefully...

369
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,059
Inspector!

370
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,530
The bosses upstairs
jUSt gave their orders!

372
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:57,002
First prioritx is for the safe
release of the passengers!

374
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,704
The prisoner, Kunio Yajima,

375
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,775
is going to be released
per the hijackers request...

377
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,578
I guess we have no other choice...

378
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:10,582
as it seems the hijackers have
alr'eady fired 2 shots in the bus

380
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,519
if the 're part of that
gang 0 jewelry robbers,

382
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,922
an explosives professional
might be in there too...

384
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,659
If they detonate some bombs in the city.
We're going to have

386
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,461
a disaster on our hands...

387
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:26,664
But still.
They're trapped like rats in there!

389
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,335
It appeans that the bus is just moving
through the streets randomly...

391
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,406
No, they have some kind of plan...

392
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,541
They intend to lose
the police and escape...

394
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,544
They've got a plan

395
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,749
So they've agreed to release him, eh?

396
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:51,189
All right then. tell Yajima when
he's released to call us back in 1 hour!

398
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:55,860
As soon as we know
he's in a safe place,

400
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,730
we'll let the passengers go.
Th lee of them first

402
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,131
Listen carefully!

403
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,833
Don't db anything stupid!

404
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,802
YilZes'!

405
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,512
Two ski bags in a row...on the floor...
they couldn't be, could they

407
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,982
What the...

408
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,323
You againl?

409
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,595
If you're not afraid of dying...
Then I'll be glad to oblige

411
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,665
Hey! Little kid stand up

412
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:35,800
Co Conan!

413
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,839
Stop that

414
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,641
He's just a little boy being...
being mischievous!

416
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,345
Besides. you're getting what
you asked for

418
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:52,217
If you hurt even one passenger.
Your plan's not going to go smoothly.

420
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,753
You've got some nerve
You young punk...

422
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,222
Stop that!

423
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,725
If the bullet misses & hits
that thing". then what?

425
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:02,393
Oh, uh

426
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,530
OK you guys.
Get back to your seats, now!

428
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,565
Yes, OK...

429
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,204
You said that if that thing" got hit...
NAha, I knew it! These bags...

431
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,406
Are there bombs in them?!

432
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,211
I still don't know what these guys are
going to do with these, but now...

434
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,884
I do know for sure that one of those
three in the back3'fpart of their gang

436
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,752
and he's telling them about me.

437
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,622
I've got to find 'out
somehow who it is,

439
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:35,026
Otherwise, there'll be nothing I Can do...

440
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38,429
Hey Haibara, do you have any ideas?

441
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:39,564
Huh?!

442
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:47,038
What? What is this?
His choking pressure...

444
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,476
It's that same overwhelming
feeling I got before...

446
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:54,412
He's here... that guy's...on this bus"

447
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:58,082
Is it one of the men in black?
Are they after me?

449
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,318
Or is it just a coincidence?

450
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,355
If my identity is blown now ..if they

451
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,358
realize I betrayed the organization.

452
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:11,262
Then Doctor Agasa and
all the others on this bus

454
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:14,299
everyone .will be killed...

455
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,803
so will he, of course...that's for sure...

456
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:25,944
Please. . .oh please...
Don't let them see me
