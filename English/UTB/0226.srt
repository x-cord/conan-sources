1
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,453
With a strong mind & sharp powers
of reasoning,

3
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,121
a keen sense of rhythm that enables one
to grasp the inner meaning of the crime

5
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,927
He sees through the one & only tnuth.

6
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,662
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult,

8
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,764
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

10
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:59,452
Battle Game Trap- Part I

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,753
Aha!

12
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,154
Oh no!!

13
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,657
This IS great

14
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,361
Now "know why this one's your favorite,
Sonbko

16
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,894
See, I told you!

17
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,165
And it's far from our school
so nobody knows about it

19
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,299
Hahaha.

20
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,001
Oh, look!

21
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,269
There's a wedding version too!

23
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,006
I don't believe it...

24
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,241
it wasn't here yesterday...

25
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:23,775
Let's have a look!

26
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:25,244
Wow...

27
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,313
Gee, 'I"'think this-'T'one's so cute'! (g

28
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,548
Why don't the 3 of us
get our pictures taken here?

30
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,182
Eh!?

31
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,753
Oh no...wait, wait, just wait a minute!

32
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,957
Uh, maybe it would be better to take
separate pictures sometimes,

34
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,859
you know, for a change of pace

35
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:41,626
Sonoko

37
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:46,866
Confess Sonoko,

38
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,701
you're going to write a letter
to Mr. Kyogoku

40
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,269
and stick your picture on it, arenit you?

42
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,507
Why just a few days ago,

43
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,476
Mr. Arade was reading
a fan letter from one of the girls

45
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,013
and he asked if sticking your photo
onto the letters was the current trend...

47
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,650
Uh, listen, Ran...

48
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,519
I think you're about the only one
ho isn't doing it...

50
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,587
Really?

51
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,891
Boy! Mr Arade has it rough doesn't he...

52
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,392
He thought he could just relax

53
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,793
when he was relieved
as coach for the basketball team,

55
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,495
but now
he's in charge of the drama club...

57
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,197
But I guess that can't be helped,

58
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,865
since that handsome Shinichi's
not around anymore,

60
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:23,202
all the girls are chasing Mr. Arade...

61
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,204
That's not completely true.

62
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,740
Jody, the new English teacher

63
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,608
is pretty popular too!

64
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,644
Only among the guys though

65
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,282
She's always wearing such se\ Clothes
and excreting pheromone,

67
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,385
I think
she thinks Japanese men are idiots!

69
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,920
Haha. . .look who's talking,

70
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:43,389
you always wear clothes
that show your belly button...

72
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,859
But she explains everything simply
and she's easy to understand!

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,261
She's just too serious, she's no fun!

75
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,497
She's always so quiet and proper,

76
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,232
after class, when we ask her
to join us for refreshments,

78
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,300
she always turns us down...

79
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:55,868
She acts like

80
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:58,270
she's a very well bred daughter
of some blue blood family...

82
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,374
I mean, she's the first American I know,

83
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,810
I expected her to be more outgoing and...

84
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,145
Hey! Come on!!

86
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,318
You're Miss Jody,
our teacher aren't you...

88
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,854
What are you doing in a place like this...

89
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,525
Oh! Miss Mouri & Miss SUZUKI!

90
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,293
Eh? A teacher?

91
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,862
Hey! Isn't that Teitan High's uniform?

92
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,231
Which means you're
a high school teacher?

94
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,399
Oh for goodness sakes!

95
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,369
No, no, you've made a mistake!

96
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,139
What!?

97
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,309
You've been coming here
every day after school!'?

99
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,878
You, Miss Jody!?

100
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:13,646
Yes!

101
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,750
The games here in Japan are
so very beautiful & exciting!

103
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:18,884
Of course the games that come to the US
from Japan are very popular too!

105
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:19,084
Of course the games that come to the US
from Japan are very popular too!
Jody Santemillion (28)

109
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,921
Of course the games that come to the US

English 'Iieacher
JdTfl'V/Ji'J/J/ KO}

115
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,091
There's always such a long, long line,
I never get to play!

117
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,628
That's why I became an English teacher

118
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,632
That way,
I can play the newest games everyday!

120
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,502
She, she's a gamer...

121
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,571
You, you mean; yourle'ssons,

122
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,806
they're so textbook because...

123
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,107
Yes!

124
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,144
Because if I make a mistake & get fired,
it'd be, The End!

126
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:50,382
It's very, very hard for foreigners
to get jobs in Japan

128
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,620
That's why you mustn't tell anyone
I was here!

130
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,989
Please keep it as our secret!

131
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,625
OK, but you sure looked good!

132
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:00,559
That's right!

133
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,161
You reminded me of Billy the Kid!

135
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,066
If you think that was neat,
want to try another great game?

137
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,269
It's the most popular fighting game
in town now!

139
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,376
Hmm, I've never heard of this one...

140
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,010
Me too...

141
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,512
Just sit, go on!

142
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,349
First, put the headgear on

143
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,751
Insert a coin & stand by!

144
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,388
Play character" is beginner level

146
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:36,795
HUN?

147
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:37,963
What the...

148
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,366
Hey!

149
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,668
Are you ready?

150
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,806
When the right punch comes in lightly, go!

154
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:49,708
Oh, OK!

155
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,311
Ready. . .Go!!

156
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:54,580
Yikes!

157
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:55,381
O'C'ST!

158
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,549
Ouch, that hurt!

159
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,150
Ram?

160
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,418
That's right,

161
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,388
this is a virtual reality fighting game,

162
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,189
the player actually feels the damage!

163
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,625
Is it too much for a girl to handle?

164
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,094
Eeek! Ran, no, come on!

165
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:09,862
Go forward!

166
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:13,632
Oh come on!

167
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:33,986
You Win!

168
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,855
You did it!

169
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,324
She may not look it,

170
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:41,026
but Ran won first place in the State karate
championship tournament!

172
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,161
Oh! Champ

173
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,297
I§,ll"kill you!

174
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:46,965
What's this?

175
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,400
Someone's entered the game

177
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,369
But why, how?

178
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,937
Another player...

179
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,674
Another player's challenging you...

180
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,076
Eh'? I don't believe it...

182
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,610
Be careful

183
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:00,979
He is terrific.

184
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,915
He's beatable though...

185
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,021
Fight

188
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:23,769
Wha, what the...

189
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,677
You lose!

190
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,084
Now that you've lost,

191
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,786
why don't you just get out of chair,

192
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:43,555
That gold seat

193
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,356
That gold seat
Kengo Bitou (21)

196
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,592
is reserved for me & me alone...

00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,195
What are you talking about!'?

200
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,163
Ran!

201
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,266
Stay in that seat & try again,
it's payback, it's payback!

203
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,667
You're just wasting your time...

204
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:56,235
Eh!?

205
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,873
Besides the punch & kick mode,

206
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,911
he can manipulate all 4 control buttons
and create an undefeatable attack.

208
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,681
Today's the first time
you've ever tried the game,
Hitoshi Dejima (22)

212
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,150
you don't stand a chance of winning
Hitoshi Dejima (22)

215
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:13,552
Hmmmm

216
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:13,819
Hmmm

217
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:15,487
Hurry up!

218
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,123
What's taking you so long?

219
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,096
Yes sir, this seat's built just for me!

220
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,264
What a creep,

221
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,832
who is he anyway?

222
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,701
He's known as The Shisa of Beika
and it's gone to his head(

224
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,202
but he's just your neighborhood hoodlum.

226
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,672
He's been getting cockier lately

227
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,807
He's been getting cockier lately

238
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,811
Oh, and by the way miss...

239
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,213
your moves are bug

240
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,749
It may be called fighting,
but it's only a game

242
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,651
you don"t need strength.

243
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,853
See, watch him.

244
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,223
His movements are small,

245
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,926
he doesn't even look like he s fighting,
does he?

247
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,595
Uh, you were watching?

248
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,230
You watched us fight?

249
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,298
That's right,

250
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,200
on that big monitor...

251
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,802
There's usually a tape playing on it,

252
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:05,537
but when a challenge is made,

253
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,140
the game's shown.

254
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,276
I figure the only person
who can beat him...

256
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,612
Haido City's invincible...

257
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,147
Lutus from Haldo...

258
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,017
I'm the only one, right?

275
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,121
Yo, I've been waiting for you, brother!

276
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,456
Let's continue our fight

277
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,724
Give me a second...

278
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,493
Iet me smoke a cigarette first

279
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,605
Miss Jody, éome on,.
Let's get out of this place

281
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,806
Why?

282
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:41,773
She's right,

283
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,308
this isn't the only game arcade...

284
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,346
Alright but this racing game!

285
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,414
Let me do it one more time!

286
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,250
Good rief...

287
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,050
Goodness...

288
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,289
Wow, you're good!

289
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,290
Do it!!

290
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,293
I bet you're going to be the high scorer!

291
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,161
Phew...

292
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,330
she's a true blue gamer all right...

293
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:06,798
Fight?!

294
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,335
Those 2 have started to fight!

295
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,303
Forget about those two...

296
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,940
But it looks...

297
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,545
What a barrage...

298
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,548
Wow...

299
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,318
Eh? Who's winning?

300
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,320
There's no hit point gauge on that thing...

301
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:33,025
I think the more damage you suffer,
the bluer your face gets...

303
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,029
The guy who beat me is winning so far .

304
00:11:37,964 --> 00:11:38,830
Hmmm

305
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,166
Wow.

306
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,000
Again...

307
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:43,635
Wow...

308
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,174
Down!

309
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:51,510
Wow,

310
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,746
that special combination rheélly'did the job.

311
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,250
That Lutus from Haido's not so hot.

312
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,485
I don't think he can get up...

314
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:03,789
he's gonna deliver the finishing touch
before he gets up...

316
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,291
Hey, what's he doing...

317
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,027
He's got to finish him off quick,
time's running out!

319
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,199
Wham?

320
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,603
Oh brother what a dummy

321
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,872
It would've been an easy win
if he'd finished him off right then...

323
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,010
Hey...

324
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:26,812
something's wrong...

325
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,990
dead.

327
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,565
He died while playing a game?

328
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:48,767
Are you sure about that?

329
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:49,935
Oh yes

330
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,039
We were all watching their game
on the monitor...

332
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,609
He was on the verge of winning

333
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,746
and then all of a sudden,
hegstopped attacking.

335
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,279
And when we looked...

336
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:07,351
The man working the character
had stopped too, eh...

338
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,922
The deceased vs Kengo BRO,
21 years old,

340
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,691
presently unemployed

341
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,193
He is by nature quite rude

342
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,130
and his reputation at this arcade
isn't good.

344
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,298
I see,

345
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,901
so he was a man with many enemies...

346
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,705
Miss Mouri, do you know this man?

347
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:27,505
Yes...

348
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,641
he's my father's former boss...

349
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,475
Huh?

350
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,513
Oh, this is our school's English teacher!

351
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,648
English teacher?

352
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:37,916
Yes!

353
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,286
My name is Jody Santemillion!

354
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,355
( Lim'rpleas'ed» to meet you!

355
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,792
My name is Jozo Megure!

356
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,128
I am a Japanese policyman!

357
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,263
Policy?

358
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,300
Not policyman!

359
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,069
Policeman!

360
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,737
Po, poleeecemaan?

361
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,272
No,no,no.

362
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,374
Policeman, OK?

363
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,276
Pholeecemyan...

364
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,411
Uh, Inspector...

365
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,345
Ahem,

366
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,380
yes, the question is

367
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,349
why did he die during the game?

368
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,050
'Co...

369
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,553
We questioned the other customers,

370
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:19,491
no one noticed anyone suspicious
wandering around.

372
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:25,097
And it doesn't appear like Mr. Bito drank
or ate anything while he was playing,

374
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,833
so that rules out suicide...

376
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,603
what's with this et-u an we

378
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,905
It Iodks'like
something from a science fiction movie.

380
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,076
It's a virtual reality game...

381
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,481
The damage'i'nfllic't'ed by your opponent
shows on screen

383
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,284
and at the' same time,
the player feels it too.

385
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,887
The player feels the damage?

386
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,658
And on top of that,
if your opponent hits

388
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,661
or lekS you from over the guards,

389
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,165
the other player feels a slight sensation
in the arm or leg

391
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,467
so it seems like you're actually in a fight...

392
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,470
Hey waitfta minute, yo'ui'd'on't mean

393
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,672
that's what killed him...

394
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,108
The damage was too much,
he couldn't take it

396
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,110
h, no...

397
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,913
That would never happen.

398
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,718
All you feel is a Ilght vibration.

399
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,054
You know, like the vibration mode
on those cellular phones.

401
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,590
You can't kill someone
with only that much, can you?

403
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,592
And who are you?

404
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,798
I'm the guy that fellow
was playing against just before he died.

406
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,535
I thought I'd better come over before
you make me out to be the murderer...

408
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,539
Besides, I don't like to admit this but
I'm the one who was taking the beating.

410
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,477
I only got a couple of punches in.

411
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:52,017
And I was even chewing gum
to help my rhythmn, but it didn't help.

413
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,019
Is that true?

414
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,491
Yes...it did seem like
he was taking the brunt of the beating...

416
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,029
Hmm...
then what could have killed him...

418
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,632
Yes ..and there doesn't
seem to be any wound...

420
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,267
Maybe it was poison!

422
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,271
See, this man looks like he died of
suffocation,

424
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,208
but it doesn't look like he was strangled!

425
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,277
It would have to be poison, wouldn't it?

426
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,482
But Conan, this man died
while he was playing a game

428
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,620
and there's no indication he ate
or drank anything

430
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,289
Now, if he had been poisoned
before the game,

432
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,761
he would have looked sick or
at least felt sick, isn't that right?

434
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,698
Did you notice anything like that?

435
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,899
Uh, no

436
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,234
I didn't notice anything...

437
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,905
Just before that game, he was very
actively giving Ran a good beating...

439
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:51,042
But if you put the poison
in a syringe & inject it...

441
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,644
Hahaha.

442
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,514
If som'eéh'e tried to do that,
he would have gotten angry & yelled.

444
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,184
And th'e 'other customers
would Have heard "that...

446
00:16:59,418 --> 00:16:59,651
Hmmmm, you're-right...

447
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,120
Hmmmm, you're right...

448
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,722
Of course I am!

449
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,858
But Inspector, have you forgotten?

451
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,861
ThlS is a game arcade, isn't it'?

452
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:13,064
All the machines are off now
& everything's quiet, but usually

454
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,933
the place is filled with all kinds of sounds,

455
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:17,202
it's so noisy,
you can't even hear yourself talk!

457
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,473
And this man's arms & legs
are attached to the machine,

459
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,009
I don't think he could have moved
very well.

461
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,481
And these arcades are kept kind of dark
so that the screens are easier to see...

463
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,084
I see,

464
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,688
the victim was practically unprotected &
even if he yelled,

466
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,357
all the noise would have drowned
out his voice...

468
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,358
And in the dark room,

469
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,230
with most of the other customers
watching the monitor,

471
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,365
is would be possible to poison him...

472
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:52,037
All right then, let's have the body taken
to the coroner's for an autopsy!

474
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,172
Our first objective is to
determine the cause offideath!

476
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,507
Yes sir!

477
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,445
Uh huh...

478
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:04,316
Now to narrow down the list of suspects,

479
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,385
It s going to be qunte a job,

480
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,322
finding the killer among the nearly
30 people who were here.

482
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:14,459
I know who went close
to the man who died!

485
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,863
We were sitting right next to him
until just before he died,

487
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,802
we were watching Miss Jody do that
racing game.

489
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,136
Right?

490
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,204
Yes...

491
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,674
And then? Who went close to him...

492
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,477
That boy who works here!

493
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,146
And that tall boy!

494
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:39,416
And including the 4 of us, that makes 6...

495
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,685
Isn't that right, Miss Jody?

497
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:47,025
Yes, but this little boy isn't the only one
who was watching everything!

499
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:47,258
Eh'?

500
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:47,826
Eh'?

502
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,062
He's the other one...

503
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,935
A security camera

504
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:02,674
By chance, would everything be on that
camera?

506
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:03,742
Uh, sure...

507
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:08,680
Then can we Viewflm'xght aw av
along with the 6 others?

509
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,349
Of course...

510
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,283
Right away!

511
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,752
Follow me...

512
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,088
Will you all please come along?

513
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,762
What's that?
What 3 making this sound?

515
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,766
It sounds like something metal is hitting
something...

517
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,770
Luke it's rubbing something...

518
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,637
What Is it!?

519
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,509
Here it is! Around here.

520
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,246
The victim took his seat at about...

521
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,383
See, there we are getting
chased out of our seats

523
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,256
Isn't that you, Mr. Dejima?
What were you doing?

525
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:55,393
I was collecting the money
from the machines.

527
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,995
I see

528
00:19:56,996 --> 00:20:01,800
Oh? Now it's Mr. Shimizu...you two
seem to be having a conversation...

530
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,401
What were you talking about?

531
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,073
Before the game, I wanted to see
if I could get him to tell me his strategy...

533
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:10,341
but it was no use.

534
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,245
What's this?
What d he crouch for & pick up?

536
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,714
I dropped my lighter &
was just picking it up.

538
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,518
And then the game started...

539
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,520
Uh, Inspector!

540
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,122
Mr. Dejima is...

541
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,391
He's holding something in his hand?

542
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,259
A Video?
Is that what it is?

544
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,262
Yes, it was such a great game,
Ithoughtrdtapeit

546
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:35,600
Hey, don't I know you from some place?

547
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,403
No, you're probably mistaken.

548
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,339
Wow, you're right,
it really is something.

550
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,941
The blows keep coming.

551
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,142
Huh?

552
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:48,680
Ran, it looks like you & your friends
Ieft the racing game partway through.

554
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,951
Yes, the fight was so exciting,
we started to watch that.

556
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:58,289
What you're saying is,
Miss Jody & the victim were left alone...

559
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:06,431
But I was very busy playing the game.
I di'dnit even notice everyone-he'd left!

561
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:10,168
But still,
unless someone verifies your story...

563
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,771
It's true, Miss Jody never left her game!

564
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,307
Whpn we ran up to the body,

565
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,310
she had just reached the goal &
her score was the highest écore'tef/er!

568
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,947
I"IICI'I"DI,'IC.ILD III LIIC LAUGH...

569
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,416
that racing game's not easy
no one can score the highest score

573
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,892
Hmm...then who killed him...

575
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:37,629
Hey, what is this!

576
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,165
This man who just came out
from behind the victim...

578
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,302
Who In the world is that guy"?

579
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,772
Oh isn't that the man
who'awas playing mahjong?

581
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,940
Yes!

582
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,376
That's the man who was bad mouthing
the man who died!

584
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,177
What!?

585
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,579
Bring this man here right now!!

586
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,380
Yes sir!!

587
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:02,453
Judg'i'nO'*'ifi'om the condition of the body,
I'm posntl e he was poisoned...

589
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,392
That makes that? p'érsfion
the most suspicious...

591
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,928
and I'm sure there is evidence inside that.

592
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,531
Now about the needle
or hypodermic syringe...

594
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,334
nothing like that was on the floor...

595
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:21,005
I doubt the killer would still
be holding on to it...

597
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,075
Where...

598
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:30,748
where did the killer hide the weapon...

The poison was injected
under Bito's arm, right?

643
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,708
I don't think he'd let me stick him.
