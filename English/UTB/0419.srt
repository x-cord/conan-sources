You're Mr. Kogoro Mour:...aren't you?
The famed detective.

42
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:08,453
Y.Yes

43
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,424
You look way better in person than on TV .

45
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,497
E-hem
Uh. do you work here?

47
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,935
Oh. I'm Eiko Esumt. I run a Japanese inn,
front of the path to this shrine.

50
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,269
Oh~ a Japanese inn...

54
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,057
Oh I'm his daughter. Ran
And... he's @onan.

56
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,580
Hello. excuse me. what's that money there?

57
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,583
Really!
There's $0 much money stuck to it...

60
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,202
I guess you can call it
a kind of tradition. maybe?

63
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:42,337
If the coin gets stuck on it,
they say your wish us granted.

66
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:46,391
Which means,
I'll meet the person of my dreams?!

68
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,329
There! Go for it!

69
00:03:52,365 --> 00:04:01,907
Dam~There!! Darn you! Oh». darn it

71
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,510
Your wish will probably never be granted.

72
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:10,415
How luc « 10 have a hometown in a place
where the god of matchmaking is.

74
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,987
I have a tentative offer for marriage too

75
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,555
Tentative. .?

77
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,393
Is it with someone you don't really care for?

82
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,296
ge. 1 le a man is poor

83
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:29,067
I think he has money. Because he's
Involved in large-scale business.

85
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,603
He has a bad personality, then!

86
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:36,341
A rich-man with bad personality
IS the worst match in any category...

88
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,977
You should call off the marriage.

89
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:40,646
D. Dad!

90
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:41,213

But. \ ave a-reason fo (
not being able to refuse.

93

But when you get married-it should:be
with-someoneithat you really love, right?

95
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:53,158
What 1s the name of that man?
Mr. Koji Wanibuchi.

97
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:59,231
No matter what reasons you may have.
Reluctantly getting married with

99
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,033
Mr. Wanibuchi is like giving yourself up
as human sacrifice!

102
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,469
I'm sorry. Dad. come off it...

103

Shall we go see
an interesting miniature model?

108
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,415
Huh?! An interesting miniature model?

109
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,751
Did Izumo Shrine look like this before?

110
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,088
This 1s indeed
the worldiof mythology!"

112
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:26,625
Th § seems to have been
the biggest shrine in all of Japan...

114
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,860
I'm not sure of the details .

115
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,312
It I$ a shrine that was builtttowards
the end of the Heian Period

117
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:32,481

118
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,535
Sorry...can you wait a while...

119
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,573
He's Ryosuke Fukama.
A childhood friend of mine...

121
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,676
He used to like ancient history
since he was a child...

123
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,979
Hess lucky because he's working doing
what he likes...

125
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,584
Eiko actually hikes Mr. Fukuma

126
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,319
I'm sure he likes her to

127
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Yep... I'm sure he likes hér too

129
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:55,704
Ep... msure 1@ 1 es .er 00.

130
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,790
How exasperating,

132
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,429
All three pillars were creathdiby benching
three huge trees together as one.

134
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,497
Huh?

135
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,966
Eiko 1s going to be taken away
by a rich guy with bad personality because.

137
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:12,104
You don't keep a firm grip on her!

138
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,138
Yes?!

139
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:13,372
Cr Cr

141
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,539
Mr. Mourn

No. it's okay.

00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,682

You seem to be saying good stuff. but
Who knows what's actual} ON your ming...

153
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,126
The following day. murder is committed

155
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,173
A current price of 10-000.000 yen?!
That does it.

157
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,376
IvA current price of 1010002000syen!
That does it"

159
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:55,013
Stabbed right in the back

160
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,349
Don't let outsiders in here!

161
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,451
Don't tell me that you're

162
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:04,139
I'm Mouri. a private detective from Tokyo

163
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,225
Just as I thought!
I've heard of your activities...

165
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,027
I'm Officer Yamane of
the Izumo Police Department!

167
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,645
Likewise. I'm Officer Komura!

168
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:13,198
It's amazing how you got here

169
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,267
I just happened to be nearby

170
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,136
However. there seems to be no need for

171
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,506
the assistance of
a famed detective for this case.

173
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,141
How's that?

174
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:27,979
The victim, 1s Mr. Koji Wanibuch.
The owner of Wanibuchi Sogyo

176
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,184
that 1s doing extensive business centering
around the Izumo area. age 35...

178
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,653
Koji Wanibuchi 2!

179
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,589
Tihesfiancé that
Eiko was talking about yesterday?!

181
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,991
He was killed

182
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,060
So. you know him

183
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,664
He 1s a famous businessman that is well
known locally. as beinga wheeler-dealer...

185
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:50,802
The person who found him is
1a Coup e over were... weyre 0cCas...

188
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,573
Well. this is not alplace that
tourists would come...

190
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,109
The estimated time of death is
around 1:00 in the afternoon...

192
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,580
The time that Mr. Wanibuchi's watch
is thought to have broken when he fell.

194
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,082
It is stopped at 1:05

195
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,385
It's probably okay to determine
that it was time the murder was committed.

197
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:10,255
The motive of the killing was
probably due to a grudge.

199
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:14,025
Being a wheeler-dealer businessman,
he must've had a lot of enemies too.

201
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:17,195
He seems to have
had a bad personality too.

203
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,632
It's true that
he didn't have a good reputation.

205
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:25,303
But the purpose of the killer was to steal
his sword that is worth 10.000.000 yen.

207
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,873
A sword priced at 10.000.000 yen?!

208
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,343
This us Mr. Wambuohfs notebook

209
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,580
He was scheduled to
go to a local antique shop today

211
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,783
and get the sword as collateral
for lending money this afternoon.

213
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,520
I confirmed with the shop
and found that at>around 12:00 noon

215
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,255
they gave the sword
to Mr Wanibuchi,as promised.

217
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:49,995
After receiving the sword,
Mr. Wanibuchi came here to Inome...

219
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,565
And we're not sure for what,
but at around before 1:00.

221
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,101
He was witnessed
standing holding the sword...

223
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:01,005
However. when his body was found,
the sword was nowhere in sight...

225
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:05,627
So. the killer"who/saw;him receive
the sword:at'the.antique shop

227
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,130
may have tailed Mr. Wanibuchi and

228
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:19,891
So you see. this is a simple case
of robbing treasure.

230
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,980
So. there 1s no need for a detective
Yes. now I clearly understand...

232
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,702
I wonder If this case 1s really
ill that simple...?

234
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,538
Why come out all the way
to a place like this?

236
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,408
Moreoyerabringing a sword
worth 10.000.000 yen along...?

238
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,611
What're you thinking about?!

239
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,580
I'm not thinking anything!

241
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,717
I hate to.sa. -this.about
the late Mr. Wanibuchiibut.

243
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,721
Eiko won't have to get married
reluctantly anymore.

245
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,825
I know that I shouldn't be saying this

246
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:56,577
But, you were saying so yourself
yesterday 100...

248
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:58,997
That it's like human sacrifice

249
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,132
Well. you see that was

250
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,635
This case sounds similar to

251
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,570
the stor. of cettinernd of
nn, Tn, wT.
The Eight-forked serpent: doesn't it?

254
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,639
Getting rid of the Eight-forked serpent

255
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,492
the mythology of Susano-0-no-mikoto

256
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:15,513
There was an unfortunate princess that
was about to be taken awayagainst her will

258
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,882
when Susano-o-appears to save her.

259
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,350
When Susano-0 appears to.save her.

260
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,052
Thanks to Susano-o getting rid of
the Eight-forked serpent.

262
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,388
The princess Is rescued

263
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,490
and Susano-0 gets a hold of he
Eight-forked serpents sword!

265
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,791
It sure as similar

266
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,860
Don't,you think so

267
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:35,200
Heck, .Susano=0=no-mikoto may be a hero.
But the killer is nothing close to it!

269
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,903
It just sO happened-to help Eiko out.

270
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,906
But the guy's a robber

271
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,442
I Know: without you having 10 tell me.

272
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,510
All I'm saying is that

273
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,178
It seems similar to the mythology about
<ettin< rid of the Eu ht-forked ser >ent...

275
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,948
Right. Conan!

276
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,217
Yeah... .Ha, ha

277
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:56,788
This case was not just
a simple robbery after all.

281
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:06,698
Once a year when the gods
from all over Japan gather at Izumo

283
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,033
It 1$ said that they land here
on Inasanohama!

286
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,969
It 1s said that they land here
on nasanohama!

290
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:11,403
Huh?!

291
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,202
Huh?!

292
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,705
They're notlistening

293
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,141
I'm explaining: this to 'you

294
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,009
I wonder: if it-found.something?

295
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,044
Huh?

296
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,613
Woof! Woof! Bow-wow!

297
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,750
Huh?!

298
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:25,984
Huh?!

299
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,319
Don't tell me that's?!

300
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,189
I confirmed-it"'with the.antique shop owner

301
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,491
and was told that it was indeed
the sword in question

303
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,260
Just as I thought

304
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:36,461
I don't understand .

305
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:40,265
Why would you hide the treasure
so that gets covered with sand like this...

307
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:42,851
It was probably thrown away. not-hidden

308
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:44,385
because whoever it was'
didn't need it anymore...

310
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,908
Taking the sword away. from the site
of the murder-was a camouflage

312
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,711
to deceive people into thinking
It was acrobbery.

314
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,512
It's most likely that

315
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,650
the real motive of 'the culprit
was to take Mr: Wanibuchi's life!

317
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,287
' He real motive is most probably a grudge

318
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,589
Get a list on the double
of his business rivals

320
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:10,712
all the people in. Mr. Wanibuchi's private
\ life that he was having problems with!

322
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,598
Excuse me?

323
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh. no .

324
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,658
After-the list was*made. the following; day
four people were called in by the police...

326
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,948
Eiko and Mr. Fukuma were also
among the people who*were summoned...

328
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,856
I will be questioning you all
in tun insa"while...

330
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:42,494
But. before that I would like to introduce.

335
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,218
T.That famed detective!

337
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:58,409
Oh. well I didn't thank Aha

339
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,012
2-6)

343
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,147
W-9)
Oh. yes sir.

346
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,815
According to our investigation.

347
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,419
Mr. Wanibuchi approached your
shop of long standing-asking

349
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,556
if you'd hike to joint-=manage
the shop with him. is that right?

351
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,957
Joint management my foot!

352
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,980
Wanibuchi Sogyo will take care of
all'the management finances...

354
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:21,182
All you have to do is
Iend me thexname Ishitobr.

And we'll open stores throughout Japan

357
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,137
Fantastic. don't you think

358
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:30,207
You're not thinking of
refusing. are you? Fuh!

360
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,211
He tried to take over 'Ishitobi that
had been in business for 2.000 years

362
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,214
by threat and money!

363
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,149
Cliseean

364
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:44,022
Next Mr. Takehiko Fujie. you run
a wedding hall-called-Ryounkaku and...

366
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:47,091
The same went for my place
as Mr Ishitobijust mentioned.

368
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,895
We:at Wanibuchi Sogyo are thinking of

369
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,764
into the wedding hall
management business.

371
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,164
Hh 71

372
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,933
But: Ildonot:want to fight for customers

373
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,303
with Ryounkaku that
is a place of long standing...

375
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,238
Son I would like to make a proposal...

376
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,574

380
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,111
What:do you: think?

381
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,834
Fujie. my.isuperior? Fuh.

Ws 44
@ wanted to take over!

384
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,255
Superior?

385
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,591
Wanibuchi was an under
classman of mine...

387
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,393
of Teito University economics
department. in Tokyo.

389
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,562
Oh. at the university

390
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,233
His name means crocodile.
But his character 1s like/that of a snake.

392
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,302
A monster that swallows up
anything he targets as prey...

394
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,504
he's just like the Eight:forked serpent!

395
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,574
I see .

396
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:41,713
Ms. Eiko Esumi. you also had business
connections with Mr. Wanibuchi?

398
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,014
Yes. Sir

399
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,817
Our inn Hinodeya is .also
an inn of long standing

401
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,820
but wear and tear kept getting worse

402
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,272
Butt-we couldn=t afford to renovate it .

403
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:53,558
At about that time. we were
contacted by a company in Tokyo

405
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,827
saying that they'd like-to build
a modern hotelsin™its place

407
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,396
so they would like us
to sell them our land...

409
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,798
Just when-my parents were thinking

410
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,667
there was no other choice
than to let go of the inn}.

412
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,771
It's absurd to make an inn with such long #7 >
standing: as Hinodeya:go out of business!

414
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,774
Let us help you with the renovation fees!

415
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,460
For the sake of Izumo!

416
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:13,695
It was unexpected.

417
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:17,282
Because from what I heard of him.
he was a greedy man and nothing else...

419
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,853
My parents accepted his offer
thankfully and renovated the inn.

422
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,123
Let my daughter marry you?!

423
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,659
What's come over: youralliof'a'suddenyg'!

424
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,744
It-$ notall of a sudden

425
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,913
I lent-yousthe:money for renovation

426
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,332
because this is thebirth home of the
woman who is to become my wife...

428
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,334
For what other reason would anybody
something like this. - Fuh, fun...

430
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,537
He was planning on-it to begin with...

431
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,206
He said 10 give the total of the
money he lent back right away.

433
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,808
Is I refuse to marry him.

434
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:44,309
Oh no.

435
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,076
Oh no

436
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,947
My parents told me tat jythey
havelto give me up to a guy like that

438
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,015
they'd rather let go of the inn...

439
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,184
But I know how much that inn

440
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:58,022
that haswbeen handed down
for generations mean to them...

442
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,273
Thatssswhy I

443
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,992
Mr: Fukuma.

444
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,394
Not being able to leave
Ms. Esumi in her plight.

446
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,265
Ou went time.and ac ain 10 ask
Mr. Wanibuchito ask him to let her go

450
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,433
didn't you?

451
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,233
I hated him.

452
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:09,834
Lihatedihim.

453
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,887
I hated that man too

455
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,247
Next, at the time that
Mr Wanibuchi was murdered .

459
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:28,703
please tell me where and what
each of you were doing...

462
00:16:28,704 --> 00:16:30,288
First of all.

463
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,523
I was at Matsue Castle!

464
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,525
Matsue Castle?

465
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,196
I was alone so I have no one to prove it

466
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,548
I signed my*name on t

467
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,700
the list of the castle tower .

469
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:44,435
Uh- Mr. Fukuma...

471
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,837
Uh- Mr. Fukuma...

472
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:51,142
It was my day off yesterday so.
I went'to Old Taisha Station.

474
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,346
I was there from a little
before noon to about 3-00...

476
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,216
I go there often.
Because ll can relax there. 4

478
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,483
But. I was alone 100.
$0 there are no witnesses to, prove it.

483
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,953
But, I was alone 100.
SO there are no witnesses to prove it.

485
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,855
Then. Mr. Ishitobi

486
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,558

TL 2 SN «

517
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,142

00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,993
1:05...

520
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:05,166
He wrote his name on the list
at the very time the victim was killed...

So. I'm not a suspect anymore

528
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:20,264
The problem is the

oO o/,
We cannot get any eyewitnesses at all

532

No...

543
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,262
I wonder why.there are
no witnesses whatsoever...

545
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,464
Could it be that they're lying...

550
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,737

00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,903
ou did it. didn't you .

567
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,038
You killed Mr. Wanibuchi. didn't your'!

568
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,508
I stand mute...

569
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,511
He's exercising his right to remain silent?!

570
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,481
Yes... but if he's the one who did it

571
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,183
that explains why there were no
witnesses at Old Taisha Station.

573
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,184
Iv L100
that explains why there were no
witnesses at Old Tasha Station

576
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,418
that explains why there were no
I witnesses at Old Taisha Station

578
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,021
Because he had killed
Mr Wanibuchi at Inome

580
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,807
and got rid of the sword at Inasanohama!

581
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:53,156
BY HL

582
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,309
I guess he's the one

583
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,527
Ryosuke Fukuma...

584
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,862
Oh. no!

585
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,265
Since the:sand and soil
were found:on his shoes.

587
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,100
As well as a witness having seen him...

588
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,636
He probably did take the
swordaway from the site

590
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,622
and buried it at the beach

592
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,843
It's not enough to conclude that
he's the one who killed the victim...

594
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,911
Huh?

595
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,631
Wl went to Hinomisaki.

596
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,799
That reaction

597
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,287
Mr Fukuma knew
where Eiko was really at that time

599
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,722
Which means?!

600
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,224
Agh...

601
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,858
Hey. where are you going?

602
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:37,635
Why you~ brat, going into
the interrogation room on your own!

604
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,270
No. Conan! 7

605
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:39,804
Onh~ because I think that

606
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:40,637
Oh~ because I think that

607
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:41,339
Oh~ because I think that

608
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,577
Mr. Fukuma isn't saying anything
because he's protecting the real killer

610
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,413
Just as I thought

611
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,182
Aha. see. I'm right

612
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:51,983
Aha. see. I'm nght .

613
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:57,488
He probably saw the real killer Kill
Mr. Wanibuchi at Inome Cave...

615
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,258
But. I wonder who that real killer is?

617
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,862
Who else wouldvhe have to protect
but just one person...

619
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,599
You witnessed Ms. Eiko Esumi
commit the murder...

621
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,370
That's why you took the sword
away to make it look like a robbery...

623
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,738
Is that it?

624
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,439
I did it!

625
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,041
I'm the one who killed Wanibuchi!

626
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,944
It's too late saying it now.

627
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,779
Me?...

628
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,281
It-$ not me!

629
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:29,320
Then, at the time Mr. Wanibuchi was
murdered where were you really at?

632
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:33,724
You said you were at Hinomisaki,
but nobody saw you there...

634
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,993
The hghthouse worker non the
souvenir shop employee: nobody!

636
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:36,978
Souvenir shop employee. nobody!

637
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,299
She's:doing the same
thing as Mr. Fukuma...

639
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,233
She sounds like she's
protecting somebody...

641
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:48,572
It"was my day off yesterday so.
I went 10,01d Tasha Staton.

643
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,274
It'could be that.

644
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:56,614
Uh, I'll.bet.you're protecting Mr. Fukuma
because you know that he's the killer?

650
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,985
Aha .

651
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,870
I was right after all

652
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,357
He...

653
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,224

654
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:08,559

The lovers are protectingreachsother

659
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,073
Ha. ha... which of you is the killer!

660
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,909
Neither of them may be the killer?!

661
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,810
We're going to prove that!

662
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,146
And where to?

663
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,217

So it seems

711
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,363
What's the meaning of this?

712
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,249
Suddenly there are times of the day entered.

713
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,752
