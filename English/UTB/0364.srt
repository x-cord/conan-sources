different person from a while ago...

00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,725
It can't be...

63
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,995
because I got a call a while ago saying
that it was definitely brought there .

65
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,797
Please check carefully once more.

67
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,144

It's good.

72
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,192
I feel bad for dad. though.

73
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,128
It can't be helped because he's working...

74
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:08,934
W. What the?!

77
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:09,868
A.A person.

78
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,802
Kyaah!!

79
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:11,837
What is it?!

80
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,671
A man fell.

81
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,739
Conan!!

82
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,708
It was'...the man
we saw just a while ago!

84
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,276
Which means that...

87
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:22,713
py, 4
This sucks.

91
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:23,882
This sucks...

93
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,751
and I was tailing him.

94
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:46,071
Shoichiro... Hitomi age 45.
I've been tailing him since this morning

96
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,207
However, please do not ask
me who asked me to do so.

98
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,977
What on earth happened?

99
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,280
Let me explain...

100
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,128
Kyaaaaaaah!!!

101
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,164
I didn°t want him to know
that: was tailing him but...

103
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,834
\ aaaaah Noooo" Don!

104
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,137

00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,941
D.Don't tell me that?!...

106
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,581
Agh 7!

107
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:05,300
Are you okay?

108
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,486
You're...

109
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,787
Oh, oh...

110
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,295
S,Sorry...l don't know
what's come over me.

112
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,130
Just whatiare youstalking about?

113
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,133
Never mind that hurry and
get down from there!

115
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,305
N.No.

116
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,907
Please overlook this.

117
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,650
Agh!!

120
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,496
I don't know.

121
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:52,664
Huh..\.

122
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,634
I'd like to ask you"that "question myself...

124
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,707
H.He tried to attack you, you know.

125
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,545
What do you mean you don't know...

126
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,148
It's true! I really don't know who he is'!

128
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,185
Ms. Kaoru Minamisato...

129
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:14,885
Yes. sir?

130
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:18,255
That's the name that's
registered on the guest list

133
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,759
but. isn't your real name Kanako Hitomi?

135
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:20,992
but, isn't your real name Kanako Hitomi?

137
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,930
And, who's that supposed to be?

138
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,867
The wife of Shoichiro's
younger brother Takehiko.

140
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,705
No. inspector, I've seen
Kanako in a picture but

142
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,374
why did you think so?

143
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:41,112
When"! checked the history of
incoming calls on Shoichiro's cell phone,

145
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,783
the last personshée had
talked to was Kanako Hitomi.

147
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,019
Calls....? What time was it?

148
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,421
11:20.

149
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:49,721
11:20.

150
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,755
Oh. if so...

151
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:54,459
He went in at 11:10

152
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,696
and came out at 11:30.

153
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:05,637
I guess, he called his wife from
¢ inside the toilet during this time...

155
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,476
Uh... may I be excused. now?

156
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:13,345
Yes...

157
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,848
Irm.sorry, I'd like to be left alone.

158
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,952
The name was Anzai. wasn't it?

159
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,920
Huh?!

160
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:22,520
You knew, the name you mentioned
at the front desksa while ago...

162
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,225
You know, the name you mentioned
at the front desksa while ago...

164
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,563
Is there anything
for me from a Mr. Anzair...?

166
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:36,635
Ill know Mr Anzal...
Is anything wrong with that?

168
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,836
No...

169
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:38,036
No...

170
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,581
What an outright lie to say
she doesn-t- know Shoichiro...

172
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,683
Maybe she really doesngt- know him.

173
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,718
No darn way!

174
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:54,853
Huh

175
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,354
What happened?

176
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,891
Pops. don't you think this is strange?

177
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,359
What is?

178
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,029
Because Shoichiro had
a cell phone, didn't-he?

180
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,066
Then why did he use the public phone?

181
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,335
Maybe his phone was
out of the service-area.

183
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,238
It doesn't seem to be so

184
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,124
True.

185
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,209
Mr. Mouri! Bad news!

186
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,878
W.What's the matter?

187
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,914
Ook at that TV over there...

188
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:28,720
This is thessite of the crime, Haido Condo.
The man who was killed is

190
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:33,625
It's T,Takehiko,
Mr. Shoichiro's younger-brother...

192
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:38,930
The same age... Huh?
You mean.... they're twins!

194
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:43,501
The estimated time of death is
around 12:15 in the afternoon today...

196
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:50,375
N.No way. 12:15 is the
same time that... .Shoichiro!

198
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,813
Huh? No way: :.Is something
Iike that possible?!

200
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,890
What?! Tithe one that asked
you to investigate on Shoichiro

202
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,827
was his younger. brother,
Takehikorwho: was killed at Haido?!

205
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,964
What!

206
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,501
And. what did Takehiko want you to do?

207
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,503
To check on his behavior.

208
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,840
According to 11akehiko, Shoichiro,
because of the fact that.

211
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,876
they were.identical twins
who looked exactly alike

213
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,846
may have been posing to be him

214
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,582
and doing fraudulent business...

215
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,383
Oh, and what did you come up with?

216
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,586
Othing definite yet...

217
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,889
However, it does seem that
he had a huge amount of debts,

219
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,526
and someone came after him
this morning too, demanding him to repay.

222
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,962
Which means

223
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,698
that Shoichiro came
to Beika Hotel because

225
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,068
he came up with some
good idea to pay the money back?

227
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,672
Synchronicity!!

228
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,342
W What's: with you,
shoutinglout.of the blue?

230
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:01,646
To think that the older and younger brother
who were twins died at the same time,

232
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:05,917
seems to be a coincidence, however.
Maybe that's not all there is to it.

234
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:09,387
Maybe there was something
more fateful involved there...

236
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,589
You mean that's synchro?

237
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,625
Synchronicity.

238
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,728
That's the theory that
psychologist Jung came up with.

242
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,433
You- know, maybe it's the same as

243
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,570
how we ran into you-at this hotel. dad...

244
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,207
I see. I guess you could say so...

245
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,077
There is a possibility of it
being a coincidence, but I wonder...

247
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,114
Right... but. everything fits in too well.

248
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:40,018
We've got to scrutinize that
two cases a bit more closely.

250
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,288
The;door was locked.

251
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,690
There are no signs: of the door
being forced opened either. %

254
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:47,725
Oh...

255
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,228
What an odd looking key hole.

256
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,531
Wawouldntibe easy to make a spare key.

257
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,940
Was he killed here?

258
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:14,152
AS you can see, thewindow
IS cracked from the outside...

260
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,621
It seems to have been a robbery...

261
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:17,922
Hmm .

263
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:22,360
someone who broke in to rob him,

264
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,997
it would*have nothing
to do with the case in Beika.

266
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:29,000
Could it actually be
a mere coincidence... after all...

268
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,675
You returned home
around 2:00 in the afternoon.

270
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,646
Saw your husband dead,
and called the police?

272
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,547
Yes, sir...

273
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,149
And. where did you return home from?

275
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,417
Beikacho.

277
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:47,352
Huh...

278
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,319
Beikacho?!

279
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,754
BBeikacho...

280
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,259
Is anything wrong?

281
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,929
Is this supposed to be synchronicity too?!

282
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,866
Uh, we were at Beikacho
just before coming here

284
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:02,100
Uh. we were at§Belikacho
just before coming here

287
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,669
Oh...l see...

289
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,806
Shoichiro fell to his
death from Beika Hotel

294
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:09,440
Huh

295
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,243
Sh.Shoichiro did:...

296
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,279
Oh no. is that true?

297
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,447
It's true

298
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:22,553
Could it be that you went to
Beikacho to meet Shoichiro there?

300
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,390
The thing is, we found after
checking the outgoing calls

302
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,126
that he made on his cell phone,
that he had called you

304
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,195
Yes...

305
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,433
Please tell us what he
wanted to talk to'y about &

309
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,103
JI ~OI1OIC.THIT CO) T1111 orice Cl =
that he wanted to make up

312
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,540
with my husband and asked me
to act as their go-between. . &@

315
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:42,941
with 'my husband and asked me
to act as their go-between...

317
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,009
Oh. make-up...

318
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,713
Yes... .the thing is.

319
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:55,136
Shoichiro and Takehiko had been working
at fathemws company for quite some time.

321
00:15:55,137 --> 00:16:01,059
And there were times wheénithe subject
of who will be succeeding father'came-up.,

323
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,462
However, just about then,
father suddenly passed away...

325
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:09,033
Why is its ou. Why are you,
my kid brother, the president!

327
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,586
Don't ask me. it was in father's will!

328
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:15,406
Well! it's not that ll don't understand
;why he decided so. though.

330
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,508
WwW. What?!

331
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,211
I hear your wife went
back to her home country.

333
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,181
Didn't you realize that
she was onl after your money?

335
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,650
That's what father
based his decision on...

337
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,485
ugh...S,Shut up!

338
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,658
You're fired. Get out of here. this minute!

339
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,162
Shoichiro then started
a company of his own,

341
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:42,600
but it didn't work-out
either and went bankrupt

343
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:46,037
Ieaving him:deeply in debt...

344
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,773
The several nights ago...

345
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:55,580
I apologize: Please: I was wrong.

346
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,516
So. please...

347
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,787
No. I beg you. I. I need money...

348
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,757
Rhooey

349
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,464
Ii don't owe you anything.

350
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,732
Kugh

351
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,435
If only...

352
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:21,706
If only you weren't here...

353
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:30,014
I wanted them to make-up and become
the two brothers that I had know before.

355
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:35,219
Therefore, Just in case, I secretly
gave Shoichiro my cell phone number,

357
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,322
as well as the
spare key to the house...

359
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,595
On the other hand, Takehiko
thinking that Shoichiro being

361
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:49,300
as cornered as he was: may
scheme up something using his name,

363
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:52,070
asked me to keep an eye on him.

364
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,906
To think that both of them
would die at the same time...

366
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:59,310
Is this a coincidence,
or rather. some work of fate . ?

368
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:05,216
Uh. what did Shoichiro want
when he called you, Kanako?

370
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:08,953
She just said that
He-wanted-to make up ,

372
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,355
Rather. please. I'd like to know too.

373
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,357
Could you tell us more in detail
hat the call was about...

375
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:13,691
Could you tell us more in detail
what the call was about 7?

377
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,293
Yes. sir...

378
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,367
Yes?

379
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,669
Is Tvakehiko in?

380
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,106
Yes: he is. would you like me to getthim?

382
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,440
No. never mind.

384
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,245
R.,Rather. I'd like to discuss
something with you, Kanako...

386
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,781
I'd like to make-up with
Takehiko, but I wonder

388
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:41,018
if you could act as go-between for us.

389
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,324
Really, my, that's great.
Yes. of course, I'di'beThappy to!

391
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:49,093
Will you please come
meet me at Beikacho then?

393
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,728
Where in Beikacho?

394
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:55,800
Beika Station at 12:30
in front of the wicket. Bye.

397
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,437
gikA

399
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,676
although I waited for quite some time,
Shoichiro never showed up...

401
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:13,117
I had no idea that things
would turn out this way...

404
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,929
Hmm .

405
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,899
I wonder if he.was 5
gplanning to-see her after *

407
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,535
he finished: what he
had:to:do at-Beika Hotel.

409
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,069
I guess so...

410
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,906
Only, that's if we believe Kanako's story

411
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,342
I don't see any reason why we shouldn't.

412
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:40,912
For instance

413
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,781
for her.to sneak? into: Takehiko's
house using that tree over there,

415
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,302
no matter how you look at it,
It's impossible for"her to do so.

417
00:19:48,303 --> 00:19:49,520
I guess so,

418
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,022
which means that
it is a robbery case after all.

420
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,624
If so...

421
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,328
the two cases.are not related
to each other in any way

423
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,916
It can only be explained
as a case of "synchronicity.

425
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:06,070
But, just to be on the safe side,
Iet's check on Kanako's alibi too.

429
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:13,160
If Sh@Oichiro didn't die...
He would've met with Kanako and

431
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,247
they would both have d)perfect alibu,

432
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:21,285
This would exclude them from the
suspect list of Takehiko's omicide case.

434
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,620
But,

435
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,122
Shoichiro fell to his death in Beika...

436
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,159
And, another character Kaoru Minamisato
comes Into the picture

438
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,028
Although this case involved
a simple relationship between

440
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,731
two brothers and the wife,
the appearance of Kaoru

442
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,666
makes the structure of
the case even more complex

444
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,971
Karou Minamisato...

445
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,540
who on earth is she anyway?

446
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,410
But really: dofstknow who he is!

447
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:51,249
How can you say you don't know him?
He attacked you. didn't he. Shoichiro?

449
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,853
He must've hand a grudge on you
or jealous of you or something.

451
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:00,591
You don't know him. That's something
that is totally unbelievable

453
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,927
Just what do I have 10 do.
to get you to believe me?!

455
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,162
Please tell Us the truth!

456
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,132
It's true, I'm not lying

458
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:13,471
Why would IRlie to you after going
through something frightening like that!!

460
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,874
God. you tell me!!

461
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:21,979
Why...Why is this all happening to me!!

463
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,892
012°
The incident in Haido is a homicide
so Investigation will continue

466
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,229
but this incident can probably
be closed as an accident

468
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,164
Huh... is this a mere accident?

469
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:44,568
Well, it's true that the fact that Shoichiro
falling to his death was an accident,

471
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,837
but what about the fact
that he attacked Kaoru?

473
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:47,238
But what about the fact
that he attacked Kaoru?

475
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:47,722
But what about the fact
that he attacked Kaoru?

477
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,673
Assault and battery...maybe
it's a case of attempted homicide!

479
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:49,540
Assault+-and battery... maybe
it's a case of attempted homicide!

481
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,591
Assault-and battery maybe
It's a case of attempted homicide!

483
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:50,941
Assault and battery...maybe
it's a case of attempted homicide!

485
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,411
Even $0, the case is closed
through the death of the suspect

487
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,413
and when the necessary
papers are turned in.

489
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,315
Oh no .

490
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,017
Hmm, I'm sure shess
hiding something, though.

492
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,120
Wonder if she's
trying to protect someone?

494
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:07,358
I'm sure the press will pursue
this case though as-an odd case.

496
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,462
In which twin brothers died at
the same time in two 'separate places.

498
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,631
Maybe it's synchronicity after all.

499
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:18,435
Wrong. that's not it.
This is not a case of synchronicity.

501
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,074
The line that connects
Kaoru with the others...

503
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:27,812
If I can figure out what that is,
the mystery would be solved.

506
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,315
Why did Shoichiro attack,
rather, try to kill Kaoru...

508
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,350
{For what reason?

509
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,517
For what reason?
