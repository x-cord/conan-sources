1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,201
Suspense and deduction
closes the gap between

3
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,036
two people's love and hate

4
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,738
Officer Takagi makes a mistake

5
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,473
Let's help him Youth Detective Squad!

6
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,208
He sees through the one and only truth

7
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,243
a child in appearance
with the IQ of an adult

9
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,679
nojcase is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

11
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,482
Hey. everyone

12
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,917
Something has happened.

13
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,252
What? Detective Takagi

14
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,187
Where is he now?

15
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,422
He-he's over there in that park.

16
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,443
Yes, really. =

17
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,113
he's trying desperately to find something.

18
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,582
Is he finding evidence of a.case;?

19
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,251
No, he isn't,
because he isn't wearing gloves

21
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,489
Ah-ha. I got it!

22
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,523
What?

23
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:39,658
That should be here somewhere.

24
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,527
It cannot be anywhere but here

27
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,364
Oh, it's you

28
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,233
We're ready to help you Well.

29
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,702
You'd do the same for us
if we were in trouble.

31
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,303
I know. I know.

32
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,173
You lost something like this, right?

33
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,242
How do you know about it?

34
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,046
Don't you know
we're the Detective Boys.

36
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,214
I can see all what you are doing.

37
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,281
If you don't find it...

38
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:04,650
You're in big trouble. aren't you?

39
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,352
Of course I am.

40
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,687
It's very important to a police person.

41
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,122
It comes second only to his or hew life.

43
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,126
What you lost is

44
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,195
Maybe not your purse, but

45
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,129
Oops

46
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,832
Oh. you lost your police notebook.

47
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,601
Hush! Don't speak so-loud.

48
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:25,938
Uh-oh. This is no good at all.

49
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:33,179
Missing Case of Police Notebook

50
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,349
This morning I realized that
I hadslost my notebook.

52
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,150
And I looked through mygroom
but couldn't find it.

54
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,218
And I looked through mygroom
but couldn't find it.

56
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:39,718
And I looked through mygroom
but couldn't find it.

58
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,589
Are you sure you were carrying it
on your duty yesterday?

60
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,491
Yes, I'm sure.

61
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,893
And then, on the way home.

62
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,696
I happened to pass in front of this park.

63
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,999
Shut your mouth! YOU, liar.

64
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,568
Hey. cut it out!

65
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,169
What're you doing?

66
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,839
YOU Cheat!

67
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,007
I oughta beat you here and now!

68
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,910
Break it up. you two.

69
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,847
Step off! Don't mess with me.

70
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,483
I'm a police officer and

71
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,118
am telling you to stop fighting right now.

72
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,023
I must have lost it then.

73
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,359
So: youircdigoking for it around here.

74
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:24,196
Do you think that maybe one of the two
fighting guys picked up the 1 dBtebook?

76
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,165
Oh. that's right.

77
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,634
I think that's very likely.

78
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:31,971
So. do you remember
those two men's names?

80
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,139
Or what about their addresses?

82
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,644
Wa-— Wait

83
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,014
Why can't you believe me. Hanzaki?

84
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,350
Hanzaki.

85
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,419
The younger one's name was Manzaki.

86
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,788
Anything else you remember about them?

88
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,659
How can I believe you.

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,962
I'm gonna tell you, my manager, that
I'm still a struggling singer

91
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,864
because all those jobs that
you got were always crap for me.

93
00:04:58,999 --> 00:04:59,765
The truth is that

94
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,167
you have to pay your dues in
Enka (Japanese Ballad) business

96
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,067
You know that!

97
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,637
Have a little more patience, please.

98
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,973
How many times are you
gonna say that huh?

100
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,475
I know you've
deceived me for a long time.

102
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:15,181
Give me back my time up to now
and the money you owe me,

104
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,749
you bastard.

105
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,484
Hey. hey! Hold on. you guys.

106
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,757
So. he's a struggling singer.

107
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,593
Don't you remember
what kinda shoes they were wearing?

110
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,462
That reminds me...

111
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,933
The man named Hanzaki was
wearing sandals.

113
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,001
Oh I see.

114
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,771
Er aps 1@ ives neary.

115
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,838
Yeah! OK, then.

116
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,210
Let's look for him together.

117
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,346
But what if that man lhasA>> picked it up?

119
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,882
why don't we divide into teams of two?

120
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,651
One is to go find
the man named Hanzaki

122
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,020
and the other is to loo &for
the notebook in this park.

124
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,588
Alrighty.

125
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,990
One-Two-Three

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,826
Sorry to leave , ou here.-Hang on.

129
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,826
See a.

130
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:02,728
Oarno.

131
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,102
No good,
there is no such name.

133
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,905
What about asking
the record companies?

135
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,173
I'm afraid that's impossible.

136
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,276
There're an awful lot of big
and small record companies.

139
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,346
asking one by one

140
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:21,780
Excuse me,

142
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,550
but do you know
the man named Hanzak\?

144
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,719
He IS a singer and supposed to
Iive around here somewhere

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,753
He is a singer and supposed to
Iive around here somewhere.

148
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,989
Pardon me. sir...

149
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,158
Uh-ha, the police handbook...

150
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,693
Yeah

151
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,764
I wonder...What if he can't find it?

152
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,965
Detective Ta "ag.

153
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,801
Perhaps..he's..in a pathetic state.

154
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,870
YOU CHEESEHEAD!!

155
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,939
You lost your police notebook,
which is supposed to be

157
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,140
an extension of a
police officer's soul and mind.

159
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,075
Get out. You're fired!

160
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,344
Detective 1akagl What 3 real pity.

161
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,013
H-hey. you.

162
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,448
This is NOT the time for a snack.

163
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,316
Help me you two.

164
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:58,550
Oh. sorry.

165
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,986
Oh. they came back.

166
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,056
Hey. how did it go?

167
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,189
Did you find the man?

168
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,458
No. we didn't.

170
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,528
We can't find him by na ie and looks

172
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,730
We can't find it either.

174
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,632

I'm sorry for the trouble last night.

So is this the man everyone
is talking about?

195

Mr- Hanzakil.

196
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,753
Why now? I just wish you had
walked by earlier.than you actually did.

198
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,691
Mr. Hanzaki, did you pick up
anything last night?

200
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,492
My stuff um. like this

201
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,662
No. I didn't.

202
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,565
Perhaps neither did the manager. I think.

203
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,334
OK. you didn't.

204
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,736
You lost your thing like this. right?

205
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,571
Am gonna Inc 1 wi 1 you

206
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,408
Thanks but you don't have to do that.

207
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,844
Just wanna repay for your'kindness.

208
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,347
Last night, thanks to you Detective

209
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,083
the manager and I
could get back together soon.

211
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,620
So. today. we were supposed to
have a lunch.meeting together, but

213
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,624
I was waiting for him at my apartment,
but he didn't come

215
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:17,563
I guess he is getting drunk
at his house, by now

217
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,998
He always boozes You know.
That's the trouble

219
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,474
I called him several times
but the manager didn't pick up the phone

221
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,777
That means he is now getting
falling down drunk at his house.

223
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:32,845
I assure you.

224
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,147
If you think he doesn't show up
no matter how long you wait,

226
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,283
then why don't you
go to his house yourself?

228
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,620
Cuz, it takes one and a half our
to get there

230
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,822
even if I drive at top speed. you know.

231
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,591
I think that's a bother

232
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,560
Oh, something is attached to you.

234
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,999
Oh. it's a shampoo.

235
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,968
A little while ago
when I cleaned my bathroom,

237
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,204
I accidentally stepped on
the shampoo bottle.

239
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,505
Hu Al

240
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,976
By the way
do you have the time, Detective?

242
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,247
One o'clock. It's just one o'clock.

243
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,383
Uh-oh, it's already one o'clock.

244
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,252
We'd better hurry-and find it!

245
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,088
All right already. You
don't have to help.me anymore

247
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,090
But. Oh!

248
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,959
So then, let me buy your lunch, please?

249
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,128

all you can eat for two hours.

00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,296
Come on, come on.

252
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,866
No thanks. I'll pass on that one.

253
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,334
I understand...

254
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,637
But you don't have to be so modest.

255
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,005
All right,

256
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,674
I'll eat as much as I can for two hours.

257
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,010
See ya, Detective

258
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:39,878
What a strange man.

259
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,013
He's too weird

260
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,016
If they hadn't picked it up

261
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,617
then it must be still here somewhere.

262
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,888
That man, Hanzaki...
I suspect he s up to something.

264
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,589
Yeah.

265
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,260
I wonder why
he bothered to ask what time it was.

267
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:55,794
Yeah,

268
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,630
it's hard to think that someone
in this neighborhood doesn't know

270
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,467
that clock.

271
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,004
Yet, he bothered to ask Detective Takagi,
what time it was?

273
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,806
What for?

274
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,441
I got it!

275
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:10,108
What?

276
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,744
Oh. have you found it?

277
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,746
Uh. no. not yet I mean.

278
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,281
It isnt about the notebook.

279
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:17,683
Oh, all right.

280
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,585
Then what did you get?
Don't scare me like that, man

282
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,821
'ev... Everyone. gather around.

283
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:24,957
What!

284
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,759
That man named Hanzaki
killed the manager?

286
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,395
Mitsuhiko, are you sure?

287
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,997
I'm 100% sure about it.

288
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,198
And also he killed him just now.

289
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,301
Hanzaki seemed to think that
he's still a struggling singer

291
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,803
because of the manager and
to Hold a grudge agaist him for it.

293
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,839
So far as I know now. he has a motive:!

295
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,143
The droplet of shampo clung to the
bottom of his trousers. right?

297
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,446
Yeah, he said, he accidentally
stepped ontthe shampoo bottle

299
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,880
while cleaning his bathroom.

301
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,283
First of all,
I wondered why he lied about it.

303
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,217
Did he lie?

304
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,687
It goes without saying that
you should roll up your pants

306
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,557
SO as not to get it wet
while cleaning your bathroom.

308
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,792
And if he rolled up his pants.

309
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,161
The shampoo shouldn't stick to
the bottom of it.

311
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,299
That is. he was not cleaning his bathroom.

312
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,135
But he was in the bathroom
for anther purpose.

314
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,303
What?

315
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,171
W wait a sec. Mituhiko!

316
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,806
And then?

317
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,308
This morning,
Mr. Hanzaki called the manager

319
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,077
to com) to his apartment,

320
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,346
saying that
he wanted to make up with him.

322
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,551
That's enough.

323
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,787
I can't drink that much Oops.

324
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,356
Phew

325
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,659
He skillfully encouraged the manager,
a heavy drinker to drink Sake.

327
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,194
He drank the manager

328
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:39,498
After waiting for the time to be right,
at just before 1 PM

330
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,000
He carried him to
his apartment's bathroom

332
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,635
and had him drown in the bathtub.

333
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,872
Then he accidentally,
stepped on the shampoo bottle.

335
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,742
And he dashed out of the apartment

336
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,144
then came to the park.

337
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,413
To set up his alibi!

338
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,649
To set up Kis alibi?

339
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,717
Yeah!

340
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,654
He's going to carry the body out of the
his apartment in secret, perhaps tonight.

342
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,893
And sink the body
in the bathtub of the manager's house.

344
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,861
In doing this,

345
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:13,165
the police will treat

346
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,900
It as an accidental death.

347
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,702
And even if
they treat the case as an homicide,

349
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,571
his estimated time of death was

350
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,774
around one this afternoon.

352
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,243
Yes!

353
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,513
By the way, do you have the time,
Detective?

355
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,884
One o'clock. It's just one o'clock.

356
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,389
At the time when the manager was
supposed to be killed at home,

358
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,691
Hanzaki was here.

359
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,994
It's one and a half hour drive
from here to there.

361
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,366
As the real police officer,
Detective Takagi proves his alibi,

363
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,868
nobody doubts Mr. Hanzaki!

365
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,005
That's the perfect crime.

366
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,606
Well done {Mitsuhiko! Perfect reasoning

367
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:56,207
sum)

368
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,143
I think W's far from perfect.

369
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,846
Detective Takag:.
What a pity .

371
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,248
He lost his police notebook

372
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,418
and he was even
used to set up the murderer's alibi.

374
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:10,889
Hey Mitsuhiko,

375
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,525
Did you say. "Everybody knows that

376
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,560
he or she should roll up
their pants when cleaning the bathroom.

378
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,796
That's just a matter of common sense
all over the world.

380
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,832
Mr. Kogoro doesn't pull up his pants
because he thinks it's a bother.

382
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,335
It's a

383
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,737
Incidentally Dr. Agasa also doesn't

384
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,940
That means there was a possibility that

385
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,609
he was really cleaning his bathroom.

386
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,513
And Detective Takagi came here
to search for his police notebook

388
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,014
because he happened to lost it.

389
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,283
It's very difficult to suppose that
Mr. Hanzaki relied on such a chance

391
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,484
to establish his important alibi.

392
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,686
What do yourtRirk, Mitstifiko?

393
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,487
Its.

394
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,656
Your guess was far § f'the Iinark.

395
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,592
I won't take it

396
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,361
A-Ayum!

397
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,330
Cut it out, Ayumi.

398
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,832
Cuz. I can never forgive that man.

399
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:58,303
Thatyman tried to use such a nice guy,
Detective Takagi.

401
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,573
B-but, my reasoning was wrong. so.

402
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,611
What does that mean anyway?

403
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,479
Wihat is what?

404
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,779
Kook at that!

405
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,221
How strange...

406
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,623
He isn't eating anything yet.

407
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:19,891
Yeah, it's true

409
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:26,198
That man... Is he still U4) to anything?

410
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:33,939
He's still not eating anything.

412
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,407
That's a waste.

413
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,609
But he cares only about what time it is.

414
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:38,577
Oh, yeah

415
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:39,144
He's only watching the clock

416
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:39,811
He's only watching the clock

417
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,512
He's only watching the clock

418
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,881
How strange!

419
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,282
If he didn't get hungry.

420
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,619
Why did he enter thejAll-you-can-eat
restaurant for two 'hours, at all?

422
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,221
Yeah, that's right

423
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:50,455
How come?

424
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,892
Oh. I remember he said.

425
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,230
I am gonna find that
square thing with you.

427
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,433
So then, let me buy
your lunch at that restaurant, please?

429
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,737
He relentlessly tried to be with him.

430
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,406
So thatlexplains it!

431
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,710
BB Mitsuhiko.,\, our
reasoning isn't entirely true but half true.

433
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,512
What do yourmean "half true"?

434
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,517
AS you suspected,
hat guy is trying to kill the manager.

436
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,386
So, he entered: this restaurant and is
now passing himself off

438
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,488
as a customer
in order to establish his alib...

440
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,457
To establish his alibi?

441
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,492
I Detective rakagi hadn't sent him away.

442
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:31,129
He would have wanted to
establish an alibi

444
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,431
by continuing to find the police notebook.

445
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,469
But you said Detective Takagi
happen 4 to come to te park today.

447
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,572
No. He knew Detective Takagi
would be sure to come to find it, perhaps

449
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,742
because he picked it up last night.

450
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,078
You mean that man still has the notebook.

451
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,849
Um. no. Unfortunately
I'm afraid he's already thrown it out

453
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,284
Y ah.

454
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,353
There's no reason to keep
such a dangerous thing around.

456
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,322
Flefiéxw

457
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,958
I said Mituhiko's reasoning
was half correct.

459
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,527
What was wrong is
TAO meme ei's Ce no (

461
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,229
The time isn't 1 o'clock,
but even more later,

463
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,398
around from two te two thirty or so.

464
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,299
Huh

465
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,501
But, it's just past one o'clock. \

466
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,735
Yeah.

467
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:14,172
The plot to kill the manager is
now going on steadily

469
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,809
Perhaps in the bathroom of his apartment

470
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,779
That's why he cares
about the time like that

472
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,028
Anyway,

473
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,298
it may not be
too late now to save the manager's life.

475
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:40,832
Yes!

476
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,802
But, wait, do you know
where that guy's apartment is?

478
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,203
Oh. no.

479
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:48,573
He'll never tell us if we ask.

480
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,276
Let's split up and find it!

481
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,510
Oh. eah.

482
00:16:56,349 --> 00:17:00,151
Alas. even the
Detective boys gave up on me

484
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,887
Oh. man...

485
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,903
Oh. that struggling singer.

486
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,838
He's quite a character.

487
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,107
Last night, he was
picking-up concrete blocks there.

489
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,076
Whatever

490
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,512
but that's not what we wanna to know.

491
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,582
Well, I have no idea.

492
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,350
Hanzaki! His name is Hanzaki!

493
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,818
He's a Enka singer!

494
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,987
He must be living around here

495
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,891
Like I care. I don't like Enka at all.

496
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,459
Hey! Wa-wait.

497
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,396
Et's go over there.

499
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,567
Hello. Flo? Do you copy?

500
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,636
We've got his address.

501
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,104
Really?

502
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,339
Good .

503
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,175
The second floor of
the "PARK SIDE HIGHTS,"

505
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,510
3-Chom Jover.

506
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,579
Roger! We'll be there soon!

507
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,449
I'm gonna get Detective Takagi.

508
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,450
Good idea!

509
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,752
Hopefully. if he can prevent the murder

510
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,056
it'll help to offset the blunder of losing
his police notebook *

512
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:11,890
Yeah

513
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,527
The shop owner said that
Hanzaki bought

515
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,162
a big block of icetat the store today

516
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,831
Andiconcrete'blocks he picked up.

517
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,867
Ana! I gotit I saw through his trick!

518
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,319
And only if Hanzaki leaves
the body laying on the stairs,

520
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,655
he can make it look like the manager
himself loses his feoting and dies,

522
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,323
in his drunken state.

524
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,625
oo< eavens. We mus wurry.

525
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,597
What!? Murder case?

526
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,099
Not yet,
but ..um...if you ask me... I mean...

528
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,500
he's gonna be killed soon.

529
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,969
I don't get what you're saying.

530
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,272
Sorry but I have to find my notebook.

531
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,707

532
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,808
Leave it to me.

533
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,512
Hey. the man named Hanzaki actually
picked up your notebook yesterday.

535
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,948
Did he actually picked it up!

536
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,018
And he said, "keep it in my apartment,
so please come to pick it up."

538
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,320
Wh-where!? His apartment!

539

How do you know my name?

578
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,416
I don't think I told you yesterday.

579
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,018
I saw your name

580
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,153
on your notebook.

581
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,924

You did it) You found it at last!

583
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,829
It would seem that that Hanzaki guy

584
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,797
didn't pick up the notebook himself,

585
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,100
but just saw him pick twp.

586
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,469
Yes. So it seemed.

587
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,872
Oh, what a relief it is.

588
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,884
