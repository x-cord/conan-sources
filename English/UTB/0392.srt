He is the president of this factory

72
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,200
The estimated time of death is

73
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,536
between 16:00 to 22:00 hours.

74
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,940
Soon after the body was found
a cordon was set up

76
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,642
The following day. the suspect,

77
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,078
yesterday. that is,
was taken custody at the police.

79
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,164
However,

81
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,887
The-suspect is Yuichi Minamida. age 47

82
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:20,092
He.is an owner chef of
a smallwcstern food restaurant. and.

84
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,427
I was a classmate of the victim
in high school.

86
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,431
It's true that I went
to Kitamura's place yesterday.

88
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,132
But. ll didn't do it

89
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,233
But. I didn't do it.

90
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,204
You had a debt of 30,000,000 yen
that you owed Mr. Kitamura.

92
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,338
He refused to extend the deadhne
for your giving him back the money.

94
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,675
SO you were cornered. and stabbed him.

95
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,743
That's the stor , isn't it?

96
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,945
Do you have evidence?

97
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,414
Are my prints on the knife
that is the murder weapon?

99
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,850
We detected no fingerprints.

100
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,019
But we found a piece of cloth

101
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,655
In other words the fiygerprints
were wiped:;off completelyr

103
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,223
after the murder was committed .»

104
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,262
Inspector Megure!

105
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,330
Hmm?

111
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,071
Besides. owing Mr. Kitamura money.

113
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,607
you have another strong motive to kill him,
don't ou?

115
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,981
\Mr Kitamuraiwas. after yourishop and
your land.

118
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,118
e spread rumors about
the sanitation standards at your shop.

120
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,120
Which sent you into a financial rut.

121
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,290
He lenty ou 30.000:000 yen 3lmonths ago.

123
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,200
Minamida, after finding out
what. Mr. Kitamura was actually after.

125
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,503
Was enraged and told the people
around him how vexed he was.

127
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,706
On the da of pa. ment,

128
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,607
that is the day the murder was: committed,
at 13:00

130
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,410
Minamida appeared at this office
to see MrKitamura

132
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,814
It's already 15:00!
Just how long do you intend to stay here?

134
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,247
It's already 15-00!
Just how long do you intend to stay here?

136
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,384
WARREN
Just another, 3 days. no 2 days'll do.

138
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,820
I lent you the cash
because of the good old times.

140
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,223
If you don't have the cash,
give me the deed to the land.

142
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,891
Kkitamulfa!

143
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,896
What the...?

144
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,431
Excuse me. president!

145
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,165
Ware having some problems
with the machine...

147
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,037
Oka! Go on ahead!

148
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,489
Oh. es sir. . Thank ou.

149
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,110
I tell you! Totally hopeless...

150
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,445
W.What do you think you're doing?!

151
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,463
Know just what you're after!

152
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:23,749
Let go of me!

153
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,417
You schemed it from the very start!

154
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,451
Let go!

155
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,220
You were after my land to begin with!

156
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,623
So what!

157
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,825
Leave your deed here and get ost.

158
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,427
Ou darn oser!

159
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,966
Think those words-made...
Minamida mak Jup his mind

161
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:45,237
He waited for Kitamurafto return...

162
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,727
Whaaa!

163
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,980
But Minamida...

164
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,484
Yes. he did come back after
about 30 minutes.

166
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:01,987
I started to negotiate with him oncesagain,

167
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,239
and stayed there until around 6:00
in the evening

169
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,391
but.was eventually kicked out of the room

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,995
Huh? A person who can testify&to that?

171
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:10,896
I don't know.

172
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,229
I don't know.

173
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,031
I 28)"

174
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,368
You've got all the circumstantial evidence,
but no concrete evidence...

176
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:21,206
Agh..ha ha
I'm sure this is what Pops would say.

178
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,811
Aha. ha... You haven told me
about the absurd thing yet!

180
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:26,895
Ia! A

182
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:31,516
The absurd thing 1s the height difference
between the suspect and Minamida.

184
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:32,617
147 A
Hoght difference
Just what do you mean?

187
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,019
Height difference.
Just what do you mean?

189
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,024
He's pretty tough to handle. Besides...

190
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,093
The strange confidence I sense from him
bothers me too...

192
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,129
Inspector!

193
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,599
I got an absurd report
from the forensic officer .

195
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:52,737
The height ofathe victim Kitamura is
166 .centimeters.

197
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,307
And Minamida is 186. centimeters.

198
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,542
Minamidq Is 20 centimeters taller

199
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,846
If so. then. what?

200
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,216
In the case that a tall person stabs
person shooter than he is.

202
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,552
The angle of the knife would usually be from
diagonally above.

204
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,856
On the other hand if a short person stabs I
someone taller lha 'himself.

206
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,757
It would be from diagonally below.

207
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,761
The knife that was stabbed into Kitamura's
chest was from diagonally below.

209
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:17,796
In other words A

210
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,600
it's impossible for Minamida
who 1s 20 centimeters taller

212
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,201
to have committed.the crime.

213
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,170
O Oh no...

214
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,074
So. I had the forensic officers use the angle
of the knife to calculate backwards and

216
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,309
come up with the height of the killer...

217
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,210
And %7

218
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:32,811
And. .?

219
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,781
Yes. sir! The results came out to be
that the person is 110 centimeters...

221
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:37,949
Huh?!

222
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,683
110 centimeters?

223
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:42,120
T. That's the height of a child!

224
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,024
I get it!

225
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,058
If the killer stabbed from below
where there arejstairs

227
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:51,296
even with Mr. Minamidas*newgnt,
he'd be able 10 stab from below.

229
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,664
The scene off the murder was
a one-stony building.

231
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,032
With no stairs.

232
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,433
And there were no traces of the body
being moved.

234
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:58,603
Then!iHe probably attacked the victim
when he was off his guard...

236
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,206
Oh! Just what do you think you're doing?!

237
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,508
He sank down low on the spur
of the moment and stabbed?

239
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,378
Takagi... You just stabbed me. didn't you

240
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,347
Agh. aha. ha. "m sorry.

241
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:13,018
Inspector!
I think that the killer is Minamida too...

243
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,254
But,
the victim was stabbed from the front...

245
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,924
SO. it's hard togbelieve that: he was attacked
When 'he was off his guard...

247
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,092
Moreover. a week before the incident

248
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,861
Minamida sprained his ankle.

249
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,763
I. wonder if he'd be able to sink down low
on the spur

251
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,565
of the. moment-with his leg in a cast.

252
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,301
He would never be able to do something
Iike that...

254
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,202
He may have been threa enedfF ith
the knife and forced to go up somewhere

256
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:33,805
and stabbed from below...

257
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,640
That's not possible

258
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,143
The victim, Mr. Kitamura 1s
a ranking judo belt owner

260
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,946
Iso he wouldn't be intimidated by Minamida
sticking a knife at him.

262
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,481
Everyone around him. says

263
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,250
Kitamura was probably strong enough +
to attack Minamida instead.

265
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,819
'Rue. no, matter how you look atfit

266
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,089
Does that mean the difference in heights
hat's protecting Minamidar

268
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,425
You've got another picture!

269
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,560
No. Conan!

270
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,967
Huh? This mans wearing glasses!

271
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,835
He's not wearing them in the other picture. 4

272
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,037
on ab
Oh. these are reading glasses.

274
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,741
Reading glasses aro something you wear
when reading something. right?!

276
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:14,579
Does that mean that Mr. Kitamura was
attackediwhen he was reading something? P

278
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,716
But .
There's nothing like that imthis room...

280
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,284
Right

281
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,654
the thing that Mr. Kitamura was supposedly
reading back then is nowhere in sight.

283
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,091
The problem is that something is gone.

284
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,193
And Minamida took it with him.

285
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,695
Oh! ou're right on, Officer Takagi!

286
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:32,564
Hat on earth could it be.

287
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,433
We still don't know why he took it
with him...

289
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,503
Uh. are these slippers the president's?

290
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,888
Yeah. that's right

291
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,741
What about when Mr Minamida came
the da before esterda ?

293
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,310
Of course he was wearing them.

295
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,646
Mr Minamida was barefootthoug...

297
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,483
why are the slippers over here like this?

298
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,152
They probably came off from'the im act
when he was stabbed!

300
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,320
Impact?!

301
00:10:56,222 --> 00:11:00,959
But. isn't it strange that they came off
from the impact when he was stabbed?

303
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:02,994
Huh?

304
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:08,500
Because they're nicely in place just as If
someone had put them in place. right?

306
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,468
I haven't touched them!

307
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,338
The slippers have been this way
moo the body was found.

309
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,741
The came off...

310
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,712
If not so, Mr. Minamida took them off
after he killed the victim. ?

312
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,014
Wh would he « 0 out of his wa
to do something like that?

315
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,349
- <4 /
2 - -—
You think so. don't you?

319
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,819
Oh. or mayb¢ Mr Kitamura took them off
mes {...

321
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,853
That's it!

322
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,523
But. why would he do something like that?

323
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,659
I can't figure it out!

324
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,145
Stabbed from the front diagonally below?

325
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,263
Height difference?

326
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,570
A ll.ladder?

327
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,539
WW.What... 7?

328
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,875
What did he do?!

329
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,446
President Kitamura

330
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,347
used the ladder...

331
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,016
To do what?

332
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:06,524
But. wait, why did Minamida think up
something like this?!

334
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,595
Why would an ordinary chef think up
the trick of reversing the fact

336
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,465
about his height
by doing somcthing like this?!

338
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,475
What were you waiting for?!

339
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,815
At first we thought it was-aicrime committed
on the spur of the: moment.

342
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,902
But after watching you,
we've come to understand

344
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:37,055
that it was a carefully thought-out murder

345
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,423
If so,

346
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:43,995
there's got to be 1 reason why you stayed
in the president's room: from 13:00 to 18:00.

348
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,132
You had another purpose

ORNS & Ht

352
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:50,869
Five hours in the president's office!

353
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,370
Just what on earth

354
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,305
were you waiting for?

355
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,476
A miracle. I guess.

356
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,421
Officer Takagi...

357
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,524
I've found out something absurd!

358
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,692
But. this is only a deduction.

359
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,494
I need evidence that will lead him
to confess...

361
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:17,529
Proof

362
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,563
Whaaaat?!

363
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,332
S...Something absurd?!

364
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,069
Another absurd thing. 4

365
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,138
I hope it's not bad news.

366
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,573
' I-- 0
Ec Ts,

368
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,009
there was a series of random killings
within the Minato Police Station.

371
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:33,327
The person who was arrested back then,

372
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:36,414
Mos suk a Dalia: Yaadkek )
who was javcompany cmployee!

374
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,385
Although Minamida denied this.

375
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,170
The prosecutor had confidence
and indicted him

377
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:47,642
But, the evidence that
his lawyers submitted saved Minamida.

379
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,329
That proof was the angle of the stab
wound that the random killer left behind

381
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,164
It was proven that with his height

382
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,867
Minamida wouldn't have been able to stab
anyone at that angle.

384
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,404
Moreover, during his hearing
a new killer was arrested...

386
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,755
And the case was solved.

387
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,825
Which means that

388
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,292
Which means that

389
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:07,928
Minamida knew from the start that the
height difference between him

391
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:09,948
and the victim would serve
as evidence in court?

393
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,984
I see! That's why he thought up this trick.

394
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:18,056
Right. In thissgase,
a trick involving height difference was used!

396
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,776
A trick >
using height difference is involved ..7!

398
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,965
A And what kind ofétric dis that,
Officer Sato!

400
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,733
I haven't figured it"outkyet...

401
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,736
I'll go report this to Inspector Megure.

402
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,739
Officer Takagi,
go back to headquarters right away too!

404
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,510
I'm going back to headquarters then...

405
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,779
Thank you so very much!

406
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,881
Oh...No problem .

408
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,384
Is Mr Kitamura's height 166 centimeters

409
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,354
tall for an adult?

411
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:50,388
Huh?

412
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,790
I want to become an adult quickly too.

413
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,392
Because it's inconvenient being a child.

414
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,896
When things are in high places
I've got to use a ladder.

416
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,667
Adults are lucky at that point because
they don t have to use a ladder .

418
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,836
A ladder...?!

419
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,505
That's not real y true

420
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,806
When cleaning the air conditioner

421
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,708
and changing light bulbs

422
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,644
even Dad uses a ladder...
Agh?!

424
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,711
Light bulbs.

425
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,248
If the light bulbs were out at that time...

426
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,252
You mean the lights so conveniently
went out back then....?

428
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,623
C.Conan!

429
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:29,460
IF WOO) QO SINE VO EY,
Turn on the lights when it gots dark...

431
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:30,929
Conan.

432
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,332
She used to say that we'll ruin our eyes
If we read in dark places.

434
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,567
n dark places...a book. .?!

435
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,472
Roading glasses and

436
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,007
Iight bulbs.

437
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,211
Slippers .!

438
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,383
I.l see!
You guys get going home too! Okay.

440
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,221
All that I need now, us proof
to make him confess what he did...

442
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,060
Cee Tee
He seems to have hit upon aw ideal!

444
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,964
Mr. Yuichi Minamida

445
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,635
you stayed in Mr. Kitamura's office
for O hours. waiting for.

447
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,687
Sundown" isn't thattit!

448
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,472
S.Sundown?

449
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,912
WwW. Why would I have to wait for sundown...

450
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,783
Because that's when Mr. Kitamura turns on
the lights of the office.

452
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,037
But the chandelier did not turn on that day.

453
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:33,925
Mr Kitamura who wanted to check out
what was wrong. climbed a ladder

455
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,496
You took this opportunity to stab
Mr. Kitanmura

457
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,665
who is 20 centimeter: shorter than you,
from below

459
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,568
R.Ridiculous...

460
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,038
Are you saying that the bulbs
just"happened to go out on that day?!

462
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,741
Are you saying that I knew
the bulbs were going to go out?!

464
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,243
He bulbs didn't go out...

465
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,478
VO URODSSN EUR

466
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,015
WwW. What do you think you're doing?!

467
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,017
I know what you re after!

468
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,218
Let go of my hand!

469
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,786
From the beginning,
from the very start you!

471
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:02,954
Lot go!

472
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,322
You were after my land!

473
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,435
Eating, going to the restroom,
If you stick it out for.5 hours

475
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,137
you had all the opportunity in the world
to wait for Mr. Kitamura to leave the office.

477
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,674
You probably loosened the bulbs when
he left to go check on machine trouble.

479
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,644
Mr .Kitamura left the room for 30-minutes

480
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,283
How can you be:sure that Kitamura would
check the bulbs of the chandelier himself!

482
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,420
He's so haughty, it's more likely
that he'd call one of his employees.

484
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,421
In order for him not to do;so.

485
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,021
In order for him not to do so.

486
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:42,226
You handed over some important
documents after it started getting dark...

488
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,579
is reading glasscs told us so

489
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:46,731
Reading glasses?

490
00:17:49,984 --> 00:17:52,236
The dead body was wearing
reading glasses...

492
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,072
He was reading something. no rather

493
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,307
It's evidence that he was trying to.read
something...

495
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,243
That something was also very important
to the killer...

497
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,181
It was the deed for the and.

498
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,216
Where your shop is
that Mr. Kitamura wanted. wasn't it?

501
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,521
You've finally decided to give this to me...

502
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:15,927
Hmm?

503
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,170
It's not a b ack out

504
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,140
Darn! Not again...

505
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,541
Why at a time like this...

506
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,279
You set it up so that he would find
calling one of his employed a waste of time

508
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,548
that he checked the light himself .

509
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:41,068
Hmm? What's this,

510
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:43,688
they're just loose .

511
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,063
You admit to your crime. don't you?

512
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:58,202
His reading glasses and slippers

513
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:01,572
will probably serve as evidence
that Mr. Kitamura climbed the ladder.

515
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,010
But,
that's not proof that I loosened the bulbs.

Takagi

519
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,780
O.Officer Takagi...

520
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,835
Hey. hey...

522
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:16,988
It's me... Mouri...

523
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:19,190
Oh! Mr. Mouri!

524
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,375
I hea d about the case from Ran.

525
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,878
WIF Wed pm!
Did Minamida confess?

527
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,063
A little bit more.

528
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:30,017
He demanded that I show him proof
that he rigged: the chandelier...

530
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,386
Not having proof is the proof...

532
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,605
Huh? Just what do you mean...?

533
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,007
Yes. .Yes...

535
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:36,691
Yes .Yes...

536
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,945
I see! I understand. Ill do so right away!

537
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,414
Inspector!
I'm going to check with the forensic officers!

539
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,483
Hmm? Oh. hey. Takagi. Takagi!

540
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,786
Whation earth is on his mind. anyway?

541
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,089
Okay! This is it for now!

544
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,125
F.For now...?

545
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,546
Mr. Minanmida,

546
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:01,531
Il culprits make mistakes

547
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:04,368
There was ono more thing
besides the glasses and the slippers.

549
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,503
After committing the murder.

550
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,239
You wiped off your fingerprints

552
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:13,411
At the same time,
you naturally wiped off your fingerprints

554
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,996
from the bulbs that you loosened.

555
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,551
Yes, the fact that its notsthere may
sometimes serves as proof.

557
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,486
I checked again with the forensic officer

558
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,555
whether any fingerprints were found!
Mn the chandelier.

560
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,025
o fingerprints were found whatsoever.

561
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,162
Mr Kitamura's fingerprints that were
supposed to be there weren't either.

563
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,432
I confirmed with his bereaved family too.

564
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:38,336
The bulbs of the chandelier
also .went.out a monthrago.

566
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:41,005
And it seems-Mr Kitamura himself
changed the bulbs.

568
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,207
And yet. no one's fingerprints were found

569
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,743
This is proof that someone
obviously rigged the bulbs.

571
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,179
The trick that you usod of making

B.But, my company fired me as soon as...
I was arrested...

586

who believed me.

592
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,001
Kitamura tried to take that away from mel,

593
00:21:27,002 --> 00:21:28,386
He's the bad one!

594
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,185
He's the bad one!

595
00:21:29,186 --> 00:21:32,323
But. no matter what reasons you may have.

596
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,392
What value is there to a dream

00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,394
that ou must protect
