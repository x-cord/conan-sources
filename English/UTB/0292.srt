Lost island and the deep sea. Conan

17
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,919
We accompany the filming crew
to an uninhabited island

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,955
where an unidentified body
and a mysterious Message is found.

21
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,193
Then a female member of the
film crew. Taira Yoshie,

23
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,762
IS murdered and a mysterious
message is found near her body

PRINCESS OF THE ISLAND AND THE
PALACE OF THE DRAGON KING PART II

29
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,581
What? An anchor?

30
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,983
On the bottom of the sea
where Miss Taira was diving?

32
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,952
Are you sure about that?

33
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,220
Yeah.

34
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,689
The chain was cut and it was rusty

35
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,190
but it was a ship's anchor all right...

36
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:39,892
Maybe it was from that man's ship

37
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,661
you know, the man who was
found dead here a year ago

39
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,096
Yes, I bet you're right!

40
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,534
He probably got to this island on it
and he decided to wait out the storm

42
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,238
in here but the chain broke
and the boat drifted away!

44
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,305
No. no. no!

45
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:53,873
What?

46
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:57,376
There was a lot of mollusks
and sea weed on the anchor

48
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,047
it must've been down there for
at least four or five years...

50
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:05,150
Four or five years...
It's been about that long. huh?

52
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,954
Several incidents happened at the
mayor s: house around that time

54
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:09,789

Miss Miyako was kidnapped...

79
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:24,503
then a year later, a gang of robbers
broke into the mayor's home,

81
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,073
they took a gold screen which
was a family heirloom

83

The mayor refused to pay the ranso
and the money for the screen

93
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,358
so they were never caught,
and both Miss Miyako

95
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,962
and the screen were never
seen again, orsso I've heard

97
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:50,729
It was a terrible blow to the mayor

121
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,042
the butler was so scared. he quit,

122
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:08,481
people started to bad mouth the mayor
saying he was a heartless money monger

124
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:13,119
and on top of that, the corpse
of a man who starved to death

126
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,122
was found on this island the mayor owns,
along with that mysterious message

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,740
didn't they say
The Princess sleeps in A not B

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,040
am I right?

136
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,909
You're right .

137
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,879
Don't you think that the princess
might mean the mayor's daughter?

139
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:47,653
Are you saying she's been killed and
is buried somewhere on this island?

141
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,288
That's right...

142
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,192
she came back as a messenger from
the other world and killed Miss Taira .

00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,338
there's an Qld legend that women kept a
dagger in their mouth so that

160
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,040
that their souls wouldn't be sucked
ut of them through their mouth.

163
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,344
and. it could be used for, self protection

164
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,252
Hey. this is very interesting...

165
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,123
take a look at this tea cup!

166
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,693
It looks like somebody
used it as an ashtray

168
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,763
there are more than one
kind of cigarettes

170
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:35,334
and the water on the bottom
Isn't completely dry yet

172
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,804
which means that
just before we got to this island,

174
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:43,676
there was another group of people here...

175
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:47,379
That's right, and there
wasn't just one or two of them

177
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,118
they killed a woman and now they're
hiding somewhere on this island

179
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:56,021
I'm talking about the
messengers of death

181
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,590
Oh come on you're kidding. right?

182
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,628
Are you saying there's a
group of killers on this island?

184
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,799
I'm just saying that it's possible.

185
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:13,772
They could be watching us from
somewhere waiting to steal our souls...

187
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,608
I don't believe it...

188
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:19,411
Th, then they might
already be inside this hous™

190
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,881
That's not possible! We all checked
to make sure nobody was inside, right?

192
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:27,052
But there're a lot of broken
windows In this place.

194
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,024
It'd have been easy to sneak
in while we were busy talking

196
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,394
Then I think we should
split up into groups

198
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,427
and search the place one more time.

199
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,733
I agree, it won't help
to stay here and panic...

201
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,371
Then Mr. Kume, you and Mr. Ikema
andr. Daito check the second floor

203
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:47,206
Okay. sure...

204
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,709
Mr. Taketomi and we will
check the first floor

207
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,578
Yes, alright...

208
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,314
I mean, you'd be at a
disadvantage if you got attacked

210
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,850
since you'd be the only
male with two girls to protect...

212
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,019
Huh? You've got to be kidding!

213
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,290
You're the one that they'll be protecting

214
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,760
No kidding. really?

216
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,427

you can ave them to us!

225
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,813

226
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,555
Okay Heiji...

227
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,325
h, this is the last room

228
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,660
Don't keep us in suspense, open it up!

229
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,297
Aybe it wasn't a good idea after all...

230
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,170
Is anybody in here?

231
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,172
Hey...

232
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,074
No. nobody...

233
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,609
seems to be inside...

234
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,977
I think you're right...

235
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,748
This room's not like the
others, it's really big

237
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,719
think the mayor's wife
used this room, see,

239
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:10,022
there's a picture of them together.

240
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:12,825
I see

241
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,928
it's really corroded...

242
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,997
Now look what you did Heiji

243
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,101
There's two pictures in here...

244
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,269
What?

245
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,476
What is this? There's a
picture taken with a young girl.

247
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,513
Do you think the mayor was
having an affair with her

249
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,215
No. you're wrong.

250
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:40,486
That's Miss Miyako, the
mayor's only daughter

252
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,922
She looked just like her
mother. they were both

254
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,126
fair skinned and good
natured, everyone liked her

256
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:52,498
when she was kidnapped five years
ago while still attending junior college

258
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,933
and then never found.
Everyone was shocked...

261
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,305
Didn't you say you work for a
television station in Kyushu

264
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,775
how do you know so much then...

265
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:09,415
Yoshiko Matsumoto the maid that
worked for the mayor is my cousin.

267
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,717
She used to talk about them all the time.

268
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,688
That maid. is she the one who

269
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,991
Who was killed during the robbery...

270
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,129
Yes, one of the robbers killed her
during the robbery four years ago...

272
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:30,235
Speaking of family, Ikema told me his
mother and the mayor's wife were sisters

274
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,071
so that makes him and Miyako cousins

275
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,575
This castle in the back
ground of the picture,

277
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,111
I've never seen it before,
which castle is it?

279
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,781
Oh that's not a castle,
that's the mayor's house...

281
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,883
It's a huge mansion

282
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,952
according to my cousin,
when the house was first built,

284
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:52,591
Miss Miyako was still little
and she was so happy!

286
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,294
She said she felt like 1
princess in a castle.

288
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:56,795
A princess...

289
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,597
In a castle!

290
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,968
That settles it, the princess
carved on that pillar really is...

292
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,635
Miss Miyako?

293
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,739
Speaking of strange messages,
there's some here too

295
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:08,440
What?

296
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:13,010
I think they-were written by Miyako...

297
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,213
What!

298
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,547
See, there's three...

299
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:22,788
You're right, it looks it
was written with crayons

301
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:28,827
The top one says "Chiyoni 20
centimeters below that it says "Kaachan

303
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,097
and on the very bottom, it says me

304
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,802
judging by all the lines.
Near the word me

306
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,073
I'd say she was comparing heights
with someone when she was little

308
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,377
That's a relief, you had
me scared there for awhile

310
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:49,448
I know kaachan means mother
but for a well bred young lady,

312
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,183
she certainly uses common language...

313
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,820
No. I don't think she meant mother...

314
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,553
What?

315
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:56,788
Take a look!

316
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,324
They're very faint but you
can still make out

318
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,993
some words on this door
written with the same crayon.

320
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,794
It says 'Mama's Room"

322
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,529
You're right!

323
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,498
Then who'd she mean?

325
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,969
Who are these people,
Kaachan and "Chiyonl

329
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,004
Beats me...

330
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,840
Maybe they were her
friends from school

332
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,644
I don't think so! She was
still very young when she wrote this,

334
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,580
her friends wouldn't be that tall!

335
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:22,915
Yes, I see your point...

336
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,318
Those words are written on this door too!

337
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,324
The room over there's
Chiyoni's room and this is Kaachan's

339
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,595
and that's not all. there're strange
drawing by the words too

341
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,164
Kaachan's drawing is a bird...

342
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:42,200
Chiyoni's drawing looks like an eel...

343
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,705
You know, looking at a little girl's
drawings in this dark is kind of .

345
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,740
Creepy. hub...

346
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,375
Well anyway,

347
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:54,012
seeing as how these two have
rooms here on this uninhabited island

349
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:59,484
they must've come here with her often!

350
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,288
When the rescue boat comes to
take us back to the main island,

352
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,859
I guess we'll just have to go ask the
mayor personally about these two.

354
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,064
They may be involved in this murder...

356
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,768
Wh. what was that sound...

357
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,036
I think It was Kume...

358
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,906
It came from upstairs, what happened?

359
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:22,975
It couldn't be the killers...

360
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,142
Rats!

361
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,252
Hey. what's the matter!

362
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,887
Did you find the killer?

363
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,322
No. it's not that!

364
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,361
That guy let out a scream and
he fell back inla panic

366
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,397
he saw what was behind the curtain...

367
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,099
this painting

368
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:52,471
Look, isn't the model in
that painting. Miyako?

370
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,074
You're right, it looks just
Iike the girl in the photo

372
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,678
It was probably done by her mother,

373
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,915
Yoshiko told me she was quite an artist.

374
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,183
Yoshiko?

375
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:10,288
Yes, she's my cousin and she worked
as a maid in the mayor's household

377
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:17,428
I see, that means that there's four people
here who are connected to the mayor

379
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,797
Did you say four?

380
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,701
Yes, my mother was
the mayor's wife's sister,

382
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,237
the director's cousin was the maid

383
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:29,274
Kume was Miyako's classmate in
elementary, junior high and high school

385
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:34,813
and Mr. Daito over there was a
childhood friend of the mayor's wife

387
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,481
Childhood friends?

388
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,986
Yes, when I went to visit Mrs. Kaneshiro's
grave last year with my mother,

390
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,021
he was there too.

391
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,591
My mother asked and he told her
they were childhood friends

393
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:52,764
But my mother said she didn't
remember him, so he could've been lying

395
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:58,704
I don't blame her, their ages were far
apart. that's why she didn't remember

397
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,074
If your mother and
Mrs. Kaneshiro were sisters,

399
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,476
then you must've come
to this island before too

401
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,678
No. I never came to this island, in fact,

402
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,481
I rarely went to the
mayor's house to visit.

404
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,119
The reason was, he was a very
wealthy man and we felt uncomfortable

406
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:17,589
I only saw Miyako a few
times when she was very young.

408
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,160
I wonder why Mr. Kume panicked like
that when he saw her painting though?

410
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:27,566
Beats me. maybe he thought
he was seeing her ghost?

412
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,203
There's been gossip
that she was killed...

414
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,605
W. well anyway

415
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:37,242
it doesn't look like anybody
suspicious is hiding out in this house

417
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,480
so let's all just stay together in,one
room and wait for the rescue boat

420
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,464
Don't you think it's
taking a little too long?

422
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:00,665
Yeah...

423
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,101
but you know old Kogoro...

424
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,571
you can bet he's found himself a
girl and they ve gone out drinking

426
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,907
the old good for nothing...

427
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,646
Ah... what was that?

428
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,349
M. maybe it's...

429
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,222
Yes, I knew wt!
It's the rescue boat!

431
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,458
We're saved!

432
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,827
Hey there!

433
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,395
Here, we're over here!

434
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,596
Hey!

435
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,431
Something's wrong with that boat!

436
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,700
Yeah, there're no lights on

437
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,003
and it's not docked right

438
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,221
What a horrible way to die...

439
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:00,225
the killer used something like a
hard pipe and hit him so many times

441
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,061
even after he died...

442
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,230
H. how awful

443
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:10,936
Then the Killer tied-his body to the side
of the boat and wrote those words

445
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,005
I Death's messenger

446
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,510
whoever did this really hated him...

447
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,979
Who would do such a thing...

448
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,614
So there is somebody else here...

449
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,784
somebody besides us is here
on the island or in the ocean

451
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:28,987
Somebody who enjoys killing
IS hiding out somewhere!

453
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,658
You're right, when the boat
rammed into the landing,

455
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,294
we were all inside the house.

456
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:41,933
Whoever piloted this boat is still
around here. I'm sure of that

458
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,937
Yes, that would be the so
called "Death's messenger

460
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,673
No. that's not necessarily true...

461
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,809
Co. Conan.

462
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,777
I just looked around inside,

463
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:56,848
there's a teeny tiny thing that looks like
a television by the steering wheel

465
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,051
I checked the screen and it looks
Iike this boat just went from

467
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,088
this landing to the ocean
and then came back again!

469
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,156
Oh I see, it was on auto pilot!

470
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,193
That way. no one has to be steering...

471
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:13,899
But kid. there're currents in the ocean,

472
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,503
you wouldn't be able to control how the
boat crashed into the landing by auto pilot

474
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,439
That's where you're wrong, it
doesn't have to be exactly right

476
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:27,979
The flow of the current would affect the
boat by about 50 to 100 meters

478
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,448
To have the boat come
to this side of the island.

480
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,951
All you'd have to do is set the
auto pilot to move along the shoreline

482
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:38,256
then the boat would move along the
reef and crash into the landing

484
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,195
Look at that! You can see the
side of the bottom's scraped

486
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:47,866
That proves the boat moved
along the reef scraping it!

488
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:54,139
By using the auto pilot, anyone
would've been able to commit the crime.

490
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,875
No matter what time the boat
was set to leave this landing!

492
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,145
So you see, any one of us
could have done it.

494
00:18:01,347 --> 00:18:03,381
Are you trying to tell us that...

495
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:07,419
Th, that the killer is one of us?

496
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,957
That's right, when the four of us
Ieft the boat to look for Miss Taira

498
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,860
you said you all left the boat
right after us, didn't you?

500
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:22,267
Well, it would've been possible for the
man who left last to commit the crime!

502
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,703
So who was it?

503
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:25,804
N. not me!

504
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:26,805
It wasn't me either...

505
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,342
I was the last one to get off the boat.

506
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,278
Th. then that means you did it...

507
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:38,950
But any one of you could've come
back after I'd gone, right?

509
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,721
And another thing you shouldn't
forget. young detective

511
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,857
When that woman
Miss Taira was killed

513
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,227
Th, that's right,
I remember what you said!

515
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,531
About the words in the sand
where her body was found

517
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,935
you said it'd be impossible for us

518
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,005
to do it since we were on the
opposite side of the island...

520
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,510
Yeah, you definitely said that since the
words were written where the last wave

522
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,179
of the high tide receded, they must've
been written shortly before we found her

524
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,116
when the tide was low, otherwise,
they would've been washed away!

526
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:16,054
B. besides, the words on both
scenes were the exact same,

528
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,024
so they were written
by the same person, right?

530
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,460
Then the killer couldn't
possibly be one of us...

532
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,397
If there was more than one Killer

533
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,567
they might have talked it over and
decided to do it the same way

535
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,137
it may have been part of their plan...

536
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:38,777
to make us suspect
each other of the crime .

538
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,248
Well the boat's back now anyway...

539
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,249
That's right

540
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,919
you think it'd be better if we discussed
this after we get back to the main island?

542
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,256
Thing is, while we were
taking the captain down,

544
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,425
I looked around the boat and saw
that the fuel tank's pretty much empty

546
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,394
And that's not all.

547
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:01,099
The radio's been broken and all
our things are gone which means

549
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:08,406
the killer wants to keep us on this
island and is planning to do something

551
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,209
What do you mean...

552
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,577
You mean another murder?

553
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,780
Yes, if you don't want to get killed,
we better all go back to the house

555
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,651
and wait for the rescue boat to arrive,
that's the only thing we can do

557
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:27,525
Good grief, how long do we have to
wait for that rescue boat?

559
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,626
Who knows...

560
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,363
Alright Heiji...

561
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,432
We'll see you back there later...

562
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,266
Alright

563
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:36,601
Be careful!

564
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:37,502
Don't worry.

565
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,474
Listen Kudo, something
about this isn't right...

567
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,374
I Know...

568
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:46,611
With the first victim Miss Taira,

569
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,348
the killer took the time to fold her arms
neatly over her chest and close her eyes

571
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,618
but the second victim, the
captain, was beaten to death

573
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,823
Their killers might've
been different but still,

575
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,025
the methods are drastically different...

576
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,128
Another thing bothers me

577
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,731
the way Miss Taira and the captain
behaved before they were killed

579
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,201
Yeah, she deliberately chose to dive
where the current was fast,

581
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,937
knowing how dangerous it was

582
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:18,176
and the captain circled around
the island until the very last minute

584
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,512
And there was seabed exploratory
equipment on board too...

586
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,415
he must've been searching for something

587
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:30,387
and it was probably attached
to that anchor I found

589
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:32,490
but what was it...

590
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,026
But besides that Kudo.

591
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,363
Remember the words written on the back
of the chairs in the room we were all in

593
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:41,065
Uh huh...the ones
written by a child in crayon?

595
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:47,038
The one I was sitting on, had "Me"
written on it. and Ram's had "Mama"

597
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,241
But. on the back of the
one I was sitting on was

599
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,443
Mr. Kaneshiro...

600
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,380
The little girl wrote it didn't she?

601
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,516
Then Mr. Kaneshiro would be
her father then, wouldn't he

603
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,319
I wonder why she didn't write Papa?

604
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,689
And those were the only
chairs with names on them

606
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,026
Another thing bothers me, there
weren't any chairs for

608
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:12,130
Kaachan and Chiyoni
who she compared heights with...

610
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,901
I know, { seems strange that they'd
have their own rooms but no chairs

612
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:22,640
Kaachan and Chiyoni
I wonder who they are!

Crackers and cookies!

What was that sound?

672
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,107
I don't know, It
sounded like water dripping
