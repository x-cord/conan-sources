00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,548
The only reason I can think of that

45
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,352
Bellmott would o after Ai's life
and want me to stay away from her is if,

48
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,323
heridentity is the actress
Chris Vineyard as well as Sharon.

50
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,559
That is,
she is one and the same with both!

52
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,563
She was probably acting out
two roles under disguise...

54
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:04,519
If she knows mom, she would've probably
seen pictures of me as a kid,

56
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,072
so she would've easily
ade out who ll am...

58
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,474
and I also understand why

59
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,859
she-wouldrvt want to become
messed up with a scandal...

61
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,046
I'll be fine!

62
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,783

I promise to make it back alive!

I didn't come here just to die...

72
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,052
Even if you were to be arrested,

73
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:56,855

75
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,225

76
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,196
But. I'd like you ta give me your word...

77
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,999
that you will not lay a hand
on anyone else except me...

79
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,205
Will you promise to give me your word?

80
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,074
Okay...

81
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,112
I'll save all the others except
for this woman FBI agent here...

83
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,581
But first, I'll get rid of you, Sherry...

84
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:24,783

Don't tell me he killed himself?

220
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,625

and snuck inside,

230
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,712
Oo search my car...

231
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,350
She heard the bullets and came outside...

232
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,054
Then protected the brown haired girl,
who had-a-gun: pointed at her...

234
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,392
But, because of the gun fire a while back,
they probably thought they were shot...

236
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,111
Nd both passed out...

237
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,832
Gee...l don't know
if you can say they got guts or not...

239
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,703
Then, I'll leave the rest up to you...

240
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,240
Just go ahead and explain to them that
an FBI agent on a long leave of absence

242
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,144
came to Japan and got mixed up
in a case of a kid being kidnapped...

244
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,147
Since that chick got away

245
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,919
nobody would believe anything
e say anyway...

247
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,356
The big guy behind all
this hasn't come up front yet...

249
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,458
and besides I

250
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:45,797
can't have that girl
with the brown hair see me yet...

253
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,051
IHL.
U2'. »

257
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,687
Okay. boss...heave, heave...

258
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,908
Hah...

259
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,881
ow...this child...

260
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:41,185
What shall do with this boy who thinks
he is capable of doing everything...

262
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,730
Huh /!

263
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,640
The electrodes of an ECG monitor?!

264
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,677
There is a tracing device
s well as a recorder...

266
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,396
D.Don't tell me that

267
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,397
the sound of the telephone
made just a while ago was...

269
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:11,883
Don't...

270
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,219
If you pull that out.

271
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,688
It means that my heart has stopped...

272
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,958
and the mail address of the boss
you sent an e-mail

274
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,594
o will be disclosed...

275
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,265
The telephone company
must protect the privacy of their clients...

277
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,100
But the police

278
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,703
can get that information
if they fill out a special form

280
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,272
and have one of the big shots
stamp a seal on it,

282
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:37,241
then have the information
disclosed before several witnesses...

284
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,878
If the call that was received was
not from a cell phone,

286
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,315
but a regular home phone,
even the address would be disclosed!!

288
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,284
In other words,

289
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,085
if the sound just now is recorded

290
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,088
and analyzed to decipher
the alphabets and number,

292
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,791
the name of your boss, as well as
his whereabouts can be tracked down!!

294
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,129
That is, even if I were 10 be killed!

295
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,133
I did figure that if you found Sherry

296
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:02,366
I did figure that if youfound Sherry

297
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,586
who you. guys are going
nuts looking for you

299
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,607
would unmistakably
ontact your big boss...

301
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,611
Since things began to
Iook dangerous for Jodie

303
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,781
changed my plans, but...

304
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,650
so. what now?!

305
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:27,191
My friends are waiting for contact
from me at a distant place from here...

307
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,130
If you don't want this to go out,

308
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,132
take me to your boss!!

309
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,269
Let's get things over
with once and for all, Bellmott!!

311
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,772
I want to stop playing
hide-and-seek already!!!

313
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,347
Kay...

314
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,881
Iose...

315
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,384
I'll give up going after Sherry...

316
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,753
uh, fuh. fun. .

317
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:58,389
Huh

318
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,658
What the...?!

319
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,161
Ss mere sleeping gas...

320
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,496
Y.You fool,

321
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,065
If you do something like this,
you'll suck in the gas too...

323
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,501
s...this is a gamble...

324
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,237
F you get up first...

325
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,007
you go ahead and call the police
and have me arrested,

327
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,110
then go raid the boss along with them...

328
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,480
What happens if I get up first...

329
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,714
You already know, don't you?

330
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,852
B, Bad news!!

331
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,723
I've got to go wake him up right away...

332
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,258
or else Shinichi is in danger...

333
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,363
Huh?

334
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,182
S.Shinichi!!

335
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:44,868
Shinichi!!

You guys were blasted by Shu Akai?

385
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:20,047
Y.Yes...he'just happened to find us by,

386
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,933
and-Calvados ended up
with 3 broken-nbs...

388
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:23,166
and Calvados ended up
with 3 broken ribs...

390
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:28,556
Oh...you mean that FBI agent that you
failed to get rid of back

392
00:23:28,557 --> 00:23:32,977
in New York a year'ago: when you
disguised yourself as the street ripper...

394
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,712
I thought he'd be off
his guard if he figured

396
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,214
I was just a mere street ripper. but...

397
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,483
Heave...heave

398
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,286
I should've gotten rid of him
back .then even

400
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:44,755
if I had to risk being killed myself...

401
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:56,183
Whaaal!!

402
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,637
Heave, heave...

403
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,307
Heave., heave...

404
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,909
that guys. .

405
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,143
that our biabbss...

406
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,310
heave, heave

407
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:10,964
fears could be our silver bullet...

408
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,323
Phooey!

409
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:25,262
A sliver bullet capable of finishing us
off in one blow;doesn't exist.

411
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:30,233
A:At any rate, I'm in a phone booth on
route 20, so can you come pick me up?

413
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:34,738
1.1 got into a bit of trouble.

414
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,740
And can't move...

415
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,044
Before that I have something
I want to ask you...

417
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:45,216
Do you know a kid by the name off
Shinichi Kudo?

419
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,089
No..l dent...

420
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,592
WwW. Why did you save me?

421
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:58,529
Phooey...
Who needs a reason.

423
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:04,151
Does logical reasoning exist as to
why people save other people?

425
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,740
Yes. it's him...

426
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:18,182
He, the one who pierced
through m heart

428
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,951
could probably become...

429
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,664
the one that I have long awaited,

430
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,001
the silver bullet...

431
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,469
Sigh...

432
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,778
Atgany rate, we'll have to figure out
what this.mark that Ayumi drew is...

434
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,280
That's first priority...

435
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,481
H.Hey!!

436
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,953
The mark on Santa's
butt sure looks familiar...

438
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,230
