1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:04,704
Just as flowing water has no form,
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,606
deductions take all shapes and styles in
each and every case to be solved

5
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,374
A parent is a parent but not the child.

6
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,142
Ran"s challenge outdoes Kogoro.

7
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:11,944
He sees through the one and only truth

8
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,479
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult,

10
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,746
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

12
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,383
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,454
UNSEEN WEAPON
RAN'S FIRST CASE

16
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,322
It's so hot!

17
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,560
He Akasaka Princess Hotels
a nice hotel but this hill's a killer

19
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,328
You're so right!

20
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,897
I'd like to change right away
and jump right into the pool, don't.you?

22
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,232
Listen Ran...

23
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,236
I'm going to find me a gorgeous guy
so don't you get in my way, understand?

25
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,672
Yes, yea, I understand completely...

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,808
By the way, have you heard
anything from Shinichi?

29
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,144
No not since he left

30
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,647
Is he working on another case?

31
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,818
I just don't understand how one can get
so worked about a case...

33
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,890
Look at that car

34
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:39,658
This doesn't look good!

35
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,731
Look out!!

36
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,802
I'm so sorry! Are you two all right?!

37
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,837
We're fine

38
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,572
Just barely...

39
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,542
AKASAKA PRINCESS HO EL

40
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,444
So Ms Yoshino,

41
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,980
you're an instructor
at a flower design school...

43
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,549
Yes, I commute to Shizuoka,
5 days a week.

45
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,153
Did you say Shizuoka?
That's very far, isn't it

47
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:08,320
Chie Yoshino (31)
Flower Designer

50
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,922
No, in fact,
Chie Yoshino (31)
Flower Designer

54
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,224
I was on my way to school just now
when I remembered today was a holiday...
Chie Yoshino (31)
Flower Designer
FF ==

59
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,793
I was on my way to school just now
when I remembered today was a holiday...

62
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,861
So I called my husband,

63
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,898
oh, he works for an insurance company

64
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,400
and we made plans
to meet here at this hotel...

66
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,403
we were going to have lunch

67
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,172
Oh, I see...

68
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,541
I'm really very sorry about
what happened.

70
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,211
I suddenly got dizzy and
Iost consciousness for a second.

72
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,514
I've been getting dizzy spells
and splitting headaches a lot lately...

75
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,818
Maybe you're sick?

76
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,421
No, the doctor couldn't
find anything wrong...

78
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,590
It's probably the weather...

79
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:48,761
the temperature's been fluctuating
so radically lately, hasn't it?

81
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,564
And I guess the
fatigue's been building up

83
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,699
since I have to drive to
and from Shizuoka every day.

85
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:58,270
The proof is, when there's no school
or when it's cool, even if it's a weekday,

87
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,272
I feel fine, nothing happens

88
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,041
Is that so...

89
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,741
Chie!

90
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,478
Oh! Hi there!

91
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,314
This is my husband, Akio Yoshino

92
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:09,982
Oh hello

93
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:13,385
This is Ran Mouri and Sonoko Suzuki...

94
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,756
I had another dizzy spell
and nearly ran them down

96
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,158
Again...?

97
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,127
Were you hurt in any way?

98
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,230
No we're fine! But it was a close call

99
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:26,765
Your wife was nice enough
to treat us to lunch...

101
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,334
I St...

102
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,536
Please accept my apologies

103
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,504
And how do you feel?

104
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,239
I'm OK...

105
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,774
I felt fine after I rested a while.

106
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,177
Good. I'm so relieved

107
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,446
He seems so nice

109
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,016
Excuse me, I think we'll be going now

110
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,886
That's right,
you were going to the pool, weren't you

112
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:47,987
All right then

113
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,056
Where do you two live?

114
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,559
In Beika

115
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:57,463
Why, that's near us. We live in Haido...

116
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,366
We live very close to the park,
please drop by sometime!

118
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,200
Thank you!

119
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,337
A bump?

120
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,474
Eh?!

121
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,677
Oops, What is this!

122
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:15,080
Ran, be careful! There's a bump here!

123
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:15,713
OK...

124
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,259
Well?

125
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,994
Don't you think it's strange?

126
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,929
What is?

127
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:33,966
I just told you he knew she had
just had a dizzy spell,

129
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,635
so why didn t he warn her
about-the bump?

131
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:39,471
She couldn't gotten hurt badly
if she had tripped and fell!

133
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,474
She couldn't gotten hurt badly
If she had tripped and fell!

135
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,010
I don't see why you're
making such a big deal out of it

137
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,447
But Sonoko warned me about it...

138
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:51,383
and I know that guy would too...

139
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,286
What?! That guy...?!

140
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,387
Who're you talking-aboltit?

141
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,324
Oh, nothing. /

142
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,527
Anyway!
I'm very curious about that couple...

144
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,829
I think I'll go over to visit
Chie and check things out

146
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:05,831
And do what?

147
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:10,035
I want to find out what's causing her to
have those headaches and dizzy spells!

149
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,804
What?

150
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,340
You're no doctor, don't poke your nose
where It doesn't belong

152
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,475
I'm not.stupid, I can figure it out!

153
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,943
If you're going to insist, go ahead and try

154
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,745
I most certainly will!

156
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,850
what's with her, live never heard her say
anything like this...

158
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,854
But she does that a point,
something's fishy

160
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,890
Hey, can-I*go with you...

161
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,627
Do you wantito-come with.me.,

162
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,362
Then I'll ask Sonoko to come
along and we:-ll7all go together!

164
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,564
Humph, what do I care

165
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,801
I guess I'll have my rice now

166
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,902
Get it yourself!!

167
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,504
What?!

168
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,706
What a grouch...

169
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,176
YOSHINO'S HOUSE

170
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:51,510
Wow, this place is super nice!!
YOSHINO'S HOUSE

172
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,446
Wow, this place is super nice!!

173
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,883
The garden's so well cared for.

174
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,252
Your home is so beautiful

175
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,954
Thank you!

176
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,857
We just-finished building
this place a month and a half ago

178
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,294
I had a feeling it was new

179
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,596
A new house, how wonderful!!

180
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:15,301
But carrying a loan of
40 million yen is pretty rough

182
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:20,372
That's why we both have to work,
otherwise we'd never make ends meet...

184
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,641
Here you are

185
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:23,342
Thank you

186
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,946
I apologize for barging in on you
when it's your day off

188
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,415
It's quite all right!

189
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,251
Unfortunately, my husband
went out this morning, so I'm alone today

191
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,087
Your husband seems so nice!

192
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,789
Yes, I suppose he is...

193
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,924
he loves cars and he's been
complaining lately

195
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,528
that he hasn't been able to
go out for drives like he used to

197
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:47,199
I guess that's why he goesOout walking
every morning, to take his mind of it.

199
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,036
And while he's out,
I fix breakfast, that's our daily routine

201
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,705
Umm...

202
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,708
this may be a strange thing to ask

203
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,377
why do you go
all the way to Shizuoka to work?

205
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,046
To help pay for the loan...

206
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:04,950
I used to teach at
a design school here in the city

208
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:09,388
but my husband told
me about this school in Shizuoka...

210
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,358
the salary was better there

211
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:13,759
Oh I see...

212
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,628
But still, it's pretty hard on you, isn't it?

213
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,931
Driving there every day

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,532
That's right!

215
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,302
If you took the train, you'd at least
be able to get some sleep...

217
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,972
Actually, I enjoy driving.

218
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,007
The entrance to the highway is near here

219
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,610
it's much more convenient when you have
a lot of supplies and large-equipment

221
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,510
isn't it?

222
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:33,912
I guess...

223
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,282
By the way, have you kids-ever
thought about insurance...

225
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,584
oh dear!

226
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,552
I forgot, you're still in school

227
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,920
Eh? What was that?

228
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,522
I'm terribly sorry

229
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,091
my husband works for an
insurance company and

231
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,760
I've gotten into the habit of
suggesting people to get insurance

233
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,797
As a wife, you're
helping your husband, right?

235
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,766
Yes, well...

236
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,969
I felt bad about just
suggesting it to others

238
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,072
so I just recently adjusted
my policy to 100 million

241
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,474
A hundred million?!

242
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,245
My husband asked me to...

243
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,514
the monthly payments are very high

244
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,416
but it's the kind of policy where
after the fixed period has passed,

246
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,885
even if you cancel the policy,
you still get the premium back

248
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,487
I figured it'd make
his job performance look good

250
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,123
Uhm you're really
crazy about him. aren't you?

252
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,426
Eh. Oh, do you think so

253
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,327
100 million yen...

254
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,799
he wouldn't. .but then...

255
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,271
Excuse me, when did you start having
those headaches and dizzy spells?

258
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,575
Let's see, about a month ago I guess...

259
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,243
A month ago...s

260
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,613
half a month after the house was built...

261
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:45,584
Maybe that's what they call
sick house syndrome

263
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:46,718
Eh.»

264
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,123
Sick house syndrome...

265
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,893
Did you say "Shiku haku 7?

266
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,930
I said sick house syndrome!
SYNDROME

268
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,231
It's when people get sick
from the gas given off
HOUSE SYNDROME [M15 C5 (

271
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,800
It's when people get sick
from the gas given off

273
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,069
the«dumber and paint used
when building a house!

275
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,604
Sonoko, I'm sure you've heard of
orma ey e

277
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,575
Sonoko, I'm sure you've heard of
formaldehyde
FORMALDEHYDE

280
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:09,975
FORMALDEHYDE

281
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,610
Don't make fun of me!

282
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,979
Of course I know about those things!

283
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,615
I'm not sure...but don't think that's it

285
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,517
Why not?

286
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:22,921
The contractor who built this house is
a friend of my husband's...

288
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:29,561
My husband would have told them
not to use anything that was dangerous

290
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,366
But I still think
you should have it checked out!

292
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,969
The contractor could have deceived you...

293
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,570
Sonoko!

294
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,039
Do you know of any companies that
specialize in checking for

296
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,441
contaminated building supplies?

297
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,009
Well, sure...

298
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,645
my father would probably know,
we could ask him...

300
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,514
All right then, let's ask him right away!

301
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,984
Chie, I think you should have it
checked to be on the safe side!

303
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,652
Well, OK...

304
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,098
Ran, you're acting strange today.

305
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,567
Why did you insist on
getting her house checked?

307
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,135
I had my reasons...

308
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,872
Ran thinks Chie's husband,

309
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:19,510
Akio, is trying to kill
her to collect the insurance money

312
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,247
Ran, is that true?!

313
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,216
Yes.

314
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,986
What's going on?!

315
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:34,893
First, Akio gets the contractor to build
the house using dangerous materials

317
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:38,430
so that Chie's health starts getting bad...

318
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,499
And on the other hand,

319
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:44,635
he suggests she take the job in Shizuoka

320
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,705
Eh? But why?

321
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,841
Chie does as he suggests

322
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,510
and drives to and from work
on the highway every day

324
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,614
if she should have
a dizzy spell while driving...

326
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,893
No...l don't believe it!

327
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,062
Ran, your imagination's working overtime.

328
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:16,201
After all, wouldn't
the house make Akio sick too?

330
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,970
He does live there too you know!

331
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:23,442
But those materials could've been used
only for her room and the kitchen

333
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,614
Of course, we have no proof.

334
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,584
But as long as the possibility exists,
I thought it was best to check it out

336
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,822
At this point,

337
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,425
we still don't know if
Ran"s suspicions are correct, but

339
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,963
something, something wasn't right

340
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,331
I.couldn't put my finger on it...

341
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,204
This Is the instrument that
measures the amount of formaldehyde

343
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,839
According to room,

344
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,308
there's a possibility that different
materials were used in each room

346
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,778
so I think it's best if we checked
every room to be accurate

348
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,481
Fine, you may start anytime

349
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,650
All right then let's begin

350
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:09,154
When Chie told me about this,
I was shaken up

352
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:14,826
but then there is a possibility the
contractor did use those kind of materials

354
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,764
so I figured it might be
better to have it checked

356
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,267
Yes, of course, we agree

357
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,202
Well, I'm going for a walk...

358
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,073
I'll pick up some cake on the way back

359
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,341
That would be nice

360
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,242
See you later...

361
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,948
He really loves to take walks!

362
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,618
I'm going to take a walk too!

363
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,487
Hey Conan, don't stay out too long!

364
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:43,288
Okay

365
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,224
That customer's going to buy it, isn't he?

366
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,860
Yes! He used to come
in all the time on his days off

368
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,261
but I think he's made up his mind now!

369
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:25,497
Eh?!

370
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,799
25 million yen!!

371
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,735
Oh come on, is he serious?!

372
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,436
We have the results!

373
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:36,241
Every room shows a level much lower
than 0.08 ppm which is the level

375
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:41,179
the Ministry of Health and Welfare
has declared safe 4 years ago

377
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,515
Are you sure about that?

378
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,484
And what does that mean?

379
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,553
It means this house is absolutely safe!!

380
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,322
What a relief...

381
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:55,427
I guess it's not sick house syndrome
that's making me sick

383
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:56,962
You're just tired

384
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,631
Let's try to get to bed earlier

385
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:00,632
T Co.

386
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,269
I don't understand.

387
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,006
Is there something else going on here?!

388
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,247
I told you so!

389
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:20,018
That's what happens when
amateurs try to do a professional s job!

391
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,222
I wonder, could it just
have been my imagination...

393
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:31,797
I hope you didn't tell them you were
the famous Kogoro Mouri's daughter

395
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,032
Of course not

396
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,801
That's good,

397
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,971
I hope this taught you not to go sticking
your nose into other people's business

399
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,275
Well, answer me!

400
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,143
I understand

401
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,855
I guess I just can't compete
with that guy...

403
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,758
Phew...

404
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,032
Conan

405
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,303
Ran, I don't think you were wrong

407
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,477
I overheard the salesmen
at the place they sell sports cars,

409
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,949
Akio Is going to buy
a car that costs 25 million yen!

411
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,351
25 million yen?!

412
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,486
Where's he getting the money from...

413
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,423
the insurance on Chie?!

414
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,925
So he trying to kill Chie!

415
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,193
Yeah...

416
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,930
even after he pays off the loan on
th Shouse, he'll still havel60 million left

418
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,169
But there-was no sign
the air in the house was contaminated...

420
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,372
Maybe he was poisoning her food...!

421
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:51,343
But I think she does all the cooking

422
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,378
That's right...

423
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,455
What do you think?

424
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,723
How's he doing it...?

425
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:10,161
While I'm sitting here,
danger could be creeping up on Chie...

427
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:14,132
Oh! Shinichi, what am I going to do!!!

428
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,903
Something's bugging me.

429
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,805
And it's been bugging me ever
since Ran told me about it...

433
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,776
What is it?

434
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,445
Wait a minute, I'm sure Chie said...

435
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,116
That's it! I've figured it out!!

437
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,620
You want to know what
Chie told me the first time?

439
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:36,621
Yeah!

440
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,424
What did she say about her dizzy spells?

441
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,260
I'm pretty sure...

442
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,397
It's probably the weather.

443
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:49,501
The temperatures been
fluctuating so radically lately, hasn't it?

445
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:52,871
And I guess the
fatigue's been building up

447
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,472
since I have to drive to and from
Shizuoka every day.

449
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,878
The proof is, when there's no school
on Saturday or when it's cool,

451
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,613
even if it's a weekday,
I feel fine, nothing happens.

453
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,883
That's what she said...

454
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:05,850
See!

455
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,653
If it was something in the house

456
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,691
then wouldn't the symptoms
be worse on her days off

458
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,427
when she's at home longer
instead of when sheys out?

460
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,829
You know. .you're right

461
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,232
I think the thing that's giving her
headaches and dizzy spells

463
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,134
isn't in the house

464
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,970
It's some place else?

465
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,440
Oh, maybe at the
design school in Shizuoka?

467
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,276
Some place between
her house and the school...

470
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:36,614
You don't think!

471
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:39,584
NEXT DAY

472
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,553
I'm going for my walk now
NEXT DAY

474
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:42,020
NEXT DAY

475
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,456
OK, is ham and eggs for breakfast
okay with you?

477
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,826
Sounds good!
I'll be hungry when I come home

479
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,094
so make a lot!

481
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:06,411
41% UN

483
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,279
ATT UM

484
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,047
ATTN [UV

485
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:35,240
Hey, what the...?!
What are you kids doing here?

487
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:39,144
Mr. Yoshino, what did you
just put in your pocket?

489
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,947
Eh? Oh, this,
it's an air conditioner disinfectant,

491
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:47,419
I wanted to protect Chie
from cold germs and other bacteria

493
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,389
OK then; when the police get here,
you'll show that to them, won't you

495
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,524
Eh?!

496
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,694
I just called them.
I have a friend on the force

498
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,930
P, police...!

499
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:02,367
I'm sure Chie would never have dreamed

500
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,805
her husband, the man she most
trusted, was spraying

502
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,375
an unseen weapon into her car's
air conditioner every morning.

504
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:14,779
That's why Chie never got sick
when she didn't drive to work

506
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,850
or when it was cool enough where
she didn't have to use the air conditioner.

AKIO...

510
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,779
Later. the police investigation showed

511
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:50,115
that the can of spray contained a diluted

512
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,218
agricultural chemical
composed of organic chlorine

514
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,287
Akio Yoshino had
embezzled several million

516
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,457
from his company
and was trying to cover the deficit

518
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,528
but he also wanted a new sports car
and that's why he thought up this plan,

520
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,996
that's what his confession stated

Eh? You mean Chie sold the house?

565
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,566
Yes and along with
some friends and flower shops,

567
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,835
she opened her own
flower design company!

569
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,703

573

She looks good!

574
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,345
Chie Taniguchi...she got a divorce
and went back to her maiden name

576
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,915
Boy, women get over things so quickly...

577
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,052
And Ran sure was sharp, getting
suspicious about Akio Yoshino

579
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,287
over a little thing like
a bump on the ground...

581
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,823
I'm so glad things worked out.

582
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:15,693
If you hadn't noticed anything and done
all you did, Chie might be dead now!

584
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,861
Hold on now!

585
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,964
Maybe you're getting to be like
you know who". huh?

587
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,067
Oh don't be silly...

588
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,904
But I guess you could say I wanted to
understand him a little more,

590
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,074
maybe get to feel closer to him...

591
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,445
Yes, I understand

592
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,882
so, do you understand
Shinichi a little more now?

594
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,854
No way!

595
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,524
Who can understand that mystery fanatic!

596
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,693
Oh of all the!

597
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,397
But never mind that, let's go eat
some yummy cakes!

599
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,001
Well, I guess it's for the best

600
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,543
Eh?!
Was he trying toxdamage his own car?

602
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,885
Hey, doesn't the president have
a mobile telephone with him?

604
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:18,089
Ran?!
