and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,406
Today's mystery involves
the Youth Detective League.

00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,675
The picturesa.child draws holds
the key to the case.

9
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,243
He sees through the one and only truth

10
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,246
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

12
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:15,581
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,531
Just as expected of you,
this is a terrible picture, Genta!

16
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,202
Hey; come on, talk for yourself Mitsuhiko!

17
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,206
Say what you Like!

18
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,709
A man's value is not to be judged
by the picture he draws!

20
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,043
You're right!

21
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:32,351
But, people who can draw nicely
are admirable and I really respect them.

23
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,720
1. guess so...

24
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,290
Maybe I'll think of commuting to
art class starting tomorrow

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,159
Oh, count me in too!

27
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,695
Really I tell you...

What a weird man!

36
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,813
I smell a crime.

37
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,991
What? What? What?

38
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:12,992
M,Money?!

39
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,261
T,Talk about a large sum of money too!!

40
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,834
That's...maybe?

41
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,173
Hold it, mister!!

42
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,308
Why do you have all that money.

43
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,476
Are you a thief?

44
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,679
N.,No! I'm...

45
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,614
Get him!

46
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,582
Oooh... TI

00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,451
Wait, you guys

48
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,757
Let me go! The boy...

49
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,660
The boy will... be killed!

50
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,696
What does it mean?

51
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,032
J, Just as I thought!!

52
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:00,039
The Kidnapper in the Picture

53
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,826
My hunch was right after all...

54
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,032
Right... it was a kidnap case!!

55
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,836
The one who was kidnapped is
Akio Tsubakuro, age 5,

57
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:31,137
The one who was kidnapped is
Akio Tsubakuro, age 5

Akio Tsubakuro

85
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:47,286
And the bunch of bills were ransom
moeny for Akio who had been kidnapped.

87
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:52,024
All right, then Mr. Tsubakuro,
will you please explain the details.

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,225
Get out of here...

90
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,794
Mr. Tsubakuro...

91
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,998
What's this?

92
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:04,603
It's a picture that Akio drew,
that was sent here from the kidnapper.

94
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,206
When did you receive it?

95
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,009
About noon yesterday...

96
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,046
It was in the mail box
together with the blakmail...

98
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,515
I see...

99
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,054
And that's the blackmail...

100
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:26,692
Price of your child,-10 billion yen... Clown"

101
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,796
Wow~~! How many servings of eel
over rice can you eat with that amount?

103
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,932
Ah, come on, Genta!

104
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:37,236
But, the money we just saw a while ago,
was far from 10 billion yen.

106
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,370
That money was just to display

107
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:43,275
whether they really had the will
to pay the ransom amount or not.

109
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,544
I'm sure that the kidnapper
back then was...

111
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:54,552
Yep, I'm sure, right!!

112
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,489
Y,Yes...that's right...

113
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,893
Hey, hey, I appreciate you
reporting the case to the police,

115
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:02,861
but from here,
we the police will take care of things

117
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,597
So, go and hurry on home!!

118
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,131
What 211

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,903
Inspector! You the police
are also going home!

121
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,772
B,But, Mr. Tsubakuro...

122
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:19,078
Akio is my precious one and only grandson
that my son and his wife :had left behind

124
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,547
after they died of
a traffic accident last year

126
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:26,218
If anything happens to him,
I wouldn't be able to face up to them...

128
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,223
I understand how you feel,
Mr. Tsubakuro, but...

130
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,227
The moment of contact with
the kidnapper when the ransom money is

132
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,596
to be exchanged for the kidnapped
Is the best time to arrest the kidnapper!

134
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,434
10 billion yen is quite heavy to carry,
therefore, the kidnapper...

136
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,669
No!!

137
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,739
I don't care whether
the kidnapper is caught or not!

139
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,908
Ado lidon't want to endanger Akio's life!

140
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,845
Besides, I have no intention to
give the kidnapper the money!

142
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,912
Huh?!

143
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,117
Just what do you mean?

144
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,890
This was In the mail box this morning...

145
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,725
Account where the money
IS to be transferred to

147
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:11,130
Swiss Fontvelle Bank...

148
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,133
S,. Swiss Bank?!

149
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,103
Inspector, we'd better order
stop payment

151
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,407
or ask the bank to tell us
who the account belongs to...

153
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,474
It's no use.

154
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,175
What?

155
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,878
Switzerland ls a bank nation.

156
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,680
If things go that easily,

157
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,649
the existence of the banks
In Switzerland would-lose their meaning.

159
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,751
Oh.Oh god...

160
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,953
I hate to say so...

161
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,357
But, it's just as the boy says.

162
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,026
No matter what the case,
they are no exceptions.

164
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:45,898
But if by doing so Akio
IS going to come back safe...

166
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,467
So, please!! Leave!

167
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,670
Mr. Tsubakuro...

168
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,308
Then...

169
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,476
This is...

170
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,411
A perfect crime?!

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,753
Um, Inspector.

172
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:11,156
Don't tell me that
you gave up on ie inves iga ion.

174
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,891
Of course!

175
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,227
As long as Mr. Tsubakuro
wants it that way,

177
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:18,864
we can't involve ourselves
in his paying the ransom.

179
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:24,169
However, being the police, we can let
such a ruthless crime go unchecked!!

181
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,974
Which means that as soon as the ransom
Is paid and Akio is returned safely,

183
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,144
you're going to start
an all out investigation, right?

185
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,445
Exactly!

186
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:43,355
But, even if the ransom is paid, there is
no guarantee that Akio will returned safely.

188
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,763
Oh, Akio really likes to draw, doesn't he...

189
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,001
This is...!!

190
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,743
What's up, Conan?

191
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,045
Conan?

192
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,252
Mr. Tsubakuro! Will you please show me
Akio s picture one more time!

194
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,691
Just as I thought, it's here too!!

195
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,295
Oh! That's Akio's habit.

196
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,463
Habit?

197
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,432
When he draws a picture,

198
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:30,335
he draws whatever
catches his attention as his signature.

200
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,670
Whatever catches his attention?

201
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:36,707
Come to think of it, I think I've seen
the same thing somewhere before.

203
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,711
Really? Where?

204
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,682
Hmm -1 wonder where it was

205
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,119
Oh! That's right.

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,989
When I went to South Beika Kindergarten
where Akio goes to,

208
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,725
I was shown a picture that he drew.

209
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,562
South Beika Kindergarten, I got it!

210
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,832
Mr. Tsubakuro, please lend me
this picture, I'll bring it right back!!

212
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,366
H,Hey, sonny...

213
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,443
Excuse me!

215
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:13,879
Do you want anything, sonny...

216
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,516
I would like to have a look at the picture
that Akio Tsubakuro had drawn.

218
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:20,284
Akio's drawing?

219
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:26,358
The one that Akio's grandfather looked
as is probably this picture posted here.

221
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,563
There!! This is the one!!

222
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:36,768
Um, teacher,
where did Akio draw this picture?

225
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,379
No doubt about it. That signature is
the same as the one that Akio drew.

227
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:52,851
Moreover, the one that was sent over is
what he drew in confinement.

229
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,022
Which means .

230
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:01,693
If I can figure out where this is, I'll be
able to find where Akio is being confined.

232
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,863
Ut... the problem is...

233
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,031
Conan!!

234
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,800
Just what do you think
you're doing, Conan?!

236
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,569
It's not fair leaving us out, you know!!

237
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,271
LI... didn't mean to...

238
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,072
Don't play dumb with us!!

239
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,476
I'll bet you're planning
rescue Akio all by yourself!!

241
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,444
We'll help you out.

242
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,446
D.Don't be rididulous!

243
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,283
We're dealing with
a kidnapper, you know!!

245
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,617
We can never tell what kind of danger
we may be encountering

247
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,652
But!

248
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,252
But!

249
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,289
Take a look at this picture,
Akio looks:so happy!

251
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,323
Yes.

253
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:34,693
He's enjoying watching TV
with the kidnapper and laughing.

255
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,496
Yes, thisfis Kamen Yaiba, isn't it.

256
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,397
Yeah!

257
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:42,601
As far as this picture goes,

259
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,603
If we're going to rescue him, it's now!!

260
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:45,237
Yep!

261
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:45,604
Yep!

262
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,707
Conan, that's what
you were thinking too, right?!

264
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,576
You guys...

265
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,913
Besides: this is a case
that we brought attention to!!

267
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,981
Right,.right!!

268
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,217
Okay!

269
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,721
But, only until we find
the place he's confined in.

271
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,290
After that, we leave everything
in the hands of the police!

273
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,960
Hmm -his signature...

274
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:09,260
Hmm -~-his signature...

275
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,596
I see...

276
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:14,032
But, what is it he drew here?

277
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,734
A spaceman?

278
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,204
Isn't this a chimney
attached to some building?

280
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,974
No I'm sure it's a spaceman!

281
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,010
What makes you think
he can see a spaceman from here?

283
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,413
But, there's no chimney
IN view from here either...

285
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,215
Well, that's true...

286
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,918
This is no time to be arguing!

287
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,287
It doesn't matter
whether it's a chimney or a building...

289
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,990
Iet's split up and look for the thing
that looks like this signature.

291
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,124
Okay!

292
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,846
There it is!!

293
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,014
Huh?!

294
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,650
Really, Ayumi!

295
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,519
Look isn't that it?!

296
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,989
A water supply tower... But ,.

297
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,825
It sort of looks like it...
And kind of doesn't look like it

299
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:17,295
I'm surer*that's it!

300
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,698
Really?

301
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,967
How can you be so sure?

302
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:27,105
Look, what do you see in the foreground
of that water supply tower?

304
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,976
A clock. ?

305
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,046
A park?

306
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:34,880
Yeah...

307
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,015
So, what!

308
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,551
A park is not included in his signature...!

309
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,119
Take a good look.

312
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:43,455
There's something that looks like eyeballs
in the middle of the signature, isn't there?

314
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,757
There's somethingithat looks like eyeballs
in the middle of the signature, isn't there?

316
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,959
True.

317
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,027
Definitely...

318
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,933
How would you see if the water supply
tower and clock overlap on each other?

320
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:02,407
Right, The thing that looked like eyeballs
on the signature was that clock!

322
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:06,144
Which means that Akio is
in the water supply tower?

324
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:12,017
No, he s at a place where he sees
the. water supply tower and clock overlap

326
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,618
I see!

327
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,722
Let's go to the water supply tower, then!

328
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,758
Maybe we can see where Akio is!

329
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,593
Okay, let's go!!

330
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,474
How is it, Conan?

331
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,641
Yeah...

332
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,845
That place in view over there is
the park with the clock...

334
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,182
The eyeball of Akio's signature is drawn

335
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,652
so that it fits right into
the center of water supply tower...

337
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,154
In other words...

338
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,090
Although there may be slight differences,

339
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:56,161
Akio is most likely confined
somew ere wi in IS range.

341
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,999
Holy cow! Talk about a lot of houses...

342
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,436
It s hard to tell from here, after all.

343
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,006
If we all split up and search,
I'm sure we'll find him in not time at all!

345
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,642
Okay! Let's give it a try!

346
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:20,051
If you see any suspicious
person or house,

348
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,953
use your badge and call immediately

349
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,323
Don't ever attempt to go after
the kidnapper alone

351
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,859
or even think of attempting to
rescue Akio on your own!

353
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,618
How was it?

354
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,588
There were quite a few
suspicious looking places, but...

356
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,658
There was nothing all that conclusive
of any one of those places...

358
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,428
There are too many places yet, to really
narrow down the place of confinement.

360
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,731
Hey, wheres Ayumi?

361
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:07,966
Huns

362
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,433
Huh?

363
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,670
We were all supposed to meet
at the park at 5:00.

365
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,977
Yes! This is Ayumi!

366
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,146
Ayumi! Where are you?

367
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,715
Oh! Conan.

368
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:28,620
I figured Akio might be hungry, so I was
shopping at a convenience store.

370
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,956
Ah, come 01!

371
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,192
It's way past the promised time,
you know!

373
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,093
I'm sorry

374
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,797
I'll be right there$
so wait for me just a while more, okay...

376
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:39,464
Huh?

377
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,669
A clowns mask!

378
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,240
Huh? What did you just say?
I couldn't hear you too well?!

380
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,979
Ayumi? Is anything wrong?

381
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,617
What's up,. um?

382
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,719
I've found a suspicious looking person!

383
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,254
A suspicious person?

384
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,488
The kidnapper?

385
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,492
I'm not sure yet, but the clown
that Akio drew was wearing

387
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,896
a triangular hat with a star on it,
and had greemhair.

389
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,198
It was holding the remote controller
with its left hand, wasn't it!

391
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,267
Wait a sec!

392
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,935
Yep, It's exactly as she says.

393
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,471
No doubt about it!

394
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,774
It means that the kidnapper is
Ieft-handed, right?!

396
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,243
Ayumi, don't do anything rash!
Listen to me, will you.

398
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:27,812
Oh, wait!!

399
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:29,781
Ayumi?!

400
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:40,225
I've found him! I'm sure
he's the one who kidnapped Akio!!

402
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,060
I'm going to go after him!!

403
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,828
D,Don't, Ayumi!

404
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,464
It's dangerous, Ayumi!!

405
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,400
Answer us, Ayumi!

406
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,367
I'll be fine!

407
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:54,439
But, I don't want the kidnapper to find
me out, so I'll contact you all later, over!

409
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,207
S,She cut us off...?!

410
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,842
Ayumi... 7?!

411
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,177
Ayumi

412
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,113
Darn it! How could she...

413
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,796
Hey, Conan...

414
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:22,033
How long are we going to wait here
for Ayumi to get in touch with us...?

416
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:26,104
If anything should ever happen
to Ayumi, it's all our fault.

418
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:35,313
I get it! Can't you track where Ayumi is
with that glasses of yours?

420
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,115
Gentar I can't...

421
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,752
Agasa is fixing
my tracking glasses for me now...

423
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,925
Sitting here doinggnothing
isn't going to get us anywhere.

425
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,194
Look where?!

426
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,265
It's Ayumi!

427
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,967
Hello, Ayumi?!

428
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,772
Hi, sonny, I'll bet you're hungry?

429
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:37,108
I bought you some sandwiches.
And crayons and drawing paper too...

431
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,079
Thank you, Mr. Clown!

432
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:52,991
While you were out shopping,
I drew a lot of pictures, Mr. Clown.

434
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,826
Oh, yeah! Good for you!

435
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,528
W, Who is it?!

436
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,634
Who are you?

437
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,471
Akio! You'll be all right now,
because we've all come to save you!!

439
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,206
Who are you?!

440
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,406
How did you come here?!

441
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,579
Hold it!

442
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,147
That's it!

443
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:26,925
Hey hey! Kidnapper! We Detective Boys
are taking you on!

445
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,626
Give yourself in quietly!

446
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,560
Right!!

447
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:30,929
Darn it!

448
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,065
Come, kid!

449
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,700
Mitsuhiko, there he goes!

450
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,208
You're not getting away!!

451
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,541
Conan!

452
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,646
Here you go!!

453
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,185
We did it!

454
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:00,892
Akio!

455
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,195
Are you all right, Akio!

456
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm all right...

457
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:13,304
Akio!! I'm so glad,
really glad that you're safe!!

459
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,841
We did it, didn't we, Conan!

460
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,943
Our strategy worked.

461
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,777
Yeah!

462
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,848
A great victory once again
for the Detective Boys!

After that, Inspector Megure
and the other officers who got our report

510
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,310
came to the scene and
arrested the kidnapper.

512
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,548
But, as for us...

513
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,483
You fool!

514
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:10,188

516
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,325
Bye, bye, big sister!

517
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,963
Thank you, big brothers
of the Detective Boys!

519
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,498
Ye, bye

520
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,601
Let's hang out next time, Akio!!

521
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,169
Bye bye 1)!

522
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,806
