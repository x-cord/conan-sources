Huh?

46
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:16,144
What's that?

47
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,480
It's a proverb of Belgium

48
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:22,217
In order to cut hard diamond
another diamond has to be used. right?

00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:24,753

And? Just who 1s that thief?

64
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:04,459
Are you talking about the partner of

83
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,983
Doc has told me...

84
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:30,585
About your battles...

85
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,055
Our battles?

86
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,524
It seems that
you've been outfoxed quite a few times?

88
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,260
It.It's not that he outfoxed me or anything...

89
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,129
Because he's never sto
an treasure from me yet...

91
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:44,099
Uh is Thief Kid here?

92
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:45,133
Huh.

93
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,269
It's just that he could be...

94
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,338
It was written in the man's notebook. right?

95
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:53,875
That from :now om
Ioan outfox that petty thief...

97
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:58,680
That petty thief that he was referring to
is probably Thief Kid...

99
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:01,883
Then. are you saying that Thief Kid

100
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,618
killed that man?!

101
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,287
Beats mec

102
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:09,157
Rumor has it that
he never takes a person's life though...

104
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:13,128
But, it's for sure that
Thief Kid as well as the one

106
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,397
who killed that man is
still around here somewhere.

108
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,732
Right.

109
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,401
If the treasure hasn't been found yet...

110
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,673
It's most likely that
it's inside this mansion...

112
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,147
El. it's started-to.-rain...

113
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:35,350
SO why don't we go Inside the mansion
and take shelter from theirain...

115
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:37,152
Huh? Then. we're...

116
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:38,353
Treasure hunting

117
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:40,288
We're going to start?!

118
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:42,958
Don't get I me wrong...

119
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,961
It's only until Doc calls the police
and they get here. understand!

121
00:05:45,962 --> 00:05:48,629
All right!

122
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:26,068
But... now that we're going inside,
It sure is a creep mansion...

124
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,204
Are you sure there's treasure in here?

125
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,340
I'm sure it's hidden somewhere in here...

126
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,943
It bothered me a while ago too. but...

127
00:06:35,044 --> 00:06:38,480
The brand new traces of wet mud
on the border of the wall

129
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,615
and the floor of the mansion.

130
00:06:41,084 --> 00:06:43,051
Moreover,
throughout the mansion there is...

132
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,737
I wonder why?

133
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,072
He . Conan.

134
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,290
Huh?!

135
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,293
Explain the meaning of
the writing one more time!

137
00:06:51,294 --> 00:06:55,030
The meaning of the writing that
was written inside the stone lantern!

139
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,032
Oh. that...

140
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,435
The god's not around. right...?

141
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:01,903
Right... 3

142
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:05,507
The resting place of\the gods
Is near the sun...

144
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,342
in an extremely busy location

145
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,846
where the elders get together
that is where gods' stone is...

147
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,882
Those who fear not the rage of the gods

148
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:16,852
In their hands brimming with stones.

149
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,521
He teaches proverbs
from long ago...

151
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,756
Samizu Kichiemon...

152
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,942
In other words.

153
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,395
The gods sleep in a place closet to the sun

154
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:30,966
and where the elders gather,
in a very lively place...

156
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:33,034
That's where the stone of the gods'...

157
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,771
In other words,
the diamond is hidden. right!

159
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:40,308
But. the point Is the words that follow...

160
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:42,043
Yes. that's right.

161
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,479
Conan went on to explain it part way
and became silent,

163
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,181
so we still don't understand it

164
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:49,050
Those who know
10! of the rage of the gods...

166
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,387
Get a hold of the stones that
are brimming out of its hand

168
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,257
and learn from the proverb of long ago...

169
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:58,927
Hmm~What does that mean?

170
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:01,062
The god is going to get angry after all.

171
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:05,467
Yeah 'and the stone Magatama
with the word "fire" carved onto it

173
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:08,336
that was hidden in the hem of the
dead body that was found a while ago...

175
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:14,009
I have no idea what
this has to do with the code at all yet...

177
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:17,379
Huy. Inf, go manic: already

178
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,947
Hold your horse...

179
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:23,151
Isn't there anything else written
in that: man"synotebook?

181
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:28,390
There is, but since it's wet ll think
we should wait until it dries.

183
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,692
Otherwise. it'll rip and become unreadable.

184
00:08:30,693 --> 00:08:32,961
We don't have all day. you know!

185
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,897
H.Hey. Genta!

186
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:42,037
He . Genta!

187
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,705
Don't go inside carelessly!!

188
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:46,841
The puppet maker Kichiemon
built this mansion, you know!

190
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,277
Ymvaaha.

191
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:52,581
The diamond is in a place
nearest to the sun, right?

193
00:08:52,582 --> 00:08:54,182
If so. then I'm sure it's hidden

194
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:55,250
He . Genta!

195
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:57,118
At the top most part of the house!

196
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,860
At any rate. let's go to the very top!

198
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,265
H.Hold it, Genta!

199
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,134
Yep...

200
00:09:14,203 --> 00:09:15,337
Huh?

201
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,540
Whaaa!

202
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:22,210
RGentall
Kugh!

204
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:26,130
Whaaaa~Ugh!

205
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,483
Whaaa

206
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,485
G.Genta!

207
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:38,293
Awhaaa

208
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:43,832
What's with you...
Kids...

210
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,550
Hon ara

211
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,502
Genta. are you all right?

212
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,572
Are you guys looking for
Kichiemon's treasure too?

214
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:54,242
Phooey. well, who cares...

215
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:56,711
You'd better be really careful. though.

216
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:59,114
This step is a trap!

217
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,188
If you want to go up,
you have to go on farther beyond...

219
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,457
Puppet maker Kichiemon is
quite a sourpuss you know...

221
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:14,996
If you move just according to
what you see. you'll get hurt.

223
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,334
By the way, didn't you guys find
an odd looking stone?

225
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,135
Oh. well as to that

226
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:23,204
We didn't find anything!

227
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,272
Huh?

228
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,877
Oh, really?
Tell me if you find it then, okay?

230
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,812
Okay. sure!

231
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:32,547
- He , Conan?!

232
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,749
Why are you lying?

233
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,620
He's a good man
who saved Genta. you know...

235
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,691
You never know if he's a good man...

236
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:47,395
He could acting friendly just so
he can take away the stone Magatama...

238
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:51,933
Yeah...if that guy's Thief Kid the more so...

239
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:55,470
He could even be the guy who killed
the body that was found a while ago...

241
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,504
Huh?!

242
00:10:56,905 --> 00:11:00,475
But, it seems that
we'd be safer staying close to the guy

244
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:03,478
because he seems to know a lot
about the traps inside this mansion...

246
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:06,414
Also so that he doesn't get away
till the police get here...

248
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:11,952
I wonder if
Doc got hold of the police already?

250
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:16,074
Is.Is it still farther away?

251
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,693
That dilapidated mansion...?

252
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:22,230
Yes. well:-*Aha. ha. ha...

253
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:30,305
Huh? . -Aha. ha
Now. which way was it

255
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,540
C Come on...

256
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,345
Oh, carps!

257
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:38,646
There are a lot of them!

258
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:41,249
This place is like

259
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,451
a high class Japanese restaurant
with the river flowing throughout the house.

261
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,388
I wonder if
it's connected to the swamp outside...

263
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,391
Look,

264
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,126
there's even a bridge!

265
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,404
A pitfall?!

266
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,678
I'm not going to fall
for the same trick this time!

268
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:14,949
No. It looks like a pitfall but it's actually.

269
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,153
Whaaa!

270
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:22,991
Vvhaaa!

271
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,543
Wow!

272
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,545
It's just like an elevator!

273
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,614
Conan!

274
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:47,949
Huh?!

275
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,683
Let's get on, quick!

276
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:50,819
Oh, eah...

277
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,027
In other words, if we try to go up,
we end up going down...

279
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,029
and if we try to go down
we go up. right?!

281
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,231
Once you get the hang of it,
it's pretty simple

283
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:10,772
Here we are...

284
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,509
Aha. ha...It was simple. wasn't it

285
00:13:15,744 --> 00:13:17,178
Yikes!

286
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,246
Kyaah!

287
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:19,914
How silly...

288
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:23,585
If it were that easy, we wouldn't have to
go through the trouble of looking for it.

290
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,922
Right, treasure hunter with kids?!

291
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:34,162
These kids are not with me.

292
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:37,599
And, I don't think you should
be using knives around kids...

294
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,802
Take a good look at the tip of the knife...

295
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,271
P Poison spider?!

296
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:45,005
Kichiemon was not only a sourpuss

297
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,942
ut he seems to have been
mean quite mean too...

299
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:52,347
If you want to go to the very top,
it's this way...

301
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:56,150
Hey. could she be Thief Kid?

302
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:58,620
I thought Thief Kid was a boy

303
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,583
Oh~Which means that
the Magatama that you kids found

305
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:05,019
had something like flames carved on it?

306
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,290
Yeah...You hit the bull's eye. Ms

307
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:13,895
But, I can't make it out...
Forever and "Flames"...

309
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:17,031
Maybe If we stick those stones
somewhere inside the gravestone,

311
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:22,303
the gods stone
the diamond that is. will come out?

313
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:24,639
What makes you think so?

314
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,176
Because it was carved
Inside the stone garden lantern

316
00:20:29,177 --> 00:20:33,514
that the diamond would be in a busy place
where old people get together, right?!

318
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:37,385
Is this the busy p ace
where old people get together?

320
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:39,854
Yes. because, uh, what was it .

321
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:42,790
Resting place of the gods...

322
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:46,594
The resting place of the gods
Is nearest to the sun

324
00:20:46,595 --> 00:20:50,714
in an extremely busy place
where the elderly get together...

326
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:53,000
The gods stone is there...

327
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,068
This is it. right?

328
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:57,805
I guess you want to
interpret the part that goes.

330
00:20:57,806 --> 00:21:01,541
An extremely busy place
where the elderly get together

332
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:06,497
to this shabby pl e of dead bodies...

333
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:07,815
Yes...

334
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:12,253
But those here are the foolish ones who
have been blinded by greed and decayed.

336
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:16,190
Not being able to find the way out of here .

337
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:21,395
When Kichiemon built this mansion
none of them were here...

339
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:23,331
Oh... guess so...

340
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,534
Then you saw the lanterns too. grandma?

341
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:30,070
Yeah.
They weren't sunk in the swamp though...

343
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,874
At any rate,
I guess the treasures not here...

345
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:39,613
There seems to be no place, where you can
Insert stones on this gravestone either...

347
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,916
I guess we'll have to find

348
00:21:42,917 --> 00:21:44,852
the other sacred treasure
to solve the mystery. after all...

350
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:46,721
he other...?

351
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:49,123
They're called the three sacred treasures.

352
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:54,528
The mirror and the Magatama were found,
so there should be one more somewhere.

354
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,262
The three sacred treasures?

355
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:59,333
Yes. the mirror is the Mirror of Yata.

356
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:02,003
The Magatama is called the Magatama of
Yasakani. it's shaped like a comma,

358
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:04,472
and the remaining one is...

359
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:07,274
the Sword of the gods.
The Sword of Kusanagi...

361
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,143
that got its name because

362
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:11,145
it Is said to have saved
God Takeru Yamato.

364
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:14,548
Who was in a pinch,
by slashing down the grass

366
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,418
when fire was set to the field.

367
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,288
Whaaaat?!

368
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:23,624
The Sword of Kusanagi?!
