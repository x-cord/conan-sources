Well, when one wants liquor the. first thing
that comes to mind is beer!

14
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:02,215
Super cold beer drank in one gulp

15
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:08,588
there's nothing better than it

16
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,474
What's so good about it,
1s of course the bitterness.

18
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:15,027
No, rather, what I want to ask you
about is not beer...

20
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:19,298

00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:31,177
Well. when it comes to the charm of wine.

28
00:02:31,178 --> 00:02:33,112
It's not wine...but...

29
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,350
This is an important commemorative
event for our program and

31
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:38,918
what's with all the gibberish

32
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,787
Il...we asked him to come beca
he Is quite well known and loves to drink

34
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,290
I mean, it's so obvious when Kagoshima
comes into the picture and

36
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,325
it's about liquor...Sigh.

Oh... 71 No...

47
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:07,680
WW.Well.

48
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:09,615
Beer is good!

49
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,083
And wine is also good.

50
00:03:11,084 --> 00:03:15,154
But the fact is. I like distilled spirits best.

51
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:19,191
Actually, I didn't want any of you out there
to realize. more than you alrcady have.

53
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:22,328
How delicious distilled spirits are.

54
00:03:22,696 --> 00:03:25,464
That's why you went out of your way
to talk about other liquors?!

56
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:27,967
Oh. so that's what it was!

57
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:32,004
But, I, Kogoro Mouri can
deceive you no longer.

59
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:37,143
Among all the distilled spirits,
this IKagdshima made genuine distilled

61
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:39,779
spirit of Satsuma is the best!

62
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,381
Viva! Kagoshima!

00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:47,119
All right. Mr. Mouri! Good job.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,022
We were right to invite him over,
weren't we?

68
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:52,959
Sigh...he somehow made it through...

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,329
Aha, ha. he's an expert at that for sure.

70
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,901
Takakuma. you mean the rare spirit?!

71
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:04,770
Yes... Since tho manufacturing
of it Is completely limited.

74
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:07,773
it as very hard to gem hold of and
Is the gem of all liquors.

76
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:10,977
Y.You mean lFget to drink that?!

77
00:04:10,978 --> 00:04:12,578
We asked the brewery and they answered

78
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:14,714

Hello

118
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:21,881
I guess a sake brewery is no fun for you,
is it, sonn 7?

120
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,983
That's not true. right?

121
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:26,685
I like it very much.

122
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:29,555
That is Takayama.

124
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,893
I see, that's where you got the
name of your brewery from...

126
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:37,396
Please come this way to the office...

127
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:39,365
Do come along

128
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,117
Oh. . thank you

129
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:45,337
If you will excuse me.

130
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,844
How do you like the Takakumar

00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:55,347
Kuuuulgh. 1 ™ §eli€Bus .

132
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:58,016
There's.no other word for it.

133
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,718
It's onl sake

135
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,522
Now no. this is the gem of all sake
It s splendid.

137
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:08,694
But, it is our pride and joy to
make that 'mere sake

139
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:15,835
Preparation for making sake starts, with
steaming the washed grains of rice.

141
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,571
Rice malt is then mixeduin.

142
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:22,808
The-rice malt mixture that
Is completed is put into a vase,

144
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:25,945
then water and yeast is added,
and let stand, to ferment.

146
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:30,749
Add steamed Statsumn potatoes
into the mixture and ferment even more.

148
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,953
The temperature must be kept stable
and 'the contents must'be'stirred-constantly

150
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:37,756
withra stick torpreyvent the
propagation of unwantedbacteria...

152
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:40,475
Then, it is left to mature.

153
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:43,963
Which after, an appropriate
amount of water is added

155
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:46,866
and the process Is finally complete.

156
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,502
There are companies that
are mass producing using machines,

158
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:52,338
but as for us,
we have stuck to hand-making the sake.

162
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,743
Limited production,
may sound of the quite nice

164
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,478
but the thing is we can't make more than

165
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,715
we are now if we insist on
making something genuine...

167
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:07,219
Right. The genuine made by hand.
S no wonder its delicious .

170
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:10,389
Yes?

171
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,660
I'm Maizono from "Weekly Entertainment
that asked for an interview the other day.

173
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,028
Interview;... 7%

174
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,230
No. I know nothing about it

What's the ghjange over the moment
the name Tatsufiwra was mentioned... ?

180
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,013
I came here to film the preparationfprocess

181
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,281
The preparation process?!

182
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,983
Did Mr. Tatsumura give you
permission to do that?!

184
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,486
Just what the hell is on his mind!

185
00:07:40,787 --> 00:07:43,155
How can he make such
stupid"promise on his own...

187
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:46,926
I'm sorry to say that we cannot show
an one the preparation process.

189
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,361
Ou can't ob But.

190
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,664
The greatest enemy
for the sake making process is

192
00:07:51,665 --> 00:07:53,599
bacterial contamination from outside.

193
00:07:54,401 --> 00:07:56,669
So, no one other than
the one who makes the sake is

195
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,370
allowed inside during the process

196
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:03,576
Oh...l guess so. It's true that
people are carriers of various bacteria...

198
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,244
That's common sense!

199
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:10,549
"M sorry, I took on the interview
because I love distilled spirits

201
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:13,352
Hut how igner nt of me

202
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,923
We're notingny it you
We're pissed at Manager Tatsumura!

204
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:21,293
Hey. what's all the shouting about. Kosugi.

205
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:23,062
Mr. Tatsumura...

206
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:27,166
Well. wellntdsure looks like
I'm not very welcome here...?!

208
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,634
Are you Ms. Maezono?

209
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,135
Oh. es.

210
00:08:30,203 --> 00:08:32,771
I'm so sorry that I'm late...

211
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:38,344
My physical exam took kind of
Iong you see so...

213
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:41,764
I'm sure you're surprised
at how small our brewery is.

215
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:43,349
Oh. sort of

216
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:46,085
But. we're thinking of re-building it,

217
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:49,755
so that we can mechanizegeverything
in order to mass produce.

219
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,391
Huh...?! You mean, Takakuma?

220
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,927
Mass...produce!

221
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:58,697
Mr. Tatsumura, I've told you time and again
that we're ndt thinking of doing something

223
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:02,501
Iike that. Mass production will surely
bring down the quality of its taste.

225
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:05,004
AS Ou can see,
we've dot a stubborn president.

227
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:06,839
Distilled spirits-is the in" thing now.

228
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,358
If we don't mass produce now and
make big cash, what's in it for us.

230
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:14,613
Pips
Uh, I think it's not 1 very good idea
to mass produce.

233
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:16,615
Huh?

235
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:20,385
I'll think about whether
I really want:toginterview this situation...

237
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:21,720
Goodb. e.

238
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:26,492
Wait, I figured it would have advertising
benefits and I was counting on it too.

240
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:30,129
Why don't you try to love the liquor
of your brewery a little more?!

243
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:33,766
You're not even thinking about possibility
of the taste of Takakuma being spoiled.

245
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,433
I can't allow that!

246
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:40,623
Okay. shall we all go back to work too. then

247
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,792
Even if W's not brought in from the outsido,

248
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:45,678
unwanted bacteria is already inside
from some time 'in the past

250
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,349
Unwanted bacteria, talking about me...
I tell you. you're all the same.

252
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,753
, I'm against mechanizing
the making of hand-made sake too.

254
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:55,921
Hmm... Who are you?

255
00:09:55,922 --> 00:09:59,525
Oh. thank ou fore er thing toda. I

260
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:18,143
An image character to
advertise the product?

262
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:22,681
I was looking for someone
who would match the image of our product!

264
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:27,353
If you agree to accept to do it,
I'll send you as much sake as you want.

266
00:10:27,354 --> 00:10:29,855
Huh. you mean that Takakuma!

267
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,156
Dad. don't tell me that you're going to?!

268
00:10:31,157 --> 00:10:35,027
Well. uh, but, you see...

269
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,529
Aha when it comes to sake,
he's got super weak will power

271
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:42,134
That's right, I'll take you around tomorrow

272
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:45,704
It's my day off,
so I'll treat you to some place good to eat.

274
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:49,375
Please do accept my offer, okay. okay?

275
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:51,377
Nya. ha. ha

276
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,313
Mr. Mourl, let me do that for you...

277
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:55,681
Mrs. Shiraishi...

278
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:59,151
It's a token of my gratitude for you
Iiking our sake so much.

280
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:01,553
Please let me take you around.

281
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:05,524
Hmm well,
I guess a woman guide is more enjoyable

283
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:11,063
I guess I'll leave it up to Mrs. Shiraishi then
and relax as I was planning to anyway.

285
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:14,566
Mr. Mouri,
I'll be waiting for a good answer.

287
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,436
Ha. hahahaha...

288
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:28,247
Dad!
Why didn't you refuse; him flatly?!

290
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:33,452
Oh! It's Takamori Salgo. awesome!

291
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:36,255
Goodness.
You always avoid things you can't handle.

293
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:40,558
But for some reason I don't like that
man called Mr. Tatsumura.

295
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:43,295
The others don't seem to
Iike him much either.

297
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:44,430
Ha, ha

298
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:12,758
Wow, they even forecast the direction
of the wind in Kagoshima...

300
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,293
Oh eah.

301
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,093
I wonder for what. though?

304
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:16,995
I wonder for what, though?

Oh good morning.

308
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,001
Good morning.

310
00:12:24,437 --> 00:12:26,839
The ashes of Sakurajima ride the
wind and fly. so hanging the laundry out

313
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,242
whenlthe wind is blowing
wouldibe a disaster, right?

315
00:12:30,443 --> 00:12:33,879
Oh, so that's why the direction
of the wind is a problem.

317
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,048
I wander if lashes will ,
come flying today too

319

Uh, Mrs. Shiraishi?

325
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:51,063
How come the man called
Mr. Tatsumura doesn't getifired

00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:54,867

330

331
00:12:56,002 --> 00:12:58,770
Oh I'm sorry.

332
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:01,840
Fuh, fuh, I guess, even a child would
think there's something strange about it.

334
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:06,812
But, we can't fire him because
we owe alot to him from the past.

336
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:08,580

337
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:13,418
Our brewery has a history.

338
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:16,722
But, were a small brewery
without asname to begin with

340
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:19,892
so our product? didn't sell too well...

341
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:23,327
If things were left as 1s, we would've been
out of business long ago...

343
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:27,432
woe somohow made it to where
we are now thanks to Mr. Tatstimura

345
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:31,202
\. Who is in charge of sales going
all out selling our products.

349
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:38,010
Still, we are unable to face up to the
major manufacturer's production ability of

351
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:40,646
Iow profit-high sales way of business...

352
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,751
We were finally faced with
going out of business 10 years ago.

354
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,553
That was 5 years before I got married

355
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:53,892
Back then, my father-in law,
the predecessor and m husband.

357
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:56,995
Who was still an apprentice,
came to a decision...

359
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:59,815
If this was to be it.

360
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,767
They decided to do as
they really wished to do.

362
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:03,502
And that was to be really
particular about the ingredients

364
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:05,103
and the method the sake Is made.

365
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:07,272
They decided to close
the Takakuma Brewery only after

367
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:09,675
they made the best liquor
they could ever make.

369
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:11,827
And that's the Takakuma

370
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:13,378
Yes. And.

371
00:14:13,613 --> 00:14:15,581
It was recognized as genuine

372
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:18,550
Everybody's waiting for the real thing.

373
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:21,286
But, in winter of Inst year, because of
his long years of strain from worry

375
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:22,821
the predecessor passed away...

376
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:27,092
Don't you forget What
we decided on 10 ye rs ago=p

378
00:14:27,126 --> 00:14:28,660
Y.Yes, sir!

380
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,130
That'srabout when a change
ame about Mr. Tatsumura...

382
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,833
What. mass production ?!

383
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:38,337
Customers come asking for
the brand name Takakuma.

385
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:41,273
They wouldmt know the difference
% TRO Quetify Gu fr 80 Liou O TO.

387
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:43,642
Business! Business!

389
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:47,613
What a thing to say. Are you going to
allow him to talk like that, president!

391
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:51,049
He's going to spoil our liquor
We'd better drive him out of here.

394
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:56,989
I can't. We were rescued from
going out of business thanks to him.

396
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:00,792
We're'obliged to him and
I will never forget that

398
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,962
You sure are stubborn.

399
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:04,229
You sure are stubborn

400
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,531
My husband is not really
all that good at getting ahead

402
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,200
He never forgets what
someone has done for him...

404
00:15:08,201 --> 00:15:09,952
He sure is a man of Statsuma.

405
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:11,236
He's fantastic.

406
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:17,309
Mr Mourn, please refuse what
Mr Tatsuma asked you to do yesterday

408
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:21,546
If a famous person lik? you Mr Mount
cooperate with advertising) the product,

410
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,915
he can't lose.

411
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:26,685
I'm sure that he will forge his way through
to mechanizing the p ocess and

413
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:29,187
start mass production

414
00:15:29,355 --> 00:15:30,555
I see .

415
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,328
You decided to take over showing
me around to ask me not to listen to him.

417
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:37,796
Mm SoOrr

418
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:43,201
Well I was planning to refuse anyway!
Of course. from the very start .

420
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:45,203
Aha. ha.

421
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:55,380
Mr... Tatsumura lives In Kagoshima city...

422
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:58,316
Oh. I'miiglad. he seems to be home.

423
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,121
6:00...eh.

424
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:05,323
Does Mr. Tatsumura have a family?

425
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,793
No. he lives alone...

426
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:12,164
Agh it's open?!

427
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,200
I'll go check inside

428
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:18,003
Mr. Tatsumura. this is Fumiko.

429
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:21,606
Agh... doesn't something feel sandy?

430
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,875
Ugh...now that you mentioned it.

431
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,912
The ashes are falling...

432
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:27,846
Oh no

433
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:29,514
Oh ino

434
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:32,951
Agh, his car's not here

435
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:34,386
Kyaaah

436
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,188
Shiraishi!

437
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:39,224
What's the matter?!

438
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:42,227
Agh ..agh...

439
00:16:43,463 --> 00:16:44,479
This is 7!

440
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:51,103
Its blood!

441
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:53,839
O.Don't tell me it's...Mr. Tatsumurars?!

442
00:17:02,682 --> 00:17:05,517
I can imagine just about what happened.

443
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:06,818
When Mr. Tatsumura was relaxing
on hisuday off...

445
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:09,287
When Mr. Tatsumura was relaxing
on his da off...

447
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:23,034
Judging from the circumstances,
this is-a-case of kidnapping.

449
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:26,772
Hem And, when you all came here,.

451
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,741
the fact that the lights were on means that

452
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:32,810
he was taken away
some time after sundown.

454
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:33,345
He was taken away
some time after sundown.

456
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:35,547
I can give a more exact time...

457
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:39,818
When I confirmed the time,
the blood stain wasn't dry yet.

459
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,456
That means the time of the murder was
right before 6:00 when we found him. \

461
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:45,690
See,

462
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,093
Ohatakeyama,
pursue the car on the double.

464
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:49,027
Yes sir!

465
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,534
U.Uh. 'weren't yo Ma nurse
at the Chuo Hospital... before?

469
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:59,371
I wasiiuntli5%ears ago when I get martied

470
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,442
Oh. so you are the nurse I saw back then.

471
00:18:04,443 --> 00:18:05,827
Hurry up 'and .get going!

472
00:18:05,828 --> 00:18:06,711
Y.Yes sir]

473
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,078
Y.Yes sir!

474
00:18:11,117 --> 00:18:14,685
Am sorry I gBllyou messedrup
in something bothe some

476
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:19,457
You must be worried.

477
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,129
He may have {gen a bit of trouble, but
after all Mr. Tatsumura did help'/you out so

479
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,966
If the kidnapper is after money,
he'll surely call to demand ransom.

481
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,302
When he does. we'll nail him...

482
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:35,640
However, there was no contact from
the kidnapper the following day...

484
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:40,378
Hmm, I wonder why
the kidnapper's not making contact?

487
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:40,679
Hmm, I wonder why
the kidnappers not making contact?

491
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,548
And, another day went by...

492
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:46,885
The prefecture! police received
an anonymous call,

494
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:50,755
saying that Mr. Tatsumura, would be found
at Terayama Park in the city.

496
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:59,231
Mr. Tatsumura!

497
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:03,568
This is not asplacewhere people **
would normally set foot in.

499
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:06,371
The caller.was probably the killer .

500
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:07,806
The voice see ns to have been
a made-up voice,

502
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,441
in which you could not
make out the gender

504
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:12,911
Kidnap and murder what a guy

505
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,447
Dead for two days?!

506
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:18,817
0S, according to therresult of the autopsy.

507
00:19:18,818 --> 00:19:21,553
Ho wns killod two days ago,
that I Yon that day.

509
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:26,156
2 days having past,
it's hard .to"determine.an accurate estimate,

512
00:19:26,692 --> 00:19:29,261
but there seems to be No doubt that
the time of death is between

514
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,462
sundown to night that day.

515
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,431
The cause of his death was
from a blow to the back of his head...

517
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:36,067
and he seems to have died
instantly with one blow.

521
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,403
What?!

522
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,673
The figurine that was
on the floor of the living room.

524
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,060
The traces on the figurine and
his head matched perfectly

526
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:49,647
and the blood stains that
were found. wer "Mr. Tatsumura:s

528
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:52,150
SO Its No doubt-that.
It is: the murder weapon...

530
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,518
Wait a minute.

531
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,856
If Mrs Tatsumura died instantly
ithfone blow to his head.

533
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:00,425
It means that the killer didn't strike him and
p 18s him out. then take him away but...

535
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:00,759
killed him on the spot, took him away
and abandoned his car at the park.

541
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:07,132
Dead body and all...

542
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:11,435
Then, {woidays later today, the killer,
calls from his side to notify the police of

544
00:20:11,436 --> 00:20:13,104
Mr. Tatsumura's whereabouts.

545
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,639
That's the story.

546
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,942
There must be some reason
why the killer went out-of the way to carry

548
00:20:16,943 --> 00:20:20,011
Mr. Tatsumura: out of the house.

549
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:24,416
Moreover, the killer notified:the: police of
Mr. Tatsumura's 'whereabouts... .But. why?

551
00:20:25,284 --> 00:20:27,452
And, according the report
by the forensic officers...

553
00:20:27,453 --> 00:20:27,986
And, according the report
b the forensic officers...

555
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,855
all the doors and windows of
Mr. Tatsumura's house had no traces of

557
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:33,391
being forced opened.

558
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,362
Besides, the locks to his house were
all special types that

560
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,030
spare keys could not be made

561
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:42,666
Il 50,
how did the killer make it into the house

563
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,403
There Is only one way

564
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,607
That is, the killer and
Mr Tatsumura knew each other.

566
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:56,514
AS to this case, no cash had been;stolen,
SO It IS Not a case of robbery

568
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,184
The only thing thinkable is a grudge.

569
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,853
Somebody hated him
enough to want to kill him

571
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:04,456
And, moreover,
It was someone who was around him...

573
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:05,757
which means.

574
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:11,229
What?! The killer is among us?!

575
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:17,402
We can't find anybody who had a grudge
against Mr. Tatsumura other than

577
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:20,005
NSIREOD ISTO IAI SA TEWE TY

579
00:21:20,272 --> 00:21:23,208
Then, why do I have 10 be suspected too?!

580
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:26,243
We know that you held ill feelings against
Mr. Tatsumura from the information

582
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,846
we got asking around.

583
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,314
Oh...no.

584
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:34,419
Of course we had a grudge against him
We all did. but.

586
00:21:34,553 --> 00:21:37,555
He was killed at sundown.
The day before yesterday. right?

588
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:42,160
Then, all of us here were)
In ithe brewery w king!

590
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,699
I thought I already told you that
everyone was working and...

592
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:53,371
Hmm... It could be that you re all
matching your story up together too

594
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:56,608
And, Ms. Maezono,

595
00:21:56,609 --> 00:21:59,477
since you say that you were
in your hotel room alone,

597
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:01,379
your alibi hasn't been backed up yet.

598
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:05,767
We don't want to suspect any of you,
but what Officer Shmfuku as

600
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:08,987
saying abides to logical reasoning.

602
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:14,125
It's true that no one here
Gays 3 Cleatilko) =H

604
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:17,896
And. everyone hates Mr Tatsumura...

605
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,232
I'll bet Mrs Shiraishi is in agony,
being that everyone

607
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:23,835
close to her is being suspected.

608
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:34,245
But I'm sure the killer is
among the people here!
