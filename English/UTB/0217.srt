1
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,421
Be strong I say to my heart and
step into the essence with strong rhythm

3
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,257
Show time again
for the Metropolitan Police Department.

5
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,058
One mistake after the other
IS made in this eerie case.

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,760
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,662
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

10
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:32,131
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

12
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,724
Oh, hello...
It's me...

14
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,392
I'm sorry, just a while ago...

15
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,495
I guess the battery of
my cell phone ran out on me

17
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,763
Yep, that's right...

18
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,200
I got off the car and am calling
from a phone booth now.

20
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,671
I should be there in another 30 minutes...

21
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,210
Okay then, I'll see you later.

22
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:48,534
INSPECTOR MEGURE'S
SEALED SECRET" PART I

24
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,340
Look! Look!
What do-you:think.of this?

26
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,177
You're going to give it
as a gift to Mr. Kyogoku, aren't you?

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,879
Don't you think it's a bit too cute?

29
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,513
You think so 7?

30
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,116
I think...

31
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,553
he'd look better
in a simple sweater like this...

33
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,722
No, it has to be hand-knitted!

34
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,257
What do you mean
it has to be hand-knitted?

36
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,870
I just thought that a hand-knitted
sweater would be warmer, that's all...

38
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,839
Sonoko. don't tell me that you!

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,410
W Well, I kind of wrote in the last letter
to him that I would, you what

41
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:35,915
I'm knitting a sweater
for someone that I care for...

43
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,385
But, I didn't think that knitting a sweater
took so much patience...

45
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,856
So, you're planning to buy
a ready madehand knitted sweater

47
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,859
And give it to him, making him
think that you knitted it for him!

49
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,996
Well, I can't back off now, can I!

50
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,231
Well . all right.

51
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,966
I give you credit for your courage

52
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,801
of telling the person
that you like how you feel about him

54
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,403
so I won't say a word
about the sweater

56
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,273
I still haven't told Makoto
how I feel about him yet...

58
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,976
but didn't you write him a letter?

59
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,512
That you're knitting it
for the one you care for...

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,750
Maybe he'll take it to be
that you have another boyfriend...

63
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,053
That's just it...

64
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,688
That's the point...

65
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,926
If he thinks so, that'll make him
feel a bit flustered, won't it?

67
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,896
Just as he's feeling that way
he receives this parcel, see...

69
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,533
What's this, a parcel from
KY receives the parcel Sonoko?

71
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,201
He opens the parcel slowly, and finds...

72
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:35,107
It was actually a sweater
I was making for you.

74
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,411
This is my Love; love strategy.

75
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:45,350
Well, I hope it'works out the way
you want it to, and not theother way.

77
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,021
Makoto is so reticent,

78
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,191
unless I do something like this, I'll
never find out how he feels about me.

80
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,927
Thanks for wornryingrabout me, though...

81
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,131
Besides, I'll need a lot of nerve
and courage to ask him directly

83
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,399
how he feels about me...

84
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,636
B...But, Sonoko...

85
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,338
Ran, how about you?

86
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,108
Do you know how
Shinichi feels about you?

88
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,647
See, see, see see!

89
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,382
You want to know, don't you?

90
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,984
You want to ask him,
don't you? Well?!

92
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,451
L,I guess...

93
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,222
1. guess as a childhood friend...

94
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,692
if I said I didn't care at all, it
ould be a lie, but...

96
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:27,893
cc 0000

97
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,264
But... but, but

98
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:35,600
I want to ask him, and yet I don't.

99
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,938
S how I feel right now... F

100
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:43,209
I hope that's not what
you're thinking dream lover?!

102
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:46,078
1, am thinking...no such thing!

103
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:52,685
May I go over to Pops
who is waiting in the parking lot?

105
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,888
Then can you tell dad to go ahead
to the spaghetti shop

107
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,856
behind the department store
and wait for us there?

109
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,260
Hey, hey, how about this one here?

110
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:06,165
I feel like I listened to girlie talk
that I wasn t supposed to listen to...

112
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,302
what Is that... Talk about dorky!

113
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,837
You can say that again!

114
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:21,213
I wonder why girls
Iike to waste their time on...

116
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:22,715
You can say that again...

117
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,522
Wow, look at those legs of hers

118
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,660
Moreover, look at that super mini skirt,
despite the cold

120
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:38,864
A ball pen ls on the ground

121
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,067
Maybe that woman$
who just came out dropped it?

123
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,402
Oh, we've got to go:give it back to her!

124
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,272
Oh, excuse me, Miss .

125
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,507
Uh, you dropped this

126
00:06:59,152 --> 00:06:59,985
Get him!

127
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,162
Uh, hold it, hold it, hold it
give me a break

129
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,101
You were after a serial killer
who goes after women and kills

131
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,536
them by beating them with an object?...

132
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,371
Right,

133
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,074
Officer Sato acted as decoy,
dressed up like that,

135
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,108
so that we could nab him...

136
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:28,013
But... the height of the killer
was publicly announced as being about 52

138
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,885
One look should tell you
that I'm not the man...

140
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,990
Oh, well... the way you approached
Officer Sato was so... you know...

142
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,459
Not what you could
call all that normal so...

144
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,628
I felt a bit of danger, you see...

145
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,831
H How rude!

146
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,902
We've got a bit of problem here, though...

147
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,070
Yes.

148
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,971
The only thing the three women
victims have in common is

150
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,641
that they were dressed flashily
when they were attacked...

152
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,110
That's about all we know...

153
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,146
The place of attack is also scattered
here and there

155
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:06,785
Will you show me
the picture of the girls again?

157
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,586
Oh, yes sir...

158
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,125
The first victim was Â« oko Mizutani.

159
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,094
One night, two weeks ago,

160
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:19,798
she was hit from behind while she was
waiting for the light to turn green.

162
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:24,236
Therefore, she got off her car to complain,
but beaten with a metal bat...

164
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,474
The next one who was attacked
was Ms. Hitomi Endo.

166
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,376
Late at night, 10 days ago,

167
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,480
she was struck with a metal bat as she
came out of the ladies' room of the park...

169
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,317
And, she s Michiko Ishiguro,
who was beaten last night.

171
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,755
She seems to have been struck right
after she came out of the phone booth.

173
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,058
Don't tell me it was that phone booth...

174
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,628
Yeah, that phone booth
that we got a hold of you at.

176
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,832
Fortunately,
all three are in satisfactory condition

178
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,068
but the.only thing common
we can find in all of them

180
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,469
is that they were dressed quite flashily.

181
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,138
They allksay

182
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,707
they have no memory of anyone
having a grudge 'against them either...

184
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,145
Well Mr. Mouri any inspiration?

185
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,747
Well, if ll had to come up with something...

186
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,816
If you were to come up with something

188
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:15,387
Nd were raised in the jungle...

189
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,264
Well, it's hard to think
that these three are ordinary Japanese...

191
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,065
Wow, how cute!

192
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:31,303
All of them are super black!
The one in the middle is ultra black!

194
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,306
They're called mountain witch girls

195
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,476
Girls wearing this kind of make-up
are very popular now.

197
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,244
M.Mountain witch'...

198
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,347
Not?! Don't tell me you
don't know about them?!

200
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:47,186
Don't be ridiculous,mountain witch,right?
Of course I know about them!

202
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,022
Huh? Where's Ran?

203
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,224
Oh:she*said
she had to goÂ¥to the ladies' room,

205
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,326
so to go ahead and wait for her
at the spaghetti shop.

207
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:00,432
But, if the killer is indiscriminately
attacking*those type of girls

209
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,967
where do we start looking for him...

210
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,004
Right...we havenit-had
this kind of case before either so...

212
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,507
On the contrary... If .remember correctly...
they was a similar case in the past...

214
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,778
A series of high school girls
were hit-and run

216
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,547
Very abhorrent case...

217
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,951
That was way before
I became a police officer...

219
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,286
Let's go back and investigate!

220
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,589
Agh, yes sir!

221
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,691
I'll act as decoy once again...

222
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,926
No! No more decoy!

223
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,863
Let s go back and check
if there are no other things

225
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,731
in common. with the victims once again

226
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,132
Y,Yes sir!

227
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,936
See you Mr. Mourn sorry for the mistake

228
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,438
Oh, no problem...

229
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,942
Hello...Oh, Ran...

230
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,480
What, you don't know where the exit is?

231
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,716
And, where are you now?

232
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,784
What, the basement parking lot?

233
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,321
I don't believe it...
how bad can you getsatidirections...

235
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,594
Sonoko, isn't that ring,
necklace and bracelet

237
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,564
the same ones that the girls
in the pictures were wearing?

239
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,599
Where did you buy it?

240
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,670
I didn't bub, it was given to me
at the department store we just went to.

242
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,872
Something about a Millennium Sale

243
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,340
when I showed my receipt at the exit.

244
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,243
I got to choose any item I wanted for
every 10,000 yen worth of shopping...

246
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:20,979
Hey, how about it?

247
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,748
They're wearing them!

248
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,750
Although they're only wearing one each,
they're the same accessories

250
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,919
as those that Sonoko has!!

251
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,687
Which means that the three girls...

252
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,190
Were customers at the same
department store!!

254
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,992
Hey, Sonoko

255
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,329
What's the matter? Please answer me

257
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,897
Sonoko

258
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,274
Ran?!

259
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,978
Hey, Ran! What's wrong?!

260
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,848
RanOwhat"s up ./! Answer me!

261
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:58,650
What,

262
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,653
a blood splattered woman is lying on
the ground of the basement parking lot?!

264
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,033
The victim is Tae Aizawa, 20 years old...

265
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,903
She used to be a salesclerk
at this department store,

267
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,937
but quit a year ago,

268
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,939
She seems to have been
presently unemployed

270
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,209
He finally kills at the 4th attempt...

271
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,178
Then, this was also committed
by the same person...

273
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,115
Since the characteristic of the killer
has not been made public,

275
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,985
and this is the basement parking
of the department store in question...

277
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,354
so there's probably no doubt that
it's the same person.

279
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,823
Then this could be the doings of someone

280
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:40,993
who has a grudge against
the department store...

282
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,861
Tae! Tael!

283
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:44,863
Fg Fg Puy Fe

284
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,231
Who is he?

285
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,967
He is her boyfriend

286
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,370
and was supposed to
meet her in the department: store.

288
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:52,037
Something about his father
being the owner of the department store

290
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:55,140
Something about his father
being the owner of the department store
Noriyuki

293
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:55,606
Noriyuki

294
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,643
and that he was going to introduce
her to him today
Noriyuki

297
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,178
at the restaurant
he is working as a cook at.

299
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,781
Who Is that woman?

300
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,284
A waitress at the restaurant
he works I hear.

302
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,255
Her name is Yuri Konno.
She was his classmate in university,
3 (24 VY

305
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,457
and she used to give him
advice when he needed it.
(24) Y

308
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:13,992
Advice?

309
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,729
Mr. Shirakawa's father seems to
have been against him

311
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,098
going with Ms. Aizawa...

312
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,334
Ran,

313
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,837
didn't you see anyone suspicious
before you found the dead body?

315
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,739
There was no such person!

316
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,676
The only person I passed by
was a security guard...

318
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:31,443
A security guard?

319
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:35,313
Yes,at the entrance of this parking lot...

320
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,382
A man somewhere in his forties, I think...

321
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,718
Oh, that's me!

322
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:40,851
I just happened to leave
my post to go to the men s room.

324
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:43,355
I just happened to leave
my post to go to the men's room
Yoshio Sadakane (43)
Securitysguard

330
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:46,258
The killer probably entered
the parking lot during that time...
Yoshio Sadakane (43)
Securityzguard

335
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,760
I'll bet you're the one who did it?

336
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,997
D.Dad!

337
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,032
I hear you working as a security guard

338
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,369
for a rival department store
until 6 months ago.

340
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,104
Don't tell me they asked you to do this

341
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,106
Â«1Â» Don't tell me they asked you to do this
Haruyoshi Shirakawa (53)
Owner of Haido Supermarket

345
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:03,408
for them in order to
give us a bad reputation...
Haruyoshi Shirakawa (53)
Owner of Haido Supermarket

349
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,077
N,No way...

350
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:06,878
Well, Noriyuki,

351
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,981
I guess this is a good opportunity for you
to go and find yourself a new girlfriend!

353
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,052
Next time go find yourself a nice girl
who has no blemishes to her name!

355
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,620
D. Dad!

356
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,290
Noriyuki

357
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,694
Uh, what did he mean by a girl
with no blemishes to her name?

359
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,298
I think he's talking about
the traffic accident

361
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,000
she caused a year ago in the parking lot...

362
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,036
Traffic accident?

363
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:36,608
Yes...she ran over a little boy here,

364
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,111
and was fired...

365
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,415
Oh, I heard about:it from
Yumi in the transportation section.

367
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,818
A boy who was waiting for his mother
in this parking lot,

369
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,387
ran out from behind a car
and got run over...

371
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,191
Being a parking lot,
the car wasn't going fast,

373
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,461
but the boy got hit in the wrong place
and died...

375
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,064
I think the boy's name was

376
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,500
Akira Sakurai...

378
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,701
I OTC...

379
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:08,507
By the way, Noriyuki, do you happen to
know how tall your father is?

381
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,710
A little more than 52"(150 cm.) I think...

382
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,613
And, how about

383
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,115
173 cm...

384
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:17,983
I'm 144 cm.

385
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:18,683
I'm 144 cm.

386
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,919
I'm 167 cm...

387
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,456
Thattimakes the owner
a possible suspect...

389
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:30,629
He was capable of knowing that
she'd be coming here too...

391
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,564
Excuse me

392
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,599
did your father come to the restaurant

393
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,335
where you were supposed to
be meeting each other?

395
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,138
No, since he didn't show up
at the promised time,

397
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,808
I had her go check on him
to the parking lot

399
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,276
I see...

400
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,180
D.,Don't tell me that you're suspecting
my father of having killed her?

402
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,214
Oh no...

403
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,183
since a woman, who
was previously: attacked mentioned

405
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:55,487
the attacker being about 150 cm
we just asked to be sure

407
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,022
A woman who was previously attacked...

408
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,392
Then, is this the doing of that
serial attacker after all?!

410
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,693
WwW, We can't really say

411
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,728
What the hell are you guys doing anyway!

412
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:07,098
You even know the height of the attacker
and how come you can't arrest him!

414
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,467
If you had only nabbed the attacker

415
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,037
Tae wouldn't have had to die!

416
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,505
Noriyuki...

417
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:17,042
You, yourthespolice are
to blame for Tae's death!

419
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,045
You police are no good!!

420
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,247
Cut it out, Noriyuki!!

421
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,054
No good

422
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,822
No good...

423
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:33,124
You police are no good!!

424
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:39,464
Why are you so surprised?
I'm Saying) Ixll be the bait.

426
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:48,340
It doesn't work out like in the movies,
does it...

428
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:53,778
Inspector Megure!

429
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,679
In-Inspector!

430
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,547
Are you all right?

431
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,751
Nothing, it's... nothing...

432
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,191
I'm sorry, Inspector.

433
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,294
Noriyuki's just a bit upset so...

434
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,365
No problem.
He's absolutely right...

436
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:17,168
h... could we go over to that side
and cool off for a bit...

438
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,904
All right...

439
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,177
I guess I'll get back to work then...

440
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,779
Thank you very much...

441
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,916
You know,

442
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:36,721
didn't all the three women say
that the attacker was about 150cm tall?

444
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:41,693
No, the ones who said so, were the first
and third women that were attacked...

446
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,461
The second woman...

447
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,797
was suddenly struck from behind

448
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,099
and was passed out till
a passerby:found her

450
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,102
so she didn't get to see the attacker...

451
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,540
But, there is no mistake
that the attacker is about 150 cm tall.

453
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,443
When we had them come to
the station at a later date

455
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,780
they both said that
the attacker was just about their height...

457
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,950
How tall are th two girls?

458
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:11,489
The first one is 151 cm
and the third one 153...

460
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:14,793
We measured them
when they came to headquarters

462
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:15,660
so there's
no mistake about it.

464
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,361
Hey!

465
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,431
Don't go talking to children about things
you don't have to!

467
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,206
Hey, Ran!

468
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:31,509
You really saw no one suspicious?

469
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,644
No, I didn't...

470
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,314
I was walking around here for a while
Iooking for the exit but I saw no one...

472
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,049
Isn't,

473
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,517
there something funny, thoug

474
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,720
What's funny?

475
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,555
That woman

476
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,656
Oh, you think so too, Ran?

477
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,926
Don't you think? Right?

478
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,394
There's something strange...

479
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:50,595
I can't really say what it is but...

480
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,001
There's something...
awfully strange about this woman...

482
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,337
Awfully strange, eh...

483
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,140
Wasn't there something strange

484
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,043
about how the second woman
who was attacked was dressed, too?

486
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,979
This woman was attacked

487
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,349
when she came out of the restroom
In the park after midnight, right?

489
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,251
That's right.

490
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,389
That's the picture that we took
when we went to the scene of the crime...

492
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:18,323
See...

493
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,759
The restroom in the back?

494
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,729
If a passerby found her,

495
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,364
it means that she was alone, right?

496
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,634
But, she s wearing a man's coat!

497
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,837
Oh, that's my coat,

498
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,739
I put it over her,
because she looked so cold...

500
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,711
Then why was she at the park
at night dressed so lightly?

502
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,483
She said nothing about her jacket
being taken away or anything either...

504
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,018
Come to think of it,

505
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,354
she's been in a state of confusion
ever since the incident

507
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,990
and we haven't been able to really get
anything out of her yet...

509
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,358
You fool!

510
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,129
It's the in thing for young women
nowadays to dress lightly!

512
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,332
But, she was wearing
an outfit with no sleeves...

514
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,235
She was dressed too lightly
for the weather

516
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,338
Maybe she was in a warm place
to begin with

518
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,475
and planning to go right back?

519
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:13,078
A warm place?

520
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,079
Yes, for example...

521
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:16,614
Iike in a car or something...

522
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:18,950
A car!

523
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,518
Come to think of it,

524
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,923
the first and third victims were attacked
when they got out of their cars...

526
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,425
And this fourth incident

527
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,093
happened in a parking lot...

528
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:30,528
C-Cars are involved in all the cases!

529
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,564
Okay. Officer Takagi,

530
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,266
go check and
confirm this with the second victim!

532
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,334
Yes, sir!

533
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:47,312
That sort of clears up the suspicion
away fromthe owner, doesn't it...

535
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,981
No, we can't be so sure yet...

536
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:54,986
Thanks for all the good work
as usual, renowned detective!

Kiyonaga, Matsumoto (54)
the Metropolitan Police Department

544
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:58,923
S-Superintendent Matsumoto!

545
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,459
Thank you for coming all this way!

546
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:03,862
Hey, Megure...

547
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,130
the press is out there making a fuss

548
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,966
about this being the beginning
of a series of indiscriminate murders...

550
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,468
Call it a day for now

551
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,569
and come back again tomorrow!

552
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,738
Oh, but, well...

553
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,540
Let's do that, Inspector.

554
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,175
We've already gotten to the point

555
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:19,777
of knowing that all the victims
were probably riding a car...

557
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,212
If need be,

558
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,382
I'll paint myself black,
ride a car and try again...

560
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,717
I've already told you

561
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,285
that I will not be using decoys anymore!

562
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,762
Please let me stay and
investigate a bit further!

564
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,264
I know I'm close to ettin somewhere!

565
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,668
Besides, I have this feeling that
the killer is still somewhere nearby...

567
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,337
Oh, well...

568
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,674
Inspector Megure...

569
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:52,710
I hope you're not still...

570
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,579
dragging the you-know-what
case inside of you.

572
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,486
That case that you sealed up
inside that hat of yours...

574
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:16,201
I would never.

575
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:17,935
Okay...

576
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,637
Excuse me for the stupid question...

Here goes!

625
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,474
Huh, these shoes are too big for her...

626
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,111
That's right, that's the thing!

627
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,714
She wouldn't wear those shoes
with that fashion of hers .

629

If so, the killer...?!

630

Hey, isn't anyone around?

631

Yikes!
