That was a joke!

My is that?

79
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:04,783
Why is that?

81
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:09,054
Wrestling is getting popular among
young people right now.

83
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,856
The boys in our karate club

84
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,926

86
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,594
Hey now...

87
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,031
Especially that ene hit KO move!

88
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,035
Wait. what was the name?

89
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:29,074
No matter how cool they act,
it's just a ehilds play.

91
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,496
There you go!

92
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,566
You're totally into it...

93
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,671
Hey Ran, when is that
Masked Wolf coming out?

95
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,440
His pretty strong right?

96
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,843
Wolf face match is a Jr heavy
weigh title match so...

98
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,145
It's the last fight. the main event.

99
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,682
D.Does that mean his a champion?

100
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,451
Yes he is!

101
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,587
After making a contract of takingioff his
mask after losing even 1 game,

103
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,490
his been 65 singles game, undefeated!

104
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,895
But I kind of want to see him lose...

105
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,164
Why is that?

106
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,668
If he loses we get to see his face.

107
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,472
His hiding his face with
a mask for a reason.

109
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:37,876
His either extremely ugly or his bald!

110
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:40,012
Sorry for being a ugly man.

111
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:47,319
But I'm not bald.

112
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:51,890
Wait then, that means you are!

113
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,096
This is the true identity of Wolf Face...

115
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,933
A.Are you sure it's okay, though?

116
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,902
Coming out without your mask
to a place like this

118
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,270
No worry,

119
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,707
Wolf Face is said to be Mexican...

120
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,045
Besides, I sometimes fight
in the opening performance with this face

122
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,715
But, everybody thinks that
I'm just a young wrestler

124
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,252
Well, of course I don't use the techniques
of Wolf Face at that time,

126
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,454
so I'm just another young wrestler...

127
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:25,057
So. no one knows your true identity then...

128
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:25,924
No...

129
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,427
Nobody except for the personnel
of Teito Pro Wrestling know about me...

131
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,830
Neither do my parents nor my girlfriend...

132
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,999
I debuted as a mysterious

133
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,235
masked wrestler in Mexico
to begin with so...

135
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,973
You don't have the kind of face that
you'd have to hide, though...

137
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,042
I hike to wear masks!

138
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,145
It's been my dream since I was a child...

139
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,316
Doesn't it bother you at all?

140
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,753
To hide your identity
and deceive everybody...

144
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:02,627
I'm sure that your girlfriend
wants you to tell her the truth...

146
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,817
I really wish that
you were Shinichi, Conan...

148
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:12,237
Ran...

149
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,842
I just said a while ago. remember?

150
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,478
That my true identity is

151
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,314
a secret that only the personnel
of Teito Pro Wrestling know of...

153
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,618
If in case my true identity is
revealed to those outside,

155
00:06:27,452 --> 00:06:29,054
I won't have to suspect her
for having given away my identity

157
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,021
if she doesn't know, right?

158
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:30,555
But...

159
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:31,757
Besides.

160
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,859
I don't want to worry her

161
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:39,131
Wolf Face's match is
red on TV during Golden Time...

163
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,201
The match may turn out
to be violent and bloody too so...

165
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:45,470
Well,

166
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,472
I'm more or less prepared
for what is to come...

168
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,443
The time when I take my mask off is
when I lose and sink into the mat...

170
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:55,213
It's when Wolf Face dies
and leaves the ring...

172
00:06:58,718 --> 00:06:59,418
But then,

173
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,687
why reveal your identity to us. then...

174
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,822
Oh, well, that's...

175
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,824
The thing is.

176
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,493
My girlfriend is a great friend
of the Sleeping Kogoro...

178
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,595
I figured you wouldn't
give me your autograph

180
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,397
if I was just another young wrestler...

181
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,365
Why didn't you ask me

182
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,435
when you were wearing your mask,
ust a while ago, then...

185
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,406
Wolf FACE can't communicate in Japanese
unless he uses an interpreter!

187
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,509
Therefore, I wouldn't be able to ask you

188
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,578
to give me an autograph addressed
to a girl with a Japanese name!

190
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,213
Besides, I figured that

191
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,315
you're not the kind of people

192
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,985
who would give away my secret
and shatter the dreams of children...

194
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
WwW. Well, of course not...

195
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,323
Mr. Ogami. it's about time...

196
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,090
Okay!

197
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,861
Her name's inside,

198
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,963
so please give me your autograph!

199
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:45,931
0... Oh...

200
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,341
His identity will be revealed...

201
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,443
when he dies...eh...

203
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,046
Mr. Nagase

204
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,648
Mr.Nagase!! Turn this way please

205
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,852
\ aaah

206
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,253
Mr. Nagase!

207
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,489
You're finallydgeing to be fighting against

208
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,191
the invincible champion
Wolf Face for his belt,

210
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,860
can you tell us how you're feeling new?

211
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,728
Hui,
Hew I'm feeling...

213
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:21,333
All I want is for the.people here
to watch me...

215
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,035
To watch me fight with all my might...

216
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,772
against that idiot Japanese leopard
whose mask will be.

218
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,842
Torn off when I defeat him

219
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,811
Japanese leopard?

220
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,547
You mean Wolf Face is Japanese?

221
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,449
Oo...

222
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,084
It's a joke, just a joke!

223
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,053
We're in a rush, so interview us later

224
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,490
Hey. Nagase!

225
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,225
Just what do you think you're doing?!

226
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,096
Didn't I tell you that
Wolf'Face's identity is top secret?!

228
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,765
And that you're not supposed to
say a word about it to anyone!

230
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,166
Are you aware of the fact that

231
00:08:55,768 --> 00:09:00,105
Ogami shoulders half the popularity that
Teito Pro Wrestling 'enjoys!!!

233
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,108
Hen; what is it you're saying.
Mr Ushigome?

235
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,976
Are you telling me,
the star of the main event,

237
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:11,216
who has worked and polished
strength as well as gain popularity...

239
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,586
to go out of my way to lose deliberately...
on this gala occasion?

241
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,291
It's true that you're just a good looking

242
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,594
but with the strength that you possess now.
You couldn't possibly beat him...

244
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,396
Just what are you talking about?

245
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,298
What's important for a wrestler is looks

246
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:27,699
If not.

247
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,870
A wrestler with your ability would've
become popular long time ago. right?

249
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,438
What?!

250
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,975
Hey Nagase!!

251
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,877
That's no way to talk to your superior...

252
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,682
You don't want to hurt 2 precious body
just before a matéh, do you?

254
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:44,516
Ugh.

255
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:45,517
Okay then,

256
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,421
I'll be flexing my body
Iike always, in the room

258
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:52,190
so when it's ti; e to fight the match
please call me

260
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,391
Well

261
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,529
fl win, I'll give you all a mask as a gift...

262
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,898
So that you go can
all. hide your ugly faces

264
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,100
and gain more popularity...

265
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,976
Yeah...No problem...

266
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,945
Chances are 2006 my win...

267
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,981
Although, it's a hidden fact.

268
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,084
His left knees is not completely healed yet.

269
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,687
If I target: his weak point,
I can stop him in"his moves...

271
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,321
Phooey...

272
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,375
and if by any chance it were to look
as if I'm about to lose, that's fine too...

274
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,962
All I have to do is peel his mask off
on the mat, that'll be it...

276
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,880
Everything will work out just fine...

277
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,334
I made the young ones
at your place wear masks

279
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,370
and I practiced time and again with them...

280
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,873
on how to tear off the mask
during the match .

282
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,510
The match will be cancelled
once hisvdentity is revealed,

284
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,445
and I'll be fired,

285
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,248
but Teito Pro Wrestling's popularity will
go down too...

287
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:54,702
I'll end up the unfortunate wrestler who
is fired from Teito Pro Wrestling

289
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,189
for revealing the true identity of Wolf Face,

290
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,875
and go up on the ring at your place...

291
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,130
I'm counting on you
when that time comes...

293
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,582
Okay, Bankoku Pro Wrestling?

294
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:12,270
Dan!

295
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,306
He sure is the leader
of Teito Pro Wrestling

298
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,644
I gotta go to the restroom!

299
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,045
Aah...

300
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,548
You better come back quick
or the match will start!

302
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,082
Yep!

303
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,919
Uh~Where's the restroom. restroom.

306
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,976
M. Mr. Ogami?

308
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,567
He's so different from who we just saw...

309
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,235
Hey Wolf!

310
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,138
Good luck...

311
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,345
Shoots...

312
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,647
I better to the (restroom quick...

314
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,416
Hey kid! ,

316
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,952
nus pace iso Im s oO everyone
except authorized personnel!

318
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:05,023
Come on, I'MmMsyjust going to the restroom!

319
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,224
No. no,

320
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,460
The restroom for the general public
is on the 2nd floor.

322
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,427
Hey. Nagase!!

323
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:09,894
Huh?

324
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,931
Just what do you think you're doing!
The match is going to start!!

326
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,601
Hey. Nagase! Hey!

327
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,303
What's up. Sakuma...

329
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:20,338
M Mr Kiba

330
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,973
Is something wrong with Nagase?

331
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,041
Oh. well

332
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,211
Nagase won't come out
of the waiting roomr

334
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,147
Well, we had a slight argument a while ago

335
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,250
and nobody wanted to be his corner man,

336
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,154
so I decided to be his corner man
and came to call him but...

338
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,324
Then, why don't you
just drag him out of there

340
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,593
and make him get up on the ring!

341
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,260
B.But. he gets outraged saying that

342
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,765
his concentration is interrupted
if we go in without his permission...

344
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,432
Phooey...

345
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,735
who does that green-horn think he is...

346
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,670
Hey-Nagase!!

347
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,339
Come on get out.here!!

348
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,580
NNagase?!

349
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,716
Hey. get a hold of yourself!!

350
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:05,383
Nagase?!

351
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,918
No good...

352
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,153
there's no pulse...

354
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,187
sgWhat?!

355
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,625
Hurry and get an
ambulance and the police!!

357
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,126
Y Yes, sir!

358
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,495
Damn. who...

359
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,364
who the hell could've
done a thing like this...

361
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,265
Shhh!

362
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,567
Don't you hear a strange sound of the?

363
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:23,534
What?!

364
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,103
A strange sound of the

365
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,606
It's coming from that bag...

368
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,409
A hidden camera?

369
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:34,612
Nichiuri TV?!

370
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,094
I D";on't tell me that
\the killer isn the video...

372
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,440
T:This is...

373
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,978
Wolf Face?!

374
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,477
We're sorry to have
kept you waiting for so long...

376
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:25,280
The challenger for
the junior heavy weight title match,

378
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:30,835
Hyota Nagase is unable to fight
because of a sudden accident

380
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,189
Therefore, the title match with Wolf Face
that had been scheduled

382
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,058
has been cancelled...

383
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:39,260
What 7?!

384
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:40,261
Oh no

385
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:53,575
The murdered is
Mr. H ota Nacase a e 25...

388
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:56,010
A pro wrestler who belongs to the...

389
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,512
Teito Pro Wrestling Team...

390
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,013
- BS

391
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:01,616
he'd been getting stronger
dabda

393
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,284
and was steadily gaining popularity...

394
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,086
He seems to have been stabbed to death...

395
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:05,653
Yes...

396
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:10,224
he's been stabbed inia total of three places,
his back. his chest and his stomach,

398
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,228
and the blow-that took his life
was the final stab in his chest...

400
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,296
Huh

401
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,399
How do you know that
the final stab was in his chest?

403
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,901
Oh, well

404
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:23,538
that's what we saw on the video
before you got here, Inspector...

406
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:25,006
The video?

407
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,275
You mean a surveillance camerar

409
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:31,479
It is a hidden camera that Nichiuri TV,

410
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,014
who holds broadcasting rights

411
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,717
to our Teito Pro Wresting Team set
up In this room!

413
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,286
They wanted to film in secret Nagase

414
00:15:38,287 --> 00:15:40,555
just befo e the title match

415
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,658
Whenever he fought at the Tohto Kokugikan

416
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:48,262
he used to do warm-up exercises
alone in this room.

418
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:49,564
Oh...»

419
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:54,702
Will you show me that video too?

420
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,204
Oh...here it is!

421
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:56,871
Hmm.

423
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:01,943
If so. the case is just as well solved!

424
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:04,846
The killer is shown on this tape. right?

425
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:06,547
WW .Well. the thing is...

426
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:06,848
yo 'W
W. Well, the thing is...

429
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:09,150
Iiq 'Q
W Wolf man?!

431
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:11,919
Rather. a wolf's mask?

432
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,721
Wolf Face

433
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,357
the masked wrestler that is popular now

434
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,593
He's a junior heavy weight champion

435
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:23,865
and was scheduled to
fight Nagase tonight for the title...

437
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:28,569
Since Wolf Face publicly announced that
he would reveal his true identity if he lost,

439
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:31,239
it was a match in which
his mask was at stake...

441
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:35,043
Which means that the masked wrestler .
In order to protect his title and~identity *

443
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:38,379
without realizing that'thére
was a hidden camera here killed/Nagaee

445
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,816
before the match...

446
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,317
Oh.not really...

447
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,019
Not really!

448
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:49,223
Almost all the people
of the Teito Wrestling Team

450
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,959
- besides Nagase knew that

451
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,162
there was a hidden camera here.

452
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:58,733
And once this wolf's mask is worn,
Wolf Face could be anybody. right?

454
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:00,768
C.Conan?

455
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:04,539
Which means that
the killerflis Wolf Face himself

457
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,575
or a pro wrestler with the same kind of
physique as Wolf Face

459
00:17:07,576 --> 00:17:10,845
who wants to set him up as the killer, right?

460
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:14,281
A pro wrestler with the same physique?

461
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:17,852
Because the killer that is in the video is

462
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:20,588
about the same height as Mr. Nagase

463
00:17:20,955 --> 00:17:24,726
Wolf Face is about the same height
as Mr. Nagase, right?

465
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:25,526
Y.Yeah...

466
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,331
Besides, this room is closed to everyone
except authorized personnel!

468
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:36,270
Only another pro wrestler could
stab a pro wrestler in a place like this!

470
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:40,708
Oh, and I already gave the forensic officers
the murder weapon. which was a knife.

472
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,144
The gloves and outfit of the killer.

473
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,314
That was found in the restroom nearby,
so don't worry!

475
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,416
Ii] see...

476
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,184
Ehem!

477
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:53,988
So. Mr. Kiba, please bring that
masked wrestler and the pro wrestler

479
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:57,558
that has the same physique
as he does here!

481
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:58,860
Y.Yes sir...

482
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:05,700
But. Conan-why did you. come here?

483
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:08,069
I wanted to goto the restroom
and I heard the other wrestler making a fuss

485
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,171
over Mr. Nagase
not coming out of his room,.

487
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,640
so I came to check
out what was happening!

489
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:14,575
No. rather.

490
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:18,012
Who brought you
to this pro wresting grounds...

492
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:22,483
Renown Detective Kogoro Mourn,
Mr. Inspector!!

494
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:26,621
Not you again. you god of death...

495
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:30,925
Please let me see it too.

496
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:36,197
The video tape which shows
the murder being committed

498
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,804
Huh? Oh, it's you...

499
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:43,838
This is when...

500
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,474
the killer comes into the room. eh...

501
00:18:47,476 --> 00:18:51,279
Hey. hey. I haveynothing to talk
to you about before the match...

503
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,614
Or do you want tojask me
to lose on purpose?

505
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:56,951
Huh? The scene just shook...

506
00:18:57,152 --> 00:19:02,557
I think the killer's/fool touched the bag
in which the video was hidden...

508
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:07,161
I already told you that
I'm going to go for it seriously tonight...

510
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,364
Oops! He's already holding the knife

511
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:11,399
Wha!

512
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,868
He stabs Mr. Nagase in the back first...

513
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:18,039
Then as he turns around, Mr. Nagase
IS stabbed again in the stomach...

515
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,509
Hey.::Isn't the victim trying to
say something.

517
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,812
But, the killer covers his mouth
so nothing can be heard...

519
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,149
Oh! He's going for the mask!!

520
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,719
Come to think of it, the blood smeared
mask that I found in the restroom

522
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,889
was ripped about 10 centimeters
under the part of the right eye!

524
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,791
Then, maybe the killer's face can be seen...

526
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:41,596
Then, the final.blow in the chest...

527
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:45,800
Darn! Only if the killer would look this way...

528
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,669
But. why is he looking around like that?

529
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,972
Maybe he's looking for something?

530
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,206
Oh. his clothes goti:Caught:on-the chair...

531
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:56,410
Okay. get up. just the way you are!!

532
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:59,947
Then, we get to see a close up of his face
rom the ripped part of the mask...

534
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,819
Darn... It's the left profile of
his face of the part

536
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,754
that's not ripped that we first saw...

537
00:20:08,423 --> 00:20:11,125
And. he leaves the room...

538
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:13,995
But, if ablood smeared man
hike him walks around.

540
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:16,664
I'm sure that
somebody wouldjve noticed him...

542
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:17,932
Oh, . es.

544
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,635
The youngswrestler who
was in front of the restroom

546
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,905
seem to have, seen a man
with blood on his outfit...

548
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:28,075
It seems that the man went into the restroom
hiding his head with a bath towel,

550
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:29,977
that the young wrestler
took no special note of him

552
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,280
thinking that it was
just another veteran wrestler,

554
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,548
who was smeared in blood
after fighting in the opening performance...

556
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,350
"SEQ...

557
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,787
if he hid another outfit in the restroom
beforehand, he can change clothes

559
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:44,358
then come out looking
as if nothing had happened...

561
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,094
Whatstime isthe estimated time of deaths?

562
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:50,298
A definite time-has not been
concluded on yet but...

564
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:51,832
It was probably some time

565
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,368
during the match Mr. Kiba was fighting...

566
00:20:55,037 --> 00:20:57,137
Because three minutes
after the killer left the réom.

568
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:59,974
Mr. Kiba's roar of victory...

570
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:00,808
- Se.

571
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,610
You'll hear it«soon!

572
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:03,878
Dah!

573
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,047
T.True...

574
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,416
Which means that the time
the murder was committed is...

577
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,886
Around 7-20 pm...

578
00:21:11,987 --> 00:21:12,620
L& OD

580
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:16,339

So. please let me know
when you find the murderer...

584
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,902
It's a promise...Inspector...

585
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:30,805
O.Okay...

586
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,374
Oh. there he is!!

587
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:37,678
Mr. Kiba!! Is it true that
Mr. Nagase was killed?!

589
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:41,482
Are the four that just went in suspects?!

590
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,884
Please answer us. Mr. Kiba!

591
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,786
Mr. Kiba?!

592
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,655
Shoots. his lips are sealed, eh...

594
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:51,425
But, this means the end
of the Teito Pro Wrestling Team...

596
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:52,326
Yeah...

597
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:57,631

Y.Yeah...

601
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,175
Judging from the circumstances,

602
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:11,479
the killer should be among the four...

603
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,117
Who of the...four is it?

604
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,086
