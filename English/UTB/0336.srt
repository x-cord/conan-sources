1
00:00:01,412 --> 00:00:03,280
Friendship. Romance and Mystery!

2
00:00:03,348 --> 00:00:05,132
Because we cherish them we can contin'e

3
00:00:05,416 --> 00:00:07,284
A soundless murder in darkness

4
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:09,186
Conan's clear deductive in the messy room

5
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:09,820
He sees through the one and only truth,

7
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:10,854
He sees through the one and only truth,

8
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,689
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

10
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,225
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

13
00:01:55,126 --> 00:01:58,995
We all head over together
with mom to the Toto Processing Station

15
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:02,666
to watch the preview of the new movie
Kamen Yaiba the Movie II

18
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:06,737
However, it ends up that the preview

19
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,805
that was scheduled could only be
shown late at night. so wethad to wait

21
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:12,492
Mom goes back to the U.S.

22
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,113
while we all go over to Mr. Akira
Hojima's condo to take a nap

24
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:20,549
Guaaah!!

25
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:33,096
(152%)
Secret of the Toto
Processing Station Part 2

28
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:33,430
(152%)

29
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:38,101
The victim is
Mr. Tokuhiro Furumura, age 39...

31
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:40,837
He seems to have been employed
at the Toto Processing Station

33
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:42,205
Iocated opposite this condo

35
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,042
One stab through the chest with a knife...

36
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,378
He seems to have been stabbed
from over the blanket

38
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,881
in order to avoid blood
splattering onto the killer...

40
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:51,715
Oh...uh

41
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:52,349
Hmm'!

42
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,918
They all just happened to come
to take a short nap at my place

44
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:58,555
We were planning to
play all might mahjong

46
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:01,191
after the movie was completed tonight...

47
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:02,859
MM Movie 7?

48
00:03:02,894 --> 00:03:03,493
Yes...

49
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,897
The preview showing of that movie
was extended to around 23:00

51
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:08,832
o we all decided to
take a short nap together,

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,434
including those children... ,

57
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:13,603
I see...

58
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:14,604
And?

59
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,740
Where were you all sleeping?

60
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:18,208
That room!

62
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:19,876
and>slept on that bed.

63
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:21,945
All five of us lined up sideways

64
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:23,196
Then.

65
00:03:24,365 --> 00:03:25,582
We heard a man shout...

66
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,818
When we opened: the door
and turned on-the light,

68
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,653
this is what:we saw...

69
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:30,954
Oh...

70
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:32,689
I see...

72
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:34,658
But. it's strange

74
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:36,092
What's strange?

75
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,829
We didn't hear the murderer...

76
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,632
That's because...

77
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,667
you were sleeping...

78
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:46,570
But, it's after Mr. Furumura was killed!

79
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:47,771
It's only natural

80
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,607
hat we'd at least hear the sound of
somebody leaving the room...

82
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:53,443
The killer probably

83
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:56,246
tiptoed out

84
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,080
Well, isn't it true...

85
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:57,447
ell, isn't it true...

88
00:03:57,915 --> 00:03:59,249
That it would be pretty impossible

89
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,918
to escape from*his room in a short time...

90
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:03,720
being as messy as it is?

91
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,623
Which means that the killer...

92
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,593
IS the person sleeping next to the sofa
the victim was sleeping on...

94
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:11,094
Mr. Hojima...

95
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,496
Oh no...!

96
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,565
There were no signs of the door
being forced open either...

98
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,000
WwW. Wait!

99
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:18,435
People other than me

100
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,136
have the spare key to this room!

101
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,039
People who work at the same
processing station as I...

103
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,274
Iike Mr. Karata...

104
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:25,308
and Mr. Megami...

105
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:27,227
What?!

106
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:28,778
F.Furumura was...?!

107
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,680
By who?!

108
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:34,184
We'll soon find out after
you all tell us about yourselves

110
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:35,886
Will you please tell us

111
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,587
what you were doing and where you were

112
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:39,322
at the time of the
murder around 10.55 p m!

114
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:40,924
At that time,

115
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:42,659
since "was almost done with timing...

116
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,762
Ieft the rest of the work
with another worker

118
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,264
went to take a rest at the nap room...

119
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:49,199
T. Timing?!

120
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,935
It involves adjusting the color
for movies and dramas...

122
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,271
Can anyone verify that for you?

123
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:57,974
There were two to
three other people there,

125
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:00,010
but they were all asleep...

126
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:00,710
And...

128
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:04,915
1.1 was alone

129
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:07,717
in the dark room checking the film...

131
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,120
SO you both...

132
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:12,155
don't have an alibi?

133
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:13,456
N.No...

134
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:14,724
And?

135
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:16,693
Will you explain why you had a spare key?

136
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,629
So that I could play mahjong right away...

137
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,299
The ones who finished work first
woul '1 come here

139
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:25,035
and get the game. set up and all go

141
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:26,036
But,

143
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:29,406
maybe we weren't the only ones
who had the spare 'key/

145
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:32,641
He seemed to'have other people
he played mahjong with too...

149
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:36,263
the only people I gave my spare key 10
are those two

151
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:38,381
and Mr. Furumura

152
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,883
But...

153
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:41,084
If you,used to come here

154
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:43,753
and knew where everything was...

155
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:46,156
maybe...

156
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:48,792
It could be possibleito move around
easily even in the dark...

158
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,560
But...

159
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:51,261
Huh?

160
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:56,066
C.Conan?!

161
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:57,667
See! This room is really...

162
00:05:58,035 --> 00:05:59,603
pitch dark...

163
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:05,075
Hey! Don't interfere with the officers!

164
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:05,975
Yes. sir

165
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:09,546
But Conan's right

166
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:11,314
Right...

167
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,783
If it's that dark. no matter how
used to you are/to this place.

169
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:15,652
You're bound to bump into something

171
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:18,688
inspector, may I have a moment with you

172
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:19,322
Huh 2!

173
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:23,627
The 3rd button of the corpse's shirt
has been yanked off...

175
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:27,364
Hmm...It seems as if...the victim has
struggled with the killer, before he

177
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:29,966
was stabbedthe victim has struggled
with the killer, before he was stabbed

179
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,770
His shirt sure is dirty though...

180
00:06:34,138 --> 00:06:35,939
His collarÂ«is soiled black...

181
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:37,874
Mr. Furumura used to hate bathing and

182
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:40,110
used to take baths only once a week or so

183
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,646
Come to think of it,
when werplayed 3 days ago.

185
00:06:42,713 --> 00:06:45,448
He was weainingithis shirt too...

186
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,784
Which means he
hasn't changed since then...

188
00:06:47,952 --> 00:06:50,520
I could never do something like this!

189
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,922
I could never struggle with him.

190
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:55,959
Yank off his button or stab him WM
in a pitch dark place like this!

192
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:57,627
But. if you were the only one

193
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,696
ISP
awake at that time,
you could've confirmed

196
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:03,199
the position of the victim
with a flashlight or something

198
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,568
and approached him. couldn't you?

199
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:10,674
And besides. the children haven't heard
the killer running away...

201
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:15,311
Or...did you hear the killer
making any sound?!

203
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:16,179
Oh.no...

204
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:19,449
I was surprised at hearing Mr. Furumura's
voice that I noticed nothing else...

206
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,051
What's tha a.

207
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:24,054
Inspector!!
There's a video camera on the floor...

209
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:24,721
Huh

210
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:28,792
W.What's with this video camera...?

211
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,929
Oh, this is the video diary that
Funumura used-to take everyday...

213
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:36,099
Don't tell me the video was
kept running all this time...

215
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:39,769
Okay! Connect it to the TV. right away
and play it!!

217
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:43,273
There may be something it in
that would give us a clue to the murder!!

219
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:43,807
Y.Yes, sir!

220
00:07:47,378 --> 00:07:49,212
Good work...all day today!

221
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:52,182
I'm ..going to give my best shot...
playing all-night mahjong tonight

223
00:07:52,383 --> 00:07:55,218
Ill report the result later!

224
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:59,255
Hmm? It's been switched off once here...

225
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,125
Oh!?

226
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:04,160
It switched back on again

227
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:05,995
But, it's pitch black and
you can't see a thing...

229
00:08:06,197 --> 00:08:08,565
Guwhaaa "

230
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:09,532
In Inspector!

231
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,500
Agh. aaaagh...

232
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,437
Hey. Mr, Furumura, what's the matter?
Mr. Furumura?!

234
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:15,572
1. This is my voice...!

235
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:20,009
That's the sound I made *
when I opened the bedroom door

237
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:21,077
MM. Mr. Furumura?!

238
00:08:21,178 --> 00:08:22,312
Kyaaaah!

239
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,781
This is where this boy
turned onsthe light.

241
00:08:26,117 --> 00:08:29,853
But. why did the video camera
switchback on again?

243
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:33,790
The impact of the video camera
falling to the floor when he struggled with

245
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,892
the killer probably set it back on again.

246
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,362
The problem here though. is the sound

247
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,099
Until the.victim shouts. Conan opens

248
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:45,468
the door and Ayumi screams,
there is no sound

250
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:49,589
other than your voice, Mr. Hojima...

251
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:51,674
Which means that...

252
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:54,210
N.No way! If I was planning
to do something like this,

254
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,980
I wouldn't have brought
hese children here to take a nap!

256
00:08:57,348 --> 00:09:00,450
Besides, I have no reason
to want to kill Mr. Furumura...

258
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,551
Y. You do...

259
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,855
You had a grudge on him
for spoiling your precious movie...

261
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,359
h... The last episode of the series
Doting Parents' Diary

263
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,928
T.The same goes for you,
right. Mr. Megami?!

265
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:15,832
You weresreally"angry too,
werenlt you. Mr. Karate?!

267
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,001
WwW. Well. it's true. 1 but...

268
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,702
What do you mean?

269
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,439
W.:Well...
when he was checking the film,

271
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,275
Furumura overlooked a scratch.

272
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:29,445
Developed it the way it was
and cut the film...

274
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:32,248
Because of it we suffered a great loss...

275
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:34,884
We had to pay for all the retake
of the scenes

277
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,986
that were no good after being cut...

278
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:41,157
But film checking is done
in the dark room and is tough work

280
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:44,194
thatlis done virtually by the sense of
touch of the fingertips so...

282
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:47,130
It was work that was. too hard
on him to begin

284
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:50,200
because he used to play mahjong
till early morning almost everyday...

286
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:53,970
Checking the film I ithe dark room...
Mr Megami?!

288
00:09:54,004 --> 00:09:54,904
Don't you do that too?

289
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,241
Yes: :-He usedjpto be
a developer before too...

291
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:03,513
After that incident,
Furumura was switched over to sales...

294
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:07,784
I don't see why three.of you need
to hold a grudge against him, though?

296
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:10,385
Were your bonuses decreased too?

297
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:14,924
That Doting Parents' Diary series was

298
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:17,393
the pride and joys
of all of us working here...

300
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:22,098
It's only natural to hold a grudge against
him for damaging the final episode...

302
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,768
Mr. Furumura alone, didn't. seem
to proud about it. though...

304
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,937
It's not that we held that much
a grudge against him...

306
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:28,904
In a SA,
KRY =~ F
a grudge against him...

314
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:31,007
He was one of the members
we played mahjong with after all...

00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:31,574
Ja 7 O

320
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:34,711
- (O2--
Most of us have forgotten
about it already...

323
00:10:37,715 --> 00:10:39,215
A soundless murder...

324
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:43,987
From that front door to this door

326
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:47,023
Even if you were to be able to pass
easily with no obstructions...

328
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,226
The toughest part
would-be this living room...

330
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:54,297
It's virtually impossible

331
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:57,267
to go through here in a short time
without making a sound .

333
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:00,003
Then, the killer would have to be...

334
00:11:00,337 --> 00:11:03,439
Mr. Hojima, who was here
begin with...

336
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:03,907
Mr. Hojima. who was here
to begin with. .?

338
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:10,680
C.Come to think of it!!

339
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:13,483
That video camera was also...

340
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:17,854
I see...That's why he was...

341
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:19,989
flustered and did what he did...

342
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:26,296
If so. the unexplained thing about
no noise on the video tape...

344
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:29,299
And the button
that was yanked off all fit in!!

346
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:32,251
QCÂ» 4
The killer 1s probably hum...

348
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:37,473
\ The only one who could've committed
the murder in this pitch darkness is him!

351
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:39,442
But. I don't have proof...

352
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:44,279
What now?What do I do?

353
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:47,483
What's the matter. As?

354
00:11:48,652 --> 00:11:49,786
You look dreadful

355
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,989
it's nothing...really

356
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:55,725
She says it's nothing .

357
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:57,894
Really?

358
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:17,113
D.Don't'tell me that?!

360
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:29,542
So. what we clearly know now is...

361
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,596
Mr. Furumura who was sleeping
on the sofa around 23-00

363
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,549
was stabbed to death
by someone in the dark...

365
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,569
If the Killer stabbed Mr.-Furumura and fled

366
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:42,605
he would've most naturally, bumped
Into something and made noise...

368
00:12:42,973 --> 00:12:45,041
But the children who were
sleeping in the next room

370
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,476
heard no noise at all...

371
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:47,643
Moreover. the video camera

372
00:12:47,778 --> 00:12:50,546
which seemed to have fallen
to the floor and switched on

374
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,716
when the killer and Mr. Furumura was
thought to have struggled with each other

376
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,452
had no such sound recorded in it...

377
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:57,587
In other words,

378
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:58,721
the killer is the one

379
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:01,491
who was sleeping next to the sofa
where Mr Furumura was sleeping

381
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:02,358
Mr Hojima!

382
00:13:03,794 --> 00:13:06,829
You're the only one~lscan-come up>with!

383
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:08,898
Agh. wait!

384
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:10,099
Absolutely!

385
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,135
D.Dr. Agasa?!

386
00:13:12,569 --> 00:13:14,037
DD. Doc 21

387
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:18,608
Conan called me to ask me
to come pick him up

389
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,046
I heard about the case on the phone...

391
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:26,783
No matter how much I think it over,
I come up with just one answer!

393
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:31,521
That there is probably no-doubt
that Mr. Hojima committed the crime!

395
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:35,725
An ordinary person
wouldn't be able to move

397
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:38,628
around in the dark
without making a sound....!

399
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:42,432
Maybe it'd be a different story if you were
a ninja or a ghost, though!

401
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,534
Gha. ha. ha. ha...

402
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:47,336
Dr. Agasa! You think so too...

403
00:13:47,738 --> 00:13:51,174
But, there is just one thing
that bothers me...

405
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:51,808
Huh'?

406
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:55,510
Remember. the third button of
Mr. Furumura's shirt that was yanked off

408
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:58,047
when he struggled with the killer?

409
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,383
It hasn't been found yet, has it?

410
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:02,518
N.Now that you mentioned it. no...

411
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:06,355
Without it. it just doesn't feel good" .

412
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:09,592
It couldn't be that the button
had wings and flew off

414
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:13,930
It's probably;somewhere
in this messy room...

416
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:16,866
or. the killer still has it on him...

417
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,869
I'd recommend you to do a thorough
body check of Mr. Hojima

419
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,940
when you take him for questioning
to the station...

423
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:25,641
Y.Yes. I will...

425
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:28,211
Mr. Hojima!
Please come to the station with me...

427
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:32,315
A-All right. . -
But...l.I'm not the killer!!

429
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:36,185
Then, Mr. Konjo and Mr. Karata,
Iet's go too.

431
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:37,203
Yes. sir...

432
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:40,156
Did I do okay?

433
00:14:40,357 --> 00:14:42,191
Yeah... just great...

434
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:46,362
So, we'll go to the police station
for questioning too!

436
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:48,865
You all slept once,
SO you can all stay up. right?

438
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,399
Ay III

439
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,135
Hey [Ai..let's go!

440
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:54,170
Y.Yes...

441
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:56,939
But...l really wanted to see
Yaiba's movie...

443
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:58,708
Oh, wait...

444
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:01,711
Let's all go see it together
when it's released...

446
00:15:50,027 --> 00:15:51,294
W Why /!

447
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,276
Just as I-thought...
It was you after all...Mr. Megami...

449
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,714
W Why

450
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,250
Sound...It was the sound...

451
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:15,618
ound...?

452
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:19,555
B:. But the children said
they heard no sound...

454
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,624
the same with the video tape...

455
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:25,628
Right. it's true that
there were no suspicious sounds,

457
00:16:26,496 --> 00:16:27,830
But. it was too soundless...

458
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:31,968
If the video camera dropped to the floor
NY and switched on the sound back

460
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,804
then of the video dropping or the sound
of the struggle should've been recorded...

462
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:37,773
But. since it had no sound.

463
00:16:37,975 --> 00:16:39,442
Chances are,
the killer deliberately pressed

465
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,680
the record button and put it on the floor...

466
00:16:45,515 --> 00:16:48,084
It could be that the killer was
confident of fleeing from

468
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:51,854
a dark room without making a sound...

469
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:56,592
And, your job as a developer also
made me suspect you...

471
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,093
Huh

472
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:00,329
You seemed to have mentioned that
working as a developer requires one

474
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:05,166
to check the scratches on the films only
with the sense of touch of the fingertips...

476
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:08,304
No matter how used to you are to
the dark room,

478
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:11,107
it is impossible to work in
a room with no light at all...

480
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:15,344
That's why I thought you would've had to
place some kind of mark

482
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:18,581
in the room to help you locate
things even in the dark...

484
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,218
And walla! I found it
as Soon as I entered this room...

486
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:25,488
Among all the things cluttered in 7
this room. on every corner

488
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:28,958
I found these black tapes!

489
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,743
This probably...

490
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:34,680
IS black vinyl tape pasted on over
fluorescent tape...

492
00:17:35,499 --> 00:17:37,133
See. "there are tapes

494
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,871
tape under them are slightly showing...

495
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:44,473
Unless...light is kept
at a low level in this way.

497
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:47,977
The film in the darkroom would
probably over expose...

499
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:49,679
So. although

500
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,313
So. although

501
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:53,816
an ordinary person can't see right away
when the lights are turned out...

503
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:56,852
when their eyes get used to the dark,
they gradually start being able to see

505
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:00,256
Using this light as a guide
and walkin carefull

508
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:03,459
aware of where everything is located...

509
00:18:04,728 --> 00:18:08,097
U's possible to go through
without bumping into anything...

511
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,966
I happened to change
the position of some things.

513
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,435
SO you seemed;to have
panicked a'bit this time...

515
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,806
That's why when Conan turned off the
Iight you turned it right back on right?

517
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:18,641
You did so because you didn't want others

519
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:19,742
and realize what you had done...

520
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:23,879
Now that you mentioned it, there is
black tape on this video camera too...

522
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:27,450
Even if he could tell
here the camera was...

524
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:31,954
would he be able to tell where the chest
of a person who is asleep is?

526
00:18:32,556 --> 00:18:33,689
If the body were to move even a bit.

527
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:35,156
It would be impossible
to commit the crime...

529
00:18:35,258 --> 00:18:36,291
The button

530
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:41,997
He probably put a bit of fluorescent
paint on Mr. Furumura's 3rd button

532
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,935
to make out where the chest
was even in the dark

534
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:49,905
In other words, if you can get into the
room with the spare key,

536
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,344
you can stab him in the
chest even in the dark...

538
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,347
You must've painted the button
3 days ago

540
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:02,885
when you played mahjong all night and
he was fast asleep...

542
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:06,322
Knowing that he only takes b
aths once a week,

544
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:08,824
itss very likely he wouldn't change shirts...

545
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,662
Then, you decided to bring back the button
after peeling off the fluorescent paint from

547
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,932
it because if someone finds
it the trick would be revealed...

549
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:21,837
On top of that since you heard me say
it's strange that the button

551
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:26,976
hasn't been found.you returned the button
after peeling off the fluorescent paint...

553
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,512
After Dr Agasa explained
everything to me,

555
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,680
I finished questioning you first of all,

556
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,084
and was waiting herein this room...
but I didn't expect this outcome...

558
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:39,755
It's amazing how Mr. Furumura
who worked tapes...

560
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,260
as a developer like you,
didn't notice the fluorescent tapes...

562
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:50,966
Notice what?

563
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,702
These tapes were pasted on b
y Furumura himself...

565
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:56,672
He told me that he pasted the tape
onto the video camera

567
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:58,574
so that he could get a hold of
it any time in the dark...

569
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:00,608
He said that he also pasted tape around
the room so that he could find

571
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:01,877
the restroom if-he needed
to go late at night.

573
00:20:02,446 --> 00:20:05,581
He did it as a-prank and
didn't let Hojima in on it

575
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:09,034
I always knew that
he was unreliable, though...

577
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:11,554
But; I just couldn't forgive him
for what he did back then...!

579
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,089
When he damaged
the film of the final episode

581
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:17,041
of the series "Doting Parents' Diary
I just couldn't overlook his mistake!!

583
00:20:17,594 --> 00:20:20,896
But. you did a:retake and the movie
was successfully completed, wasn't it?

585
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:24,300
No good .r~it wasn't perfect...

586
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,169
Because in the original film,

587
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:31,339
the younger brother of the star
of the show was also acting in it...

589
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:35,211
But. just before the retake
he died in a traffic accident...

591
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:37,646
So we had no
choice but to do without him...

593
00:20:38,348 --> 00:20:44,019
That's why that movie is not perfect
or ever will be complete...!

595
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:47,473
Just because of him...!
E's to blame ..Uuugh...

Thanks for everything!!

644
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:23,185
H.Hey...hold it...

645
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,454
Come back here then. will you!

646
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:28,741
Although it's a bit far, run over here
because it's good for your health!

C.Conan...

649
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:36,531
Shh...

650
00:22:38,702 --> 00:22:39,718
Don't worry...

651
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,255
that cigarette is like...a car tooting its horn
waiting for the traffic light to change...

653
00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:47,092
If you don't want them to

654
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,644
be aware of our existence,
Iet's not toot our horns from our side

656
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,097
The same with the condo
they were watching...

658
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:55,517
From what we saw from that window,
he was not smoking a cigarette

660
00:22:56,586 --> 00:22:57,553
If we saw the lit cigarette he was smoking.

661
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:01,323
It would be: like.we were telling/him
from our siderthat we:are: here...

663
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:05,127
It's the basics of a stake out!

664
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:08,697
But, he just happened to be smoking
a cigarette in our view

666
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:11,467
it's only proof that he lost track of us...

667
00:23:12,002 --> 00:23:13,736
Since he's still waiting around here,

668
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,405
it means that he most probably doesn't
have an idea of where we live, right?

670
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:20,309
I had Officer Takagi deliberately go

671
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:22,810
through a drunk driving checkpoint,
and bring us all the way here...

673
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:25,114
It's no wonder they lost track of us...

674
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:27,650
Dflbnttlfitell me... that they...

675
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:29,118
Beats me...

676
00:23:29,352 --> 00:23:32,021
The only thing I'm sure of is
that he's not one of my mom's fans...

678
00:23:33,173 --> 00:23:37,393
It seems that
his target is either you or me...

680
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:40,596
So, we've lost track of them...

681
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:43,932
It's all right...
The string hasn't been severed yet...

683
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:45,200
keep it up...

684
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:48,370
But...

685
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:54,677
She sure resembles...

687
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:13,862
W.What are those scratches...

688
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,801
I got it.

689
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,805
I've figured out the real meaning
behind this accident
