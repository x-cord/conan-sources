1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:03,802
An awkward situation; two people
unravel a mystery

3
00:00:03,803 --> 00:00:05,754
a situation that closes in on
Conan and Haibara

5
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,473
A life threatening danger is close

6
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,308
A breathtaking.2 and: ahalf hours.begins!

7
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,275
He sees through-the one and only truth

8
00:00:11,276 --> 00:00:12,211
a child in appearance

9
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,211
with the 1. Q. ofran-adult

10
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,214
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

12
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:43,769
CPENEATI OF 1480 OCT
1000 ST 4 A

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,937
THE CONS ONTATION WITH THE BLACK CONNECTION
(CE CE OF TF 0 SPEED OF £1) 47 A UL 00

16
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:01,870
All right!
All seven of us have-finally gathered!!

18
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,439
Phooe...
What dense guys...

20
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:06,175
Uh, Pops?

21
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:06,608
Huh

22
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:11,847
Wolf Man. Franken and Mummy
are nowhere in sight

24
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:13,582
What?!

25
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,184
I wonder if they went to the restroom...

26
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:16,518
I guess so?

27
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,321
If that is a case. Do you look for?

28
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,825
The party is about to begin too...

29
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:25,093
Y.Yeah...

30
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,997
Oh. it's over here...

31
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,034
Oh, there he is!

32
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:36,537
Oh, there he is!
We looked all over for you!!

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,876
What a toilet this is, though.

35
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:45,080
It's dimly lit and full of spider webs,
even the mirror is cracked.

37
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:47,216
Not only that, men and women
have to use the restroom together!

39
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,319
After all, we're all monsters.

40
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:54,055
So I guess there's no need to
differentiate between men and women.

42
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,890
It won't come off...

43
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,927
The blood on my hands...
on't come off...

45
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,197
It won't come off
even if I wash my hands...

47
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:06,702
Hey. hey, acting your part
even in the restroom, eh...

49
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:12,406
Are Wolf Man and Mummy here?

50
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,079
They don't seem to be here...

51
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:17,912
Yeah...

53
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,823
What?!

55
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:33,595
What was that...

56
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,379
Hey. boss! What's up?

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,116
Oh, bartender. can you give me
the same thing he's drinking.

59
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,485
Silver Bullet?

60
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,421
White Lady for me. then please...

61
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:00,889
Yes. ma'am.

62
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,759
Hey. you don't look too hot...

63
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,428
Are you bummed out or\something?

64
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,497
Uh? H.Hey...

65
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:10,732
Aooooohn

66
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:12,234
Aooooohn

67
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,736
What is it?

68
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,504
Are you looking for somebody?

69
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,341
Aoooohn

70
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,979
I wonder where Mummy disappeared to?

71
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:26,213
How should I know!

72
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:29,518
Talk about not being
able to work in groups...

74
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:32,187
An hour has already gone by...

75
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:33,555
Huh

76
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,189
What?

77
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,260
Since the party started...

78
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,766
Listen, you monsters...

79
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,802
I've got good news for you...

80
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:51,088
The bait's been set...

81
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:55,894
It seems that there is a human
among us at this party

83
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:59,931
that is neither ugly
nor possesses evil power...

85
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:00,949
Go now,

86
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,552
and join hands with the 7 comrades
that you will share your fate with.

88
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:08,323
Find the good-for-nothing,
tear its meat apart.

90
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:15,129
Pull out its guts and drink up to the last
drop the blood that comes flowing out!!

92
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,232
VvwWhao

93
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,200
Okay

94
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:21,436
If it's looking for the culprit,
there's none other than I Kogoro Mouri,

96
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:22,871
more suited for the job!!

97
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,741
But. not all seven of us are here yet...

98
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,342
Who cares!

99
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,644
If I figure out who the culprit is.

100
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:32,147
I'm sure they'll come
walking out from their side!

102
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:36,885
I have the keyword which is
the hint to who it is...

104
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:41,590
If you want to get hold of the treasure
that is to be your reward,

106
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,258
come out to deck
and receive my revelation...

108
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,993
Gugh. Galigha

109
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,568
W. What was that...?

110
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:04,813
What's the matter?

111
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:09,051
I'm sorry, the load that was
on the construction truck fell off...

113
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:13,754
We-ll clear it up right away.
So pleas Ygive us a moment.

115
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,025
I'm in a bit of asrush,
so I'm going» to go around.

117
00:06:17,026 --> 00:06:18,527
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:28,070
I'm sorry...

119
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:38,046
Thank you for waiting,
you may go through now.

121
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,948
Thank you. Goodbye...

122
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,087
Take care!

123
00:06:51,794 --> 00:06:53,261
He just went through

124
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,698
W. What's that...

125
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,766
T.That's?!

126
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,473
Captain of the ghost ship?!

127
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:08,844
H~~~What a grand performance...

128
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,352
This is real blood...

129
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,453
What

130
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:19,187
Hurn

131
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:19,521
Hurry!

132
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:22,023
Hurry. somebody get him down!!

133
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,094
Agh!

134
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,889
111]

137
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,768
Oh. I'm sorry to have surprised you...

138
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:12,307
I'm an English teacher of Teitan High
School, where Dr. Niide is .in charge of...

140
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:16,878
His car broke down on his way here

141
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,515
That's why I've come
to pick you up instead!

143
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:26,488
If it's okay with you,
will you please unchain the door?

145
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,165
I'm really late...

146
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:47,209
Jodie...

147
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:13,001
His chest is pierced through
with an arrow of a bow gun...

149
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:14,101
Moreover,

150
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,472
the card of the devil is here too...

151
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,876
So. the:devil's the guide
to the world'beyond?

153
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:22,677
Hmm...

154
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:27,649
I don't think he needed any guide
to take him to the world beyond though,

156
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:29,784
because he seemed,/
to have died on the spot...

158
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,119
True...

159
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,955
And as for the bow gun
that fired the arrow,

161
00:09:33,956 --> 00:09:37,192
it's probably been disposed of
somewhere in this vast Pacific Ocean...

163
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,110
so virtually will not be found...

164
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:44,032
So. I wonder if there's @ camera on this ship?

165
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,968
I'd like to take a picture of the scene...

166
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:50,538
We have a digitalOcaméra that we are
using to take pictures of this party.

168
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,573
Well

169
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:55,076
it's something that will serve as evidence
so I'd prefer something on film, but...

171
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:56,478
Pops

173
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:59,447
I've got a disposable camera on me.

174
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:00,148
See...

175
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:03,485
Well I guess it's better than nothing...

176
00:10:11,427 --> 00:10:15,397
I'listake'a look at his face then

177
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:17,565
Huh?

178
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:20,268
I think I've seen him somewhere before...

179
00:10:20,736 --> 00:10:24,906
Oh! Isn't he a movie producer
that appears a lot on TV?

181
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,310
I think his name was Senzo Fukuura...

182
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:29,077
Huh?

183
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:34,416
I think he became famous after
producing the series "Unlucky Days",

185
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:36,751
before the Phantom Ship Captain series...

186
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:40,021
Are you saying that the producer
appeared in the movie

188
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,657
in person and acted the role
of the captain of Phantom Ship?

190
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:46,294
Oh, no. the movie was filmed
using a real actor...

192
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,682
Mr. Fukuura loved
the captain of the Phantom Ship.

194
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:55,103
SO he used to play the role of his own
Initiative every year at the party on board...

196
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:58,740
Mr. Flkuura-is the one who planned
the performance of appearing on the mast

198
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,643
with the light shining on him
and giving out hints to the quiz.

200
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:02,844
Yeah...

201
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:07,682
You mean that quiz about humans being
mixed up here among the monsters...

203
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,419
There's a microphone attached to
the inside of the mask...

205
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:18,026
It seems he was talking I
directly into this microptOne.

207
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:23,365
And? What's the answer to this qui .

208
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:28,670
WwW. Well, The quizzes and hints
were decide on by Mr. Fukuura alone,

210
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:30,904
SO we, the staff know
nothing about them...

212
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,908
We heard that the first group \
to solve the quiz

214
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,313
wouldqreceive an invitation 3
to the preview of the movie, though...

216
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,448
Well.

217
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:45,387
It seems quite definite that one of you
among the staff is the killer...

219
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:46,521
What?!

220
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,707
First of all,

221
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,493
Mr. Fukuura who was disguised
as the captain of the ghost ship

223
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,028
started suffering
while he was announcing the quiz...

225
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:58,466
He was probably struck by
the bow gun then...

227
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,685
However. back then,

228
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:04,973
we, the passengers,
were still inside the ship at the party hall...

230
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,076
It would've been impossible for us

231
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,645
to fire the bow gun at Mr. Fukuura
who was on the top of the mast...

233
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:14,849
The only people who had the chance
to kill him! would be the ones who were out

235
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,385
on deck to begin with,
and the ones who prepared the lighting

237
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:20,121
and the sound devices when he was
announcing the quiz. that is. the staff...

239
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,025
Secondly, this card of the devil...

240
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,529
Thexkilleriprobably wanted
to. mislead people into thinking

242
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,366
that one of the passengers who boarded
this ship that received this card is the killer

244
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,735
Since you're the ones
who prepared the cards,

246
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:36,504
you probably could make as many of
these cards as you wanted to...

248
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:42,210
these cards were made by
Mr. Fukuura to avoid foul play.

250
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:45,680
So. it would have been impossible for
any of the staff to prepare thesecards...-

252
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,665
Las ear he used playing cards...

253
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,284
Besides there was a passenger
who was on deck

255
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:53,588
before the quiz was announced too...

256
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,990
saying that he wanted to
Iook at the ocean...

258
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:56,624
Huh?

259
00:12:57,226 --> 00:13:01,463
I don't remember who exactly that
person was since it was dark though...

261
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:02,430
Oh, is that right?

262
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,431
Oh, is that right?

263
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:04,899
I see...

264
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:09,404
Which means the possibility of
the killer being among us

266
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:13,174
who have received
the card of the devil is high!

268
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,120
Cough...cough, cough...

269
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,290
Are you okay?

270
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:33,962
The doctor that
we're going to see is very efficient!

272
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,865
So. your cold will be cured right away

273
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,267
and you'll feel better in no time at all.

274
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,903
Cough...cough...cough...

275
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,620
By the way.

276
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:01,055
When is this ship returning to the harbor?

277
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:04,125
I think it'll be another hour or so...

278
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,326
I see...

279
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,029
Then, shall we go inside the ship

280
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,898
and investigate the case?

281
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,332
Mr. Sleeping Vampire?

282
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,433
Oh. okay...

283
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:20,808
Huh?

284
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,810
What's up. Pops?

285
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:23,912
Yeah,

286
00:14:23,913 --> 00:14:26,648
it seems we're coin to be late
so I thought I'd let Ran know...

288
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,669
Huh? She's not answering...

289
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,771
Maybe she's taking a bath?

290
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,206
Okay. then...

291
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:29,877
Please show me the card
of the devil that you all have...

293
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:35,483
H.Huh? Huh?...

294
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:38,086
Huh? What's the matter. Mummy?

295
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,722
1.1 wonder if I dropped it somewhere...?

296
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:42,590
I see.

297
00:15:43,058 --> 00:15:46,527
You deliberately poked
your card with the arrow

299
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,430
and tried to free yourself
from being a suspect, right?

301
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:53,167
You played on the psychology that

302
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:56,671
the killer himself would leave
his devil card behind with the victim,

304
00:15:57,106 --> 00:16:01,242
unaware that this card was
a one of a kind in this world,

306
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:04,579
that Mr \Fukuura had exclusively made!!

307
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,515
I. I was fully aware of that too!

308
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,151
Huh?! How'd you know?

309
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,619
B.Because...

310
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:13,721
I was asked¥y, Mr. Fukuura to
sit among the passengers

312
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,224
and choose someone
with great make-up on...

314
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:21,162
after all rmyalso a staff
member of the movie!!

316
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:21,829
What?!

317
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:24,432
You're a movie staff member?

319
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,538
would never dream of...
hurting Mr. Fukuura...

321
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,742
Are you the only movie staff that
isimixed up among the passengers here?

324
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,080
almost all the other mummies
besides me are staff members...

326
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,983
When we find passengers
with great make-up.

328
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:44,886
We contacted Mr. Fukuura by e-mail

329
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,123
Y.Yeah...

330
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:53,227
we received all kinds of instructions
from Mr. Fukuura during make-time...

332
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:56,030
structions...?
What kind of instructions?

334
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:58,733
Like. drink a certain kind of wine, etc...

335
00:16:59,168 --> 00:17:02,403
I was told to eat only chicken dishes #

336
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,673
I was told to wear this red wig.

337
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:09,677
All his instructions were varied
depending on the person

339
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,314
and the only instruction
he gave us in common was not to talk.

341
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,516
What kind of instruction is that
supposed to be?

343
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,085
How should I know,

344
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:19,320
it's Mr. Fukuura's instructions!

346
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:33,661
But...

347
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:36,364
When we were waiting for the quiz,

348
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:40,251
you disappeared from before us,
didn't you 7?

350
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:42,904
I.ll went to the restroom!

351
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,272
These two were with me too!!

352
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,641
Right?

353
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,242
It-s. true...

354
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,145
that you were: with us
when we went to the restroom but...

356
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,847
S.See.

357
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,018
B.But...l didn't see
you come:out of the restroom...

359
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,487
Huh?! What are you-talking about?!

360
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,390
I passed right behind you when I left!!

361
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,258
WwW. Why're you saying
something like that...

364
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:08,529
I; ll guess...you didn't notice me

365
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,065
because somebody cracked the mirror...

366
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,400
Huh

367
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,534
You mean that

368
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,904
mirror wasn't cracked begin with
in order to give a creepy atmosphere?

370
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,139
Huh?! No...

371
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:22,108
It wasn't cracked until we departed!

372
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,779
A.Are you sure?

373
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,647
Y.Yes!!

374
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,751
We. the staff decorated
this ship together...

376
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,454
But, we weren't given instructions
to crack the mirror in the restroom...

378
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:37,959
Then, just before Mr. Fukuura was
about to give out the quiz,

380
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,094
where were you?

381
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,163
I... was herel!

382
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,632
Near Wolf Man!! Right?!

383
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:48,236
Y.You saw me. didnatsyou?

384
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,070
I wonder...ll don-tdfremember

385
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,672
OO. Oh no...

386
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:58,145
I was desperate trying to sell myself
because I wanted a part in the movie!

388
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,579
Like so!

389
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,483
Aooohn

390
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:06,687
Come to think of it,
you were roaring several times.

392
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,124
It seems that nobody's seen you around...

393
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,295
Which means...
you don't have an established alibu...

395
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:22,762
0Oh no...

396
00:21:22,763 --> 00:21:25,166
( It.It's a trap!

397
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:28,169
Somebody's conspired to frame me!!

398
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:33,140
Phooey...A killer who's cornered
barks a lot...

400
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:38,913
At any rate, you have no alibi
and no card Mummy...

403
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:44,652
You're the only:one I can think of that
could've committed the murder!!

405
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,789
Detective Mouri. you're a little off there...

406
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,026
What? What~?!

407
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:54,996
The truth is still in the dark...

408
00:21:55,763 --> 00:21:58,766
The>»voice is coming from the speaker
wine ghost ship captain was using!

410
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,836
Darn! The deck!!

411
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:03,904
Kugh...Out of my way!!

412
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,420
W.Who is it?!

413
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,389
Where are you?!

414
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:27,862
You've already acquired everything
you need to solve the case and yet...

416
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,597
How disappointing...

417
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,132
Agh!! Why you!

418
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:32,933
Who are you!

419
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,753
You better shut up
or you're going to pay for this!

421
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,505
Fuh. fuh. fun, fu...

422
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,906

Captain of this ghost ship, Captain Gold,

427
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:01,562
that is, the host of this party,
and movie producer Mr. Senzo Fukuura.

429
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:02,563
Who killed him...?

430
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:04,464
And...

431
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,835
