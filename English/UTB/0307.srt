Excuse me, Detective Mouri!

24
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,251
I'd like to ask you about-the
recent homicide case.

26
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,019
It is said that

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,556
Mr. Nagumo who was arrested
confessed that he committed the murder

29
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,093
because Nebuharu was being
bullied[by Mr. Kazami

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,730
If that's what he's saying. so it is...

32
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,400
All I did was expose the trick that
he used and advised him that

34
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:19,071
it would be wiser to turn himself in
before any evidence came up...

36
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,272
If you will excuse me then...

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,708
Ooh, Mr. Mourn!

38
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,445
Please wait! Just another word please.

39
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:31,017
Hmm==~~A man -says-few
but the message is: still there...

41
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,452

44
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,726
When he rarely solves the case without
goofing, he gets all carried away

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,729
Well, I guess I can't help
making Pops play detective

48
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,533
because I got to get information
on the men in black.

50
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,702
They sure don't show up...

Rewind, rewind...

52
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,441
They collect large sums of
cash by repeating assassinations

55
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,543
They force people like Ai to make drugs

56
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:02,581
and go) around gathering
competent computer programmers.

58
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,387

59
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,560
Yes. this is the Mourn Detective Agency

60
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,695
Don't tell me that they're planning to

61
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,864
create an incredible game
using all that cash

63
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,566

Oh... so he's the system engineer
that disappeared about a week ago...

90
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,723
And? You say this is not the first time

91
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,526
he disappeared like this...
What do you mean?

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,028
Well, each time the deadline for
the game system that

95
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,030
he is ordered to.do-closes in...

96
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,799
he frequently disappears...

97
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,802
Wells we think it's the usual
this time too, but...

99
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:34,273
We can't afford to just wait with
our fingers in our mouths either...

101
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,043

We asked the police to ask him
previously and he really bawled us out,

105
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,379
so this time we decided to
ask you instead!

Oh...

109
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,050
They don't seem to have anything
to do with the guys I'm looking for...

111
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:50,256
So, if you doe find him,
please contact me...

113
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,993
Hey, you gotta be kidding!
My place is dishing out the most cash!

115
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,127
Hey!

116
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,031
Our company's the one that first ordered
the system to him this time!

118
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,302
Ce You're not of the same compa

119
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,838
I'm Sugai. the one who ordered him

120
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,040
to make the system
for the igo software this time!

122
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,011
I'm Naito. and asked him
to make a chess software...

124
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,782
I asked him to make a shogi software...
My name's Soma.

126
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,350
But, is it possible for
one person to handle

128
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,587
making three different kinds of
game software at once?

130
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,956
That-s"why we want to find him
and complain!

132
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,357
That'things are not how we
thought they were!!

134
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,160
We all went to place our order
to him separately,

136
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,597
and this is what he told each of us...

137
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,334
I haven't signed a contract with
anyone this time so leave it to me.

139
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,902
When did you find out that he
was taking work

141
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,737
from all of you at the same time?

142
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:43,075
A week ago,
\ we all received this e-mail from him!

144
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,513

153
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,391
I didn't notice because he was
wearing glasses in the picture but

155
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,062
Isn't he Mr. Taku Itakura, who is famous
for computer graphics?

157
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,499
Yes the wears contacts when
he appears in public...

159
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,801
Do you know him?

160
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:12,771
Yes. he is comes out a lot in the
credit of the movies!

162
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,809
Ever since his eyesight got bad
about 3 years ago. he left the

164
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,212
field of computer graphics and now
concentrates on developing systems...

166
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:25,751
If he's that famous, he could've
been kidnapped.

168
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,885
No way...

169
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,623
Rather...with that guy anything
IS possible...

171
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,127
About 2 years ago, I saw a guy with
a mustache at Mr-ltakura's office.

173
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:39,298
He was a big man with a Kansai accent...

174
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,566
Huhr¢

176
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,768
I'm sure you-ve seen him too.

Wore

184
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,716
What were they talking about
at the office?

186
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,618
I. don't know.

187
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,022
When I got there he was saying,
We-don't need you no more,"

189
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,157
and he was ready to leave.

190
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,793
Is't at all?! Isn't there more!!

191
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,262
Hey,. Conan, just what's the
matter with you?

193
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,034
Damn! I've no choice but to find
Mr. Itakura and ask him myself!

195
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,103
If I'mynet mistaken thatfbig man
supposedly died

197
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:21,206
in the.explosion back then! so I
donitithink he's involved.

199
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,142
The problem-is this picture. -

200
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,644
How shall we start:searching for him...

201
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,547
I think he's in a hotel or
something somewhere...

203
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,818
Hotel's refuse to give out
private information of their guests too...

205
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,754
Besides. he's probably using a
pseudonym anyway.

207
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:43,028
Ran. I want to eat sashimi, Tientsin food
and beef stew tonight!!

209
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,699
Hey. wait sec., that's Japanese, Chinese
and Western style food!

211
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,167
You can't even get that
combination of food

213
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,601
at a family restaurant that's got
most all kinds of food!

215
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,137
Which means if one customer
orders all three kinds by himself,

217
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,373
people"ll think he's a weird
customer, right?

219
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,208
A weird customer?

220
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,611
Come to think of«it.O

221
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:03,015
he has a Shogi board, anslgo
board and a Chess boardtin his room...

223
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,419
Have you heard what he took
with him from his work place?

225
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,155
I heard that he packed the
notebook type computer

227
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,725
that he always uses. and a few
discs in his bag and left...

229
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,662
He didn't take anything else
with him then?

231
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,533
What-is with this hotel?!

232
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,168
Huh?... Who may I ask are you? )

233
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,872
I'm the one-who borrowed the
Shogi. Chess and Igo game from you!

235
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,675
The phone of my room is
suddenly not working!

237
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,479
Im calling from my cell phone now, hurry
and. do something about it!!

239
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:36,849
We do not rent out things like
that in our hotel...

241
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,152
Oh, I'm sorry, I made a mistake...

242
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,856
Okay. next it's Hotel New Beika.

244
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,794
If a guest borrows asshogi,
chess, and igo board all by himself

246
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,996
and stays at the hotel for a eek

247
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,534
I'm sure the employees of the
hotel are talking about him...

249
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,904
I'm calling on my cell right now,
but hurry and do something, will you?!

251

No big deal. Mr. Detective.

264
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,736
You just want to go back after
finishing your work

266
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,639
and eat dinner all by yourself, right?

267
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,775

You're all. competitors in the
business, aren't you?

274
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,728
Why'd you all end up coming
here all together?

276
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:01,533
Because we found out that he took jobs
from all three of us at once...

278
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,635
All of us who are in charge of
the job we ordered to him decided that

280
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,270
we three should talk to him together...

281
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,007
And so, it dawned on me to ask
you to help us, Mr. Mour...

283
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,178
I was the-one, who suggested that
we ask a detective to help us!

285
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,215
No. I'm the one who
mentioned your name!

287
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,818
Idiot!; I'm the one who
contacted him by phone!!!

289
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:20,619
So, I'm the one who first
mentioned the idea. right?

291
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,421
So I'm the one who first
mentioned the idea. right?
Ghads...

294
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,558
Ah, man, Yoko-chan's program is over.

295
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,062
My. wearing a cheap
wristwatch like that I'm sure you'll get

297
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,630
some snide remarks about it!

298
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,297
Huh?...

299
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,867
Mr. Itakura is really pic «
when it comes to watches...

301
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,201
Remember!

302
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,402
That's why we also...

303
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,671
Is your wristwatch genuine or what?

304
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,108
Hell with you! I just bought its
days ago. it's brand new!

306
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,077
I'll bet yours is fake?

307
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,213
Sigh

308
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:57,623
Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Naito, can you
push the 20th floor for me please?

310
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,657
Sure...

311
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,293
Ag Sings Saas

313
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,501
I'm sure that Mr. Itakura will be
surpr ed seeing us all here!

315
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,702
Y.Yep...

316
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,240
I wonder: if it is okay to head for
the hotel room just like that?...

318
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,210
Mr. Itakura is a man who is
somehow involved with Tequila,

320
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,779
a member of the organization...

321
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:26,318
I wonder if it's safe for Ran,
Pops and those people to go to his room?

323
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:30,489
Those last words that Tequila
said to Mr. Itakura,

325
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,692
You're of no use to us anymore.

326
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,427
In other words it could mean,
We refinished

328
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,895
finished with you, so we're
going to kill you

330
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:41,933
What if those guys are hiding near
here in order to get rind of Mr Itakura

332
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,202
Rather, they may already be in
NS 00, .+

334
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:51,743
Come on, idiot...what're you
getting all panicky for. cool head...

336
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,813
Tequila said so 2ears ag...

337
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:59,751
If they really meant to kill him, Mr. Itakura
would ve been killed long ago.

339
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,154
Besides, if Mr. Itakura is a
member of the organization,

341
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,058
he would never let
an outsider such as Mr. Soma,

343
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,860
enter the room while he is
talking to Tequila.

345
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,900
At any rate, we've got to meet
Mr. Itakura*and

347
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,069
get him to somehow tell us
what's going on...

349
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:21,873
I've got to find out
why Tequila came to his office...

351
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:35,621
Strange? He's got this "Don't Disturb
sign anging'on ee o0oran. ye...

353
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,123
He probably went out
to eat or something.

355
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,892
Let's wait in right in front of here, then...

356
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,297
Thank you so much for the trouble.

357
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,266
It's an automatic locking door,
SO please make sure

359
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,935
take your key along with you

360
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,303
Yes. I will...

362
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,774
Excuse me, bell boy!

364
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:57,409
Uh, could you open my uncle's room too?

366
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,345
Uh, could you open my uncle's room too?

367
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,013
Huh?...

368
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:05,082
It seems he forgot that we were
coming and went out.

370
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,318
But...

371
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,187
Hurry! Or. I'm going to leak-1!

372
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,126
I gotta go. I gotta go

373
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,628
I'm really sorry. thank you...

374
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,534
You're pretty sharp. sonny!

375
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,303
Because, if Mr. Itakura comes back

376
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,139
and sees us all in
front of the door of his room,

378
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,740
he might run away, right?

379
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,744
But, sonny...it.seems
we didn't have to do so...

381
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:36,748
It seems that Mr. Itakura
has just dozed off...

383
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,850
Of all things I tell you

384
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,121
Hey, get up! Hey!

385
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,825
You can't get away, Mr. Itakura... Huh?

386
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:52,998
What the?!

387
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,207
Mr. Ntakuga! Mr. Itakura?!

388
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:08,413
No good 4.He's been dead
for more than a day...

390
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,149
What?! It can't be?

391
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,784
I'll go call the police!

392
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,553
Why...

393
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,790
Probably a heart attack...

394
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,259
Pills are scattered all over the desk.

395
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,664
He probably had a sudden
heart attack and tried to drink medicine,

397
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,233
but couldn't, and died

398
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,237
I tell you...it's because
he goes into hiding.

400
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:41,246
No! Mr. Itakura didn't dig;of @n illness!

401
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,514
He was killed by someone!

402
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,083
But, why?!

403
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,954
Why did all clues of
those guys vanish just like that

405
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,825
7 pr 4
Darn!

408
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,963
What's this? A diary?

409
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,834
Mr Itakura's diary

410
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,139
If so. maybe theress something in it

411
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,977
About what Tequila
came to visit Mr. Itakura for

413
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:17,883
and what the men in black are trying to do

414
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:21,486
Maybe looking through this will
give us an idea

416
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,387
Hey!

417
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,388
Whaaa!

418
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,925
Don't you dare touch the
belongings of a dead person!

420
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,228
I tell you... The minute I
take my eyes off of you...

422
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,763
Darn!

423
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,799
I can't do a thing about it after all.

424
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,737
I guess I'll have to let him know what's
going on in order to look inside the diary...

426
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:42,407
About the fact that Mr. Itakura didn't
die a natural death by heart attack.

428
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,043
But was made to look
that way by someone...

431
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:51,149
'a- xe poss! 11 yo 1a someone
being one of the three here is very likely!

433
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,890
The victim is M raku Iitakura. age 45...

434
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,259
A system engineer of games...

435
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,661
a system engineer of games...

437
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,729
And. the cause of his death isy

438
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,134
A can't say anythin \decisive but
there are no visible external injunies.

440
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:13,004
Judging from the fact that he was taking
doses of a coronary enlargement drug,

442
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,907
it is likely that he had a heart attack...

443
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,877
He's probably been
death for about 2 days...

445
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,011
Inspector!

446
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:22,581
We got- a hold of Mr. ltakura's doctor!

447
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:23,849
And?

448
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:27,118
Mr. Itakura's.heart-seems to have been In
very bad shape, and he was scheduled to

450
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,889
undergo surgery as soon as he completed
the work he had taken on this;time!

452
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,458
Her «Which means, 4

453
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,294
this case 1S Not one thates to
be handled by you...

455
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,498
Yes, it sure looks to be that way...
Ha. ha, ha...

457
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,804
But, if he's been dead for two days, why
didn't any of the hot?! personnel realize it?

459
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,242
He used to hate people
coming into his working place...

461
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,111
Right, right! Just the other day
he was fuming about the fact

463
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,147
that the papers on his desk
had been moved 10 centimeters...

465
00:16:56,349 --> 00:17:00,051
And, he rarely changes the
sheets he uses at home either,

467
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,721
so I'm sure he refused
ta have his bed made...

469
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,323
Who are those three people?

470
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:09,761
They are employees of the companies
that ordered jobs to Mr Itakura!

472
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,097
They came to ask me to search

473
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,401
for Mr. Itakura who
disappeared a week ago...

475
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:21,806
And- you found him all right,
but-he was dead...?

477
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:28,546
Yes...but it's no wonder that
he ended up this way. being

479
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:30,882
that he confined himself in a hotel,
neglecting his health...»-

481
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,450
I see...

482
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,086
I think this man favors tidiness.

483
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,154
I think this man favors tidiness.

485
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,491
Because when we came into this room.

486
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,328
This man was sitting on the chair with his
face pushed down on the desk,

488
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:46,498
and yet there are
no marks left on the desk!

490
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,968
Marks?

491
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,536
The marks of his saliva!

492
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,838
If somebody drools as much as he does,

493
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,974
it would usually
dirty the desk too. wouldn't it?

495
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,976
I'm sure the -man wiped it!

496
00:17:57,977 --> 00:17:58,209
Fool! Why would a man who is
suffering from a-heart attack

499
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,546
Fool! Why would a man who is
SURO Nom - oak fg vd

501
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,482
wipe the desk before drinking his medicine!

502
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,419
Then. who wiped the desk?

503
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,721
I wonder who can it be?

504
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,223
Besides! This is the first time that I heard

505
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,893
that the victim was found,
with his face down on the desk!

507
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,429
Oh well, he slid to the floor
when he was shook...

509
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,497
If so, then it's strange.

510
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,867
The back of the victim's hand

511
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,337
If the hand of the victim
Ww i0se ace was. ¢c own on edc es

514
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:28,039
was found stiff in this position,

515
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,277
his hand would've had to be stuck between
the desk and his body all this time

517
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,246
But. there are ne such traces left.

518
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:39,250
Don't tell me that Mr. Itakura
died somewhere else

520
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,153
But, Inspector!
The hands and feet of the corpse

522
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,724
Is completely stiff in this manner!

523
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,527
If so. it would be
impossible unless someone

525
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:52,864
tied Mr. Itakura onto
the chair deliberately

528
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,165
Oh...

529
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,632
Oh...

530
00:18:55,267 --> 00:19:00,372
I see... so Mr Itakura was
probably made to sit in the chair

532
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:03,975
tied up with his hands on his chest,
and was unable to take his medicine

534
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,911
unless somebody helped him drink it...

535
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,848
Then, don't tell me that this is...

536
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:16,121
Yeah... this is in a case within the
range of our profession...

538
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:17,188
homicide...

542
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:24,529
But, if so there should be marks
of him Yaving been tied up.

544
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,397
How about it. coroner!

545
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:30,402
There are no such clear traces but.it
seems that exterior pressure had been

547
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,139
applied to a wide area over his body,

548
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,141
from the many visible traces of
blood congestion.

550
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,642
Just what does that mean?

551
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:41,379
Wow~~~this blanket is soft and warn!

552
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,049
C.Conan!Stop that!

553
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,319
But. what's this? It's got sticky
stuff on here and there!

555
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,788
00 of

556
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,589
II get it! It's the blanket!!

557
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,059
The blanket?!

558
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,195
The killer probably wrapped Mr.
Itakura's body with the blanket,

560
00:19:58,196 --> 00:20:02,867
made him sit in the chair and then
wrapped his body up with masking tape!

562
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,804
A-pillow or something was
probably placed in

564
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:09,007
between his lap and chest, to
make. him lean against the desk.

566
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,877
I see. if so. there would be no traces!

567
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,814
Which means that the legs of this table

568
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,616
that are fixed in place is what
held his chair in place.

570
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,752
Although it:looks as if
they removed it once...

572
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,489
A little of the adhesive of the
masking tape can still be detected.

574
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,025
In other words. the killer left Mr. Itakura

575
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,828
in that position until
he died of a heart attack.

577
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:33,565
Then after postmortem rigidity
spread throughout his body.

579
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,669
They came back again to remove
the masking tape and blanket.

581
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:41,706
That is, they made it look like he
died of an illness!!

583
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,041
Okay!

584
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,909
Ask the hotel employees

585
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,846
if they saw any suspicious looking people
during the last three days!

587
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,314
Yes. sirll

588
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:51,049
A hotel...

590
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,786
Well, the thing is, I called this hotel
making believe that

592
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,989
that I was Mr Itakura in order to
hunt down this room...

594
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,724
I told them that I was the one
who borrowed

596
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,291
the Shogi. Chess and Igo games...

597
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,294
And complained to them
saying that my telephone broke down,

599
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,864
so to hurry and do something about it!...

600
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,065
dingy gs Eg

602
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:10,802
Anatinats Now I gotitne
room number to this room.

604
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,738
I heard"them laughing on the
other side of the line after that...

606
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,874
Saying. .."Not again.

607
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,611
Which rjeans that semebody else
could've done the same thing

609
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,413
to find out where he was too then?!

610
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,649
Well, but I wonder if there would
be anyone

612
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,618
who have the same sort of brains
that I, Kogoro Mouri has...

614
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,854
Inspector! We found anether
suspicious person

616
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:34,425
who pretended to be Mr. Itakura saying
that the phone of his room broke down!

618
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,294
Oh. so there was someone else...

619
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,397
When the employee went te check
the room later, Mr. Itakura yelled at him

621
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,066
and chased him away saying.
Didn't call you!

623
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,469
I guess it would be safe to say
that the killer is the one

625
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,471
who made the phone call.

626
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,941
But, how did you know that
Mr Itakura borrowed the Shogi,

628
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,278
Chess and Igo game from the hotel?

629
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,146
From 'his mail

630
00:21:55,147 --> 00:22:00,218
I saw the mail with the image attachment
that Mr. ltakura sent ta the three of 015m.

632
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:06,491
That is, Mr. Itakura sitting in front
of aShogié Chess and lgo board.

634
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,694
I see in other words.

635
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,698
All three of you could've used
the same method

637
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:17,702
that Mr. Mouri used to come here...

638
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,539
No way!

639
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,174
It can't be!

It seems that Mrltakura had
been writing a diary

693
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,568
On a daily basis from 5 years ago...

697
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:01,539
Which means...it's there, the info
IS there!

699
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,376
Information on the day two years ago
equila visited him is... ir

701
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,878
4!...This can't be...

702
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:12,884
Yes...Mr. Itakura had written information
indicating who the killer is.

704
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,621
That is. his dying message...
