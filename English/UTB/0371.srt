Nose is known as the b ah pitcher
player of the baseball world!

42

It's his sharp-eye of
discerning the habits and

00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:22,067
type of ball the batter will hit
against my power of deduction!!

46

Naha, ha ha, ha.

I guess so...but I don't think

281
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,010
We don't have much time, so let's
continue the introductions in the car...

283
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,211
Oh. all right -

284
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,113
Shall we get goingithen.,

285
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,348
Okinawa sure 1s a nice place

286
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,150
Too bad it's raining. though...

287
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,552
Huh?! Hey! Let's go.sonny!

288
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,855
Oh. okay...

289
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:57,188
Oh, okay...

290
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,325
Mr. Motoyama seems
to be a kind person so

292
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,661
maybe I'll be able to ask
him for Mr. Nose's autograph...

294
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,430
Y Yep... guess SO...

295
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:20,378
It seems that Nose hasn't
returned to the hotel yet...

297
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,914
Maybe he 'got.tired: on
the way back andliis resting

299
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,383
somewhere? After all,
he's not all that young...

301
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,468

302
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,920

There's no nee
to call an ambulance...

327
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:32,717
Huh?

328
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,053
Mr. Nose has been
stabbedsin the stomach

00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,205
with something and is already dead...

331
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:37,822

Oh. okay!

347
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,466
Farst from night above
take two or three pictures...

349
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,068
Be careful not go inside the grassy area.

351
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:35,279
Huh? What's wrong. Ran...

352
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,782
WV Well...

354
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:43,488
I was thinking of getting mom, a picture
of Mr. Nose. posing a guts pose...

356
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,158
And yet I end up
taking this kind of picture...

358
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,994
No cove O Voodoo

359
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,164
Sorry, never mind already...

360
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll take the pictures
so you go back inside the car...

362
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,569
Okay

364
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:42,513
Hey, hey... This guy's
Nos of'thevdagldrars!!t

366
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,351
saw on fTV'that he
was trainin .over here...

369
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,121
The estimated time of death
is around- 9:30 this morning.

371
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,091
The cause of death is loss of blood from

372
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,009
being stabbed in the
stomach'with a knife...

374
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,562
The weapon hasn't
been found yet though...

376
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,564
And. where is' the person who found him? \

377
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,033
Oh, uh, I think 1t was...

378
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,006
Uh. who 1s the one that found the body...

379
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:12,277
Us. We coincidentally
happened to drive by and

381
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,146
found Mr. Nose lying on the ground!

382
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,616
He was probably stabbed

Huh? If I remember correctly. you're .

Yeah...

387
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,321
that renown detective...

388
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,923
Oh, d'Yyou know me?

389
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,958
Mr. Kogoro Mouri...right?!

390
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,560
You re the talk of the town in Okinawa!

391
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,497
Yes yes yes, yes!

392
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,866
You're highly valued for your
tremendous appetite!... Right?

394
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,400
Well...

395
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,167
Hull?

396
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:40,071
Come to think of it,
Pops entered. 31 big-eaters

398
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,340
contest in Okinawa with Hattori...

399
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,445
So, it's almost as if the
case has been solved then!

401
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,213
We're counting on you!

402
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,849
I wonder if they really believe so...

404
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,721
I know somebody you can county
on more than Mr. Mouri, though!

406
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,755
Huh...

407
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,059
Sports talent. Mr. Motoyamal!

409
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,494
Huh?! Just what are
you talking about, sonny...

411
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,664
Because when we found Mr. Nose.

412
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,600
His blood was drained in the rain

413
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,170
and unless we went
up close to take a look.

415
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,672
We couldn't tell that he
was stabbed in the stomach!

417
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:20,778
Besides, if one knew
that Mr. Nose was road working.

419
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,715
Wouldn't it be most natural
to think that Mr. Nose fell ill

421
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,416
and was lying on the ground?

422
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,987
But. you said to call the-police.
Without even getting off the-car...

424
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,457
Hurry call an ambulance
and get the police!!!

426
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,793
Even Holmes can't
beat you as a detective!

428
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:42,834
How did you know that it was murder?

429
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:50,241
Come to think of it, bef re
I checked Mr. Nose's stomach

431
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,144
and mentioned him being stabbed you...

432
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,746
T.TeléPhone!

433
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,680
Tel@pHone?

434
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,817
After the TV appearance
Iast night, he mentioned-that...

436
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,654
a strange man claiming
to be an anti Jaguars

438
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,791
was troubling him with crank calls

440
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,094
Well, when I saw Nose
Iy ng on the ground,

442
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,329
I just felt that something was: wrongs

443
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,599
I's that true?

444
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,368
Well! guess it'll do you no
good to suspect me anyway,

446
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:21,339
because I couldngt
have committed the crime...

448
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,573
Just*what do you mean?

449
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:28,046
Because Mr. Nose's estimated time
of death is about 930 this morning. right?

451
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,550
Just around that time I was on
the flight that left Miyazaki at 8:15

454
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,887
and scheduled to
arrive in Okinawa at 9:50...

456
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,106
@Oheck the passenger's list!

457
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:38,823
Yes, sir!

458
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,558
Oh, uh,

459
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,828
I'm not onthe List...

460
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,163
Huh?! Why net?

461
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:48,433
km pretty:well known,
you know...l don't like people

463
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,903
making a fuss that I'veqalways
bought my tickets under an alias...

465
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,239
Besides, I was slightly
disguised wearing a hat and

467
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,575
all that I don't. think anyone saw me...

468
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,078
So. what was the alias that you used?

469
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,280
Huh?! Uh...

470
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:06,317
Yamada...no, maybe it was Tanaka?

471
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:13,458
Well, if Mr. Motoyama was in
Miyazaki last night. he has an alibi...

474
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,195
Because that's the only fight
that flies from Miyazaki to Okinawa...

476
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:23,034
Please go ahead and ask the hotel
in Miyazaki that I spent th night at.

00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,695
Great chat show?

503
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:57,034
Oh, he's from Nichiuri TV
of Okinawa, and was scheduled

505
00:18:57,035 --> 00:19:02,306
to have a chat with
Mr. Motoyama today. but...

507
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,726
Who would've even
imagined we'd run into

509
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,379
Nose's corpse while
heading ever to his hotel...

511
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,214
Well§we'll get to the

Huh?

515
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,820
We found. this near the corpse...

516
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,056
A time table-and can of tennis balls?

517
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,092
Oh, they're mine!

518
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:25,229
I'm sorry! I seem toihave

520
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,212
Inspector! It's been confirmed!

521
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,350
About the phone call...

522
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,238
Itys true that Mr. Motoyama
called Mr. Nose from

524
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:50,688
Itys trye that Mr Motoyama
called Mr. Nose from

526
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,592
his hotel in Miyazaki
at 19:20 to 19:23 yesterday.

528
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,593
Sea'?...

529
00:19:55,594 --> 00:20:01,332
Well, even without it , I appeared
Iive on TV from Miyazaki last night...

532
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,970
Viewers all over the nation es
will prove my 'alibiforime.

534
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,706
Come to think of it, that's true.

535
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,709
And? Have you heard of
any characteristics of the man

537
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,812
who was making crank calls to Mr. Nose?

538
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,582
No...all he said was an odd man.

539
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,916
An odd man...eh...

540
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,786
It sure is strange. though...

541
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,690
I confirmed with his
other teammates. but

543
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,259
none of them seems to have
heard of any crank calls

545
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,526
none of them seems to have
heard of any crank calls.

547
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,828
Most naturally.

548
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,698
Nose was the much feared
guardian of the Jaguars,

550
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,500
SO I'm sure he couldn't
mention anything about

552
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:39,170
being frightened over 'a crank call,

553
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,672
I, however, have been
best friends with him for a long time

555
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,008
and there was nothing we
didn't talk about with each other...

557
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,394
Now that you mentioned it,
you entered the team

559
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:48,762
at the same time as Mr. Nose, didn't you?

560
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:50,414
Y. Yes.

561
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,884
You were awarded King of Save
and Best Rookie the first year...

563
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,087
But, I damaged my
shoulder the 2nd Y8ar.ee.aNJ

565
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,155
underwent an operation.
However, I never regained

567
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,424
my pitching velocity
and resigned in my 5th year...

569
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:05,396
I gave in te the 2nd-year jinx, and was
no more than a one ime cluteh player...

571
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,400
I was planning to tell
the young players who are

573
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,336
training here with
Nose here tomorrow. but...

575
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,990
Under the circumstances
I guess it'll be better to cancel

577
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:19,410
the interview of the young players
we were planning to hold tomorrow...

579
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,673
At any rate, please arrest
the murderer as soon-as possible...

581
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:38,362
The devil who got in the way of my best
friend making his Japan record of saves...

583
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,399
No. not right...

584
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,335
He s the killer

585
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,006
Oh, can I make a phone call?
I'll be done 'in a minute.

587
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,408
Sure go ahead...

588
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,229
But, he has an alibi

589
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,983
Why en earth...

590
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,858
What?

591
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,199
What the...

592
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,126
What is this?!

593
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:27,628
What's this thing that I feel?!!!
