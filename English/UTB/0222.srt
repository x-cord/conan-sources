1
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,953
With a strong heart
and power of deduction,

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,555
step into the essence with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,190
The legend of a mermaid
starts off the new series.

6
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,791
Heiji, Kazuha, Ran & Conan
work together again.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,526
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,362
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,430
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:59,218
THE MERMAID DISAPPEARS-PART I
(THE MYSTERY)

16
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,289
Good grief,

17
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,490
I hope you appreciate what I'm doing...

18
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,392
first you pop up out of the blue

19
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,894
then you tell me
that we've got to go to Fukui on a job

21
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,397
and that's why were on thisicrazy trip...

22
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh don't grumble!

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,900
I'm paying for this.

25
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:16,635
what?

26
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:17,970
So where are we?

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,672
What's the name of that island
we're going to?

29
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,842
It's called Bikuni Island,
it's just a tiny island

31
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,745
the locals around here call it...

32
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,781
the island where the mermaid lives...

33
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:29,515
Bikuni Island

34
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:29,882
Bikuni Island

36
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,417
Did you say mermaid?
Bikuni Island

39
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:31,751
Bikuni Island

41
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,485
Yeah.
Bikuni Island
ERIE

44
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,555
They say there's an old lady on that island
! , - ype .
AA ea Ss nmerimal mea.

47
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,025
I've heard about that!

48
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,993
About 3 years ago,
there was a big fuss:about her,

50
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,129
she's an old lady who has lived forever,
Isn't that right?

52
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,096
Yes, that's right.

53
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:44,797
I decided to come along

54
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,967
because I wanted to learn
the secret of her beauty & longevity!

56
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,201
Oh I/get it!

57
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,504
You want to snare Heiji
with those secrets, eh?

59
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,505
Shh!

60
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,340
Don't talk so loud!

61
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,644
You've got to be kidding me!

62
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:04,884
I hope you're not going to tell me
our job is to find a mermaid!

64
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,918
It's just the opposite,

65
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,122
there were only 3 lines
in the letter giving us the job...

67
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,424
and the writing was shaky...

68
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,561
This is what it said,
The mermaid will kill me...

70
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,129
help!

71
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,930
A mermaid...

72
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,399
Is going to kill someone?!

73
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,268
Yawn...

74
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,637
Hey, this is serious!

75
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,272
Give me a break,

76
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,107
mermaids only exist in fairy tales,

77
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,542
don't expect me to take you seriously.

78
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,745
I don't. believe they really exist either,

80
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,283
the name in the letter got my attention.

81
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,418
The envelope was addressed to me but

82
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,389
the letter was written to Shinichi Kudo!

84
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,292
You should be thanking me!

85
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,929
It might be somebody from your past,
that's why I brought you along!

88
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,100
did you contact the person
who sent the letter to confirm it?

90
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,301
Yes.

91
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,837
The sender, Saori Kadowaki,

92
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,906
wrote the number for her cellular phone
on the letter!

94
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,977
No one answered after the second time
I called,

96
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,980
but the first time I called someone
answered and hung up immediately.

98
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:09,782
On that first call though,

99
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,650
I can still hear

100
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,619
the sound coming from
the other side of the receiver...

102
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,387
It was the sound of waves

103
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,590
and a woman moaning...!

104
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,792
It couldn't be...do you think it was her?

105
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,326
Maybe the mermaid already killed her.

106
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,532
What?!

107
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,401
Saori Kadowaki is missing?!

108
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,069
Yes,

109
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,606
it seems she hasn't shown up for work
for the past 3 days.

111
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,076
3 days ago,
that's about when I got the letter.

113
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,379
Her neighbors are saying

114
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,448
that she might have gone
to the main island:on the ship though.

116
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,116
Sir, it's almost time!

117
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,651
Yes, be right there!

118
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,653
Well,-I've got to go prepare for the festival.

119
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,189
Festival...

120
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:55,194
Today's the day of the "Dugong Festival".
It's the island's annual celebration!

122
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,329
If you:want-to know more about it,

123
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,667
go to the gift shop Saori worked at,
it's right at the corner!

125
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,403
Mermaid amulets... mermaid straps...

126
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,674
wow, they've even got dugong cakes!

127
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,544
This island's really got every
mermaid item in stock.

129
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,080
What's a dugong. anyway?

130
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:15,915
Well. uh...

131
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,117
It's a mammal that lives in the ocean,

132
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,852
some people say that
that's the model for the mermaid.

134
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,189
They used to live in the southern part
of Japan too, long ago. and it was

136
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:27,126
believed that their meat was medicinal
and could make you live a long life.

138
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,128
Dugong arrow...

139
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:29,895
Yes sir.

140
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,830
It's a charm to keep you young forever,

141
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,135
only 3 are given away,
once every year at the "Dugong Festival

143
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,472
Saori was presented with 1 lastyyear
but she said she lost it

145
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,075
and she has been terrified since last week...

146
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,844
She said the mermaid would curse her.

147
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,713
That's hard to believe...a mermaid...

148
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,616
Mermaids do exist.

150
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,785

I don't blame her for running away,

who wouldn't be afraid of
the mermaids curse

175

And who is this holy person?

She's the star of the festival

181

as well as the symbol of our island,

182
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,318
she's old lady Shimabukuro!

183
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,489
So tell me, how old is
the old lady anyway?

185

There's some that say she's a hundred,
some say she's 200...

Just because she's a little older than :40',
most, everyone exaggerates so much. 77

A little older...

She belongs in

where is this very old lady anyway?

229
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,635
She's in her room,

230
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,638
blessing the arrows to be presented
at today's festival.

232
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:20,739
Then, you mean,

233
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,442
she really eats dugong meat?!

234
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:23,942

There's no such things as mermaids!

Heh?

239
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,853
That story's a complete lie!

240
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,823
B, but what about the Dugong Arrow...

241
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,425
My late mother told me

242
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,227
that it was originally a protection amulet

243
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:48,634
but the people on the island went &
started to call it dugong arrow instead.

245
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,470
You've lost your mother?

Â» a WD
1 CO.

248
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,174
She was lost{at sea 5 years ago,
along 'with my father.

250
00:07:55,742 --> 00:08:00,512
And it seems my grandparents
were also lost at sea before I was born.

252
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,614
How awful,
you lost your whole family to the sea,

254
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,149
there must be something behind it.

255
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,251
That's nonsense!

256
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,188
Saori and I went to the main island
by boat just recently

258
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,622
and nothing happened.

260
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,025
You went with Saon?

261
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,360
When was that?

262
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,228
4 days ago.

263
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,798
I had a dentist appointment
andfasked her to come with me.

265
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,634
There's no dentists on this island.

266
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,371
Was there anything strange
about her that day?

268
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,474
She was very scared
because she lost the dugong arrow.

270
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,809
She thought the mermaid would curse her.

271
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,980
No matter how hard I tried to convince her
nothing would'happen, she wouldn't listen.

273
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,915
You're so stupid.

274
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,550
She wouldn't listen

275
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,120
because you don't believe in
the holy:ones:powers, isn't that right?

277
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,254
Toshimi?

278

She really ate dugong meat!

289
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:47,860
Well, actually,

290
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,196
about 3 years ago, the carcass of
a real dugong did wash up.

292
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,766
A dead dugong?!

293
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,303
Oh, wasn't it on television
about 3 years ago?

295
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,273
The media played it up a lot.

296
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,609
You don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,210
You saw it, didn't you?

298
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,748
The bones were crushed in
a very strange way. It was grotesque...

300
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,816
That's enough, Toshimi!

301
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:12,518

302
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,621

317

You might learn something if
that drunkard father lets you in, that is...

319
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,168
Nobody seems to be very worried.

320
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,938
That's because Saori fought with
her father a lot and she'd often runaway. 4's

322
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,575
Would you mind taking us
to Saori's home?

324
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,743
I don't mind.

325
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,577
But it'll have to be after the festival.

326
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,481
What do you do at the festival?

327
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,984
Lottery tickets are sold beforehand

328
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,320
and if their numbers match the numbers
my great-grandmother picks,

330
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,721
they get an arrow.

331
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,591
It's like lucky number drawing.

332
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,259
Oh, that's right!

333
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,995
Would you like to try your luck?

335
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,632
An elderly couplessuddenly
cancelled this. morning

337
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,167
so there are 2 extras.

338
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,272
If you say so...

339
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,610
Whether you win or lose,
it's all up to the Gods!

341
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:17,516
Maybe, you'll be able to obtain eternal
youth and beautydjust like the rumors.

343
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,896
I'm kind of excited.

344
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:31,897
Me too!

345
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:43,075
Mikoto Shimabukuro (130)

346
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,710
It's the holy person!

347
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,012
The holy person is making
her appearance!

349
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,981
That's the holy person...

350
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,183
She's so tiny.

351
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,853
It's just an old lady
wearing heavy makeup.

353
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,129
She set fire to the door!

354
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,178
I get it.

355
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,983
The fire burns
the winning number onto the door.

357
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:25,984
I... don't believe it...

358
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,219
Am I seeing things?

359
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,221
I did it, what luck!!

360
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,622
Oh well...

361
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,257
Ra, Ra, Ra, Ran...

362
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,194
I won!!

363
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,062
You what?!

364
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,734
Attention winners.

365
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,505
The dugong arrows will be
presented to you in an hour.

367
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,308
Please proceed to
the Mermaid's Waterfall!

369
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,849

374
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,692

That's strange...

398
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,770
I could've sworn that other girl won too.

399
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:19,938
Yeah...

400
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,873
and I don't see her around here.

401
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,308
At this time, however...

402
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,645
she was already

403
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,914
here at the Mermaids Waterfall.

404
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,150
Show these 3 with the divine light!

405
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,791
Hey. What's that?

406
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,026
What is that?!

407
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,565
That's right...

408
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,201
Iong, black hair wafting...

409
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,005
on a slim body that sways...

410
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,740
it most certainly looked like

411
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,476
a mermaid swimming up
the waterfall,

413
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,878
shiny & blue...

414
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,648
but it was a lifeless body...

415
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,558
To, Toshimi...

416
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,527
Do you think she killed herself?

417
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,862
R was she murdered...

418
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,464
Maybe it's neither...

419
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,901
the rope that's around her neck is

420
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,171
the one that's used to rope off
the dangerous areas along the river.

422
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,106
What did you just say?

423
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,343
- - - 37 am -_
I OCC...

425
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,611
So it happened like this,

426
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,314
it was dark & Toshimi tripped

427
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,451
she grabbed the rope
but the current was too strong

429
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,652
so the nails came loose

430
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,556
and as she fell,
the rope got tangled around her neck!

432
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,858
But don't you think that's strange?

433
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,262
The festival was still going on
around the bottom of the waterfall.

435
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,731
So what did she go into the forest for?

436
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,401
Maybe she was looking for
the mermaid's grave?

438
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,269
What?!

439
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:01,039
The mermaids grave Is
somewhere in this forest...

441
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,141
on the night of the festival 3 years ago,

442
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,077
a fire burned the shrine's storage house,
that's how

444
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,714
the mermaids bones were found. They
were buried somewhere in this forest.

446
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,818
Yes, I remember she was always talking
about that grave...

448
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,152
Hold on a minute!

449
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,587
You all talk about a mermaid

450
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,755
but how do you know
they were a mermaid's bones?

452
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,623
Well...

453
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,359
all the people on the island said they were

454
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,562
but the policeman from the main land said

455
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,430
the bones were those of
a middle aged woman.

457
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,465
That's a lie!

458
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,401
He said he couldn't be sure if there were
bones from the lower part of her body!

460
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,570
The lower part of her body...?

461
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,608
He main beam from the storage house
burned and fell on the lower part of her body

463
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,044
but when the beam was lifted off,

464
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,714
there were no bones
for where her legs should have been.

466
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,216
Th, that's hard to believe!!!

467
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,084
Thanks to that fact,

468
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,020
the media made a big fuss broadcasting
that a mermaid's body was found.

470
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,857
And our holy person became famous!

471
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,094
But didn't the police say it was a lady?

472
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:56,895
Yes...

473
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,999
they said probably tourists who didn't
win one of the dugong's arrows

475
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,536
snuck into the storage house
Iooking for an extra arrow

477
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:09,975
and the fire was caused when the candle
In the storage house was lit.

479
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,212
A year went by and
it was still unidentified

481
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,749
so we went and buried it...

482
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,684
The problem started after that.

483
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,286
Problem?

484
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,554
Grave robbers...

485
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,555
What?

486
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:29,661
Stupid tourists started coming around
trying to dig up the bones.

488
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,465
It seems they heard that mermaid bones
were the elixir of eternal life.

490
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,401
That's why my great-grandmother
asked someone

492
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,538
to help and they reburied
the bones here secretly.

494
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,174
Who did she ask?

495
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,208
I don't know.

496
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,778
All she said was that it was
someone she trusted very much.

498
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,883
Well, whether it's suicide,
murder or an accident,

500
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,052
we'll continue this conversation

501
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,955
after the police have arrived
and we've taken her body down.

503
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,256
Humph...

504
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,125
If it was murder,

505
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,793
then it's partly Toshimi's fault too,

506
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,930
coming to a place like this
at this time of night.

508
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:09,167
Aren't you the cold one,
your fiancee just died.

510
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,902
Fiancee?

511
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,039
Our parents arranged that on their own.

512
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,373
I never proposed to her.

513
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,611
Besides, both my father and mother
are no longer alive.

515
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,415
Toshimi!

516
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,116
Toshimi!!

518
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,818
Ioshimi!

519
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,453
Who is:that?

520
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,888
That's Toshimi's father.

521
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,624
Mr. Ebihara,
the head of the fisherman's union.

523
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,892
Dad!!

524
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,327
Uhuh...

525
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,029
did you call the Fukui prefectural police?

526
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,131
They said the seas are too rough

527
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,001
and they won't be able to
come until the water calms down!

529
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,603
You've got .to beikidding.

530
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,304
Hey. lucky:for us!

531
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,072
Huh

532
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,775
The murderer can't get off
the island either.

534
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,611
What do you mean, murderer...

535
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,847
we don't know for sure yet
that she was murdered.

537
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,782
Then take a look at it!

538
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,084
A swim ring?

539
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,654
Heiji & I found it,
It was stuck in the middle of the river

541
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,457
that joins the water from
the waterfall to the ocean!

543
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,260
If Toshimi was knocked unconscious

544
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,329
then she's put on the swim ring and set
afloat, with the rope winding her neck,

546
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,431
she'd end up hanging from the waterfall,
wouldn't she?

548
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,969
We saw Toshimi at the shrine
2 hours before the fireworks went up!

550
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,172
It doesn't take an hour to get
to and from the top of the waterfall...

552
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,041
which means,

553
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,078
anyone could have committed the crime,
man or woman...

555
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,049
and the murderer is still on the island!!

557
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,985
Th, that's terrible.

558
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,020
Don't worry about it!

559
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,954
The murderer will be caught in no time!

561
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,858
When Heiji moves his hat around,
he's turned his switch on!

563
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,627
He's ready to go!

564
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,929
Wow...

565
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,630
But...

566
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,098
you must've fallen in love with him.

568
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,736
I'm no match for you...
we ecome rivas...

571
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,873
Ka, Kazuha...

572
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,641
you're so sweet!

573
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,110
Hey, what're you doing?!

574
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,011
Listen...

575
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,180
if Toshimi was murdered,

576
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,416
you'd better not let that person
out of your sight.

579
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,353
I'm talking about Saori's drunk of a father.

580
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,655
Excuse me,

581
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,589
would you like to go to Saori's home now,

582
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,492
I'll take you-since I promised you earlier.

583
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,460
With him in that condition,

584
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,929
I doubt he'll be much help though.

585
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:18,897
You may be right.

586
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,464
Alright then...

587
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:20,899
Huh 7

588
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,368
I'd like to meet the holy person!

589
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,569
Sure,

590
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,037
I don't mind, but?.

591
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,277
Boy this house is old...

592
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,280
#it doesn't look like they're making too
much money from those dugong arrows.

594
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,315
How can you say that?

595
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,718
Those platelets cost 5 yen a piece.

596
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,286
Eh? 5 yen?

597
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,954
The people on this island said the price
has been the same

599
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,356
since they can remember.

600
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,858
There are 108 number platelets
in a huge box

602
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,428
& everyone lines up then pulls one out.

603
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:54,733
Then the old woman picks
E winning num ers.

606
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,902
What's taking that old lady
so long anyway?

608
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,170
Kimie said she'd tell her
we want to see her

610
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,106
but she might be tired
after today's festival,

612
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,275
so we may not be able to see her...

613
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:05,377
Huh

614
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,779
What is that sound?

615
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,218
Ah?!

616
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,589
Are you the ones who want to see me?

617
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,793
Without makeup, she looks like a spook.

618
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,962
Uh, excuse me...

619
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,600
we wanted to know
how you picked the winning numbers.

621
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,904
I just pick them randomly.

623
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,610
Once I used the numbers of the horses
that won at the races.

625
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,278
I don't believe this.

626
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:45,116
So why don't you sell more instead
of being so stingy and selling only 37

628
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,385
That can't be helped...

629
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,456
the hair I tie to the arrow is my own
& ll don't have a whole lot.

631
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,091
Great grandmother!

632
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,360
Your bath is ready!!

633
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,396
Excuse me,

634
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,798
if that's all you came here for,

635
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,333
I'm going to take a bath now & go to bed.

636
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,069
Wait, I'd like to ask.you more...

637
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,037
Alright then, you girlie...

639
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,339
You, the one with your hair tied back.

640
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,341
Who, me?

641
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,379
The dugong's arrow is
really a charm to ward off evil...

643
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,382
if it leaves your body,
evil will overtake you

645
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,319
men will return to the soil
and become heartless demons,

647
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:26,156
Women will return to the water
and become silent mermaids.

649
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:30,095
You must never let it leave your person.

650
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,172
Even her voice sounds wrinkly,
\ andsshe's so pale!

652
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,174
She looks like
she could drop dead any minute.

654
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,978
The next day

660
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,882
I'm glad I brought my school uniform
withfme, it's coming to good use.

662
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,951
Arelyou sure this is OK...

663
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,419
Won't they mind having
us show up like this? Â¥ .

665
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,987
No problem!

666
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,022
It's a small island, this'll be
) the perfect time to question everybody.

668
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,426
Stop smiling like that!

669
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,294
This is Toshimi's wake!

670
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,662
Oh, sorry...

671
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,131
Kazuha, -

672
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,299
\did you bring the arrow with you?

673
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,468
Yes! I certainly did!

674
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,503
Hun?

678
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,438
It's that drunk...

680
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,672
he's already here.

681
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,114
Why Mr. Mourt,
I'm surprised you all came.

683
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,749
Yes, well...

684
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,851
by the way,

685
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,722
I understand that Mr. Kadowaki
didn't go home last night.

687
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,056
That's right...

688
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,360
But I heard he got into a fight
with a tourist at a bar.

690
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,930
So he was drinking all night, huh?

691
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,134
I don't see Naoko around.

692
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,802
Her name was on the
sign-in sheet though.

694
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,272
Eh? Naoko's here?

695
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,807
She's probably in the restroom!

696
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,676
We'll go check

1 CD,

699
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:53,711

Eeek!!

701
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,822
Don't tell me you're afraid of thunder?

702
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,357
No, it's not that...

703
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,759
someone's out there.

705
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,530
Y, you're right!

706
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,798
What's going on?

707
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,066
Oh, Heiji!

708
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,668
Somebody's out there!

709
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,468
Are you sure?!

710
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,240
