1
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,953
With a strong heart
and power of deduction,

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,555
step into the essence with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,190
The legend of a mermaid
starts off the new series.

6
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,791
Heiji, Kazuha, Ran & Conan
work together again.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,526
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,362
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,430
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:59,218
THE MERMAID DISAPPEARS-PART I
(THE MYSTERY)

16
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,289
Good grief,

17
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,490
I hope you appreciate what I'm doing...

18
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,392
first you pop up out of the blue

19
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,894
then you tell me
that we've got to go to Fukui on a job

21
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,397
and that's why were on thisicrazy trip...

22
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,299
Oh don't grumble!

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,900
I'm paying for this.

25
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:16,635
what?

26
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:17,970
So where are we?

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,672
What's the name of that island
we're going to?

29
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,842
It's called Bikuni Island,
it's just a tiny island

31
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,745
the locals around here call it...

32
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,781
the island where the mermaid lives...

33
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:29,515
Bikuni Island

34
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:29,882
Bikuni Island

36
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,417
Did you say mermaid?
Bikuni Island

39
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:31,751
Bikuni Island

41
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,485
Yeah.
Bikuni Island
ERIE

44
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,555
They say there's an old lady on that island
! , - ype .
AA ea Ss nmerimal mea.

47
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,025
I've heard about that!

48
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,993
About 3 years ago,
there was a big fuss:about her,

50
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,129
she's an old lady who has lived forever,
Isn't that right?

52
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,096
Yes, that's right.

53
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:44,797
I decided to come along

54
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,967
because I wanted to learn
the secret of her beauty & longevity!

56
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,201
Oh I/get it!

57
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,504
You want to snare Heiji
with those secrets, eh?

59
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,505
Shh!

60
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,340
Don't talk so loud!

61
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,644
You've got to be kidding me!

62
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:04,884
I hope you're not going to tell me
our job is to find a mermaid!

64
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:06,918
It's just the opposite,

65
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,122
there were only 3 lines
in the letter giving us the job...

67
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,424
and the writing was shaky...

68
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,561
This is what it said,
The mermaid will kill me...

70
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,129
help!

71
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:18,930
A mermaid...

72
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,399
Is going to kill someone?!

73
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,268
Yawn...

74
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,637
Hey, this is serious!

75
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,272
Give me a break,

76
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,107
mermaids only exist in fairy tales,

77
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,542
don't expect me to take you seriously.

78
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,745
I don't. believe they really exist either,

80
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,283
the name in the letter got my attention.

81
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,418
The envelope was addressed to me but

82
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:43,389
the letter was written to Shinichi Kudo!

84
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,292
You should be thanking me!

85
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,929
It might be somebody from your past,
that's why I brought you along!

88
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,100
did you contact the person
who sent the letter to confirm it?

90
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,301
Yes.

91
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,837
The sender, Saori Kadowaki,

92
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:00,906
wrote the number for her cellular phone
on the letter!

94
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,977
No one answered after the second time
I called,

96
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,980
but the first time I called someone
answered and hung up immediately.

98
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:09,782
On that first call though,

99
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,650
I can still hear

100
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:13,619
the sound coming from
the other side of the receiver...

102
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,387
It was the sound of waves

103
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,590
and a woman moaning...!

104
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,792
It couldn't be...do you think it was her?

105
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,326
Maybe the mermaid already killed her.

106
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:26,532
What?!

107
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,401
Saori Kadowaki is missing?!

108
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,069
Yes,

109
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,606
it seems she hasn't shown up for work
for the past 3 days.

111
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,076
3 days ago,
that's about when I got the letter.

113
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,379
Her neighbors are saying

114
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,448
that she might have gone
to the main island:on the ship though.

116
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,116
Sir, it's almost time!

117
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,651
Yes, be right there!

118
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,653
Well,-I've got to go prepare for the festival.

119
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,189
Festival...

120
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:55,194
Today's the day of the "Dugong Festival".
It's the island's annual celebration!

122
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,329
If you:want-to know more about it,

123
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,667
go to the gift shop Saori worked at,
it's right at the corner!

125
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,403
Mermaid amulets... mermaid straps...

126
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,674
wow, they've even got dugong cakes!

127
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,544
This island's really got every
mermaid item in stock.

129
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,080
What's a dugong. anyway?

130
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:15,915
Well. uh...

131
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,117
It's a mammal that lives in the ocean,

132
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,852
some people say that
that's the model for the mermaid.

134
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,189
They used to live in the southern part
of Japan too, long ago. and it was

136
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:27,126
believed that their meat was medicinal
and could make you live a long life.

138
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,128
Dugong arrow...

139
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:29,895
Yes sir.

140
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,830
It's a charm to keep you young forever,

141
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,135
only 3 are given away,
once every year at the "Dugong Festival

143
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:40,472
Saori was presented with 1 lastyyear
but she said she lost it

145
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,075
and she has been terrified since last week...

146
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,844
She said the mermaid would curse her.

147
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,713
That's hard to believe...a mermaid...

148
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,616
Mermaids do exist.

150
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,785

I don't blame her for running away,

who wouldn't be afraid of
the mermaids curse

175

That's Naoko, she & Saori have been

And who is this holy person?

180

She's the star of the festival

181
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,083
as well as the symbol of our island,

182
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,318
she's old lady Shimabukuro!

183
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,489
So tell me, how old is
the old lady anyway?

185

There's some that say she's a hundred,
some say she's 200...

Just because she's a little older than :40',
most, everyone exaggerates so much. 77

A little older...

She belongs in
the Guinness Book of World Records.

228

where is this very old lady anyway?

229
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,635
She's in her room,

230
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,638
blessing the arrows to be presented
at today's festival.

232
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:20,739
Then, you mean,

233
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,442
she really eats dugong meat?!

234
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:23,942

There's no such things as mermaids!

Heh?

239
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,853
That story's a complete lie!

240
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,823
B, but what about the Dugong Arrow...

241
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,425
My late mother told me

242
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,227
that it was originally a protection amulet

243
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:48,634
but the people on the island went &
started to call it dugong arrow instead.

245
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,470
You've lost your mother?

» a WD
1 CO.

248
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,174
She was lost{at sea 5 years ago,
along 'with my father.

250
00:07:55,742 --> 00:08:00,512
And it seems my grandparents
were also lost at sea before I was born.

252
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,614
How awful,
you lost your whole family to the sea,

254
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,149
there must be something behind it.

255
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,251
That's nonsense!

256
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,188
Saori and I went to the main island
by boat just recently

258
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,622
and nothing happened.

260
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,025
You went with Saon?

261
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,360
When was that?

262
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,228
4 days ago.

263
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,798
I had a dentist appointment
andfasked her to come with me.

265
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,634
There's no dentists on this island.

266
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,371
Was there anything strange
about her that day?

268
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,474
She was very scared
because she lost the dugong arrow.

270
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,809
She thought the mermaid would curse her.

271
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,980
No matter how hard I tried to convince her
nothing would'happen, she wouldn't listen.

273
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,915
You're so stupid.

274
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,550
She wouldn't listen

275
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,120
because you don't believe in
the holy:ones:powers, isn't that right?

277
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,254
Toshimi?

278

She really ate dugong meat!

289
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:47,860
Well, actually,

290
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,196
about 3 years ago, the carcass of
a real dugong did wash up.

292
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,766
A dead dugong?!

293
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,303
Oh, wasn't it on television
about 3 years ago?

295
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,273
The media played it up a lot.

296
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,609
You don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,210
You saw it, didn't you?

298
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,748
The bones were crushed in
a very strange way. It was grotesque...

300
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:10,816
That's enough, Toshimi!

301
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:12,518

302
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,621

You might learn something if
that drunkard father lets you in, that is...

319
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,168
Nobody seems to be very worried.

320
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,938
That's because Saori fought with
her father a lot and she'd often runaway. 4's

322
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,575
Would you mind taking us
to Saori's home?

324
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,743
I don't mind.

325
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,577
But it'll have to be after the festival.

326
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,481
What do you do at the festival?

327
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,984
Lottery tickets are sold beforehand

328
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,320
and if their numbers match the numbers
my great-grandmother picks,

330
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,721
they get an arrow.

331
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,591
It's like lucky number drawing.

332
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,259
Oh, that's right!

333
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,995
Would you like to try your luck?

335
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,632
An elderly couplessuddenly
cancelled this. morning

337
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,167
so there are 2 extras.

338
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,272
If you say so...

339
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,610
Whether you win or lose,
it's all up to the Gods!

341
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:17,516
Maybe, you'll be able to obtain eternal
youth and beautydjust like the rumors.

343
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,896
I'm kind of excited.

344
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:31,897
Me too!

345
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:43,075
Mikoto Shimabukuro (130)

346
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:44,710
It's the holy person!

347
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,012
The holy person is making
her appearance!

349
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,981
That's the holy person...

350
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,183
She's so tiny.

351
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,853
It's just an old lady
wearing heavy makeup.

353
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,129
She set fire to the door!

354
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,178
I get it.

355
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,983
The fire burns
the winning number onto the door.

357
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:25,984
I... don't believe it...

358
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,219
Am I seeing things?

359
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,221
I did it, what luck!!

360
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,622
Oh well...

361
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:32,257
Ra, Ra, Ra, Ran...

362
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,194

363

364
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,734
Attention winners.

365
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,505
The dugong arrows will be
presented to you in an hour.

367
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,308
Please proceed to
the Mermaid's Waterfall!

369
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,849

That's strange...

398

I could've sworn that other girl won too.

399
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:19,938
Yeah...

400
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,873
and I don't see her around here.

401
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,308
At this time, however...

402
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,645
she was already

403
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,914
here at the Mermaids Waterfall.

404
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,150
Show these 3 with the divine light!

405
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,791
Hey. What's that?

406
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,026
What is that?!

407
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,565
That's right...

408
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,201
Iong, black hair wafting...

409
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,005
on a slim body that sways...

410
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,740
it most certainly looked like

411
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,476
a mermaid swimming up
the waterfall,

413
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,878
shiny & blue...

414
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,648
but it was a lifeless body...

415
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,558
To, Toshimi...

416
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,527
Do you think she killed herself?

417
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,862
R was she murdered...

418
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,464
Maybe it's neither...

419
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,901
the rope that's around her neck is

420
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,171
the one that's used to rope off
the dangerous areas along the river.

422
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,106
What did you just say?

423
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,343
- - - 37 am -_
I OCC...

425
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,611
So it happened like this,

426
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,314
it was dark & Toshimi tripped

427
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:39,451
she grabbed the rope
but the current was too strong

429
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:40,652
so the nails came loose

430
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,556
and as she fell,
the rope got tangled around her neck!

432
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,858
But don't you think that's strange?

433
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,262
The festival was still going on
around the bottom of the waterfall.

435
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,731
So what did she go into the forest for?

436
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,401
Maybe she was looking for
the mermaid's grave?

438
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,269
What?!

439
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:01,039
The mermaids grave Is
somewhere in this forest...

441
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,141
on the night of the festival 3 years ago,

442
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,077
a fire burned the shrine's storage house,
that's how

444
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:08,714
the mermaids bones were found. They
were buried somewhere in this forest.

446
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,818
Yes, I remember she was always talking
about that grave...

448
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,152
Hold on a minute!

449
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,587
You all talk about a mermaid

450
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,755
but how do you know
they were a mermaid's bones?

452
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,623
Well...

453
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,359
all the people on the island said they were

454
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:23,562
but the policeman from the main land said

455
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,430
the bones were those of
a middle aged woman.

457
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,465
That's a lie!

458
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,401
He said he couldn't be sure if there were
bones from the lower part of her body!

460
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,570
The lower part of her body...?

461
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:36,608
He main beam from the storage house
burned and fell on the lower part of her body

463
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,044
but when the beam was lifted off,

464
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,714
there were no bones
for where her legs should have been.

466
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,216
Th, that's hard to believe!!!

467
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:46,084
Thanks to that fact,

468
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,020
the media made a big fuss broadcasting
that a mermaid's body was found.

470
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,857
And our holy person became famous!

471
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,094
But didn't the police say it was a lady?

472
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:56,895
Yes...

473
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,999
they said probably tourists who didn't
win one of the dugong's arrows

475
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,536
snuck into the storage house
Iooking for an extra arrow

477
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:09,975
and the fire was caused when the candle
In the storage house was lit.

479
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,212
A year went by and
it was still unidentified

481
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,749
so we went and buried it...

482
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,684
The problem started after that.

483
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,286
Problem?

484
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,554
Grave robbers...

485
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:23,555
What?

486
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:29,661
Stupid tourists started coming around
trying to dig up the bones.

488
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,465
It seems they heard that mermaid bones
were the elixir of eternal life.

490
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,401
That's why my great-grandmother
asked someone

492
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,538
to help and they reburied
the bones here secretly.

494
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,174
Who did she ask?

495
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,208
I don't know.

496
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:46,778
All she said was that it was
someone she trusted very much.

498
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,883
Well, whether it's suicide,
murder or an accident,

500
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,052
we'll continue this conversation

501
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,955
after the police have arrived
and we've taken her body down.

503
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,256
Humph...

504
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,125
If it was murder,

505
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,793
then it's partly Toshimi's fault too,

506
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,930
coming to a place like this
at this time of night.

508
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:09,167
Aren't you the cold one,
your fiancee just died.

510
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,902
Fiancee?

511
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,039
Our parents arranged that on their own.

512
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,373
I never proposed to her.

513
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,611
Besides, both my father and mother
are no longer alive.

515
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,415
Toshimi!

516
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,116
Toshimi!!

518
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,818
Ioshimi!

519
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,453
Who is:that?

520
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,888
That's Toshimi's father.

521
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,624
Mr. Ebihara,
the head of the fisherman's union.

523
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,892
Dad!!

524
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,327
Uhuh...

525
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,029
did you call the Fukui prefectural police?

526
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,131
They said the seas are too rough

527
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,001
and they won't be able to
come until the water calms down!

529
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,603
You've got .to beikidding.

530
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,304
Hey. lucky:for us!

531
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,072
Huh

532
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,775
The murderer can't get off
the island either.

534
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,611
What do you mean, murderer...

535
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,847
we don't know for sure yet
that she was murdered.

537
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,782
Then take a look at it!

538
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,084
A swim ring?

539
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,654
Heiji & I found it,
It was stuck in the middle of the river

541
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,457
that joins the water from
the waterfall to the ocean!

543
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,260
If Toshimi was knocked unconscious

544
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:11,329
then she's put on the swim ring and set
afloat, with the rope winding her neck,

546
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,431
she'd end up hanging from the waterfall,
wouldn't she?

548
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,969
We saw Toshimi at the shrine
2 hours before the fireworks went up!

550
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,172
It doesn't take an hour to get
to and from the top of the waterfall...

552
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,041
which means,

553
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,078
anyone could have committed the crime,
man or woman...

555
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,049
and the murderer is still on the island!!

557
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,985
Th, that's terrible.

558
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,020
Don't worry about it!

559
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,954
The murderer will be caught in no time!

561
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,858
When Heiji moves his hat around,
he's turned his switch on!

563
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,627
He's ready to go!

564
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,929
Wow...

565
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,630
But...

566
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,098
you must've fallen in love with him.

568
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,736
I'm no match for you...
we ecome rivas...

571
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,873
Ka, Kazuha...

572
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,641
you're so sweet!

573
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,110
Hey, what're you doing?!

574
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,011
Listen...

575
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,180
if Toshimi was murdered,

576
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,416
you'd better not let that person
out of your sight.

579
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,353
I'm talking about Saori's drunk of a father.

580
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,655
Excuse me,

581
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,589
would you like to go to Saori's home now,

582
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,492
I'll take you-since I promised you earlier.

583
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,460
With him in that condition,

584
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,929
I doubt he'll be much help though.

585
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:18,897
You may be right.

586
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,464
Alright then...

587
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:20,899
Huh 7

588
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,368
I'd like to meet the holy person!

589
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,569
Sure,

590
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,037
I don't mind, but?.

591
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,277
Boy this house is old...

592
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,280
#it doesn't look like they're making too
much money from those dugong arrows.

594
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,315
How can you say that?

595
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,718
Those platelets cost 5 yen a piece.

596
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,286
Eh? 5 yen?

597
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,954
The people on this island said the price
has been the same

599
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,356
since they can remember.

600
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,858
There are 108 number platelets
in a huge box

602
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,428
& everyone lines up then pulls one out.

603
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:54,733
Then the old woman picks
E winning num ers.

606
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,902
What's taking that old lady
so long anyway?

608
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,170
Kimie said she'd tell her
we want to see her

610
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,106
but she might be tired
after today's festival,

612
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,275
so we may not be able to see her...

613
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:05,377
Huh

614
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,779
What is that sound?

615
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,218
Ah?!

616
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,589
Are you the ones who want to see me?

617
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,793
Without makeup, she looks like a spook.

618
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,962
Uh, excuse me...

619
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,600
we wanted to know
how you picked the winning numbers.

621
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,904
I just pick them randomly.

623
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,610
Once I used the numbers of the horses
that won at the races.

625
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,278
I don't believe this.

626
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:45,116
So why don't you sell more instead
of being so stingy and selling only 37

628
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,385
That can't be helped...

629
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,456
the hair I tie to the arrow is my own
& ll don't have a whole lot.

631
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,091
Great grandmother!

632
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,360
Your bath is ready!!

633
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,396
Excuse me,

634
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,798
if that's all you came here for,

635
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,333
I'm going to take a bath now & go to bed.

636
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,069
Wait, I'd like to ask.you more...

637
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,037
Alright then, you girlie...

639
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,339
You, the one with your hair tied back.

640
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:10,341
Who, me?

641
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,379
The dugong's arrow is
really a charm to ward off evil...

643
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,382
if it leaves your body,
evil will overtake you

645
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,319
men will return to the soil
and become heartless demons,

647
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:26,156
Women will return to the water
and become silent mermaids.

649
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:30,095
You must never let it leave your person.

650
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,172
Even her voice sounds wrinkly,
\ andsshe's so pale!

652
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,174
She looks like
she could drop dead any minute.

654
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,978
The next day

660
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,882
I'm glad I brought my school uniform
withfme, it's coming to good use.

662
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,951
Arelyou sure this is OK...

663
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,419
Won't they mind having
us show up like this? ¥ .

665
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,987
No problem!

666
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,022
It's a small island, this'll be
) the perfect time to question everybody.

668
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,426
Stop smiling like that!

669
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,294
This is Toshimi's wake!

670
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,662
Oh, sorry...

671
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,131
Kazuha, -

672
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,299
\did you bring the arrow with you?

673
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,468
Yes! I certainly did!

674
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,503
Hun?

678
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,438
It's that drunk...

680
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,672
he's already here.

681
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:23,114
Why Mr. Mourt,
I'm surprised you all came.

683
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,749
Yes, well...

684
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,851
by the way,

685
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,722
I understand that Mr. Kadowaki
didn't go home last night.

687
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,056
That's right...

688
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,360
But I heard he got into a fight
with a tourist at a bar.

690
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:38,930
So he was drinking all night, huh?

691
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,134
I don't see Naoko around.

692
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,802
Her name was on the
sign-in sheet though.

694
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,272
Eh? Naoko's here?

695
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,807
She's probably in the restroom!

696
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,676
We'll go check

00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:52,743

1 CD,

699
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:53,711

Eeek!!

701
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,822
Don't tell me you're afraid of thunder?

702
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,357
No, it's not that...

703
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:07,759
someone's out there.

705
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,530
Y, you're right!

706
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:13,798
What's going on?

707
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,066
Oh, Heiji!

708
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,668
Somebody's out there!

709
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,468
Are you sure?!

710
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,240
