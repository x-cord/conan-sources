1
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,520
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,722
His name is"Detective Conan

4
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:39,905
oh Ws TEA ws
- Wa Em Yh

6
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,174
Really look at the huge
number of helicopters.

8
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,911
More than the helicopters, the number of
onlookers is even more surprising!

10
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,647
They should've put up a KEEP OUT sign.

11
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,083
Uncle had them come in deliberately

12
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,952
because he wanted the arrest scene
of the Thief Kid

14
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,354
to be complemented by genuine extras.

15
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,757
Come to think of it, the advertisement for
introducing that large museum

17
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:08,660
as well as the special programywas
really flashy and filmed from the air...

19
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,664
But, wouldn't it be difficult
to find Thief Kid among this large crowd?

21
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,535
Don't worry,
he has special seats reserved for us!

23
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,571
Ms. Sonoko Suzuki,
we've been waiting for you...

25
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:20,539
Thank you!

26
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,342
Please follow me,
everyone to the seat over that way.

28
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,511
Hey. hey. is this for real?!

29
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,346
This is the roof!!

30
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,584
Wouldyou like anything to drink?

31
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,552
We'll leave it up to you...

32
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,122
For the first time,
she kind of looks like a richlittle lady...

34
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,860
This certainly is the roof of the building
near where Thief Kid appeared,

36
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,496
because the only ones here
beside us are the security guards...

38
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,498
I still don't understand.

39
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,001
I looked through the image
the helicopter sent afterwards,

41
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,421
but there was nothing strange in it...

42
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,641
Moreover, he vanished: in midair.

43
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,142
Just.how on earth didlhe: 27

45
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:57,976
Kyan!

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,412
I'll go get it!!

48
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:01,880
I'm sorry

49
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,018
A scratch?

50
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,519
It seems like something got stuck here...

51
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,422
And it's still new!!

52
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,658
Do.you see what I see?!

53
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,661
A-multitude off helicopters are
practically{covering the entire sky!!

55
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,064
And look at the many security guards
that are positioned all through the vicinity!!

57
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:21,266
This is it deed a handpicked
unit of security guards

59
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,968
that. the Suzuki Financial Group
has gotten together

61
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,436
with their heart and soul
to maintain their prestige!

63
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,940
Will he really appear under
such tight security?

65
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,210
The one who forewarned that
he would steal Blue Wonder

67
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,579
that is decorated on the roof
of the great Suzuki Museum...

69
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,080
Thief Kid!

70
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,882
He'll come, he'll come

71
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,150
of course. he'll come!!

72
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,219
It sure doesn't sound like a remark
that would come out of

74
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,387
the, mouth of a little lady
of the Suzuki Financial Group

76
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,722
whose treasure is the target of a theft...

77
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,924
But. he's the Thief Kid.wyou know!

78
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:49,394
/If just this once
I'd sure like to see himsin person!

80
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:54,099
I actually wanted to hold
the Golden Goddess statue

84
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,169
with a lot of gemstones on it
that is on the roof, but

87
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,938
Uncle Jirokichi wouldn't let me!!

89
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,207
Of course: he wouldrilt let you

90
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,445
Don't tell me you wished that.he would take
you away with him, gemstones and all...

92
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,613
Right. exactly

93
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:12,784
and Makoto would come to rescue me,
who is being held captive...

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,056
Il. Sonoko wouldn't know what to do @
with two men fighting over me

97
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,358
Har ha...

98
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,263
I guess all this abnormal security
around here can't be helped...

100
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,732
After all he declares that he is coming
to check the place out last night

102
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,968
and appears by the building
right besides this one floating in midair.

104
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:34,006
He walks in midair and closes In
Nn the museum...

106
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,307
Then. he suddenly vanishes...

107
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,909
I guess it's understandable, since he is the
great thief that they are all trying to arrest.

109
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,347
Really, he-was walking in midair
as though there wereyno.tricks involved

111
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,316
I'm sure that there are
tricks and magic.involved.

113
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,117
Huh?

114
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,620
Because if people can
so easily walk in midair,

116
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,088
it would:surprise the birdies. right?

117
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,758
B.Birdies=he says...

118
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,861
My. what a cute-thing to say. Conan.

119
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,197
Maybe the-remark was a bit too childish...

120
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:03,869
Phooey! Brat, let Thief Kid's magic
surprise you and the birdies!

122
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,338
H.don't Know what trick
he used yet, but the marks that

125
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,574
he left behind when he set up
the trick. may be found.

127
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:14,379
See! The scratch on the wall over there
Iooks as if something was hooked on!

129
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,417
The scratch is still new so it could be
something that Thief Kid left behind...

131
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,086
iawand + sdunanfntne ong ignited
Well?...

133
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,122
Huh? There's one over that side too?

134
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,691
Are you sure that there's a mark that

135
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,693
Iooks similar on the
building on your side too?!

137
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,162
Es, a brand new scratch...

138
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,564
But. I wonder what the mark is?

139
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:37,069
Maybe he hooked a wire up from
this building to the other?

141
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,671
Thief Kid probably did so to put people

142
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,907
under the illusion that he
was floating in midair!

144
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:47,446
No way! Inspector Nakamori who climbed
the other building last night said that

146
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:51,216
there were no wires or anything like that!

147
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,552
Besides, if he's suspended
from something like that,

149
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,786
he wouldn't be able to walk.

150
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,321
Oh right!

151
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,058
Hey. maybe he set up a device
to project a 3-D image?

153
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,927
And. that's what left the traces?

154
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,597
See, if he projected from two sides,
this side and that side...

156
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:06,998
Impossible. He couldn't have
done something like that

158
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,667
with the technique of this day and age.

159
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,637
It's impossible to project such a
clear moving 3-D image

161
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,439
In a space where there's nothing!

162
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,442
Then, do you know how
he carried out the trick, dad?

164
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,344
Sort of!

166
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,346
What kind of trick did he use?

167
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,417
When people think that something is not
there, they have a way of not being

169
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:30,155
able to see it because of the influence
of preconceived ideas, even if it's there!

172
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,923
reconceived ideas...?

173
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,724
And?

175
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,026
And just what is that something
supposed to be...

177
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,628
'l':
Wellsfor example...

180
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,431
A super huge hard glass!!

181
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:44,469
He placed it over one building
to the other and:walked on it!!

183
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,805
Inspector Nakamori
probably didn't notice it

185
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,108
because he didn't think
that the glass was there!

187
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,010
It could be that the scratch was made

188
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,480
when the equipment that held the
glass in place was removed...

190
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,317
If such a glass were there,
somebody is bound to have seen it!!

192
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,752
T.That's why...

193
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,054
In the first place, how would
he have brought something

195
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,357
as large as that along. and
then put it away as well?

197
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,160
T.That's why I said. It could be that...

198
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,263
Not being able to see it because
of preconceived ideas?

200
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,332
Kid. Kid, Kid...

201
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,751
In.Inspector Nakamori, so many
people are flowing in that

203
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:19,971
it's impossible to keep checking them!

204
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,574
It seems that the Suzuki Financial
Group passed out a leaflet saying,

206
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,242
Welcome fans of Thief Kid ..*

207
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,977
Passed out leaflets?!

208
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,647
If things are left as is,
a riot may break out...

210
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,550
It can't be helped let them through
without checking them!!

212
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,517
Roger!

213
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,120
He's probably going to come
from the sky anyway!!

215
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,625
Darn!! The security structure
of the police is a mess,

217
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,061
thanks to that attention-craving old man...

218
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,730
You're the owner of the Miracle
of the Ocean, Blue Wonder,

220
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,134
the advisor for the Suzuki Financial
Group Jiro Suzuki, aren't you!!

222
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,902
Indeed!

223
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,405
It's an hour more to go before
the time declared by Thief Kid,

225
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,540
but are you more than
prepared to take him on?!

227
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,444
It seems that he put on a
cheap magicishow last night

229
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,147
but tonight I shall be
the one to put on a show...

231
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,049
I'll show you all a dramatical arrest that

232
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,816
will make Hollywood movies
Iook like child's play!!

234
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,218
You seem so confident...
will make Hollywood movies
Iook like child's play!!

237
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,421
You seem so confident...
Gee. Uncle is-really out for the kill

239
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,156
Lets take a'short commercial break then

240
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,092
The new talk of the town that has opened
in Shiodome, bringing along with it

242
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,362
the fragrance-of history and culture
is the Great Suzuki Museum.

244
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,799
We invite you to come visit.
Hey, hey, even the commercial
is about the museum?

247
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,037
It's a tie-up. you-know, a tie-up.
Uncle never misses chances like these!

249
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,474
Even this-aerial film is abut and paste of
what he used in the special program

251
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,777
Though he may not look it.
He's quite thrifty!

253
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,614
Oh, please come quickly,
my dear Thief Kid

255
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,682
and please steal my
passionate heart away!

257
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,452
What's the use seeing him
a noisy placelike this.

259
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,255
\besides...the wind's so strong too.

260
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,755
Wind ?

261
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:45,490
What's the matter?

262
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,760
I'm going over to where
Uncle Jirokichi is for a while.

264
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,394
Huh ?

265
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,663
I just realized something interesting!

266
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,632
Just what is that interesting thing...?

267
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,467
It's arsecret!!

268
00:08:55,468 --> 00:09:00,672
What?! Show you the film
of yesterday's Thief Kid again!

270
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:03,909
Yep, Mr. Mouri insisted that I
Iook at it no matter what...

272
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,013
Sonny! You watched it more than
enough last night, didn't you?!

274
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:12,817
Besides. it's already been sent to the staff
that are making his autobiographic movie.

276
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,986
What?!

277
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,422
Well. but the film will eventually...

278
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:21,359
be submitted to the police afterwards...

279
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,496
After all, Thief Kid has never come to
check any place out like he did last night,

281
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,332
ever before in the past...

282
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,100
Come to think of it, he's right.

283
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:32,671
I wonder why Thief Kid
put on such a demonstration?

286
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,241
It's less than a.minute to go before
the time declared by Thief Kid.

289
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:40,028
The Thief Kid fans who have gathered
here are starting to countdown!!

291
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,481
Let's all watch this
miraculous moment too!!

293
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,983
Phooey. he won't come.

294
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,084
Huh /

295
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,254
No magician would ever let
any viewer up on stage

297
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,891
before the show starts and
Iet them surround him

299
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,027
Because he would-be revealing
the secret of his trick that way.

301
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,346
Although he declared
that he would appear

303
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,765
again tonight between
those two buildings.

305
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,169
Where the eyes of all the spectators are
on him and the wind of the helicopters

307
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,008
are going to blow his hand
glider out of control,

309
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,612
he willinot appear!

310
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,514
Well, if-he's a long-nosed
goblin or a mountainhermit,

312
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,216
32, 9
it may be a different story.

315
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,985
Aha, ha, ha, ha. ha.

316
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,586
Huh 2!

317
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,000
T. Thief Kid!!

318
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:43,575
It's Thief Kid. He's appeared just now,
as he has declared he would!!

320
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,677
Kyah~! Thief Kid!

322
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,045
I\ll .
H.He's come!!

324
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,546
He's really floating in midair?!

325
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,018
It.It can't be. How and where on
earth did he appear from?!

328
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,224
Oh no. It's started to rain.
Cover the equipment!

330
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,158
Rain.

331
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,360
Hey. oh no?! Rain.

332
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,428
What a time to rain?!

333
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:08,767
Despite the sudden rain,
the call for Thief Kid goes on!!

336
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,170
Hey. what's the matter?
Chopper #7. hey?!

338
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,471
What is it?!

339
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,541
The image from chopper #7
was suddenly cut off.

341
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,611
This is chopper #7.
Everything's under control here.

343
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:23,748
The image probably temporarily
went static due to the rain.

345
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,153
0... maybe Thief Kid is making one of
his henchmen send out jamming waves,

347
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,988
and is up to something again.

348
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,390
Huh?! Does Thief Kid have henchmen?

349
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:38,563
Yeah. It is reported to be an aged man or
a young lady or a lot of other characters.

351
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:41,366
But it's certain that he has at least
one person helping him!

353
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,336
Hey. can you hear me all men in the
vicinity, this is Inspector Nakamon!!

355
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:47,706
Check on the double if
there is anyone among

357
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,008
the crowd that is holding
a jamming device!!

359
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,644
That person may be
Thief Kid's henchman!!

361
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,012
He's walking!!

363
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,682
Just like last night,
Thief Kid has begun walking!

365
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,018
Advisor, please tell us what to do.
If things are left as is,

367
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,187
he will surely steal the object this time!!

368
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,757
Phooey! I'm not going to let him steal
anything right before my eyes...

370
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,493
Put the Blue Wonder inside for now!

371
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,627
Yes. sir!

372
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,097
It's his intelligence against mine!

373
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,064
Scratch.

374
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,599
Preconceived ideas.

375
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,935
Wind.

376
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,271
Henchman.

379
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,824
I see. That's the story.

382
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,976
I've figured it out, Thief Kid!

383
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:28,646
The trick that you used to appear
in midair. walk and vanish!

385
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:34,018
I've also figured out how you plan
to steal Blue Wonder now too!!!

387
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,556
Advisor! We've completed putting
Blue Wonder back inside the museum!

389
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,192
Advisor! We've completed putting
Blue Wonder back inside the museum!

391
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,729
Turn off all the lights inside
the museum right away!!

393
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,931
Huh?! All the lights

394
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:53,037
Yeah, he could be monitoring the
image within the museum, right?!

396
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,275
Hey. doing something like that is just
what Thief Kid would love you to do.

398
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,512
Then, Inspector Nakamori, do you have a
better idea on how to stop the great thief

400
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:05,116
who has appeared out of nowhere
as would a mountain hermit,

402
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,387
and close in on us walking in midair?

403
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,023
But just what do you plan
to do turning off the lights

405
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,592
of the museum and taking
the treasure inside?

407
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,163
In other words. the point is
preventing him from stealing it.

409
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:22,200
If the Miracle of the Ocean,
Blue Wonder stays out of his reach,

411
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:22,834
I win.

412
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,551
I win.

413
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,503
I'd like to make a proposal.

414
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,005
In exchange for giving you complete
command of this situation,

416
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:31,893
I would like you to lend me a few of
your men who can be trusted?

418
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,260
My men?

419
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,879
I'm accepting his challenge.

420
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,650
It's a secret strategy that
I stayed up all night thinking up

422
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:44,122
My dear Thief Kid!!

423
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:44,823
Shoots!

424
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,859
The helicopters have finally gone to the
other side giving me a good view of him,

426
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,529
and with the wind out of my way,
I get an even better view but

428
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,998
Too bad he's so far away.

429
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,099
Huh? What the...?

430
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,433
Huh? What the. ?

431
00:13:55,434 --> 00:14:00,188
Thief Kid's less than 100 meters
from his object of target Blue Wonder!!

433
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:03,007
Hey. how're things on your side?

434
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:08,079
Perfect. I'm sure that your
strategy will outfox Thief Kid.

436
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,914
Shh!

437
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:14,118
He may be wiretapping us,
so that's enough.

439
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,789
There's nothing to worry about,
the tricks are more than well set!

441
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,693
All we do is watch how everything
turns out. ha. ha, hat!

443
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,361
Hey. wait a munite!

444
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,465
In.Inspector! There's something
strange about Thief Kid this time.

446
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,733
Huh, what is it?

447
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,070
You see something that looks like a string?!

448
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,204
Really?

449
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,075
Yep. a thing that looks like a thin
string is shining at his shoulders.

451
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:41,746
Hey. jhey. if that's true then
Thief Kid's not walking but

453
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,615
rather is being suspended
from the helicopter?

455
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,251
Isn't there something strange
about Thief Kid?

459
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:50,021
His legs are moving but it looks like
he's being suspended to something.

461
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,458
Hey. chopper #7 that is right above
Thief Kid's head respond!!!

463
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,928
Chopper #7, hey, chopper #77?!

465
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:06,971
He vanished. Thief Kid, just now
He vanished right near the museum!!

467
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,207
It's chopper #7 after all!!

468
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,310
His henchman that was
on board chopper #7

470
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,579
picked him up from within
the curtain of smoke!!

472
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,849
Hey. I hope all your
choppers are numbered?

474
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,318
Oh, yes, sir, near the tail.

475
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,321
All the choppers patrolling
the sky. do you hear me?

477
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,123
This is Inspéctor Nakamori from the
Metropolitan Police Department!

479
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,192
Thief Kid's on board chopper #7
with his accomplice!!

481
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,228
Report the position of
chopper #7 immediately!

483
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,731
Surround it until the police choppers
arrive and don't let them get away!!

485
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,701
This is chopper #14.

487
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,421
Opper verre 0 e wailing
at the main entrance of the museum!!

489
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:43,257
Okay!! Keep an eye on
it and continue pursuit.

491
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:44,676
Roger.

492
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,913
This is chopper #35, chopper #7 is
currently right above Shiodome Park.

494
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:53,251
Hey, hold it! Shiodome Park is
behind the museum. isnt It?!

496
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:57,622
Chopper #28 here, chopper #7 has gone
a long distance off from Shiodome

498
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,023
This is chopper #9.

499
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,592
I verify two chopper #7s in the
foregroOund of Shiodome Park!

501
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:04,195
Hey. hey. what the hell 1s going on ?!

502
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,229
Well...

503
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,866
The number "7" is written on almost
all the tails of the helicopters around!!

505
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,369
Thief Kid probably did this beforehand.

506
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,871
Idiot!! That can't be.

507
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,342
If such a thing were to be done, somebody
would've noticed when boarding!

509
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,377
In.Inspector!

510
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,413
What is it?

511
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,383
There are strange silhouetted figures
in front of the entrance of the museum,

513
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,618
not just one or two figures.

514
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,853
Huh

515
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:32,557
They're my subordinates that I let
into the building a while ago!

517
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,593
Don't tell me that Blue Wonder
IS In the case that

519
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,128
the officer in the middle is holding.

520
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,930
Hey! What do you think you're doing

521
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:42,266
It's like you're letting him
know that you're carrying it.

523
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,304
Hey! What do you think you're doing,
Iet them in nght this minute!!

525
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,406
Don't worry, sir.

526
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,609
This case is empty anyway,
and we're just decoys.

528
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,411
Decoys?

529
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,448
Blue Wonder was taken out from t
he back door of the museum

531
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,451
in a trash bag by Jiro Suzuki
disguised as a sanitation man.

533
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,503
Huh?

535
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,229
Fuh, fuh, fun...
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

537
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,531
What's so funny?

538
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,300
111181 'KT

539
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,703
What a crazy thing to say.

540
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,906
I laughed because I was able to ¢
protect that treasure from Thief Kid.

542
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:25,676
You fool! I saw right
through you the minute

544
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,879
you came to the museum
today on this motorbike.

546
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,418
It's the same today. but you didn't have
your goggles on, back then either.

548
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,387
It would be pretty difficult
for one wearing contact lens

550
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,822
to ride a motorbike without goggles.

551
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,725
The wind would hurt your eyes
and you'd be in tears.

553
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,063
That is, even if you had a windshield,
it would be difficult to ride a motorbike.

555
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,466
Well, despite being super rich,
the old man goes riding

557
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,836
around on this flashy motorbike
without any bodyguards.

559
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,038
You'd have had more
than enough opportunity

561
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,339
to put him to sleep somewhere
and switch places with him.

563
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,643
By the way, I took the dog Lupin

564
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,280
that was riding in this side car
to a shade in Shiodome Park.

566
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,415
I'm pretty sure he's still asleep though.

567
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,684
Because of the sleeping
drug you made him sniff.

569
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,618
Ha, ha, ha

570
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,788
how could I be Thief Kid!

571
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:15,827
I was right beside you when
Thief Kid appeared just a while ago too!

573
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:20,464
The same goes for last night when
he miraculously walked in midair!!

575
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,067
That was no miracle.

576
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:27,004
It's a simple trick that can easily be
carrie ou wi Yan assis an .

578
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,406
Although the men are efficient members
of the Suzuki Financial Group,

580
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,275
they're not from the police or the military!

581
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,046
It shouldn't be too hard to mix
one of your men among the

583
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,781
bunch of professionals that were
hired on a temporary basis.

585
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:42,386
You suddenly appeared last night
in midair between the buildings,

587
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,756
and brushed away our doubts about
you having been suspended

589
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,392
by something by making ashelicopter
past over your head.

591
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,762
After that, when the police and I
ran up to the roof of the building.

593
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,964
All you had to do was make us confirm

594
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:55,500
that there were no wires connected
between the buildings.

596
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:58,669
Since it would really make it look
as if you werelfloating in; air!

598
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,741
But.if. the.pilot of.the.helicopter.that flew
over your headwere your assistant.

600
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,510
It's super easy to explain!!

601
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,512
First of all, you fly on
board the helicopter,

603
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,114
over to the two buildings you'll
be using to carry out your trick,

605
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,819
and hook the tip of one side of the wire
onto the roof of one of the buildings.

607
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,522
Then, with the helicopter, you land
on the roof of the other building,

609
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,758
hooking the wire onto {
he roof of that building.

611
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,793
You connect the wires from
one building to the other,

613
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,631
then use the pulley that is attached
to your body, and move to the center.

615
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,835
Then you take off the black outfit
you were wearing together

617
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,338
with the curtain of smoke. and
dispose of it. Then Thief Kid appears!

619
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,775
Your henchman comes immediately with
the helicopter and flies over your head.

621
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:42,647
The fish line-like thin wire that you
connected yourself to the helicopter

623
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,650
with before; getting off.is:pulled
until it is taut and wound! up!

625
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:48,352
After.that you removed the
pulley from your+body:

627
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,323
and made the helicopter swiftly collect the
wire that you hooked onto both buildings.

629
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,092
As a result, it would look
as if you're floating in midair,

631
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,062
whether viewed from the top or the side.

632
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,498
Then, all that's left for you to
do is to pretend to walk

634
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,934
together with the helicopter
as it moves forward.

636
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:07,538
You used a tape recorder to
create the sound of footsteps.

638
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,041
Matching the sound
from it with your stride.

640
00:20:11,042 --> 00:20:15,079
In order to deceive people from thinking
that you're being suspended.

642
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,348
You used exquisite body performance.

643
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,318
After walking a while, together
with the curtain of smoke

645
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,187
you abandoned your white clothes and
moved the position of the searchlight.

647
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:27,959
The helicopter pulls you up on board,
so it looks as if you vanished in midair!

649
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,895
Well, tonight's Thief Kid was
merely a walking doll

651
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,197
that caught the attention of the police.

652
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,932
You were probably just
pulling the doll in and

654
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,602
together with the curtain of smoke.
All it was doing was hanging in air,

656
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,570
so it was more than obvious
that it was just a doll.

658
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,608
But, you already climbed the building
that Thief Kid was on, didn't you?

660
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,509
If something was suspended
from the helicopter,

662
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,512
no matter how thin the string.
It would've been seen

664
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,915
No. because of preconceived
ideas and the wind!

666
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:55,253
Talk about wretched. The moment
the helicopter flew above your head,

668
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,022
I was convinced that
you weren't being suspended.

670
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,960
I was flustered when I didn't
find the wire on thelroof,

672
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,563
and didn't notice that string

673
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,100
But, the marks were surely
Ieft behind on the roofs of the buildings

675
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,235
The marks left behind by
the hooks that you used beforehand,

677
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,038
when the wires were
collected by the helicopter

679
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:19,010
But, you saw the image of Thief Kid
Iast night time and again, didn't you?

681
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,178
Although it also depends
on the resolution.

683
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,448
If the string is as thin as a fishing line,
you would have to be very near

685
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,518
moreover, view it with the naked eye.

686
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,820
It'd be virtually impossible
to view it on the monitor

688
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,989
The only way the string would show
is the DOWN SHOT image of Thief Kid

690
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:35,009
and the only one who could've filmed this
Is helicopter #7 piloted by your henchman.

692
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,230
If you sent the image that was used
for airing a museum special program

694
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,499
and you added the
image of Thief Kid onto it

696
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,770
and made it look as if helicopter #7 sent it,

697
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,772
the string wouldn't be there

698
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:52,843
That's why when it began to rain your
henchman stopped broadcasting. right?

700
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:57,048
Because on the aerial image back then,
there was no one using umbrellas!

702
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,750
The flashy stunt you put on last night

703
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,053
was to make everyone think
that you were coming from the sky

705
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,721
and loosen the tight
security on the ground.

707
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,857
You probably did so since you planned to
disguise yourself as Jirokichi Suzuki

709
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,059
and come through with no check

710
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,194
But. you goofed

711
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:15,299
when you came with no goggles on
and that image was on the TV screen.

713
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,937
No, it's not that I came with no goggles,
rather, I couldn't put them on.

715
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,841
Because my disguise would come off!

716
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,044
Aren't you worried about your comrade
that's on board helicopter #7

718
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,114
I'm sure the police have
surrounded his craft by now.

720
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,752
No need to worry, because
the police is probably panicked

722
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,622
They're probably flustered
by all the #7 stickers on the helicopters!

724
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,591
All the stickers?

725
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,828
I see... You stuck the stickers
of the real numbers of the helicopters

727
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,264
over the #7 stickers.
Uu wesic erso we rea num ers

729
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,135
were pasted on very lightly
so that the wind would blow them off

731
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:56,640
Yeah.Therefore, the pilots of the
helicopters go on board

733
00:22:56,675 --> 00:23:00,745
unaware they would be mistaken
for being my henchman and chased

735
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,281
In the meantime. my comrade splits
amidst the commotion

737
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:08,452
Indeed the great escape of
the miracle of the vast sky. Blue Wonder

739
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,920
The vast sky?

740
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:13,190
The blue of Blue Wonder is
the blue of the ocean, you know.

742
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,592
It's the same thing.

743
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,361
The blue of the ocean is
the reflection of the blue of the sky, right?

745
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,364
It's the same as the detective and the thief

746
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,733
We seem as different as
are heaven and earth.

748
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,034
If we trace back to the roots

749
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,137
we both force open the door
to what people want to keep secret,

751
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,906
using the key of curiosity. We're both
nothing more than two rude men

753
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,175
You fool!

754
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,845
The sky and the ocean are blue
Aa wk
(ue 00a yl eren quai ies

757
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,448
of the dispersion and reflection of light.

758
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,116
They're not to be thought of as the same!

759
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:42,153
As proof of that, the water
in puddles is not blue, is it!

761
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,588
You got no romance

762
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,758
I can't see through the truth
chasing after dreams, you see

764
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,363
Are you really thinking of nabbing
me with that tranquilizer gun?

766
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,366
If I fall asleep at this speed,
we re going to have an enormous crash.

768
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,069
Don't worry, I won't shoot
until this motorbike stops.

770
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,137
And, as for your custody,
I already contacted Inspector Nakamori

772
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,240
who should be on his way here

773
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,942
Phooey, I'm not stopping!

774
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:07,278
Beside, remember what Gramps
Jirokichi was bragging about?

776
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,317
This motorbike is rigged with
an acceleration function!

778
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:19,290
See you...great detective!
I'll leave that treasure to you!

780
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,760
I wasn't after that treasure
to begin with besides

782
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,180
All I did was
take him on because he challenged me

Huh? Uncle Jirokichisis
