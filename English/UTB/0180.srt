00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:02,468
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,303
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,038
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,974
Today's episode is about
a visitor from France.

7
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,176
The will to kill harmonizes
in the melody of the piano.

9
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,644
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,546
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

12
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:17,416
no case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene.

TA ANA
Nocturne of Red Will to Kill" Part I

The Kana Amusement Group
IS a very big company.
Yoshinori Kana
20 BB BO RAR1G5)

36
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,763
What would the chairman of such
a company want to talk to me about?

38
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:17,837
Well, we're going to be making the
CD of Gerald Tenma at our company

40
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,707
And, we're going to be holding a private
party upon the signing of the contract...

42
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,511
How nice Mr Tenma is finally
going to make his Japan debut?!

44
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:25,745
Do you know him?

45
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,915
Of course! He's a mysterious singer

46
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,952
that is the talk of the French
world of Chanson!

48
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,820
No one knows anything about
his personal history,

50
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,921
isn't that right?

51
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,557
I'm amazed that you know

52
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,494
Ever since the day we decided
on the day of the party,

54
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:45,364
eerie things have been happening
around his wife, Misaki.

56
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,833
Eerie things happening?

57
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,168
Repeated phone calls
without no caller responding.

59
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,571
Rose bouquets sent by
Nn unknown sender...

61
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,674
This letter came with
the bouquet of roses...

63
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,545
Blackmail...

65
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:03,382
Those who do not realize my love,
will surely fall to the pits of hell.

67
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,352
We got the other one yesterday.

68
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,922
Tithe curtains will be opened to
commence the party of revenge

70
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:13,325
Enjoy a part. of terror
0 your heart's content...

72
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,594
The party will be held in three days.

73
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:19,398
We can't cancel it now and
I'm also worried about my wife...

75
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,168
Do you have any idea who this may be?

76
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,438
We are carrying out
contract procedures secretly.

79
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,441
Therefore, the only ones who know that
there is going to be a party are

81
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,710
my wife and I, and the other
four who are scheduled attend...

83
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:38,517
You left me behind all alone,
but I haven't forgotten you still.
Three days later

86
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,220
My eyes are always on you."

87
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:45,524
I hear your'voice and
I am just so delighted.

89
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,692
What on earth is that?

90
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:52,264
Oh come on! It's the Japanese lyrics to
Mr. Tenma's "Nocturne of Red Love!"

92
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:58,637
Uh...? "I'll send you a flower a day."

93
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:05,211
A red:rose, A marigold, a roberia,
a bright red dahlia, and a love song...

95
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,514
You are forever mine."

96
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:13,219
Ugh....1 wonder what she likes
about a song like this?

98
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,057
I'm so happy that.I'm.going to
get to see Mr. Tenma.

100
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,526
Thisvis work now, remember?

101
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,497
We're supposed to be members of the
Morita family, a friend of the chairman,

103
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,698
understand?

104
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:26,599
All right!

105
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,201
I can't have them finding out
that I'm a top notch detective

107
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:32,838
Don'tiworry, because you don't look it!

108
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,810
Really you two better
behave yourselves!!

110
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,745
That's for me to say, not you!!

111
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,920
Wow!

112
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,556
Going from the gate to the
entrance of the house by car,

114
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,825
is like:what I've seen
in movies from abroad!

116
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:02,935
Oh! This is really some house... «

117
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,138
They must be millionaires!

118
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,853
Doesn't it look like a castle that
comes out in horror movies...?

120
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,762
Hunder...

121
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:33,165
It was such a fine day until just
a while ago, and now it's so...

123
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,368
Didn't you want to see Gerald?

124
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,204
Being scared is another thing!

125
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,043
Mr. Morita?

126
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,513

Your wife doesn't like me, does she?

00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,295
Hey...

168
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,734
This is the room right above
the large reception hall.

170
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,303
The room?beyond is the piano room.

171
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,876
H how wonderful...

172
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,246
You even have a spiral
corridor within the house...

00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:06,285
Hmm? This sword...

175
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:06,985

Hey!

178
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,156
Don't you dare touch it!

179
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,426
It's not all that fragile.

180
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,496
Although it's-decoration,
it is made of the same materials

182
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,698
and in the same way as real thing.

183
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,268

This room Is also of good taste

187
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,582
Is this a picture of your wedding...?

188
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:39,818
How beautiful!

189
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,354
It was taken 10 years ago today.

190
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,589
In Fiji...

191
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,891
How nice...

192
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:50,262
We belonged to the same
music club in our university days.

194
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,133
We went steady for a year
and then got married.

196
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,668
My, how I envy you.

197
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,880
H... Hello?

00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,192
Hello}...

201
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,260
It hung up...

202
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,164
Does this. kind of thing happen often?

203
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,734
Yes .
In a hoarse man's voice, things like

205
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,403
Mon amie" and "Je taime"
are whispered.

207
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,005
And when I answer,
the phone is hung up immediately.

209
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,642
You have no idea who it is?

210
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,510
That's not all

211
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:43,115
Together with a letter, I got this too...

212
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,286
Was this taken without you being aware?

213
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,621
This is what I found together
with the bunch of Marigold

215
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,757
I found at the front door this morning

216
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,326
This seems to have been
taken yesterday...

218
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:58,997
I feel like someone is always
watching me that I'm scared...

220
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,933
Aftersthe rose-is the marigold

221

an BB 3 #8 (30)

252
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,865
Yoshinori, may I have a word with you?

253
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,133
What is it?

254
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,402
Excuse me.

255
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,938
Please come this way and have a seat.

256
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:15,541
Oh; what delicious looking dishes!

257
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,843
Don't forget why we're here...

258
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,514
Why did you invite outsiders here?!

259
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,384
This is an important time when we
have to sign a contract with Gerald.

261
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,452
The contract?

262
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:32,257
You leave for France your own
and suddenly bring Gerald along...

264
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,895
Thinking of the company, .l don't
see anything wrong in what I did.

266
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,730
For the company, eh.

267
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,767
I guess so, because if
this doesn't work out,

269
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,269
you can't make yourself
Iook good to Misaki.

271
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,138
W...What a thing to say!

272
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,408
I hear you've been making
passes to Misaki persistently!

274
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,376
Who said such a thing?!

275
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,079
How about you and
Ms. Tokudaiji, Yoshinori?

277
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,014
The rumor's going around
all over the company!

279
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,151
Don't be ridiculous! There is nothing
going between her and me!!

281
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:03,989
Anyway! I'm going to make this contract
go through no matter what it takes!

283
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:13,599
Wh 4

284
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,671
It's about time for Gerald to arrive.

285
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,640
I'll go wait for him by the front door.

286
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,609
Et me go with you...

287
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,510
I'll: go.tosthe restroom before that.

288
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,183
Please get the next dish ready will you.

289
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,452
Yes ma'am.

290
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,154
You don't have anything
to drink, Mr. Morita.

292
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,423
I'll go get you some.

293
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,159
Oh, thank you very much.

294
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,430
Will you excuse me
while I go fix my make-up?

296
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,404
Don't drink too*much, Dad.

297
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,005
I know, I know.

298
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,207
Come on!

299
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,308
Um, you know what...

300
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,010
Don't you have to go guard Misaki?

301
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,514
Oh! That's right, Dad.
You've got work to do!

303
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,250
I couldn't possibly go into a room

305
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,918
Ran, you go.

306
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,919
I guess: so.

307
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,355
Oh no! It's a black out!

308
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,659
A thunder bolt probably fell somewhere.

309
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,993
IS is bad...

310
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,597
aaah!

311
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,565
Upstairs?!

312
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,700
Darn!!

314
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,174
Help!

315
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,979
The door ls locked!

316
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,113
Out of the way!

317
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,919
Help!

319
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,457
Hold it!

320
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,558
Misaki!

321
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,462
Here the heck is he...

322
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,299
Where'd it go?!

323
00:13:57,602 --> 00:13:58,704
Misaki...

324
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,540
What's the matter?! Are you all right?

325
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,976
Somebody lowered the breakers.

326
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,211
Misaki!

327
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,480
What's the matter?!

328
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,515
Suddenly somebody attached me!

329
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,087
WwW, What's that...?1

330
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,154
No!!

331
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:17,989
Roberta!

332
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,126
Ust as I thought, this is...

333
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:26,031
Ran, flowers by that name come
out in that song too, don't they?

335
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,267
That song? Oh, "Nocturne of Red Love"

336
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,903
A rose, marigold, roberia...

337
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,373
Which means that all the flowers that
the person had sent up to now are...

339
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,677
I am always wa ching you

340
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:42,514
Hearing your voice delights me...

341
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,083
Are you saying that someone
Is threatening Misaki

343
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,886
according to the lyrics
of Gerald Tenma?!

345
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,154
Threatening?!

346
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:54,726
It means that someone is
stalking your beautiful wife.

348
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,163
Although I know we are all
in the midst of a party,

350
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,766
I'd like to question all of you.

351
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,135
Are you the one who lifted the breaker?

352
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:08,306
Yes! On my way here,
the breaker at thé¥top of the stairs...

354
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,143
Where were you at that time, Hideki?

355
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,845
Mr. Morita, who are you...

356
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:19,684
Oh, excuse me, I am not Morita,
but'Kogoro Mouri, 'a detective.

358
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,952
Kogoro Mourn?!

359
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,554
You mean that famous detective?!

360
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,422
Yes, that's right.

361
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,926
Misaki, you locked the door, didn't you?

362
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,562
Yes, just as I was about to
fix my make-up,

364
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:33,932
the lights went out*and
I was attacked from behind.

366
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,401
You didn't see what the attacker looked like?

367
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:37,602
No...

368
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,038
I did.

369
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,474
I couldn't see very clearly but.

370
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,811
He was wearing a cape
and had a facial expression...

372
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,979
He looked like a foreigner...

373
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,714
Like a foreigner)!

374
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,617
Me? Why Ffierd

375
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,387
Pardon me, where were you:atithat time?

376
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,157
Hwehfito the front door to meet Gerald.

377
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:03,395
The lights went out and I came inside
because it began to rain.

379
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:07,199
I saw Hideki, and heard
a voice scream, "Help!"

381
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,434
We cameihere together.

382
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:14,172
Will you cut it out.
Michelle is an important guest.

384
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,244
Gerald!!

385
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,349
He looks like'the attacker...

386
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:30,622
Let me introduce you, this is our main
guest tonight, Mr. Gerald Tenma!

388
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,992
There seemed to be
no one downstairs so I...
Gerald Tenma
Singe 1

392
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,695
We had a black out here

393
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:39,264
May I speak to you downstairs?

394
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,266
Please come with me too, everyone.

395
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,206
The door of the room was locked...

396
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:52,210
Which means that the attacker
was already in the room.

398
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,547
Everyone who left the large reception
room beforehand had a chance

400
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:59,150
Which means that someone lowered
the beforehand had a chance...

402
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,386
Could there be more than one attacker?

403
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,520
Huh?

404
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,956
What is this a piece of?

405
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,992
The crack is still new...

406
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,728
There are other small debris around.

407
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,133
No, the size is different.

408
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,770
Hmm? What is this a trace of?

409
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:24,108
Where were -you;all"when
the-the incident occurredy

411
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,378
I was in the restroom.

412
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,847
I panicked when the lights went out.

413
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:33,485
I was in the kitchen checking
on the cake Misaki hadibaked.

415
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:37,355
Mr. Tenma, you were
drenched, weren't you?

417
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,625
That's because I got off
the taxi by the gate...

419
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,560
Is that true?

420
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,531
Well, why don't we take a break then?

421
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,334
Excuse me...

422
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,509
Ah! Where's Conan?

423
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,678
Don't tell me he's missing again!

424
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,149
Are you all right?

425
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,920
Can you go and get
medicine from my room?

427
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,755
Yeah, okay.

428
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,927
The picture that was taken last night was

429
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,495
Huh?

430
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,564
Oops!

431
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:23,535
They seemed to have
struggled pretty hard...

433
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,041
Misaki and Gerald Tenma?!

434
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:33,243
This is dated 10 years ago!

435
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:36,848
It's 6 months before Misaki got married!

436
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,216
Hey!

437
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,618
Conan, you going to be
scolded by Dad again!

439
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,320
Uh? What's that...

440
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:45,323
Well, this is, you see...

441
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,791
Show it to me!

442
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,826
Oh, no!

443
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,261
Huh?!

444
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,730
What's the matter?

445
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,468
Oh no!

446
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,739
What is the meaning of this!!

447
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,408
Did you have relationships
with Misaki in the past?!

449
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,442
What shall I do?

450
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,310
Yoshinori, what a rude thing to say!

451
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,379
Hideki!

452
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,414
Don't tell me that you knew about it!

453
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,616
Why would I do such a thing!!

454
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:12,584
Stop it!!

455
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:15,820
Misaki!

456
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,721
Dear...

457
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,158
It true, that before I married you,
I was going with him.

460
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,361
HIS real name IS Junya lenma,
and I used to go with him.

462
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,698
He was a nameless artist back then...

463
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,135
But, on a certain day, 10 years ago,

464
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,170
your suddenly disappeared.

465
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,872
Isn't that right?

466
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,541
When I saw the papers of Gerald Tenma

467
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,676
that we were going
to sign a contract with,

469
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,479
I was surprised to find that
such a coincidence existed

471
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,916
It's been a long time, Mr. Tenma.

472
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:46,651
Eah...

473
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,193
Mrs. Kana, I have a gift for you!

474
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:59,897
It's hand made wine, something
that you cannot get in Japan.

476
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,537
I would like to taste the wine...

477
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,477
There seems to be
nothing wrong with it.

479
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,712
Le «s have juice»

480
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:20,885
Now, let's all have a toast.

481
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,456
Cheers!

482
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,957
Cheers!

483
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,629
She's still on her guard after all.

484
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,399
Yes, this sure is good wine!

485
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,600
Agh!

486
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,968
Oh, excuse me!

487
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,903
No problem

488
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,673
Oh yes! I was baking a cake.

489
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:46,544
Masayo, will you go to the basement
in the yard and get me the silver tea set?

491
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,283
I will serve you all a special
hand-made cake I made.

493
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,985
Please wait a moment.

494
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,823
As one of the conditions of publishing

495
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,659
the "Nocturne of RedylLove
from your.company,

497
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,530
I have slightly changed the lyrics
and"made new arrangements.

499
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,599
One with a new arrangement?

500
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,035
Gerald insisted-on doing so. a

501
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,706
I found this bunch of
flowers at the entrance...

503
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:15,906
Dahlias...

504
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,043
Dahlias stand for betrayal...

505
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,645
Betrayal?

506
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:24,182
Thank you for waiting.

507
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,152
It's secret, everyone.

508
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,291
Mr. Tenma, won't you
play your music for us?

510
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,527
After all, you're here in person...

511
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:37,996
Sure.

512
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,535
You attacked Misaki, didn't you?

513
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,937
Not that again.

514
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,272
Who else but you could've done it?!

515
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,176
I have to make preparations,
so please leave me along.

517
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,610
Don't tell me yousie running away!

518
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,312
Will you cut it out!

519
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,681
They seem to be having an argument.

520
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,216
Let's go check on them.

521
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,153
Gyaaaah!!

522
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,954
It's Mr Tenma's voice!

523
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,429
What's.wrong?!

524
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,099
