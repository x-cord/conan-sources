Here, your ticket!

00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,249
Okay!

10
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,319
You should come with us
to Dolphin Land too, dad.

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,789
I'm not going to no dolphin show!

13
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:26,525
A man's dream is...

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,128
the horse derby!

15
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,066
I'll win really big, and treat you guys
to a gorgeous dinner tonight!

17
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:38,137
Be sure you don't run the household
finances broke, trying to win though!

20
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,741

21
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,877
Yes, yes, bye then!

22
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,680
What did Naomi say?

23
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,414
She wants us to hurry over.

24
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,885
Oh! Two beauties, beauties, beauties!

25
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,691
Wow, are you by chance
Mr. Kogoro Mourn'?!

27
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,160
What? You mean that renown detective?!

28
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,628
Right you are!

29
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,332
Oh god, I can't believe it.
I'm a great fan of yours!

31
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,135
Hey: cut out your rude attitude!

32
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,038
Oh no, she's not being rude at all!

33
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:17,343
We're going to Dolphin Land Hotel,
but where are you headed for, Mr. Mourn?

35
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,411
Well,

36
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,014
what a coincidence
I'm going ot Dolphin Land too...

38
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,083
He's going to the horse race track
next to it.

40
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:29,221
Uh, do you mind if we go along with you?

41
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,958
Not at all, please do!

42
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,492
C,Come now, let's go!

43
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,495
We have one other person with us...

44
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,097
Kuniko!

45
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:39,999

46
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,635
I'm sorry, did you wait long?!

47
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,771
Wow, another beauty!

48
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,173
It's still early.

49
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,240
You're late!

50
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,012
We're riding the monorail
Ieaving at 1:20, aren't we?

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,648
We still have 10 minutes.

53
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,418
Oh? Who is he?

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,955
He is the renown detective,
Mr. Kogoro Mourn!

56
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,757
We ran into him coincidentally!

57
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,996
We used to be classmates
of the same university.

59
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:12,263
We had a class reunion last week,

Which means another beaut. is coming?!

81
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,549
Yes, among all of us, she was the
most popular with boys, a queen!

83
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:32,985
A queen!!

84
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,087
Where, where, where is she?!

85
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,290
She's staying at the Dolphin Land Hotel.

00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,605
Oh, not really...

99
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,374
Oh, he's right,

100
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,942
especially when it comes to you, Kuniko!

101
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,781
You're going independent and opening a
designer's office of your own, aren't you?

103
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,884
Well, sort of...

104
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,887
Wow, that's really something.

105
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,991
I'm the only one who's no more than
just a housewife...

107
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,325
Oh come on,

108
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,462
you went ahead before all of
us and got a happily married life!

110
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,698
Yes, really, look at you, happily plump!!

111
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,534
Oh, cut it out,

112
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,668
You know I'm not happy
about being plump...

114
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:27,740
The train headed for Dolphin Land
will be arriving soon,

116
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,007
Oh, here it comes.
The train headed for Dolphin Land

That's the Dolphin Land Hotel.

129
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,936
They just renovated and
newly opened last month!

131
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,878
Talk about a classical setting...

132
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,681
This is called the retro-floor

133
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,916
Retro-floor?

134
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,719
Yes, the original model of this hotel,

135
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,489
a long-established famous Japanese inn
called lruka-Tel'.

137
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,026
Come, Naomi's room is over this side.

138
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:23,629
Sure thing!

139
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,434
Hey, Kuniko.
What is Naomi's room number?

141
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,870
Room 503.

142
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,705

We made it, it's 2:00 sharp!

145
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:43,015
Don't tell me that Naomi's sleeping,
despite telling us to rush over?

147
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,619
What a girl

148
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,588
Naomi, Naomi?

149
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,824
Now, what do we do?

150
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,493
Oh, the door isn't locked

151
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,862
Let's go inside!

152
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,465
Naomi?

153
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,000
We're coming in...

154
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,171
Oh no,
you don't know them well enough yet!

156
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,439
Hey, what is this?

157
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,313
What's wrong?!

158
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,921
N,Naomi...?!

159
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,123
It can't be 7?!

160
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,091
Please calm down!

161
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,328
Don't touch anything in this room!

162
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,832
I said, don't touch anything!!

163
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,468
It seems to have
switched off automatically.

165
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,504
This TV is coin operated...

166
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,344
Ran, get the police!

167
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,345
OO, Okay!

168
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,820
And, the body was found by you three

169
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,388
and like always,

170
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,025

happened to be here you, Mr. Moun?

Y. Yes, Sir...

173
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,264
I'll have to interrogate you too

174
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,967
Can you wait a while?

175
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,103
I'll act as their bodyguard then!!

176
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,004
No thank you.

177
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,007
Hey, Officer Chiba!

178
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:15,808
Yes!

179
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,543
Take care of the girls, will you?

180
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,145
Yes, sir!

182
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,183
Please come this way.

183
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,120
Hey, Mr. Moun!

184
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,555
Y,Yes sir!

185
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,189
Well, Takagi?

186
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,525
Oh, inspector!

187
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,429
The victim is Ms. Naomi Fujimura, age 27.

Inspector,

197
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,838
I found this in the pocket
of the skirt of the victim.

What, tear gas spray?

203
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,581
Maybe she was a very cautious person

207
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,887
It is strange.

208
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,991
What a place full of things
from olden times.

210
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,328
This is called a retro-room,

211
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,666
It is a replica of the guest room of
an old-established renown Japanese inn.

213
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,868
That's why the TV is coin operated...

214
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:21,407
This is the type that you can watch a for
an hour by inserting a hundred yen coin.

216
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,879
So, the TV switched off as soon as
you all entered the room?

218
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,515
Yes, at about 2:00.

219
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,718

In other words,
the TV was turned on about an hour ago.

238
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,128
What is the estimated time of death?

239
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,398
From between 12:00 noon to 1:00.

240
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,402
So, she was attacked as soon as
the TV was switched on .

242
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:54,006
Um, this candy sure is a rare one, isn't it?

243
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,776
I've never seen candies like these!

244
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,745
Not you again!

245
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:04,983
Soda candy, stringed candy balls,
squid candy and sauce crackers.

247
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,820
All candies that I used to know
when I was a child.

249
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:11,757
These candies come with this room
as snacks to have tea with.

251
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,562
They probably scattered when the killer
and the victim struggled with each other.

253
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,931
This is

255
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,101
Ice cream, although it's already melted.

256
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,569
Ice cream?

257
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,739
She was probably attacked

258
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,442
while she was eating ice cream
and watching TV.

260
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,414
Will somebody check
if there is ice cream in the freezer!

262
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,918
Inspector, there are a few bars inside!

263
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,255
These bars of ice cream
are also very nostalgic.

265
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,191
It seems exactly as you say, Mr. Mourn.

266
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,330
No, this ice cream bar
is not of the olden days!

268
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,799
Did the victim buy it?

269
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,406
What's this? It's wet?

270
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,709
It seems slightly wet here.

271
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:05,744
Wet?

272
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,480
Maybe the water from a vase
spilled or something!

274
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:16,422
You delivered the blouse that had
been cleaned a little before 1:007

276
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:17,689
Yes,

277
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:25,397
But, since the Do not disturb sign
was on the door I didn't go inside...

279
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,435
Was the door locked at that time?

280
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,403
You again!!

281
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,404
Well, come now,

282
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,174
So, was it locked?

283
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,043
I didn't touch the door knob,

284
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,178
sol don't know.

285
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,080
Inspector,

286
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:45,717
the victim's cell phone
was found under the table!

288
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,123
Right, will you check the outgoing calls?

290
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,224
1 CO.

291
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,260
Oh, this is...

292
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,197
Please take a look, Inspector!

293
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,398
11151195 PM1:08
WE Af
02058252805

296
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,133
Kuniko Yamamoto?

297
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:01,433
118198 PM1:08
02058252805

299
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,669
She's one of the three girls...

300
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:09,374
She called out at 1:08,
that's just before she was killed...

302
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,512
Just after Ms. Yamamoto got the call,

303
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:15,347
we ran into them.

304
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,082
I see

305
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:23,589
Yes, it was definitely Naomi telling us
to hurry over to her place...

307
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,391
It shows 108.

308
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:26,725
#8092984503

309
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,894
True...

310
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,597
Where were you then?

311
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,867
At the monorail
station Ichiban-cho.

313
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,170
We were together
with each other from 1:00.

315
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,306
Kanami came 10 minutes late, though...

316
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:43,575
After that,

317
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:44,576
PM 1:20

318
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,912
We got on the 1:20 monorail.

319
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,279
PM 1:20

320
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,949
We arrived at the hotel at about 1:50

321
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,153
We got to Naomi's room at 2:00 sharp.

322
00:10:55,788 --> 00:11:00,792
In other words, the girls have an alibi!

323
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,661
One last thing

324
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,130
Would you please return;
to the scene of the crime again

326
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,566
and explain the circumstances«of
when you discovered the corpse?

329
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,269
1 Co.

330
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,476
No, this ls a well calculated homicide.

331
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,046
If my deduction is correct, she is the one.

332
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,282
But, I don't have evidence...

333
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,551
What was that?

334
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:27,219
That sound of something rubbing -
against something

336
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,222
I see...

337
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,324
The killer still has the evidence...

338
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,494
She IS the killer,

339
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,095
after all!

340
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:46,404
Thank you, everyone,
you can all go for today.

342
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,741
Inspector,
I guess I'll go with the girls and...

344
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,014
Dad?

345
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:00,686
But, on second thought,
maybe not just yet!

347
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:05,457
Inspector, this is a carefully
schemed case of homicide!

349
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,626
What was that?!

350
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:13,098
Moreover, the killer is right here,
among the three girls!

352
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,366
I What?!

353
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,400
It can'tibe!!

354
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,170
The killer is among us?!!

355
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,274
What a thing to say

356
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,112
First the tear gas spray
that Ms. Fujimura had with her.

358
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,383
She had it in her pocket, yet didn't use it,

359
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,820
probably because the the killer
was someone she knew.

361
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,989
Second, is the room key.

362
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,391
The one that is on the table.

363
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,627
Let's say that the killer were a robber.

364
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,896
Wouldn't it only be natural
that the killer would lock the door

366
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:48,233
when fleeing to buy time
to delay discovery of the corpse?

368
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,335
1, True...

369
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,906
But all the girls have an alibi
after 1:00, you know?

371
00:12:55,341 --> 00:13:00,412
The actual time of death
Is way earlier than 1:00.

373
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:04,850
Probably something like 12:20 or so.

374
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,452
How do you explain the TV, then?

375
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,222
It switched off at a little after 12:00,

376
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,791
which means the coin was
inserted a little after 1:00.

378
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,129
One doesn't have to be
in this room to insert the coin.

380
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:17,963
Look,

381
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,599
if the candies that are scattered
about the room are used!

383
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,167
Candies?

384
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,570
Just how do you do that?

385
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,674
I'll explain that right now.

386
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:29,608
Conan!

387
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,076
Yes!

388
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:34,913
» 0 - - > asl

389
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,550
You use this ice cream bar
and candy ball with a string attached!

391
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:40,752
With things like that?

392
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,287
Well, watch!

393
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,389
First you hook the string of the candy ball

394
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,758
to the metal piece by the coin insert slot

395
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,827
As for the bar of ice cream...

396
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,464
Place the channel of the TV on top of
the cabinet to serve as a bridge.

398
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,933
Then one end of the string 4
of the candy ball is

400
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,268
held down by
a packaged bar of ice cream.

402
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,570
Do you have a 100yen, Ran?

405
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,675
Ves.

406
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,610
Can you put it by the coin slot?

407
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:06,645
0O,Okay.

408
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,185
The coin is caught by the string
and cannot be inserted.

410
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,755
After setting all this up,
the killer left the room.

412
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,858
As time passes, the ice cream will melt.

413
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,895
If the ice cream melts, the support is lost
and the string drops to the floor

415
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,401
You see.

416
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,070
I DUE.

417
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,307
Candies were scattered around the TV set

418
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:37,876
was to hide the trick

419
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:39,511
So, it seems...

420
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,949
The channel changer and
the top of the cabinet were wet

422
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,218
because of the ice cream bar
that was left there.

424
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:47,853
Moreover,

425
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,857
that ice cream bar is one
that has recently come on the market,

427
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:55,727
so it's not something that was left here
in the room to begin with.

429
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,764
Naomi.could've bought it-herself!!

430
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:04,469
The killer didn't lock the door
to carry out the trick, you know!

432
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,171
Just what do you mean?

433
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,573
Because if she locked the door,

434
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,177
even if she were to return
here with her friends,

436
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:16,648
she wouldn't be able to show them
the instant the TV switches off!

438
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,150
I see!

439
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:22,087
It would be meaningless unless she
showed somebody the TV switching off!

441
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,990
Which means that the sign
on the door knob was...

443
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,125
The killer probably hung
In on the door knob.

445
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,895
Be it only for an hour and a half,

446
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,899
she had to leave the room with the corpse
inside without locking the door.

448
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,668
Because of course,
if someone enters the room,

450
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,837
everything goes down the drain!

451
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,405
Wait a minute!

452
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,109
I got a call from Naomi at 1:08,
remember!

454
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,410
Right!

455
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,879
If Naomi were killed one hour before,

456
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,781
she wouldn't be able to
make the call, would she!

458
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,683
Right Mr Moun .

459
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,320
Her outgoing and incoming calls
all matched up too!

461
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,789
The killer called

462
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,225
using the victim's cell phone!

463
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,760
What?

464
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,230
But, Kuniko was talking to Naomi and...

465
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:08,934
Don't tell me that...

466
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,903
Right She couldn't have possibly
talked to the victim...

468
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,507
In other words, the killer is you...

469
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,741
Ms Kuniko Yamamoto!!

470
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,645
Kuniko...

471
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,113
No way...

472
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,883
After committing the murder,

473
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,619
You took Ms. Fujimura's cell phone

474
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,691
and went back to Ichiban-cho Station
to join Kaori.

476
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,860
Around 1.00,

477
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:38,463
you then called your own cell phone

478
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,599
from Ms. Fujimura's cell phone

479
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,269
and pretended talking to her.

480
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,737
All you had to do left,

481
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,974
was to return the cell phone to the room

482
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,476
during the commotion
of the body being found

484
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,678
Do you have evidence?!

485
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,715
You've got the evidence, don't you?

486
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:57,582
What?!

487
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,719
The vinyl bag in your pocket.

488
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,690
W, What about it!

489
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,762
You put Ms. Fujimura's cellular in there
and took it out, didn't you?

491
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,397
Is that true!

492
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:13,498
Hey!

493
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,000
Y, Yes, sir!

494
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,772
Please let me check your pocket.

495
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:22,941
H, Hey!

496
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,810
It's here!

497
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,680
Hold it up to the light and look at it!

498
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:29,681
Yes, SIR!

499
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,418
There are several fingerprints...

500
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,956
There is a place where the fingerprints
are bunched up vertically ..-

502
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:40,458
Ms. Yamamoto,

503
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:43,194
when I saw your cellular,

504
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,897
I noticed something interesting.

505
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,033
1A19BPM 1:08
82958252805

507
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:52,871
020582805.

508
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:53,271
11A198PM1.08
02958252805

511
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,642
When you match that up
with the number keys of the cell phone,

513
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,681
onlyythe keys of the center
vertical row are used.

516
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,585
The fingerprints are bunched up vertically

517
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,589
because you pushed
the number over the vinyl bag!

519
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:12,924
What?

520
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,226
Hey! Bring the victim's cellular phone!

521
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:15,927
Yes, sir!

522
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:20,432
It's only natural that the vinyl bag
that was in my pocket

524
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,634
has my fingerprints-on it!!

525
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:24,903
This is the victim's cell phone!

528
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,010
It matches up perfectly!

529
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,353
I couldn't...

530
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:43,588
«forgive Naomi!

531
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,357
Kuniko?!

532
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,258
Why, Kuniko?!

533
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,062
At university graduation{time,

534
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,764
the valedictorian was to be recommended «

535
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,267
to a brand name merchandiserabroad...

536
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,903
Naomi who attained that glory,

537
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,206
succeeded as
a children's clothes designer.

539
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,844
But the fact was, I was the one who was
supposed to get that recommendation!

541
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:08,947
Naomi had the nerve to use
her feminine wiles on the Professor!

543
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,318
I didn't know about it until
the Professor slipped his tongue

545
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,820
and told me about it at a bar
we went to after the class reunion!

547
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,925
But, weren't you going to go independent
and open your own office too?!

549
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,428
I lied...

550
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,364
The truth 1s, I was laid off}

551
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,168
Just because of
one little first time mistake!

553
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,903
Laid off?!

554
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:33,772
I was so vexed!

555
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,509
Thinking why I had to go through all this!

556
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,146
I was made to go through all this just

557
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,348
because of Naomi!

558
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,317
Naomi took my happiness away from me!

559
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,055
Hat's why I . I...

How lucky that there was a night show!

610
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,123
Yes!

611
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,759
And this is the best seat too.

612
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,429
Well, yes, I guess we were lucky...

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,901
Kid stuff...

614
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:48,640
Okay, now the dolphins will throw balls
at the guests that they take a liking to.

616
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,675
Please catch the ball for them!!

617
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:00,585
All right!

618
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:03,087
Boy, you sure are popular, Pops!

619
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,092
My...isn't there something wrong
with that boat?

621
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:08,927
What?!

622
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,563
Hey, it's capsizing!!

623
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,634
He is Mr. Hash.

624
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:22,339
Officer,
wasn't Mr. Hashi wearing a life jacket?

626
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,710
Come to think of it,
he was wearing one this morning

628
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,111
Really?!

629
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,547
Then, why isn't he wearing it?
