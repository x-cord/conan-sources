1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,705
Stars are for some reason attractive

2
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,374
They can be«the culprit or the actor

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,109
The treasure of the god Nioh
Is finally found!

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,511
Did Thief Kid get it, or
did the Youth Detective Squad get it?

7
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,513
He sees through the one and only truth

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,981
788 WnSbuesoiven
with tha ¥=Q. of an adult

10
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,617
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

13
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:55,747
Wa care admin ta
camp tagathoer with =r Avasn

15
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,118
We came long to
camp together with Dr. "Agasa...

17
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,787
<4 Gonta and tho others find <
a mysterious looking stone

19
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,156
near a suspicious looking mansion

20
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,193
TRere are codes. concerning
the Big Jewel there.

22
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,930
And besides it, we find a body of a man
who had been strangled to death!

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,001
We. then enter the mysterious
Iooking mansion of tricks +

26
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:22,207
where we encounter 2 treasure hunters
and an queer old woman...

28
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,376
We've got to find the other sacred treasure

29
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,480
or we won't be able to
solve the mystery after all...

31
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,215
I he other...?

32
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,601
They're called the three sacred treasures

33
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:35,821
The mirror and the Magatama were found,

34
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,090
so there should be one more somewhere.

35
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,825
The three sacred treasures?

36
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,961
Yes. the mirror is the Mirror of Yata.

37
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,631
The Magatama is called the Magatama of
Yasakani-it's a stone shaped like a comma,

39
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,132
and the remaining one is

40
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,702
the Sword of the gods.
The Sword of Kusanagi...

42
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,772
that got its name because it is said to
have saved God Takeru Yamato.

44
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,308
Who was in a pinch,
by slashing down the grass

46
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,310
when fire was set to the field.

47
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,979
The sword of the gods...
The Sword of Kusanagi...

49
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:08,187
Adventure at an Eccentric Mansion
Case Closed

51
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,656
Oh. I know about that Sword of Kusanagi!

52
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,459
It's the fantastic sword that
comes out a lot in games. right?

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,262
The Sword of Kusanagi...

55
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,932
If we look at the writings on that sword.

56
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,934
We ma be able to fic ure somethinc out...

58
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,137
Before searching for the treasure.

59
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:30,475
I think our priority is
to get out of this basement cell.

61
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,412
If it's getting out of here,

62
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,280
he should know how to...

63
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,615
Huh?

64
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,954
Unless you already came here once and
read the writings on the gravestone...

66
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,691
you wouldn't be hiding that
stone mirror that you have on you...

68
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:49,428
Yes, yes...let me show you the way...

69
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,499
What a large house...

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,436
The basement is strangely large...

71
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,906
Huh? The floor's starting to get wet...

72
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,540
Yes...

73
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:01,873
Yes...

75
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,709
Water is flowing in from somewhere...

76
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,844
Oh. there! Over there!

77
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,183
What's that trace that looks
as if something had moved out of place...

79
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,454
Oh, now that you mentioned it,
there was an earthquake a little while ago...

81
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,191
That's why the house moved a bit,
and water from below flowed out.

83
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,460
Ho.ho.ho!

84
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:26,398
Just as Kichiemon says,
maybe the god Noh is angry...

86
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,235
telling us to quit treasure hunting
and hurr on home...

88
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,277
Hey, the notebook that the man
who was found in the swamp...

90
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:45,617
It's dry now and legible...
It seems that he was killed by his partner.

92
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,886
I've teamed up with a dangerous guy...

93
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:51,088
I've got to hide this stone I found,
or he'll kill me...

95
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:55,627
Poison rat says he's going to kill me
and take the treasure all for himself...

97
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,032
After that...it's ripped so I can't read on.

99
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,735
Huh?!

100
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:05,887
Wow,

101
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,674
wow!

102
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,210
Whaaaa~!

103
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,947
[his smoke. 1s it a hot spring or something?

104
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:19,418
Yeah
Kichiemon probably dug it up.

106
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,356
To hide this entrance with steam...

107
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,424
fl we

108
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,891
Fantastic ¢

109
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,161
What a red hot spring...

110
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,830
I wonder If it contains a lot of iron?

111
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:35,701
He , brat!
That's not the exit!

113
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,035
Brat?!

114
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,973
Conan?! What's up?

115
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:44,276
Are you all right?!

116
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,644
Are you all right?!

117
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,179
Hey. do you know?

118
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,981
Do you know where
the Sword of Kusanagi came out from...?

120
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,316
Huh?

121
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:56,521
Sure you've all heard about
the story of Susano

123
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,991
the kid brother of Ametarasu Oomikami,
making a monster drink sake to get it drunk

125
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,927
and eventually defeat it
in order to rescue Princess Kushinada.

127
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,264
And the sword that came out of
the tall of the monster was

129
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,766
the Sword of Ameno Murakumo,

130
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,470
which later became know as
the Sword of Kusanagi!

132
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:15,607
D.Don't tell me that monster is the one that
often comes out in stories of long ago...

134
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,527
Its eye are«flaming red like those of-an ogre

135
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,528
and its stomach is inflamed with blood.

136
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:21,879
Although it has just one body

137
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,333
It is the legendary eight headed dragon
with eight heads and eight tails.

139
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,753
Look at the basin of this waterfall...

140
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,621
Doesn't it look very similar...

141
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,091
To the eight-headed dragon!

142
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,197
I 888

143
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:43,701
The waterfall 1s the dragon's neck
and the branches its tails...

145
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,805
Which means that the sword is
in one of the branches...?

147
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,807
Yeah... According to the egend.

148
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,475
The sword came out
of the tail in the middle...

150
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:55,480
In other words, the Sword of Kusanagi
should be up ahead of this branch!

152
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:58,417
Don't tell me you plan to
dive throughithe hot water?!

154
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,086
Forget it! Don't! There's nothing there!

155
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,156
What if it's the bottom of
the valley up ahead?!

157
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,160
But. we came this far, so I want to sce
what there is up ahead...

159
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,761
Mugh!

160
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,765
Whaaaa!

161
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,301
Huh?

162
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,307
Something rising!

163
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,576
The water level is decreasing!

164
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,512
Ooooh!

165
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,282
Now we can go through the hole!

166
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,616
All right!

167
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,518
Oka I Let's go!

168
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,986
H.Hold it. Genta!

169
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,522
Out of my way!

170
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,590
Vvhaaa!

171
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,859
HHe Grann ?.

172
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,927
Darn!

173
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,600
Hah. hah he's-heel

174
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,659
Ooooh!
That is indeed...the Sword of Kusanagi!

176
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,846
Huh?!

177
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,601
H oeeeh!

178
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:13,825
So. you wore after
the treasure too. Grann

180
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,028
What a dangerous trap...

181
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,765
When you try to get close to the sword.

182
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,568
Weight bears down on the floor and
blades come flying from all directions...

184
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,837
I guess he doesn't want it
to be taken. does he?

186
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,174
No...it's not just an ordinary mean trap...

187
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,242
Huh?

188
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,112
Blades come from all directions.

189
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,714
C.Conan!

190
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,983
And the blades settling in all four directions

191
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,218
only goes to show that,
the timing is slightly. synchronized

193
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,654
so that they won't bump into each other...

194
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,356
Moreover...

195
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,861
The fact that there as a handle
Iike this on the blade.

197
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,399
Is telling you to use it
to go over to the sword!

199
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,274
He ~I

200
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,109
He got to the other side!

201
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,411
Conan's fantastic!

202
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,813
WwW. What's written?!

203
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:10,949
What's written on the sword?!

204
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,156
Dragon...

205
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,758
D.Dragon?!

206
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,092
Dragon?!

207
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,145
Forever, Flames and Dragon...

208
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,831
Ho hoho

209
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,700
hyo...Just as expected of Kichiemon!

210
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,635
It probably means. suffer in agony forever

211
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:34,839
as If being burned by
the flames of the dragon!

213
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,843
So... let's forget about
treasure hunting and go home!

215
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:42,847
Maybe there was no treasure
to begin with anyway...

217
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,751
What's with you... You were
going all out to get it just a while ago.

219
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,606
Those who are lost,
offer me the sacred treasure...

221
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,662
Forever...Flames...Dragon..»

222
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,664
Offer me...

223
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:03,151
To me!

224
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,437
Hey. Conan!

225
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,154
Conan!

226
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,777
He's coming back this way.

227
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,666
You look satisfied
So. you've figured something out?

229
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,668
R.Really. Conan?!

231
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,954
This look on my face is
a wretched look that says.

233
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,606
Let's hurr up and head on home..."

234
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,608
Huh?!

235
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,210
Ara you s0Mous...

236
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,329
Hey, Conan?

237
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,130
Are ou serious about heading home?

238
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,618
After we found the mysterious
three sacred treasures.

240
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,137
You're going to forget about the diamond?

241
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,390
Yeah

242
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,025
The words that are carved
on the sacred treasures

244
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,694
Flames", Forever and Dragon.

245
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,295
As far as the meaning is concerned

246
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,098
and as to the meaning of
the writings in the stone lantern,

248
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,234
I don't have the slightest idea...

249
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,503
I guess I'll get going then...

250
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,138
Hmm.

251
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,207
I guess I'll check this mansion
a bit more too. then...

253
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,178
Whew

254
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,546
We finally made. it outside

255
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:25,016
It seems Dr. Agasa hasn't come back yet.

256
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,484
Doctor?

257
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:31,022
Dr. Agasa¥is suppose to bring:
some police officers here

259
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,092
Oh...then. Yuess

260
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,827
you'll be able to get out of
these mountainseven without me...

262
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,164
If you don't want God Nioh to curse you.

263
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,367
Don't dilly dally and
head on home right away!

265
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,904
Now that all the people
you don't want around have left...

267
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,174
Iead the way. will you?

268
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,875
Huh?

269
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,976
Huh?!

270
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,178
To where the treasure is...

271
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,046
What?!

272
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,298
Come on. Conan...

273
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,856
Then, ou...

274
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,125
You figured out the code after all!

275
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,195
It was written on the gravestone
in the basement. right?

277
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,932
To the lost ones,
offer the sacred treasures to me. .*

279
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,936
The "me" here refers to Samizu Kichiemon.

280
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,938
In other words it's telling you
to add the kanji character "MIZU"

282
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,806
to the characters of the sacred treasures

283
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,274
The words that were found on
the three sacred treasures

285
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,609
were "HONO" for "Flames" and...

286
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,211
El" for forever

287
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,749
What happens
when you put"SANZUI" alongside it?

289
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:31,783
Hmm 2!

290
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,317
Hmm?

291
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,820
The character "HONOQO™" for flames becomes
AWA" as in Awaji Island!

293
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,159
The character "El" becomes "EI"
the character for the word swimming!

295
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,180
The character 'RYU becomes
TAKI" the character for waterfall.

297
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:46,064
Hmm ?

298
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,734
Does it mean to go swimming
in the waterfall of Awaji Island?

300
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,738
It said on the gravestone in the basement
The lost ones. right?

302
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,742
That was a hint for those who couldn't
figure out the code of the stone lanterns!

304
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,878
The writing on the lantern said.

305
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,212
A place nearest to the sun

306
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,748
where the elderly gather,
a very lively place.

308
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:07,202
When you put this
oge er wi 1 Ye ree Cc arac ers...

310
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,856
The place nearest to the sun is Mercury,
the first planet in the solar system.

312
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,392
The elderly refer to
1e carps wi 1 wis ers.

315
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,830
The lively place means a place
where the sound of the water never stops.

317
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:23,635
In other words. the stone of the god Nioh.

318
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:28,173
The diamond. is hidden near the waterfall
where a lot of carps swim in fresh water!

320
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,240
Wow. Conan!

321
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,707
It's the waterfall in the basement!

322
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,976
Where the eight-headed dragon is!

323
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,581
Too bad...
That's a hot spring and not fresh water...

326
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:40,718
Maybe it's the river that was in the house?

327
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,521
Yeah, there were lots of carps
swimming inside too!

329
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,724
But. there was no waterfall.

330
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,926
O. Oh. that's right.

331
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,595
See. listen carefully

332
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,497
You hear it. don't you...?

333
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,033
It's leading us to where the treasure is...

334
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,034
That sound of the...

335
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,954
I 866]

336
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:03,041

Let's go!

338
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,242

341
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,034
Yeah...

342
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:16,921
The killer hid it again
after we entered the house...

344
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,790
What're you talking about?

345
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,658
A bod...

346
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,330

347
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,834
It's dark and I can't tell unless

349
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,202
Too bad...

350
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,270
Huh?!

351
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,009

354
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,479
Just when did she get here...

355
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,148
Look behind the waterfall...

356
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,450
Behind the waterfall?

357
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,419
There is a card or something up there!

There seems to be nothing here...

Cough. cough!

419
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,043
I.I found something!

420
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,681
It was hidden in the mud...
but there was definitely a stone

422
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,650
that was shining at the bottom
of the swamp...

424
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:57,989
It's mine!!!

425
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,792
H He...Don't take it!

Oops... Don't move!

434
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,814
Who would've thought
it was hidden with mud...

436
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:25,850
I didn't search
that well and was about to ovenlook it.

438
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,353
Thanks to that card .

439
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,025
Go on. line up on that side!

440
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,944
When that man comes out from the water
holding the treasure,

442
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:40,148
I'll give you all
a good dunk in the water together.

444
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,601
Phooey.
You've finally shown your true identity...

446
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,268
Thief Kid!

447
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,770
What?!

448
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,638
S.She is?!

449
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,374
Huh? Me. Thief Kid?

450
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,308
Don't be silly. I'm...

451
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:50,975
Don't be silly. I'm...

452
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,579
You're the poison rat
that killed your partner

454
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,180
in order to hog the treasure
all for yourself, right?

456
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,782
Ugh...

457
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,852
You were saying.

458
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,322
When that guy
showed the stone mirror...

460
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,326
then there must've been the word "Flames"

461
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,995
carved on the Magatama that you found.

462
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,296
Isn't that right...

463
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,266
Back then, all I said was...

464
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,069
I found a stone sacred treasure .

465
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,670
So. how did you know?

466
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,339
That what we found was not the sword,
but the Magatama...?

468
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,976
You knew because you're the one
WI10 Orc o Cc page

470
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,678
from the notebook of the man
that you sunk to the bottom of the swamp...

472
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,981
You took the diagram that

473
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,483
that the character "Flames"
was written inside the Magatama!!

475
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,171
How did you find out what was written?!

476
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:38,790
Yoh!

477
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,459
The notes were written in pencil.

478
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,896
SO you could see slight traces on the paper.

479
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,766
Oh. so ou're a bit smart

480
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,401

00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:29,733
That diamond was the switch
to this huge trap...

509
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:33,871
He had no intention of letting anybody have
the treasure to begin with...

511
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:39,210
Yeah....diamonds,
because of their impenetrable hardness

513
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,380
once used to be called adamas
from which the word adamant,

515
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:43,481
meaning utterly unyielding was derived...

516
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,716
Therefore,
He teaches proverbs from long ago

518
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,351
means the treasure shall never be taken...

519
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:50,288
Well, when the Shogunate collapsed,
not wanting the ones

521
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,074
who overthrew the government to confiscate
1S 18SSC SS. SMOS I Cy wa (cuemon,

524
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,893
who was supporter of the Shogunate
thought this up...

526
00:19:56,912 --> 00:20:00,831
That's why you stole it once
but decided against it, right granny...

528
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:04,569
)r rather.
The greatest thief under the heavens...

530
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,482
There he is!

531
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,016
Thief Kid!

532
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:19,951
Thief Kid!

533
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,620
Exactly... Good work...

534
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,556
The wall of the mansion that was
slightly raised. and the basement passage

536
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,391
the was slightly out of place
where the water came gushing out...

538
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,562
Contraryto what was written on the card,
the jewel was not taken...

540
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,433
And shouting: "Donst-take it!
all points-to'none other than the fact that

542
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,537
granny is Thief Kid!

543
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,839
Bingo!

544
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:46,377
Well, I didn't take it also
because it was not what I was after...

546
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:51,048
That's why you said, let's forget
about the treasure hunt and go home!

548
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,586
But, you knocked me down
and tried to take the sword!

550
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,122
That was to rescue you, Genta...

551
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,323
Huh?

552
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,791
If he didn't go in there before you .

553
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:04,395
And make you realize there was a trap there
you would've been slashed to pieces...

555
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,531
So. he waited for us in the basement

556
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:11,469
so that we wouldn't
get caught b the traps?!

558
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,939
My, my, what a heart warming
and touching thief...

560
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,409
I'm truly honored by your words, little lady?

561
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:23,481
Well, I'll let you go for today since
ou rescued m friends from danger...

for sure someday. so don t{orget that

565
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:37,094
I'll peel off that cape of your
as well as make you show yourself...

567
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,230
I advise you not to...

568
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,233
Pandora opened the box because
she didn't know what was inside...

570
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,772
Knowing the contents before opening
the treasure box is...

572
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,375
Aaaagh?!

573
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:53,878
No fun?!

574
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:03,104
You fool
It's the work of a detective to find out...

576
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,324
what's inside before opening the box...
