The reason there's no code number
Is probably because of this...

59
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:27,249
Now that you mentioned it, I heard that
they blocked off gate number 12 and 22

the other team scored another point

when returning the ball to the center.

I looked through the omega glass.

99
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,992
Then I saw him laughing...

100
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,729
Laughing?

101
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:25,100
Yeap, I asked tho other boys
of the soccer club later and

103
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:28,203
you know what he was saying
while laughing?

106
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:29,938

117
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:01,936

118
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,506

who didn't make-the penalty kick too

They're really up against the wall

00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,834
The Ohgane nine gather on the mound!

300
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:57,822
The disappointed catcher:who had
dre) ed the ball cannot lift his head

303
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,460
Of course he can't.

304
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,897
Made a blooper
in front of a large crowd like this

306
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:10,334
The other nine menibers of the team at.
Will hold a grudge against him,

308

nd the player as well 1s his parents,
siblings and even his rclatives

311
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,542
Will face embarrassment...

312
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,264
Just for something like this

314
00:16:32,374 --> 00:16:33,791
They're laughing

316
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,595
That pitcher's Inughing...

318
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:39,013
Really?

319
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,933
They split running to (heir positions
with smiles on their faces

321
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,652
Ma ha ha...

323
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:45,936
it cant be

324
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,055
How can they keep laughing?

325
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,225
Why. at this stage!

326
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,311
Because this is baseball.

327
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,517
You can't play baseball
unless all nine members are there

329
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:02,987
I'm sure that

330
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,189
the pitcher of Ohgane Is thinking

331
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,793
for himself as well as for the team

332
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,762
and for the catcher who made an error.

333
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:16,233
That he's going to slug this ball
even if his arms break!

335
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,405
He hit the ball!

336
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,742
» Bul the ballkveceged shghtly

338
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:27,745
Well, the number 4zthat follows

339
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,714
also probably wants to send, the runner
to home. so he's stepping out

341
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,616
and pitching the ball the way he is,
even if the ball may hit him

344
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,919
Although no one knows
which team will win yet

346
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,954
A Absurd

347
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,690
If they go out of their way ind get hurt
they can't become professionals!

349
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,827
They could be throwing
their whole life away. you know!

and hear the voice playball

367
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,163
for those kids out there

368
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,967
it's a battlefield of

369
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,202
whether you winor lose!

370
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,445
