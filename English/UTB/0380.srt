00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:07,057
Asuka went to the
outdoor bath around 10 pm.

20
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:10,795
And Ema went to tho shrino
In the garden around 10:30 pm.

22
00:02:11,696 --> 00:02:14,531
These two victims were killed
with the votive dagger.

24
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:17,568
As this murder weapon was
found mm the outdoor hath

26
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,455
It is plausible to
think that Ema was killed first

28
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:28,012
Plus, there were no footprints
yutside the shrine in the garden

30
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:31,749
And also, one must pass thevrecreation hall
in order to get to the outdoor bath,

32
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,418
but nobody was. seen
passing there after 10:30.

34
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,455
Oh my... So these killings were
done in the inaccessib e spaces

36
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:43,093
It was Sakurako's revenge
with Kimono Visit!

38
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:46,530
Sakurako!? Who Is that person!?

39
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:46,864
She's my university friend,
who committed suicide

Hmm? Oh yeah...

59
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:11,589
In the shrine, we found one of the earrings
of the victim missing

61
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,358
Here... This is the one

62
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,660
Oh, that's an expensive one...

Four thousand as a pair!?

72
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:28,539
It's expensive,
yet not enough for motive to kill.

74
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,473
True

75
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:34,812
I remember, Harumi, you were wearing
a necklace of the same brand. weren't you?

77
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,150
Yeah... But took them off
because Ema complained about it

79
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:44,421
Oh yes...We found this in Ema"s.jacket.

80
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,194
We also found that the kimonos and
the sashes at he homicide scenes

82
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,863
actually came from the .loset,
which was not locked at all.

84
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:55,266
So anybody could take them out.

85
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:58,736
Perhaps the murderer must
have hidden them somewhere beforehand.

88
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:03,140
Ok everyone Could I ask you
what you were doing last night. please?

Ty ',
Right. After that. I went back to my room.

106
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:19,056
Oh yeah, I saw Mr. Mouri on the way and
we had a little chat.

108
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,725
Ah. eah...

109
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:25,062
We did ..Actually you looked great and...

110
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:31,735
And Yoriko: You were working on
some stuff on the coverage.

112
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:33,203
So I suppose you saw Eri...

113
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:35,739
Yes I did. I saw Eri.

114
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:40,411
And after five minutes or so...
I saw Ema going to the backdoor.

116
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:46,016
So that was around 10:30. right?
Did you see anybody else heading there?

118
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:48,886
No... I don't think so

121
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:53,891
Around that time, Mr. Mouri and
the other three went to the .outdoor bath.

123
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,694
But there was a reserved sign-on. the door
of the female bathroom.

125
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:59,362
The door was locked. so you,

126
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:01,365
Ran and Harumi went/back
to the? recreation room

128
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,199
That's right.

129
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:03,667
Mr. Mouri.

130
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:07,271
Did you hear or see something unusual
when you were In outdoor bath?

132
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,006
We did...

133
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,143
We heard a swash
from the female bathroom.

136
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:16,080
When was it? Around what time?

137
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,616
I {Fink it was around 10e50.

138
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:20,850
Maybe that was when the killing occurred

140
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,422
We only heard the swash.
We didn't. hear a scream.

142
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:26,724
Isn't it strange?

143
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:27,324
Oh...

144
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,891
Well.

145
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:32,896
Maybe the murderer stunned the victim
with the stungun before she screamed

147
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:34,231
It could be...

148
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:36,100
Yeah! It must be!

149
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,703
Kid. keep out of the investigation...

150
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:45,442
So. Ran and Harumi, you girls were just
playing ping pong in the recreation hall?

152
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:51,015
No. I actually went back to my room,
for 10 minutesyor SO...

154
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,317
Just to take off my contact lenses

155
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:54,652
Alright

156
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:58,489
So nobodyfpassed through
the recreation hall while Harumi was away

158
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,590
Right...

159
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:03,193
It was around 11 o'clock when
Mr Mouri got out of the bath.

161
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:07,197
Around that time, Eri and Yoriko
were having a meeting here...

163
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:09,199
Oh, ..Where were you at that time,
Mr. Bando?

165
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,802
I joined the meeting around 11:15.

166
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:18,842
Hmm. And then, Mr. Mouri found
Asuka's dead body In the outdoor bath...

168
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:21,378
Speaking) of the paper doll of
Kimono Demon.

170
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,314
Wasn't it there when
ou first came to the bathroom?

172
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,450
No... I'm sure it wasn't

173
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:30,054
after Asuka was found, Ema was found
dead In rm. shrine in the garden.

175
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,856
Why did she go to the shrine?

202
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,486
I think Harumi is the only person who
might have had the motive to kill.

204
00:07:02,487 --> 00:07:03,954
Noll... I don-t

205
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,058
I know you hate the victims because of

No...I didn t kill them!

212
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,434
Whoever is the murderer,
we have to find out

214
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:19,970
how these killings happened
In the closed space first.

216
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,108
If the victims were killed
with different weapons.

218
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,110
A«possibility of what
could've happened: still stands.

220
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:31,949

same murder weapon. the votive dagger.

227
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,801
I see...

228
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:54,671

But...why?...

278
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:17,147
We have to figure out how and
when the paper doll was put here

280
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:20,117
If we suspect that person as the murderer

281
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,920

00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:56,720
2 a. <>
There's something Uncle Kogoro
wants you to do...

298
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,656
What? Mr. Mouril said it?

299
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:07,114
If I'am right, then that person
musttbe the murderer.

301
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:12,469
Mr. Mouri, you told us to come here
Now what is it?

303
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:17,407
Of course. We are going to find out what
really happened in this hotel.

305
00:11:18,843 --> 00:11:20,344
So you know who killed the victims?

306
00:11:20,445 --> 00:11:22,212
Who is it! Toll me!

307
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:25,015
Ok, let me explain in the order of
what happened. Now first,

309
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:30,754
it's about Ema. who was killed in the
closed shrine in the garden.

311
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:32,222
Lieu enant Masaki

312
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,226
could you please turn gn the digital camera,
that's on the tub.

314
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:44,401
IN Eex=iy Willie) OFOQuR H0 DIAuO
of the footprints around the shrine

316
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:46,803
because there was something
that kept bugging me.

318
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:50,273
And this morning,
I finally figured out what it was.

320
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,659
So... what's wrong with this picture?

321
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,945
The footprints are not deep enough.

322
00:11:54,946 --> 00:11:55,746
What?

323
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,347
Yesterday afternoon.

324
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,750
When I walked around the shrine
In the garden,

326
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,753
my feet sank down
about 3 inches in the snow

328
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:02,952
my feet sank down
about 3 inches in the snow.

330
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:07,491
It kept snowing the rest of the day.

331
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:12,829
Ute, [on €No Bao Wo oR {0
the shrine around 10:30 pm,

333
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,768
Emma's footprints should have been
IL least 6 inches deep or so

335
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,704
However, It was about in fact only:4 inches.

336
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:23,073
It was too shallow

337
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,642
I see. but then, why?

338
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,311
Those footprints were pressed from the top

339
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,714
Pressed!? From the top?

340
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,049
Es."indeed.

341
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,586
Her footprints wee found
from the backdoor to the shrine

343
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:40,057
Ogura nd I covered every single
one of them with bath towels

345
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:42,058
in order to preserve them.

346
00:12:42,693 --> 00:12:47,264
But what if those bath towels were
solid boards or something?

348
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:51,435
You could walkson it and
move around the shrine

350
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:54,504
without leaving footprints, right?

351
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,505
It's that simple?

352
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:57,307
Hmmmm .

353
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:00,911
It seems that the tricks are always
complicated. but actually they're really not.

355
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:06,516
Perhaps, The murderer's got a couple of
wooden boards w ich are about 3 feet long

357
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:11,455
and moved around putting those boards on
top of Emma's footprints one after the other.

359
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:18,928
After killing Ema this murderer went back
to the backdoor doing the same thing

361
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,532
This way, the footprints are maintained
as It was before

363
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,068
Except they get bit shallower.

364
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:29,739
But how did the killer
get to the backdoor. Mr Mourn?

366
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,943
Yeah! Nobody passed the lobby. right?

367
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:36,546
The killer walkedrunder theveaves
doing the same.thing...

NS ts SAW NVA NS NOINSRNO
witnesses or.footprints.

371
00:13:40,251 --> 00:13:43,220
This morning,
I checked the pass around the backdoor.

373
00:13:43,988 --> 00:13:48,675
Onithe right side of the pass, the:snow was
about 6 inches deep. but on the ether hand.

375
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:51,228
The left side was only 3 inches deep.

376
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:54,698
Meaning that the killer came from a room
along the left side of the pass.» »

378
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:58,568
Soul checked the leftiside of the pass

379
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:02,472
and-found a-place where
the snow gots deeper again.

381
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:07,093
WwW. where. .is it?

382
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:09,262
Yes...It was right in front of your room!

385
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:13,950
What!

386
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:15,418
No way...

387
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,020
Cr did it?

388
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:25,145
Last night, Er left the outdoor bath as soon
Asuka came in. and went back to her room.

390
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,365
And thengyou went Up
to the shrine from the*backdoor.

392
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,950
Using the tricks I just explained.

393
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,151
You gave Ema a fake letter
from Mr. Bando beforehand.

395
00:14:31,152 --> 00:14:33,153
So she'd come to the shrine,
then you killed her.

397
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:38,875
Sure That way, I could kill Ema

398
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:41,845
But it's impossible to kil Asuka. isn't it?

399
00:14:42,346 --> 00:14:47,317
That:s true You cant use the same tnok
in the outdoor bath on the cliff.

402
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,389
Plus. nobody passed the recreation hall

403
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:58,128
Well, the triith is,
it was Asuka who was actually killed first!

405
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,196
What!

406
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:04,935
Eri stunned Asuka with a $ ungun

407
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,470
She removed Asuka's clothes,
and killed her with the votive dagger.

409
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:11,341
Then threw the dead body in the bathtub
with kimono 'sashes.

411
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:15,512
She probably stole
the dagger the night before.

413
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:19,649
It doesn't make sense though, because
Asuka was murdered first yet the dagger

415
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,753
and Emma's bandana were found
in the outdoor bath.

417
00:15:24,138 --> 00:15:27,390
That's right. That paper doll thing is too.

418
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:30,594
Oh. that was a trick using dry ice.

419
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:34,197
By using a small piece of dry ice

420
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:37,801
Eri~glued the-paper doll
onto the crack"of the ceiling.

422
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:41,905
If you know how long it lasts,
its possible to drop the paper doll

424
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:44,207
whenever-you want to.

425
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:47,010
That's why thefpaper doll was<kinda cold.

426
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:51,281
Rn asked the general manager.
to get her a cake everyday, Y

431
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:54,618
because she'wanted the dryiice,in:it.

432
00:15:55,386 --> 00:16:00,357
I understand the dry ce trick.
But what about the dagger and bandanai?

434
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:02,892
I didn't come to the bathroom

435
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,896
Well, it's possible to move them
without coming here

437
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:10,233
Let me show you how Row

438
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:17,157
Yes Sir.

439
00:16:31,722 --> 00:16:33,089
My god...

440
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:39,079
These boards came downafromsEri's room,
whic Bis on.the cliff rightwp there.

442
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,631
Now I want you guys to think about the...

443
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:45,502
The votive dagger, which was
used to kill Ema.

445
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:48,438
And the bandana'with her blood on it...

446
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:52,008
This way, you can move these things
without leaving the room

448
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:57,914
Perhaps, Mr. Mouri heard the swashy sound
When the boards got into the water.

450
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:04,187
That's right Using this trick,
Eri tried to disguise the order of the murder.

452
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:06,856
In order to establish her alibi.

453
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:10,577
OK, but the question is,
where did the boards go?

455
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:11,361
Aah /

456
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,131
Here it is. Mr. Mouri!

457
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,666
WER (9 (re (0

458
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:22,204
Oh, these were the sashes left inithe closet
They are froze ¥hard though.

460
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:27,544
Sash becomes like this if you soa
and leave it outside for a night.

462
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:31,815
Es. She used this frozen sash to hide
her footprints in the snow!

464
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:34,117
I see. When they are put in the water

465
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:39,189
they just turn into normal sashes...

466
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:43,727
It would look odd if t ere were just a dead
body and a couple of sashes in the water...

468
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:44,928
Thus,

469
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:50,350
she put some more sashes into the water,
and spread tons of kimono in the shrine.

471
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:53,336
That way the scene of murder looks
more like tho folKlere of Kimono Demon.

474
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:56,806
wumac ua y pm 0s we secre o \e no .

476
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,213
That's 'a: very clever deduction but...

477
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,598
Where Is tho evidence ?

478
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,886
Show me thetsole of your fool.

479
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:13,089
Show me. would you?

480
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,826
Please. Er

483
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:19,329
Alright

484
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,635
I think I stepped on a nail or something.

485
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:26,836
I don't think so

486
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,639
You actually stepped on Ema's earring

487
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,842
which actually dropped
in the middle of the fight

489
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:42,719
Last night, I told you guys to wait In the hall
while we did some on-site investigation.

491
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,387
However, En said it was better to
sit on a chair rather than on the floor

493
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,257
SO you guys moved to the lobby

496
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:52,996
thts becuse your foot was bleeding
wasn't it?

498
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:55,397
I a0 oY,
you have to take: off your slippers.

500
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,267
But you didn't wanna do it

501
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,537
Do you have evidence that this
a wound I got from the earring?

503
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:03,206
I found the missing earring!

504
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:04,441
Here!

505
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:07,644
Conan!

506
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:11,448
This brand name earring is
worth 200.000 yen a piece.

508
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:15,585
Nice! If her blood is on it,
it will serve as evidence!

510
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:19,255
It's amazing that you found it...

511
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,393
Actually +. This Is a pendant.
I borrowed from Harumi.

513
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:24,694
AA RL

514
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,305
Ok. :I-give up.

515
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:41,044
I killed Asuka and Ema...

516
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,588
Why did you do such a horrible thing. Eril?

517
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:55,358
Her name is not Eri It's actually Chieri.

518
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:58,261
She's been hiding her real name.

520
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:01,079
Your last natmo. "Ake" is a-very.rare-name

521
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,501
So people think your real name
Is Akechi Eri. rathersthan Ake Chieri.

523
00:20:04,502 --> 00:20:09,038
I asked my friend at the Metropolitan
Pol ¢e to do some research on you.

525
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,442
Chic you are the real
sister o Sakurako Suzuka

527
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,844
who killed herself five years ago. right?

529
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:18,714
What! Eri and Sakurako are sis ers!?

530
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,969
Iad of, 4
As you sisters lost your parents in a fire

533
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,319
Sakurako was adopted
by Mr. and Mrs. Suzuka.

536
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,589
Sakurako was adopted
by Mr. and Mrs. Suzuka.

538
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,627
Ok, I:ll tell you the rest...

539
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:33,930
When my younger sister,
Sakurako, died. I was in Boston.

541
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:36,266
Trying to become a famous wri er.

543
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:40,720
Soil £28 acliualiiy Ay earlier wir n
I heard that she Killed herself

546
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:46,726
She was a very naive girl. And because
somebody framed her up selling:drugs

548
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:50,579
she had to kill herself...Poor Sakurako...

549
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,050
How come she didn't tell me about it?

550
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,385
I'm her sister.

551
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,622
I'm the only family for her in this world...

552
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:03,826
What Asuka and Ema did to my sister
was totally unforgivable...

554
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,762
So one day, I came up
with the idea of revenge

556
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:10,900
I asked my university friend
Yoriko to invite Asuka and Ema

558
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,437
to this hotel for coverage
of a new TV series.!.

560
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,440
It was a perfect opportunity to take revenge

561
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:20,810
disguised by the folklore
of the Kimono Demon.

563
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:24,581
Ok, but do you think
Sak 'Take-is. happy about It?

565
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,219
There was;:a person among
the three interviewees that

567
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,223
your sister actually trusted
from the bottom of her heart.

569
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:37,160
It was Harumi Fukatsu. If she wasn't here

570
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:40,964
I wouldn't have known
about your sister's death.

572
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,033
And therefore, would not have
suspected you as the murderer.

574
00:21:44,034 --> 00:21:48,338
To me, it just feels like it was
Sakurako's will that you two met.

576
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:51,608
By meeting Harumi. it's most likely that

577
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:55,878
she hgped that you'd
stop committing the crime. /

579
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,380
Harumi...

580
00:21:57,381 --> 00:22:00,983
Maybe you were possessed
b the Kimono Demon. dunno.

582
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:04,921
[up (Mam exp 2) Qa OO Pan's
what your sister wants!
