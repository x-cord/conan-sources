No, I just thought I felt
someone watching...

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,216

60
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,018

Hey, hey...what are they

73
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,657
It's really a small . Ad cutechouse

74
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,058
Don't you think «Conan?
Do you like houses like this?

77
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,227
Don't you think, Conan.
Do you like houses like this?

80
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,730
Huh?! Me?

81
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:25,697
Yes. you.

83
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,900
Ayumi! How come you're asking Conan?

84
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,069
He's out of the picture

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,239
Because he ma become
Myshusband:in-the future!

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,375
So, I'd like to know what
kind of things he likes.

90
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,963
Hey, Ayumi!

91
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:44,683
Then, you've got to see the
inside of the house at all costs too.

93
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,250
Huh?!

94
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:45,484
Huh?!

95
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,588
So. will you show us inside?

96
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,924
You've gotta be kidding.

97
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,293
Just because I didn't say anything
about your ridiculous conversation...Huh?!

99
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,629
Her parents are lookingdfor
a house right now. you know.

101
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,298
If she likes the house .

102
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:01,099
Huh?!

103
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,100
They may just buy the house!

104
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,471
Let me!

105
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,197
There are two 6-mat western st. le rooms.

106
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:17,716
A.bathroom with a bath tub
with. a. changing room on the 1st floor.

108
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,086
Are the two western style
rooms for children?

110
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,439
Yes. It seems that the person who built this x»
house had in mind a couple in their-30's.

112
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,494
With two children. a total family of four.

113
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,931
On the 2nd floor is a 16-mat
Iiving room and a kitchen.

115
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,983
Wow, how spacious!

116
00:05:34,984 --> 00:05:36,768
It's nice and sunny too!

117
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,987
There is an 8-mat western
style room towards the roadside.

119
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:41,939
There's a 3rd floor too...

120
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,644
Yes, the selling: point.of
this house is the Grenier.

123
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,479
This is interesting

124
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,413
This is interesting

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,183
There's a window here too!

126
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,222
Wow, you can see the sky!

127
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,325
You can star watch at night too.

128
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,270
Hmm... Detective agency?

129
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,556
It's in view from here.

132
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,009
How: did you like it?

133
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,147
Hmm, the Grenier and-the 2nd floor
Iiving room were nice. but...

135
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,683
Both rooms on the 1st floor
were kind of dark

137
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,885
A larger yard would be better too.

138
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,588
The stairs were a bit too steep too.

139
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,225
But, for a house built on a small lot, ~
I think it's pretty well made!

141
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,696
And williyou recommend,
this to your parents?

143
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,597
Huh?!

144
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,297
What?

145
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:43,368
Huh?! Aha, ha...Well, ofscourse...
Huh?!

147
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,570
So, now that we got to see
the inside. let's fie!

149
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,173
The layout was not all that great.

150
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,040
My house is a lot mo e comf to live 'nl

151
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,609
Huh?

152
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,687
What?! That house was sold?

153
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,790
Yep, when I passed by
yesterday with mother...

155
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,294
the for sale sign was folded, so asked...

156
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:13,832
That's too bad, since you
seemed to like it. Yoshida.

158
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,868
But the inside wasn't all that great.

160
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:21,806
No need to be disappointed, Ayumi.
I'll build you a better housek

162
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,893
Just why arefyou going
to build Ayumi a house. Genta?!

164
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,845
I'm the one who's going to
build her house, if anybody!

166
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:31,883
I wonder If the buyer was
a couple in their 30's with two children?

168
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,652
Well I guess so.

169
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:34,619
Nope.

170
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,023
They were an elderly couple
way into the 70's.

172
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,791
An elderly couple?

173
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,430
Strange That houseriisn't
made for elderly people:tovlivesin.

175
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:50,402
You're right, it's got three floors
and the stairs were steep too.

177
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:58,343
But to each his own. so I guess it's okay.

178
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,784
Hisashi Udo...?

179
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,019
What a plain name.

180
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:10,622
<< ID

182
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,624
Since there s a name plate it means...

184
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,743
They've already moved in.

185
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,828
What brings you guys here?

186
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:20,065
We figured you'd be
concerned and come look!

189
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:24,703
Even if it's a trivial thing, if
in doubt check it out thoroughly...

191
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:27,038
That's the basics of.a- detective!

192
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,707
Hey. hey

193
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:29,641
Huh?!

195
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,978
My...Hello!

196
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,729
Hello!

197
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,481
You boys
Iive in this neighborhood?

199
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,353
We just moved In today.

200
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:46,191
If it's okay with you, please come in and
tell me all kinds of things about this town.

204
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,993
Yes! Sure!

205
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,762
If it's about Beikacho.
You can count on us!

207
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,633
I even-know which shop sells the
best eels over rice and is cheap too!!

210
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,904
Here goes

213
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,810
I'll be going then.

214
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,980
Bye!

215
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:16,488
Oh...so you're all detectives?

216
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:20,191
Yes! The Youth Detective Squad

00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,394
Dem, .

221
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,730
We're just as well known
as Kojima Liquor Store!

223
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,498
Here 'you go

225
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,766
Thank you!

226
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,801
What? Is that so?

227
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,140
I'm sorry. the furniture hasn't arrived yet.

228
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,508
Not at all

229
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,378
Uh, are you going to live here together with
the elderly man who went out a while ago?

231
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,212
That's right.

233
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,981
The stairs seem sleep.
But aren't you atraidy

236
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:45,183
Not at all

237
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:50,154
I've always been wanting to...
Iive in a house like this since I was young.

240
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:52,590
I think I know how you feel!

241
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:57,962
My grandma said that she wanted to try
Iiving in a tower condo just once too!

243
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:01,933
Besides...this house is close to
the house our only son lives in.

245
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,237
Oh. I see. But, please do be careful.

246
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,074
Thank you. it's*so nice of you.

247
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,793
Thank you for everything.

248
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,178
Bye!

249
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,313
Our doubts have been cleared.

250
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:19,951
That couple bought that house
because their son livesinearby:

252
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,521
She also said she wanted to
Iive in that type oféhouse.

254
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,358
But, something bothers me

255
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,726
Huh? What does?

256
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,029
Well, I cant really say

257
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,568
What?! Day after tomorrow?

258
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,619
Yeah.

259
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,839
Whatiistit? What is it that:sibugging me...

260
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,244
I've alwaysibeeniwanting to...
Iive in a house'likerthisSince I was young.

262
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,580
Here goes.

263
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,433
Is, itithis? Is this what-s bothering-me?

264
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:55,954
But, any elderly man would do so...
More than that, back then .

266
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,124
Why was she wearing
that look on her face?

270
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,293
Huh?

271
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:07,098
Since dad and I have to attend a
memorial service tomorrow and will be late,

273
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,534
please watch the house. really! Conan...

275
00:11:10,535 --> 00:11:13,037
Oh. okay. sorry.

277
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:17,207
Hey.» don't ponder when you're eating!

278
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,210
Shoot!

279
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,356
A cab...bummers

280
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,560
Damn!

282
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,868
Shinich! What're you doing
In a place like this?

284
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,237
Doc!
All nght!!

286
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,771
Talk about good timing!

287
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,842
Could you...
go after that cab up front!

289
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,510
Doc! Hurry!

290
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,445
Yea...
Okay

292
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,212
Yeah...
Okay...

294
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,818
Although it bothers;you...

295
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:11,289
There's nothing unnatural
about the-activity of the old man.

297
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:16,159
Old.people usually use their
hands for support when standing up.

299
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,263
I thought so 100. but...

300
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,866
The old lady probably frowned because
she's been telling him time and again...

302
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,935
to get up smoothly!

303
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:28,373
She probably doesn't like
her husband acting too old.

305
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:33,010
Although I'm always being told
that I act like an old fart by Genta too...

307
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,229
Old man!!

308
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,022
Im sorry:to. have bothered you on
your way shopping .Go on ahead home.

310
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:48,226
Hmm... understand you want to
check things out until you're convinced but.

312
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,194
Are you going to be okay alone?

313
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:51,563
Don't worry!

Who on earth is that Chinese man,

321
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,834
and that old man...?

322
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,302
I wonder

323
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:08,272
Huh?!

324
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,809
That's%in:the direction...
of the Grenier house?!

326
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,344
Don't tell me that!

327
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,090
The skylight of the Grenier house...

328
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,292
A camera?

329
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,395
Moreover...

330
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,296
why Is it face towards
the detective agency?

332
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:36,534
Are they taking pictures of Pops? Or...

333
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,002
What's the matter?

334
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,372
No, I just fell like someone

00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:41,973

Am I the target?!

338
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,279
If so...don't tell me
it's, the guystin black...?.!

340
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,960
How about it. Haibara?

341
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:05,496
Have you ever seen them
in the organization?

343
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,965
I see.

344
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,502
But, they could be in disguise...

345
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,337
In disguise...?

346
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:14,138
Yes .

347
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,674
Disguise...?

348
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,162
Shin-chan?!.

349
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,866
So, it's you after all. mom.

350
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,473
Long time no see. Yukiko.

352
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,143
Oh. Dr Agasa...

353
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,944
He got us. Yukiko.

355
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,847

This time he got Doc to act on his side...

357
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,016
He's paid us back for:what
we did some time ago...

359
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,089
How'd you find out?

360
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,559
Give me an explanation
before you ask me questions...

362
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,362
Just what do you think you're
doing pulling something likethis off...?

364
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:49,666
We came back to Japan in the morning
before yesterday.Yusaku's job interview.

366
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,703
Beikacho?

367
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:53,838
Okay...

368
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,675
After we stopped over at the house once...

369
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,544
I got worried about you,

370
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,579
went alone;to check you
out at the elementary school.

372
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,150
You just:happenedito come
out with yourifriend...

374
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,053
Conan! Quick!

375
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,771
Why call Conan!

376
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:12,123
Right!

377
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,092
Really! You're really sharp, Shin-chan...

378
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,762
I thought you saw through me.

379
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,802
I was relieved to see that
you were doing well. but

381
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:28,222
I got to thinking that I wanted
to see what kind of life

383
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,259
you were livingrafter becoming Conan

384
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,728
before leaving*for the States
withoutletting you know!

386
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,981
You didn't have to start feeling that" way...

388
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:37,214
You didn't have to start feeling that way...

389
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:44,055
I was walking thinking how
cou watc 'you wit: out :eing notice...

391
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,592
I coincidentally;found that'house...

392
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,895
Though it was small: I liked the house...

393
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,697
although 'I didn't intend to getéit.at first...

394
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,233
The detective agency

395
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,135
was in view:from-the
window of the Grenier...!

398
00:18:58,136 --> 00:19:01,939
That's when she came
upon this striking thought.

400
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,877
We'll just rent the house for a week,
disguised as an elderly couple...

402
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,396
and watch your lifestyle...

403
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,682
secretly from
the window of the Grenier...

406
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:15,753
Yusaku thought that my
idea was amusing too.

409
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:22,159
So, we went to the realtor to
ask if it was okay.

411
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,129
Then, the president happened
to be a great fan of mine...

413
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:26,397
Here you go...

414
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,699
Thank you.

415
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,304
He immediately agreed

416
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:39,110
I was really surprised when you
all came the following day, though.

418
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:47,084
Since I'm an actress I had confidence that
I could deceive you, but as for Yusaku...

420
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,089
Yeah, that acting of yours, dad,
was what got me thinking.

422
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,791
Here goes.

423
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,426
But that's...

424
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,094
But that's...

425
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,964
Yeah. like you said Doc.

426
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,301
It's only natural for elderly men to use their
hands to support themselves getting up.

428
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,103
But, that's
only nobody's watching

430
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,073
In front of people I think they: try
with all their might not to show it.

432
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,708
I feel that's the psyche of elderly people.

433
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,544
Yes, even in the world of acting,

434
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,647
when you people act out elderly
people. they are-inclined to act that way.

436
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:21,018
That's why you frowned
when he did so right?

439
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:26,457
Oh, you saw? Right, I thought,
oh no. he did it.

442
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:31,796
It cc n't be help:.can it? After all, I'm
a suspense novel-writer. and:not an actor.

445
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,499
But, your acting was :pretty-good too, dad.
You knew that Doc and I

447
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,885
were tailing you, right?

449
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:40,570
Hmm?! S.Sort of...

450
00:20:40,571 --> 00:20:42,506
The Chinese owner of the shop.

451
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,576
Used to be the head of a chivalrous
group of robbers that raided the great

453
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,011
continent during his younger days.

454
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:52,350
I interviewed him about my,
upcoming Night Baron Series,

456
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,753
Night Baron vs. Mysterious Chinese Man

457
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,990
I asked him to scare you a bit...

458
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,328
I was really surprised when
he threw the dagger at you.

460
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,695
Yusaku!

461
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:12,269
At any rate...don't you
think that's going a bit too far?

463
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,070
I'm sorry...

464
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:17,408
But I was really worried about
the kind of life you were living.

466
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:21,945
Since we've been living away
from you for a while

468
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:25,783
If I were to ask you: you'd say
that ever thin *s oka. , ri ht?

471
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:30,320
I wanted to know... the real genuine fact.

473
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:41,432
Besides. I wanted a
Iot of pictures of you...

475
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,804

476
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,371
