00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,569
An awkward situation. two people
inal in in)

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,571
a situation:ithat closes in on
@€onan and Haibara

5
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,172
A life threatening situation is close

6
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:08,774
A breathtaking. 2-and :a:half hours begins!

7
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,826
He sees through the one and only truth,

8
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:11,827
a child in appearance

9
00:00:11,828 --> 00:00:12,811
with the 1!1Q. of an adult

10
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,997
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

12
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:43,402
OREN VER SEC,

13
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,570
THE CONFRONTATION WITH THE BLACK CONNECTION
TONED ACH HE OD SASED HAGEL wy

15
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,822
Who are you?

16
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,501
It's a secret...a secret...

17
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,470
I can't tell you...

18
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:56,808
A secret makes a woman a woman...

19
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,144
Daddy's glasses...

20
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,880
I'm sorry

21
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,382
Daddy... What's the matter?

22
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,101
Is he already asleep?

23
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,455
He promised to read me a story
efere going to bed and yet...

25
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,860
hen...Will you stay by your fathe
until he gets up?

27
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:15,694
Okay!

28
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,473
Then, you set fire to my house...

29
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,692
and burned everything down to ashes...

30
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,580
All of what my father... as an FBI agent
gathered behind closed doors,

32
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:39,117
the investigation data on all of you...

33
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,825
But, I was saved...

34
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,460
Because after that...

35
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,546
I remembered that there was
NO More orange juice

37
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,665
that father always drinks upon getting up...

38
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,170
and since he was lying down from
exhaustion from afternoon

40
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,505
taking care of mother
who wasn't feeling well...

42
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,175
I wanted to be of help
and went out shopping...

44
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,446
Pun 8
Oh $0 you're the little girl I saw back then)!

46
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,715
I really went all out looking for you

47
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,719
because all that was left from the remains
Mn Were the bones of your parents...

49
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,056
My father's colleagues protected me...

50
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,027
They applied the witness
protection program for me...

52
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:27,165
That stupid system of changing
the name and addressof a witness

54
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,168
whose life is in danger in order to protect
thatperson under a different identity

56
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,649
Phew
It must've been really restricting. no?

58
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,419
To live away from your hometown,
as a different person.

60
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,588
You went through hard times, didn't you...

61
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,293
And?

62
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,530
You took after your father,
and came after me?

64
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:02,968
FBI agent Jodie Sterling?

65
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:07,606
Just as expected of
a witch with a thousand faces, Bellmott.

67
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,876
With your ability of disguise
you can sneak in anywhere

69
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,612
and check on things to your heart's content
can't you...

71
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,885
I'm amazed that you sawgthrough
the disguise of Dr.'Niide...

73
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,787
It's obvious...

74
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:26,058
Despite of not having that bad of an illness

75
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,345
if you keep frequenting Niide Hospital
ith no make-up...

77
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,232
That you were planning to Kill him
and become him!

79
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:37,185
Then...

80
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,707
you mean that the time his car passed right
before me with his family and

82
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,110
crashed through the guard. rail,
eventually sinking into the sea...

84
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,431
was all set up by you?

85
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,432
Yes!

86
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:54,286
I made it look as if he died of
an accident before you got to kill him...

88
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,456
Because if the car was left {
at the bottorn of the sea...

90
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,859
and if nobody knew that he was dead,

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,846
it would make it easier for you (*
to go around acting as Dr. Niide...

93
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:05,864
Of course,

94
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:10,185
the people in the car were
my colleagues equipped with aigdpumps...

96
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,973
The real Dr. Niide is living in peace
in a place far away...

98
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,375
You,

99
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,045
just as we expected established
ot 0s :
yourse in 11 @ O0spla

102
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,813
and began checking on-something...

103
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,650
It was obvious what you were
Iooking for the moment

105
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,437
we snuck into your room in that hospital...

106
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,957
A picture was poked all over with darts...

107
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,278
The picture of a:girl in her 20's
with reddish brown hair...

109
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:40,766
You were planning to find her
and get rid of her!!

111
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,569
Ow...l have a question

112
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,907
The picture of the woman you were
trying to get hold of and kill

114
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,309
and this girl that looks just like her...

115
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,513
Of course the witness protection program
will be applied to her but...

117
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:56,548
Cough, cough...

118
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,684
Is she really the woman in the picture?

119
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,054
There's still more!

120
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,025
The two pictures
that were below her picture,

122
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,662
the meaning of the words Cool Guy and
Angel that.were written on the pictures...

124
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:16,001
That boy iscunmistakably sharp,
but he's more a "kid" than a guy. isn't he?

126
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,072
S...That boy called Cona

127
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,910
until that boy left the girl's side

128
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,748
you didn't do anything...
Inside the bus that was jacked too

130
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:36,922
Please don't!!.
It: just'the mischief of a child, ish:tit?!

132
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,257
Will tell me why you went all out
to protect that boy

134
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:42,928
to the point of almost risking your own life?

135
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,813
Fuh. fun, fun...

136
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,436
If she didn't come around...

137
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,588
T,Things wouldn't have
turned out like this...

139
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,458
S,So...

140
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,378
N.Nab that person called Bellmott too!!

141
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,446
And?

142
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,049
So that name Bellmott,
that sounds like the name of some liquor

144
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,417
IS probably a fake name. right?

145
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,285
Do you know the person's identity?

146
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,787
Uuuuugh...Brrr

147
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,389
You haven't seen that person yourself,
either?

149
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,691
N.Nope.

150
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:13,725
Then...

151
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,494
what about the receipts of the things

152
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,996
that you received
that she used to blackmail you?

154
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:18,630
Well

155
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,168
What?! N.No way!!

156
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,937
_~Y.You threw them away?

157
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,240
Phooey...

158
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,309
The address is probably a phony one too...

159
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,744
I guess for now...

160
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,880
until we arrive at the harbor,
we'll have to keep him tied up somewhere.

162
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,952
So now, the case is closed.
What?, ha, ha.

164
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,861
Come on...

165
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,430
tell me. will you...

166
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,741
Okay!

167
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,643
I'll tell you...

168
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,878
That's...

169
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,556
Don't move!!

170
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,433
Y. my
what a dangerous thing you have there...

172
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,437
Did you get permission
from the police in Japan?

174
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:38,743
We'll request joint investigation
from the police here after we nab you!

176
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,212
Of course I'm willing
to take full responsibility for this...

178
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:46,084
But before that
I have something I want to ask you!

180
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,120
Oh...and what may/that be?

181
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,158
Why...don't you...

182
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,999
Why don't you age at all?

183
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:15,547
You caught-my attention because of what
you said in front of my mother's coffin...

185
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,885
A secret makes a woman a woman...

186
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,223
I was really excited
and started investigating,

188
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,925
then sure enough,
there was a perfect match...

190
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,263
Remember back when you killed my father
making it look like he committed suicide.

192
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:37,502
Because of the way it lay
unnaturally on the floor.

194
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,472
The fingerprints that were
on the lens of the glasses

196
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,507
and yours matched perfectly!

197
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,077
But, I had my doubts...

198
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,849
You were too young to be a suspect of an
incident that had happened 20 years ago...

200
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,851
I didn't think it possible at first,

201
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,787
but when I matched your prints
with a certain person's

203
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,057
I got results that made
a shiver go up my spine...

205
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:04,062
You're the one and the same as
your mother Sharon Vineyard!!

207
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,265
And, I finally found the witness...

208
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:11,069
that could explain the mystery

209
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,938
of what was keeping you
from being arrested!

211
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,778
You guys! Come out and nab this woman!!

212
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,749
When I get custody of you from the
Japanese police I'll make you spit it out.

214
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,451
You'll tell me everything...

215
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:30,455
Well, even if you insist on saying nothing,
she will eventually...

220
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,200
Fun, fuh. fun...

221
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,904
Ugh. ugh...

222
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,573
Ugh. ugh...

223
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,647
Thank you Calvados...

224
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,451
Don't kill her yet...

225
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,553
I've still got something I want to ask her...

226
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,425
Heave.-~. heave

227
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,994
You all staked out here...

228
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,731
and figured. you lured me out.here but...

229
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:18,903
% I came here once already 2 hours ago,
disguised as you...

231
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,140
And this is what I said in your voice...

232
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:27,010
This is it tonight! Come back tomorrow!

233
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,414
Didn't you realize?

234
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,283
There was another reason as to why
the papers of the cases

236
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,986
that Detective Mouri was involved
in were stolen...

238
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,455
All ofithe documents Were stolen

239
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:41,126
sorthat the papers 'we actually
needed would:irnot be specified, however...

241
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,996
all of the documents were sent back to the
Metropolitan Police in one batch because...

243
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,032
I wanted you people to think
that my stay in Japan

245
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,935
had something to do with Detective Mouri

246
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,806
so that you would stake out
the detective agency,

248
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,576
which as a result... .would help me
figure out who the FBI agents are...

250
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,980
Just as expected,
I figured out how many of you there were,

252
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,150
the place you were all staying
and the way you were all communicating...

254
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,254
I also knew that you werestrying to trap me here...

255
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,191
Then, you knew that we snuck
into your room too...?

257
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,694
Yes...l was just playing dumb...

258
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:23,134
I thought that if you saw that picture
you would find her for me...

260
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:28,439
But...you surprised me twice already...

261
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:33,411
The first is that you are the girl
that I met 20 years ago...

263
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:38,550
The other is that you knew what went on
behind the scenes regarding Dr. Araide...

265
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,652
How did you get information onFit,

266
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,555
when nothing about it
was spoken to anyone. +?

268
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,724
Heave...heave...
I didn't hear about it from anyone...

270
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,593
I was asked to do so by someone...

271
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:52,397
To corner you and disclose your identity,

272
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,900
and in turn for doing so,
gs. she said that she would trust me...

274
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,002
T.This girl over here...

275
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,707
She said so...

276
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,743
Cough, cough.

277
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:09,314
Cough, cough.

278
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,983
Gha, ha, ha...

279
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,320
At any rate! Let's hear the whole story
hen we get to the police station!

281
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,258
He solved the case in such a short time!

282
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,627
Just as expected of Shinichi Kudo!

284
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,395
Fantastic!

285
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,535
Oh, the reason I got to solve it right away is

286
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,504
because I used the same trick
1S the killer...

288
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,707
Just what does...that mean?

289
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,407
What?!

290
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,978
The same trick that Wolf Man
over there used!

292
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:45,783
So, this is it, for our re-encounter
after 20 years...

294
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,753
It's time to say goodbye...
Fuh, fun, fun...

296
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:51,823
Come on and smile.

297
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,659
Because you're going to get
to see your father in heaven...

299
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,195
Heave, heave...

300
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,364
Fuh, fun, fun...

301
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:13,578
What?! Thé same trick
as Wolf Man used?

303
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,865
The killer...
put a mask over a monster victim,

305
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,485
who was already disguised,
and double disguised the victim, you know.

307
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,755
You've only got bandage
wrapped around you!

309
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,858
Just what the hell do. you mean!

310
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,448
Y.You're...don't tell me...

311
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,552
Yeah...

312
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:56,638
$0...this...

313
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,290
IS what I mean!!

314
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,325
Huh?!
What?!

316
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,794
Y. You're...

317
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,065
H.Heiji Hattori?!

318
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,836
C.Cool kid?!

319
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:18,242
Conan tdogawa...A detective!!

320
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,186
H.He wasn't Shinichi...

321
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,788
H.Heiji Hatter»?!

322
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,692
Disguise?! Disguise?

323
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,863
But. .his voice
and tone were just like Shinichi...

325
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:39,630
Yeah...

326
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,332
Fuh. fun, fun. .

327
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,234
Of course...

328
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,171
It took me six 'hours to disguise him...
It's my masterpiece...

330
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,272
As for his voice.

331
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:53,845
The. microphone on his collar picks up
the deduction that Heiji whispers into it,

333
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,514
then: Shinichi says it through
the microphone on the mask...

335
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:00,718
and that voice was output
from the speaker on Heiji's necktie so...

337
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,054
How do you like it,

338
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,174
a perfect collaboration by.Dr. Agasa and I!!

339
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:07,858
Ahawha, ha, ha!
Fuh, fun, fun...

341
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,029
Okay! We're okay on this side, Kudo!

342
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,431
Do: our thing on your side-too, now!!

343
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,805
Oops!! Don't move!

344
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,193
Your bodys the blind spot for the rifle...

345
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,922
Go on and-get in the car after Jodie...

346
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,692
Let's take a drive to the police!!

347
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,373
Jodie...

348
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,642
Quick and get in the car!

349
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,743
Ugh! Kugh...

350
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,145
Jodie!!I Are you all right?

351
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,881
Y,Yes...Ugh...

352
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,516
Yes...Ugh...

354
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:12,356
D.Don't tell me that...?!

355
00:18:20,898 --> 00:18:22,366
Shinichi Kudo...?

356
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,836
Remember, boss...

357
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,438
the kid that you poisoned to death
with the drug made by the organization!

359
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,874
Sorry Vodka...

360
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:37,147
I make it a policy to forget the name
and face of the ones I get rid of...

362
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,916
And?

363
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,855
Are you saying that the kid rose from
the dead and appeared as a ghost?

365
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:49,660
Yeah: I mean no...
something strange is happening...

367
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:56,267
Why are you disguised as Shinichi Kudo
in the first pladO anyway?

369
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,903
Oh,sorry, sorry! Pops!

370
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:04,175
I haven't seen Kudo for sometime,
so I got kind of lonely...

372
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,444
I figured that if I came out looking like him

373
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:09,147
and made a deduction,
maybe Re joist might pop out too...

375
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,584
t... maybe he's dea
just as rumor has it, you think?

377
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,585
Aha, ha, ha...

378
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,188
Darn! Kid from Osaka

379
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,757
this is the second time
you're pulling this trick!!

381
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,625
Aha...

382
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,928
If Ran were here
you'd be way gone by now!!

384
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,563
If Ran were here...
You'd be way gone by now!!

386
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,599
S.Scary-give. me a break.

387
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,835
I had no choice...

388
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,237
After all Kudo e-mailed me
asking me to do this...

390
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:37,375
He told me that/those guys are trying
to pull him away from Ail and do something,

392
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,945
so he wanted me to disguise myself as him
and get to the bottom of things.

394
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,214
That's why I'm on board this ship...!

395
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,083
But, it sure freaked me out...

396
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,754
when I got to his house
and found his mother there...

398
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,790
She seems to have been
worried about him,

400
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,793
and hiding for a while
in the house watching him...

402
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,862
Fuh, fun

403
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,730
Mo. ..ther

404
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,418
Hey, hey...

405
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,207
I... didn't think she had a special
talent to disguise people...

407
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,676
but she would even freak
Arsene Lupin out too!...

409
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:16,480
Thanks 10 her I didn't have 10
complete my deduction all bandaged up...

411
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,118
The only one I'm worried about
is the little girl

413
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,189
that is left sleeping and confined in the
basement of "Doc Agasa"s house...

415
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,725
Kudo says shell be fine

416
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:32,396
if she doesn't have the pursuit glasses
hidden somewhere:with:her but...

418
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,132
if I were her...

419
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,804
knowing that he would be going to see
some dangerous guys disguised as me

421
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,139
I wouldn't be able to wait for him
ust like that...

423
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,909
I would break the door epen

424
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:48,212
no matter what and go after him.

425
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,051
No matter what, Kudo!!

426
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,053
Lid go after you...

428
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,135
AAI... you...
