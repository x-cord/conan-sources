16
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,389
However, one of the guests
staying at the lodge,

18
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,858
a journalist named Yoshitaka Nigaki

19
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:10,596
fails to return to the lodge after going
Into the woods despite a violent blizzard...

21
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,102
After awhile of searching
for Nigaki in the woods,

23
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:19,438
We found him in dead.

24
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,111
Just as I thought...

25
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,347
I've figured out the case...

26
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,418
Now I know why there were black pictures

27
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,154
taken before the blood-stained picture...

28
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,159
Who took the chocolate out
and why it was put near the corpse...

30
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,630
who killed Mr. Nigak

31
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,568

00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,984
Well. Mg. ouri says he'll explain
all that in the kitchen to you from now!

70
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,391
Okay!

71
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,527
I've come, Mr. Detective.

72
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,396
Now that you know who the killer is...

73
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,398
Does that mean that you've figured out

74
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,000
the identity of the man
wearing the black knitted cap?

76
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,737
No, there is no need to
check on the identity of that man...

78
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,143
Because the one who
killed Mr. Nigaki is right here.

80
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,210
WwW. What?!

81
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:39,545
Are you kidding me?!

82
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,948
I thought we already told you
that it was impossible for us

84
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,951
to put the chocolate near the corpse
under the situation we were in!!

86
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,153
Ight/the chocolate...

87
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,024
The key to solving that
mystery was not us...

89
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,560
utWimnu.

90
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,172
S.Saburo?!

91
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,778
Then, you mean the one
who is holding the case is Saburo?!

93
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,582
Yes...thanks to him

94
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,584
I've figur dfSut the mystery of why

95
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,120
the chocolate was
near Mr. Nigaki's corpse.

97
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:25,758
Are you saying that the dog was the
one who brought the chocolate out here?

99
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,563
After you guys left the: Chocolate back
at the lodge and went to look for Nigaki

101
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,632
that dog was brought outside
by the boy wring the glasses, right?

103
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,503
If the boy who was together with
the dog was the first to find the corpse,

105
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,239
how is the dog going to
et the chocolate...

107
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:44,176
es... it's true that the do
was with Conan...

109
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,445
This Saburo...definitely was...

110
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,847
T,This Saburo?

111
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,982
Yes...

112
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:53,419
I realized this when
I saw Saburo liking round things

114
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,921
to the point of playing with the daruma,

115
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:01,760
showed no interest at all
in the video that we watched last night...

117
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,431
And when I heard that
the previous owner used to take

119
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:08,634
aburo and go visit the grave everyday...

120
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,571
Taking into consideration that

121
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,174
only specific:graves
were not attacked by wild animals

123
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,911
this assumption was easy to come by...

124
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,983
That the previous owner
probably made Saburo keep watch over

126
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,953
Ris ex wife's grave all day...

127
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,357
a. ha. ..just what are you talking about

128
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,759
How the hell are they going to let this dog

129
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,296
who is always being put back in his
cage every night watch the grave...?

131
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:41,500
It is impossible as you say...
If there is only one dog...

133
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,168
What?!

134
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,237
You know about it, granny, don't you?

135
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:49,842
About the dog that your
husband told you died 12 years ago

137
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,978
Saburo and the existence
of Jiro who hadktwo nails...

139
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,449
Well, I should've realized it

140
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,853
when I saw the dent on the chocolate
and the melted part of it

142
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:05,224
The fact that there were
two Saburos, and that the marks

144
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,960
on the chocolate was made
by a dog holding it in its mouth...

146
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,295
Whate!

147
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,765
To put it accurately, one was Jiro...

148
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:18,971
Each time they went to the grave,
they watched over it alternately .

150
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,641
He probably lied saying that Jiro ad died

151
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,110
out of his consideration
for granny. his later wife.

153
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,845
I see...

154
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,783
If that's how he was trained.
Than he would eat only every other day

156
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,285
That's why he didn't eat

157
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,690
when he couldn't go out
on stormy days and change places...

159
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:41,894
Then, the wolf that Mr Nigaki
said he saw in the woods was...

161
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:45,297
Probably either Jiro or Saburo...

162
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,168
They were also delivering
chocolate to the victims of accidents...

164
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,703
That's ridiculous!

165
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,305
Why.would:a: mere dog
arry off chocolate...

167
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,841
They were not mere dogs.

168
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,177
They were life saver rescue dogs,

169
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,913
efficient enough to win
awards for saving lives!

171
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,184
It can all be explained
if they were trained to give chocolate

173
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:09,555
that is highly nutritious to
accident victims, explanation is easy...

175
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,257
And that the actions of the dogs doing so,

176
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,993
was limited to this time of year

177
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,564
when a large amount
of chocolate was stocked...

179
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,767
The blood on Mr. Nigaki's face
was wiped off part way because

181
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,303
the dog thought he was
a victim of an accident

183
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,106
and tried to lick him to wake him up...

184
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,441
H.Hey. wait!

185
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,377
If the dog was the one
who took the chocolate

187
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,112
then anybody could've
committed the crime.

189
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,980
Just what are you talking about?

190
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,648
You saw it yourself, didn't you?

191
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,487
The blood stained picture
I showed you during the day!

193
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,090
In other words,

194
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,558
the killer is one of yo two who have
no alibi during the day tolBack you up...

196
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,496
Don't you think there-s
something odd~aboutsthat picture?...

198
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,630
Huh?

199
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:57,436
That picture was the last one in the film
and it was wound after that.

201
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,440
The killer would've most
naturally heard the sound of the

203
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,243
buzzing sound of the film being wound...

204
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,714
But the killer did not
ake that film away...

206
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:13,051
Despite the fact that
the Killer might be in the picture.

208
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:13,885
T.True...

209
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,219
T.True...

210
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:14,853
T.True...

211
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,889
But, why?

212
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:22,760
That's because that picture
was not taken at the time of the:crime...

214
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:27,566
It was a picture that Mr Nigaki had
casually taken during the day!

216
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:31,303
Unaware at that time
that his blood stains were

218
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,305
already on the lens from the nightibefore!

219
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,707
Last night, you mean

220
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,243
the night he cut his finger with the knife...

221
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,411
Yes...

222
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,847
the blood that stained only
the stomach part of the parker

224
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,582
parker he was wearing
back then as the evidence .

226
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,752
It's most likely that the blood stained

227
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,955
the lens of the camera that
he was hanging from his neck...

229
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,157
Yes.

230
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,960
The killer made Mr. Nigaki
take pictures with the camera

232
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,563
with blood stains on
its lens during the day,

234
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,033
promised:to meet:him that evening.

235
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,503
Hit and killed him
then put his sunglasses back on.-him.

237
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,705
This way, the killer made
it look like Mr. Nigaki

239
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,707
was killed during the day...

240
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,175
n thar words...

241
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,912
No one else other than
you can be the killer!!

243
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,452
In other words,

244
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,456
Ne one else other than you
can be the killer! Ms. Ako Amari

246
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,290
Huh?!

247
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,527
It can't be...

248
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,801
H.How can Ako be the Killer...

249
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,069
It can't be!...

250
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,139
Because we went to look: for
him after the blizzard started,

252
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,674
and the sun was still high!!

253
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,677
That's why you went to get him earlier!

254
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,281
Because if the blizzard got worse and
he decided to return to the lodge

256
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:53,385
before the time he promised
to meet her, everything would be in vain.

258
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,454
By the way

259
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,123
the reason why
there were two black pictures

261
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,592
before the pic ure
with the blood stain on it ws

263
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,128
to leave room for just one mere picture...

264
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,731
If space for three more pictures are left,

265
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,133
then the other two pictures would
also have blood stains on them,

267
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,537
and the pictures
would turn out strange...

269
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,941
She probably switched
all the other films and video tapes

271
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,010
to unused ones for the same reason.

272
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,880
B.But, I could've used
the same trick If I wanted to too...

274
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,484
No. only Ako could've done it!

275
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,720
In order to keep the
blood stained film inside

277
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,255
the camera after
the crime was committed,

279
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:34,927
the trick wouldn't
work unless all the films

281
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,195
that he had in his back pack are
completely r 'moved beforehand...

283
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,465
If there are other used
films in his knapsack

285
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,235
after the crime is committed,
it would be impossible to tell

287
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,871
which film is the one
with the blood stain

289
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,340
ight

290
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:52,611
singe You were with him right through
taking) are of his wound

292
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,414
you're the only one
who could've removed the films

294
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:59,718
without being suspected at all.

295
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,853
Would you like to take.a look at them?

296
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,789
; The tapes that you
collected. and disposed of,

298
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,657
after committing thecrime?

299
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,658
Huh?

300
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,796
The film that Mr. Nigaki took of you

301
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,130
when you went to
meet him in the blizzard...

303
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:16,268
He delivered it to us

304
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,871
He probably thought
that you had forgotten it

306
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,141
and brought the bag
with a lot-of Video tapes in it back here...

308
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,945
I haven't confirmed the
contents of the tapes yet

310
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,282
but tapes from 4 years ago
ere among them too...

312
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,683
That is most likely...

313
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:34,720
Right...

314
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,990
that's the scene of the previous owner

315
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,793
trying to help my older brother
whO was hunt and couldn't move

317
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,196
get buried under @A avalanche. ,...

318
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,803
It's a cruel tape that was being filmed
from the woods in the distance...

320
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,275
Don't tell me that
Mr. Nigaki kept rolling the film

322
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,677
without going to help at all?!

324
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:04,282
because my brother was
against me going steady with him...

326
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,320
I found that tape when
I was looking for clothes for him

328
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,590
to change in after Yoshitaka got hurt...

329
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,793
After seeing the date of 4 years ago,

330
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,263
I figured that this was the present
he was going to have ready for

332
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,866
me and watched it in secret...

333
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,737
That's why you were crying...

334
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,145
I didn't think that Saburo was
going to take my chocolate to him...

336
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:37,549
Maybe Saburo already knew
what I Was going to do...

338
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,585
He probably knew
hat I was the Killer too...

340
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,789
As well as the fact that
I really did love Yoshitaka...

342
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,325
What a stupid thing«to;do...

343
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,730
You don't even know
if Mr. Nigaki really filmedeither...

345
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,398
I Know he did...

346
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,668
There was a loud.sound twice,
nd then the avalanche.

348
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,271
His voice was In the tape too...

349
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,941
Sorry Natsuya,
I" aking your little sister.

351
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,077
Ioud! sound! twice...

352
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,845
Iey, wait a sec...

353
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,586
It's this sound that
you heard on the tape, isn't it?...

355
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,591
Right

356
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,060
we're the ones who
aused that avalanche...

358
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:27,232
We mistook her older brother
for a wolf and shot him

360
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,470
We were called out here,
and told by Nigaki to "Dish out cash.

362
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,873
He told us that if the:whereabouts of
the corpse was found through the video

364
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,478
and a bullet is found in his body,
we would be finished...

366
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,748
Thanks for getting rid of him for us.

367
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,583
Either way

368
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,519
we were going to cause an avalanche

369
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,921
stall him and kill him slow and easy...

370
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,525
All of you, line up beside the detective!

371
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:54,726
Hurry up'?

372
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,927
What do I do.now:?

373
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,796
I've already used the anesthesia gun and

374
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,998
I don't have my super kick shoes either.

375
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,803

Okay. you brown-haired one!

382
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:19,050
Stab your friend that's next to you

384
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,318

Don't worry

397
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,534
If I concentrate on
the direction of the gun barrel

399
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,338
and his finger on the trigger
I can dodge the bullet

402
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,808

I was just stating fact...

406
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,814
Darn!

To see if he is really good for you!

417

424
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,719
Where is that lucky guy?

425
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,531
It's you...

426
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,464

428
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:57,142
By the way, although Sonoko,
quit knitting the sweater half finished,

430
00:17:57,143 --> 00:18:00,078
she did send you the tea cup...

431
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,916
Oh, I thought that was a flower vase...

432
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,320
Is everything clear now?

433
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,721

00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,732
so please take this with you too!

438
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,666

Wow.

441
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,209
Her love attack is
really working out well

443
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,478
By the way. Sonoko,

444
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,848
I wonder about that
animal pattern outfit that you're wearing

450
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,252
I'm happy for you, Sonoko...

451
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,896
The-police arrived after day break

452
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,299
The horror of the
snowy mountain passed over

454
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,368
together with the blizzard...

455
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,038
Then, February 14th
nally comes along...

457
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,775
Uh, why didn't you write
anything on your chocolate?

459
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,911
I was going to write
something later secretly!

461
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,113
Deny an BS RS

462
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,183
I'm going-to the airport
to see Makoto off then, okay...

464
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:14,452
Good luck!

465
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,824
Sonoko...

466
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:22,460
I can't write anything on it...

467
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,197
Your feelings don't reach the one you
want to give the chocolate to

469
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,534
if you give it after Valentine's Day...

470
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,070
I can't make myself
write the name of someone

472
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,274
who don't even know
the whereabouts of...

474
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,876
Mm home...

475
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,618
Maybe I should give
this chocolate to dad...

477
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,966
Ran. you sure are strong...

478
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,972
I really... wish I were all that strong...

479
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,813
Don't cry, you fool...

480
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,948
