1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,336
Inspiration flashes piercing right
through to the truth.

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,737
Once he gets going nothing can stop him.

4
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,639
Taday's setting#is Trick Ridge.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,041
A spider's thread eerily tangles
in the case.

7
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,643
The one and only truth is brought into light.

8
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,278
He looks like a child but he's got
the brains of an adult!

10
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,680
His name is... Detective Conan!

12
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,815
Mystery of the Spider Mansion of Totton"
(Part 1)

14
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,885
Tottori Prefecture Trick Ridge

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:06,459
I feel like we're going around in circles...

16
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,530
Hey, Heiji... could we be lost?

17
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,935
There hasn't been a person or car
that's passed by

19
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,005
I've forgotten me cellular phone,
and we can't call anyone...

21
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,674
nd to top it off, the bike is out of gas...

22
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,144
We should've caught a taxi after all...

23
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,379
Be quiet!!

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,347
If it's the map of this area.
Ust leave it to me...

26
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,251
Aren't you the one who forced your way
onto the back of my bike?!

28
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,554
But, what're you going to do?

29
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:40,893
Didn't that letter say for us to reach that
Mr. Takeda's house by tonight?

31
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,428
Yeah, that's right!

32
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,097
He doesn't write a phone number to
contact and

34
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:49,301
he sends money along with a request
to check out a strange case

36
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,238
I've gotta return the money to that idiot...

37
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,174
Thought I'd solve that case while I'm at it...

38
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,609
The sun is setting...

39
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,611
Looks like we're gonna have to campout...

40
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,046
Campout?!

41
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,849
I don+<t want to! In a forest like
this without a tent or blankets!

43
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,152
It won't be funny if we catch a cold!

44
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,121
We can get through the night if we
wear a lot of the clothes we brought

46
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,924
along and sleep close together...

47
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,295
Ieep close together...

48
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,766
But, don't get any horny ideas...

49
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,835
That's my line!!

50
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:26,037
Hey, hey...Don't start a fight...

51
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,948
Kazuha, let's go...
Retend you didn't see it...

53
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,383
You're right...

54
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,318
Hey, wait a minute...

55
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,487
It's just a joke... a joke!

00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,022

64
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,199
I was just taking this beloved forest!

65
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,104
I haven't been here since receiving
r Takeda's indebtedness

67
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,540
Takeda? Do you know the house?

68
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,844
Ss... 1 was just about to go visit him.

69
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,313
Oh, so were we!

70
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,215
Then, will you show us the way?

71
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:13,352
Well, looks like I got overly taken
n by the scenery and...

73
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,457
You wouldn't be lost, would you?

74
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,094
But, aren't you going to Mr. Takeda's
house too...

76
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,798
Looks like it's a campout after all...

77
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,234
Oh no! No, I don't want to!

78
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,137
What can we do! Nobody's passin by...

79
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,774
Hey! Wait a minute!!

80
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,512
I said to wait! Didn't IT!

81
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,849
Hey! It stopped!

82
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:50,222
What do you think you're doin'!
Darn it!!

84
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,958
Sorry, sorry... didn't think it'd
you for real...

86
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,663
Wow! You're?!

87
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,032
Oh, Hattori, it's you!

88
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,301
Which menas...

89
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:08,007
I had a bad hunch
omething was gonna happen...

91
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,075
What's that?

92
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,578
You-ve received a request on the case and

93
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,346
you-fire on your way to
Mr. Takeda's place too?!

96
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:20,352
But, mine is different from yours.
Wis official.

98
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
The request came from

99
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,356
the present master of the
Takeda household, Nobukazu Takeda!

101
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,460
I've already received a nice lump of
$5,000 on the investigation fee...

103
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,930
Then

104
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,265

that came to me?

106
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:37,036

119

Victim of the spider?

That's definitely about us...

121
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,195

122
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,733

Yes.

179
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,615
Just the other day...

180
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,386
Negishi, whom
brother was indebted to, was

182
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,123
found in the barn
In the same way...

184

while we were out, he quietly...

185
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:13,999
Did that person
come in and out of here quite often?

188
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:16,702
Brother is a doll master

189
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,506
and Mr. Negishi sold
and transported the dolls.

191
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,207
It's about that Mr. Negishi.

227
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:04,216

someone in this house.

Hey, Mother... why do Emi and I
have only half a fish each?

274
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,064
Why?

275

fish and so I was short two...

Alright!

I'd better get started in putting the
finishing touches to that unfinished doll!

312
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,108
Well then... Mr. Mour...

313

Don't you have to go and
help Brother?

322
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,255
Hold on to your horses...

Excuse me, can I borrow your car?

325
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,130
I'd like to go and visit Misa's grave...

326
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:33,465
At this hour?

327
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,902
Yes, if I go now... the moon would be peeking
over the mountain on the way to the grave...

329
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:41,640
The moon over the mountain...

330
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,808
May I go along too?

331
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,810
Of course!

332
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,079
Hey, Ran, would you like to go too?

333
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,779
Sure, sure!

334
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,182
Ister Ran...

335
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,484
Conan, wanna go too?

336
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,355
Take this along with you. . you'd be
ingtrouble if something happened?

338
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:57,523
Here!

339
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,991
Something happened...

340
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,558
Take it along, take it along!

341
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,696
I don't know what it is, but that
kid is showing first-class jealousy!

343
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,533
Idiot! That's not it...

344
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,668
Well, then...

345
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:17,909
Then, dear, we're going to take a
bath first so please watch the firewood

347
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,844
Okay.

348
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,792
Those two are suspicious, aren't they...

349
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,226
You're right...

350
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:40,198
Hey! Brother! Brother!!

351
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,933
Yuzo, what's the matter? ,

352
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,537
Brother isn't around! In the workshop
or anywhere else!

354
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,505
What!

355
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,439
What's that?!

356
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,507
What about the barn?

357
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,707
Did you look in the storehouse?

358
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,077
I looked in both places,
but he wasn't there.

360
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,645
How about th second floor of the
storehouse?

362
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:54,913
No, I haven't checked yet.

363
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:59,284
Something's wrong The second
floor window of the storehouse Is open.

365
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,887
Two people have commited
suicide there and

367
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:05,290
no one wants to go close to that

368
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,164
The stairs are over there!

369
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,832
Hey!

370
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,471
It won't open! It's locked from inside!!

371
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,174
Somebody, bring an axe or something!!

372
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:22,908
Sure...

373
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,755
TTS 88occccs 78

374
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,098
Brother...

375
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,532
Brother!

376
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,735
Hurry, call an ambulance!

378
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,037
That's not what you need...

379
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,307
You've gotta call the police
not an ambulance...

381
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,909
E's already cold...

382
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,579
I'd say it's about an hour since he died...

383
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,380
What...

384
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,848
What are you talking about?!

385
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:03,815
Don't come in!!

386
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,786
This may be the site of a murder...

387
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,488
Murder?!

388
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,757
I received a letter...

389
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,428
A live doll will be the victim of the spider
here again tonight

391
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,930
a letter that
forecasted this murder!

393
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,601
Again means
an incident has happened before!

395
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,138
That's why I came
to stop the murder tonight

397
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,641
and to solve the
mystery of the previous ones...

399
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,409
But, it was boldly done In front of me!

400
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,612
Who are you, anyway?

401
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,650
Heiji Hattori. A pretty well-known
detective in the Kansai areal!

403
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,284
Detective?

404
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,587
Well, I think I've heard about it...

405
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:47,325
the story of a really sharp young
etective in the Osaka area...

407
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:52,397
But, is it alright? That
id is in the room too...

409
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:57,903
Oh, never mind, never mind! That kid
s like my assistant...

411
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,674
A thumbtack?

412
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,347
The surface is rusty,
ut the needle is new...

414
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,983
Looks like it just came loose.

415
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,887
But why is it here?

416
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,725
Anyway...please hurry and call the police!

417
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,826
Oh..Yes!!

418
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:27,799
But, if this is a murder, how did
the murderer get out from here?

420
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,601
It must be that small window...

421
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,070
he probably used a rope or something...

422
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,505
That's impossible.

423
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:38,910
That window is only big enough to
barely let a child through.

425
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,212
What?!

426
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,016
Wait a minute! The door was locked
from the inside

428
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,986
so we broke the
door down and came in!

430
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,623
And, if a person can't get out of
that window...

432
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,393
Then, this is a murder
in a.sealed room.

434
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,230
t's her Excellency...

435
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:03,368
The spider empress used her six long
Iegs to climb the storehouse wall

437
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,572
and from the window, she strangled
Nobukazu with her thread...

439
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:12,577
She wanted to get even with Nobukazu
or building a storehouse here...

441
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,147
Frightening, frightening...

442
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:18,850
You're detectives...
If you keep calling it a murder...

444
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,853
her Excellency will curse you too...

445
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,723
hat's the spider empress...

446
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:28,193
It's an ancient tale of this area.

447
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:33,565
Long ago at this ridge. . there was
a woman as beautiful as an angel.

449
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,436
She stopped travellers who passed
this ridge and asked them riddles.

451
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,908
Do you think there's a heaven?"
Would you like to go there?"

453
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,379
All the travellers were taken by the
strange beautysof the woman

455
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,281
and replied, " yess

456
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,484
they were taken deep into the forest
and*'wa"sf neverseen,;~again

458
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,988
A doll master heard of the rumor and

459
00:15:56,989 --> 00:16:00,992
put a human-sized puppet on the road
of the ridge and watched.»

461
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:05,664
As expected, the woman appeared and
asked"her riddle,

463
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,365
but the doll did not reply...

464
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,601
The woman became angry

465
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:14,573
showing«her-true identit. as a giant
spider, she attacked the puppet.

467
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:20,145
The doll master who was watching,
shot a fire arrow that*he brought

469
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:23,915
and, the giant spider, who was engulfed
in flames escaped into the forest.

471
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,385
The doll master followed the spider

472
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:31,590
and found it burnt to death with her
children in their nest.

474
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,661
After that, the village people who
feared a curse,

476
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,532
built a small shrine on that nest
calling it the "spider empress

478
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:44,135
And, they came to call
this ridge, "Trick Ridge".

480
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:49,341
It's just a fairy tale! Why does
there have to be a curse with that?

482
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:53,378
This storehouse stands where that
shrine used to be.

484
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,747
The shrine was broken down?

485
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,351
Yeah... Father was a doll master and,
after Brother took after him,

487
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:03,054
he built this storehouse against the
wishes of the village people

489
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:07,092
Three years after the storehouse was
built, Misa, Brother's daughter

491
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,960
and his wife, Kinuyo

492
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:11,596
was found having commited suicide...

493
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,902
The two were found pitifully
tangled up in a spider's web .

495
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,272
And, again three years later
the other day,

497
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,441
This time Mr. Negishi was found
in the strings in the barn.

499
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,643
Strings?

500
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:28,079
They were tangled around Mr. Negishi's
hands and legs.

502
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,983
Strings used for marionettes.
Just as Brother was...

504
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,755
As if they were wrapped in a
spider's threads...

506
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:41,760
Ee .... that's why it's called
spider mansion of Trick Ridge

508
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:47,499
es... somebody's using that curse
to commit these murders.

510
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:52,203
Come to think of it, the area around the
grave, where Robert and the others went

512
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,373
used to be the place where the
Spider Empress appeared.

514
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,107
Oh no!

515
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,475
Could it be...?!

516
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,881
Making Ran take that cellular phone was
the right thing to do after all.

518
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,750
Rn... the house phone is in use...

519
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,754
Hey, Uncle!
Lend me your cellular phone! Hey!!

521
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,588
Uncle!!!

522
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,522
Here!

523
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,961
The cellular phone I borrowed! Who
are you going to call?

525
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,798
Kazuha. & ou were back...

526
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,967
What's the matter? You're out of breath...

527
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,004
I told them that the place that you
went to had a mysterious past

529
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:28,006
they turned pale and went flying out.

530
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:30,642
Oh, you were worried?

531
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:33,011
Idiot! That's not it!

532
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:36,982
It suddenly started raining, so we
came back early.

534
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,851
A lot of landslides occur in this area.

535
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:43,021
Dear... what' s all the noise about?

536
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,490
Ell, actually...

537
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,861
What?! Nobukazu has died?!

538
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,030
On the second floor of
that storehouse again?

540
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,531
Dear is that really true?

541
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,067
Yeah... and the door was locked.

542
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,902
And the police?

543
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,637
Iyuki is calling them now...

544
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:02,374
It's terrible!

545
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,845
There's been a landslide and the
police won't be here until tomorrow!

547
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:07,846
What?!

548
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,447
Can't help it...

549
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:13,051
Robert? Can I borrow your camera?

550
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,586
Yes, sure.

551
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,588
What're you gonna do with a camera?

552
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:21,059
What else!
We're gonna do the investigations!

554
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,062
We can't wait until daybreak!

555
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,964
Who's "we"?

556
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:31,803
Who else could there be?
Me and this old man, right?

558
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:37,942
Then, everyone, until the police arrive
tomorrow, please rest in your rooms

560
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,346
Please don't undertake any
activity on your own!

562
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,618
Gee... that's strange...

563
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,585
What's the matter?

564
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,688
The mascot that was on
my pouch is gone.

566
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,025
I thought I had it before I
got in the car but.

568
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,493
Then, maybe it's in the car?

569
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,930
Then, I guess I'll have to go and
find it tomorrow.

571
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,668
Do you wanna go look for it now?

572
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,335
Huh?

573
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:09,474
Yuzo has forgotten the car keys that
he had lent to Robert

575
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,010
and I have a pen light

576
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:16,414
But dad said not to leave the room.

577
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,250
It wouldn't hurt to just take a peek

578
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,467
How is it? Is it there?

579
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,068
Nope... looks like not...

580
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,007
hmmm... I probably dropped it in the
mountain... darn it...

582
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,344
Maybe, it was before you got in the car!

583
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,848
Remember, you dropped your pouch
and picked it up in a hurry!

585
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,950
It was probably then

586
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,819
Was that mascot that important?

588
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,258
It was that Kudo who bought that
mascot, wasn't it?

590
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,095
It's no good trying to hide it!
It's written all over your face!

592
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:09,634
Boy, I envy that guy Ku

593
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:15,339
You think about him so much.
Where has he gone?

595
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:21,379
If I were a man, I'd take you away
from a cold guy like him!

597
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,485
Shinichi isn't my guy!
And he isn't cold!

599
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,989
He always seems to be looking over me.

600
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,658
Huh? Is he close by?

601
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,661
Re... I just feel that w

602
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:41,332
If I'm not mistaken it was in this area where
Robert parked the car.

604
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,268
And we came running over.

605
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,304
H... Ryuji called out t

606
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,540
I dropped my pouch when I turned around.

607
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,743
Oh no! I'm almost out of battery!

608
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,981
There's some batteries in
my CD player so I'll go get them!

610
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:58,983
Oh...

611
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,253
She's really a nice girl...

612
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,790
Leaving a nice girl like that alone...
That guy Kudo...

614
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,593
where could he be roaming around...

615
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,564
Huh? What's this? This white ball.

616
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:19,170
It's come after all...
sure has...

618
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,406
We saw it, didn't we...

619
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,541
We did, we did... the spider's thread...

620
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,210
It's frightening, isn't it...

621
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,611
Frightening, frightening...
