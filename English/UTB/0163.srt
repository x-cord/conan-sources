1
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:03,202
Inspiration flashes that pierces right
through.

3
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,770
Once he gets going nothing can stop him!

4
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,806
Today there's an autumn treasure hunt.

5
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,941
Tithe Junior Detective Squad is
challenged-with a secret code!

7
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,543
The one and only truth is brought into light.

8
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,445
He looks like a child but he's got the
brains of an adult.

10
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,614
His name is... Detective Conan!

11
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:56,215
Secret of the Moon, the Star, and the Sun
Part 1

13
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:04,423
Dr. Agasa! Is there really hidden treasure
at the place we're heading for?

15
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,625
Yiup, plenty of it.

16
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:11,263
But, that's If you can use your brains
to find it...

18
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,201
If the Junior Detective,Squad
makes the scene

20
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,570
we're sure to»find a whole lot of treasure!

21
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,037
Hey, Professor

22
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,973
Huh? What is it?

23
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,943
The treasure you're talking
about wouldn't be

25
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,278
all these toys you made me buy
would it?

27
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:30,016
Shhh! Keep it a secret from the children!

28
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,152
That's why Haibara. didn't ome along.

29
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,990
Feelin pretty rich ain't you...
the car's new too...

31
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,293
Professor .... have you made some sort
of wild machine and

33
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,195
pulled a bank into the picture...

34
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,831
I, Idiot! I wouldn't do that!

35
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:49,869
Actually...l owe it all to this!

36
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,340
He Masked Yaiba

37
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:59,612
A person I know has a toy company and
I helped them develope this new product.

39
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,848
I got a nice bundle of contract money!

40
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,253
And? What is this suppose to be?

41
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,488
Yaiba reco-changer!!

42
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,557
Surprised?

43
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:16,228
We got one from the Professor this
morning 100.! this Yaiba Reco-Changer!

45
00:03:16,395 --> 00:03:18,430
Yaiba Reeo Changer?

46
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,568
It records your voice and transforms
it in all sorts of ways.

48
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,337
It's the newest Masked Yaiba item!

49
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,775
It's no different from
this Bow-Tie Voice Changer...

51
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:35,114
Well, what do you think!
The "junk" you're always accusing me

53
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:38,551
of inventing will be on the market
nation-wide!

55
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,622
Wowwww! What a big house!

56
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,193
Professor, is this reallygyour a
Uncle's second house? If

58
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,794
Yup. that's right!

59
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:54,934
My Uncle Kurisuke Agasa was
a quite well known man around here...!

61
00:03:54,968 --> 00:04:00,940
Fifty years ago, that uncle hid a great
fortune somewhere and passed away...

63
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,345
And so, this time... I called you out
here to see if we could use

65
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,714
the brains of the Junior Detective Squad!

66
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,684
Then, it's really, really true!

67
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:16,956
Yes! The Professor didn't come up here
ahead of time to hide the treasure!

69
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:21,627
Didn't I tell you! The Professor would pull
a kiddy trick like that!

71
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,329
Isn't that right, Professor!

72
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,265
A Ann... of course...

73
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,536
You can already see right through this...

74
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,838
Search this room first!

75
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,583
Where?! Where?!

76
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,886
Ooks like it's not here...

77
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,721
Not here either...

80
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:53,725
n the painting your uncle?

81
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,328
Ah, yes, it is...

82
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,563
I see...

83
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,301
Looks like it's true that your
Un le was really rich!

85
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,869
Look...

86
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,873
the fireplace painted in the background
is the same as the one in this room.

88
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:13,078
In other words, the artist was called out
to this house to d she painting!

90
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,415
To do something like that, you'd
have to be rich!

92
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:20,552
Ahn, that painting was supposed to
have been done by a young artist

94
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,955
a year before my uncle passed away
from illness.

96
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,657
Who is the woman with him?

97
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:29,261
That's Aunt Teiko, his younger sister who
Iived here and took care of him!

99
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:34,667
Uncle hated people and she was the
only one he accepted.

101
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,137
I heard she was a teacher at an
elementary school near here...

103
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,574
After my Uncle died,
she went back home...

105
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:46,979
and no one has set foot in this house
for the past 50 years since then...

107
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,949
But, there's a lot of things left here yet...

108
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,850
books... dishes and things.

109
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,754
In his will, my Uncle said that he wanted
this house left alone

111
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:59,391
for 50 years after his death.

112
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,728
Of course, there isn't any hidden
wealth Ieftffihere]

114
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,431
And therhouse is already set to be
broken down next month...

116
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,832
I see...

117
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:11,136
Nd... before it's broken down. yo
thought of having a treasure"hunt

119
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:15,274
with the kids in this dusty house...

120
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:16,742
Exactly!

121
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,211
Where's the treasure!

122
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,781
Ah, here here... don't make a mess
of the place!

125
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,552
If you-make:a more detailed observation re
of the surroundings,

127
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,922
you'll surely find a clue!

128
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:33,225
That's right... for example... the strange
Iooking letters nearsmy feet

130
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,761
that have been obviously carved...

131
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,100
Ahhhhhh, it's true!

132
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,903
MO, ZA, RI, SA, WA, SO, DE, RU?

133
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,040
What's this?

134
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,475
Is it English?

135
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,478
No. its not... it's probably Arabian!

136
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,850
It's not that simple...
No even Shinichi would...

138
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,120
Where has he gone?

139
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,322
SS. Shinichi, could he...

140
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:17,536
Looks like even you weren't
able to solve my puzzle!

142
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:23,075
Why, of course! I thought about it for three
days and three nights without sleeping...

144
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,211
Oh, if it's the wooden treasure box
you hid, Professor...

146
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,781
I found it under
the bed in the bedroom beyond!

148
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,217
I haven't peeked into the box yet, but...

149
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,887
It seemed a bit obvious sol covered
it with a cloth and

151
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,523
pushed it further under the bed!

153
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,294
You...

154
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:48,334
What bothers me is the other mystery
about this house

156
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,336
The other mystery...?

157
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,136
Yes...

158
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,640
This... what do you think... Professor...

159
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,742
What's this. what's this ?

160
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,979
It looks like an ordinary 1 yen coin...

161
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,148
I picked that up beside the bed...

162
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,018
Then, it may be something I dropped...

163
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:10,289
No; you couldn't have... there was
a lot of dust on it...

165
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,791
and there weren't any signs around it
that showed that it rolled...

167
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:19,264
One yen coins were first made in 1955...
44 years ago...

169
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:23,502
Something like that covered with dust
found in this house means...

171
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,970
T, That means...

172
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:29,308
someone came in without permission
when the house was left empt ?!

174
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:34,546
No, entering the house wasn't all he did.
I think he lived here for a while...

176
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,716
An old person extremely skillful
with his hands...

178
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,220
Lived here? Skillful? Old person?

179
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,325
Hey, hey, what does this all mean?
I don't get it at all...

181
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:51,463
Then, compare that 1 yen coin with one
of yours!

183
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,067
Compare it...

184
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,403
What are you saying is different...

185
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:02,841
1.It's definitely thinner than my 1 yen coin...
and a size smaller...

187
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:08,414
That 1 yen coin was probably shaved
from an original coin and perfectly

189
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:12,618
reduced to size... An extremely skilled
person!

191
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,122
And the character "country" is in
an old character, isn't it?

193
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:20,592
I don't know if it*was done deliberately or
by mistake. but

195
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,462
only an elderly person would use
a character-like=that...

197
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:27,633
But, how can you say the person
Iiving here made this...

199
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,004
Oh... there's no mistake that
it was made here!

201
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,005
It was carved while reading...

202
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,941
While reading

203
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,845
There's fragments of aluminum
from the 1 yen coin between the pages.

205
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,513
And, white hair too!

206
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:46,084
Also, there isn't a person who could
carve a 1 yen coin like that in a short time!

208
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:50,823
That's proof he was living here for a
Iong time.

210
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,624
1... I see...

211
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,327
Then, why a 1 yen coin...

212
00:09:55,328 --> 00:10:00,766
ell.... looks like, just to pass th
time, but I can't really say yet...

214
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:05,103
And, I still don't know if he was
Iiving here alone too...

216
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,940
I think there was a child here too!

217
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,777
I found this a while ago... proof that
there was a child here!

219
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,113
Here, take a look at the
underside of this vase.

221
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,515
Nderside...

222
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,519
This is...

223
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,153
T, This is... 7?

224
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,156
A child's scribbling, isn't it?

225
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:26,859
If it's something like that. I found some too!

226
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,193
Me too!

227
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,161
What?!

228
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,832
Look! There's some on the underside of
this candle stand too!

230
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,937
On the back of this plate too!

231
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,743
He must've been a rascal!

232
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:49,681
Rather than that. let's hurry and
solve the code on the floor!

234
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,518
But, this is strange...

235
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,153
My uncle has no children...

236
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,856
the old person living here
must've had a child with him...

238
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:02,561
Professor...
Do you know "the dancing doll"?

240
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,463
Dancing doll"...?

241
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:08,332
Ah, yes... it came out in the Sherlock
Holmes novel...

243
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,669
you're talking about that
strange picture of dolls lined up and

245
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,538
Iook like they're dancing, aren't you?

246
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,707
If I'm not mistaken, that's a secret code
made to look like a child's scribbling...

248
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,911
C,Could this also be?!

249
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:22,447
Ahn, no mistake about it! The vase...
the plate... and the candle stand...

251
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,051
If you compare the arrangements of each...

252
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,321
You can see that the three figures
on the right side of each are the same.

254
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:34,326
In other words, it's a secret code
with rules!

256
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,563
Right... ifs a'secret code...

257
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,737
What is it?! You seem happy.
That code... can'you read it?

259
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,774
Nope, I don't know anything...

260
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:53,478
not a thing about the old person...
or the 1 yen coin... but...

262
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,783
I'm excited! The more I don't know...
the more it excites me!...

264
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:01,787
That unsurpressable
curiosity inside of me!

266
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:05,190
T "Yblood of a detective is
being aroused...

268
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:10,796
Hmmm? Come to think of it... I've seen
this figure somewhere before...

270
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:13,932
What! Professor «really!

271
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,534
Where! Where have you seen it?!

272
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,536
Oh, don't rush me!

273
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,338
Hey, Conan!

274
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,776
Think about that secret code on the
floor with us!

276
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:28,347
You're the only one that's slackin
off in this treasure hunt!

278
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,682
Ah ahn, right.

279
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:37,122
MO ZA RI SA WA SO DE RU
Can't tell what it is with just this!

281
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,924
Codes like these

282
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:44,062
often use a 50 sound arrangement with
a letter shifted before or after!

284
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:48,133
Using that theory, if we slide the
Ietters back one...

286
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,235
RU, SHI, WO, TA, DO.

287
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,037
JI, RU, SHI, WO, TA, DO,

288
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,505
JI, RU, SHI, WO, TA, DO,

289
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,975
Follow the arrow!

290
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,646
Alright! Find the arrow!

292
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,016
H,Hey wait a minute!

293
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,350
Ah, what, what?

294
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:10,088
When we entered this room, wasn't
there an arrow that caught your eye?

296
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,224
N.,Not really.

297
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,760
Didn't see anything like that...

298
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:16,662
Look, that clock!

299
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,497
Clock?

300
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,033
Is something wrong with that clock?

301
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,368
It's unnaturally stopped at 6:30, isn't it?

303
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,771
What's wrong with that?

304
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,540
It's just stopped because it's broken,
hasn't it?

306
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,275
Take a good look!

307
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,909
On a usual clock,

308
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,447
at 6: 30, the hour hand and the minute
hand would be slightly apart, wouldn't it?

310
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,952
The hands being one on top of the other is
proof that someone fiddled with it!

312
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,855
That someone who hid the treasure...

313
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,662
Ilvother words, the hands of that
clock is"the beginning arrow!

315
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,363
Right!

316
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,933
Then, we'll have to search
below the clock next!

318
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,769
There's cards scattered!

319
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,938
The ace of spades is in the center,
isn't it?

321
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,575
For some reason, it's set in place
with a thumbtack...

323
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,877
Wow, you're right!

324
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,414
I see! Tthe ace of spades is the arrow!

325
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,251
Then, the next is...
that chess piece!

327
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,390
Ah, look at how the pieces are arranged!

328
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,925
The arrangement of the pieces?

329
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,962
See! If you look good, you can
see that it's shaped like an arrow!

331
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,630
Oh, you're right!

332
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,301
It's stuck to the board with
glue so it won't come off...

334
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:31,002
there's no mistake about it!

335
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,571
Then... the next is...

336
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:34,873
It's that room!

338
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,619
y there isn't an arro
nywhere 10 sight...

340
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:53,492
this is where the erson who hid the
treasure really racked his brains!

343
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,292
Hun?

344
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,062
See... on the desk in front of the door...

345
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,498
Dust has been swept away In
three places, right?

347
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,399
That proves that something was there!

348
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,001
Something....

349
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,337
Ah, could it be...

350
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,307
about this airplane on the floor?

351
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:14,946
Yes, match it with where the dust has
been swept away and put it on the desk .!

353
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,885
Aha! the bed!

354
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,320
This airplane is facing the bed!

355
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:26,424
The tresure is definitely hidden in this bed!

356
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,163
Ohhh, there's a box under the bed!

357
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,832
That's probably a treasure box!

358
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:38,870
But, that_strarnge#... I definitely put
the airplane there...

360
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,006
but I-don't remember dropping it...

361
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,776
Hurry up and open it! Hurry!

362
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,179
What?!

363
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,626
This is terrible

364
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,963
cutting it up like this with a knife...

365
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:05,864
Yeah...

366
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,668
The person who hid this wanted
to startle us...

368
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,304
You're wrong! The Professor
wouldn't do a thing like that. A.

370
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,339
Professor...

371
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,510
Then, the one who hid this toy
is the Professor?

373
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:22,214
To play a treasure hunt game
here with you!

375
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,553
Then, from the time the Professor hid
them until today...

377
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,288
S, Someone came here and...

378
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,960
He probably saw the secret code the
Professor left and

380
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,862
found the treasure box in the bedroom!

381
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,031
He looked inside got angry...

382
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,133
and cut them up with a knife...

383
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:47,405
That's probably when the airplane the
Professor left on the desk fell to the floor!

385
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,642
But, why was he here?

386
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:55,313
Beats me! He accidentally passed by
and came in out of curiousity...

388
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,815
Or, maybe

389
00:16:56,816 --> 00:17:01,319
he came in looking for something from
the very beginning...

391
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,154
Looking fordlsomething? What?

392
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,858
Maybe it has something to do with that
8 figure

394
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,159
Figure?

395
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,228
You knows the ones you guys found...

396
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,832
that strange code with the sun, moon,
and stars lined up!

398
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,902
That scribbling was a secret code?!

399
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,036
Probably...

400
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:22,173
Just maybe. & here reall is an
unbelievable treasure

402
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,509
hidden somewhere in this house...

403
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,915
Oh, Professor... what did the police say?

404
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:34,219
Ah, they said it's probably
a bad petty thief?

406
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,289
They'll be here to
check it out tomorrow...

408
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,826
Anyway, looks like it'd be best for us to
pull out without touching anything...

410
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:46,164
You're right... That secret code bugs-me,

411
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,666
but we wouldn't want to mess up
the scene more than this

413
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,905
H.Hey! What're you doing!

414
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,044
What do you think! We're looking for
more secret codes to find the treasure!

416
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,948
Idiots! The criminal might still be
In the area!

418
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,250
I. I found it, Conan!

419
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,386
On the back of this card... that secret code!

420
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,587
RR, Really?!

421
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,789
Look!

422
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,527
'Alright, Ayumi and I will take the
first floor...

424
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,596
Genta and Mitsuhiko take the second floor.
Let's split up and find it!

426
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,633
Good grief...

428
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,211
Justamy imagination...

429
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,491
Conan, there's another one!

430
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:47,592
Nothing here.

431
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,427
Nothing here either...

432
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,432
In total, we've found l7 more secret codes...

433
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,334
Cards!

434
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,502
French dictionary!

435
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,903
Record.

436
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,739
Airplane!

437
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,339
Wine glass!

438
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:02,574
Wine glass!

439
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,942
Portrait!

440
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,611
And. this gadget doll...

441
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:13,084
Come to think of it, my aunt used to
say that my uncle liked gadget dolls...

443
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,021
D... the first§three we found

444
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,589
Plate'...

445
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,024
andle stand...

446
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,027
Vase...
total of 10...

448
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,331
But, you can't telihwhat it's all
about withsjus athis...

450
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:31,269
Ann... if only there were
something longer like a sentence...

452
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,972
a diary...
Or a letter...

454
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,006
Ietter...

455
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:40,211
Oh, that's right! I remember!
Letter, the letter!

457
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:45,483
Remember, I said that I'd seen
that figure somewhere before!

459
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:49,654
I had completely forgotten that my
aunt had shown it to me!

461
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,990
When you say "aunt, you mean the
woman in this painting?

463
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:55,727
If I'm not mistaken you said she was
an elementary school teacher...

465
00:19:55,728 --> 00:20:00,397
Ahn, that's right... It was about
5 or 6 years ago...

467
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:05,603
My aunt consulted me about an eerie
Ietter she'd been receiving once a year

469
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,740
from an unknown sender for the
past 10 years...

471
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:12,444
If I remember right the contents of
the letter were all in "hiragana" and

473
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:16,948
it said things like "Hello, teacher
and "Please-take care of yourself"...

475
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,617
Isn't it just a letter from a student?

476
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,488
Maybe, but... it was written in
hiragana" for a period of 10 years.

478
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,491
That's definitely strange...

479
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:30,829
And? The secret code and those letters...
what connections do they have?

481
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,267
It was on the letter... That figure...
it was drawn around the letter...

483
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,403
Iike a design!

484
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,475
What happened to the lette

485
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:47,412
I didn't know what to make of it, so
Ilhad\ our father look at them...

487
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,548
Ah, no... I mean I had a friend who lived
in the neighborhood look at them...

489
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,083
He was a detective story novelist.

490
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,152
H, He showed them to Father?!

491
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:57,856
It seemed that that novelist was busy with
work, and at first he look like

493
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,791
he was in a bad mood

494
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,429
But, as he looked at the letters. . his
expression turned to one with excitement...

496
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:08,766
He took the letters and hid himself
in the room

498
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:13,304
It wasn't a few minutes before
he came out and told me this...

500
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,111
Give this envelope to your aunt.
I really enjoyed it

502
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,947
Professor, you're like the sun!

503
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,617
Thanks to you, the gloominess in me
has been blown away!

505
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,088
What was that envelope?!

506
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,589
I haven't any idea...

507
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,592
The contents of the envelope is probably
how to decode the secret code!

509
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,793
What?

510
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,164
That novelist knew too.

511
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:43,134
This secret code was all in "hiragana

512
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,802
H,Hiragana?

513
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,504
Onan, is it really...

514
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,974
The letter was written entirely in
hiragana" as a key telling

516
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,212
the reader
to read the figures in "hiragana"!

518
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,548
I see...

519
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:01,953
It's best to think, that the sender of those
Ietters and the person who

521
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,190
wrote this secret code, are both the
same person...

523
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:09,360
But... why did he send the secr
code to my aunt...

525
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,530
He didn't want anybody but your aunt
Oo know...

527
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,866
For example, someone was after him...

528
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,269
Come to think of it... my aunt said this...

529
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,506
A strange guy often peeks
into the mailbox...

531
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:26,211
That's probably the guy who slashed
up the toys...

533
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:32,884
Something's going on after all...
This house...
