Then...

79
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:15,501
Hey. what's up?

80
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,471
Vodka!!

81
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,307
You're there, aren't you?

82
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,242
They've found out!

83
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,679
They've found out that
we failed to open the e-mail at this villa!

85
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,313
Yeah...

86
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,315
Hey. answer me!!

87
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,352
I know you're there at the villa!!

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,525
Hurry up and answer me,
will you, Mr. Itakura!!

91
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,261

Hey. answer me!
I Know you're there at the villa!

98
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:04,083
Hurry up and answer me, Mr. Itakura!!

99
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,687
I guess we've got no choice

100
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:13,159
but to hide ourselves in the blizzard
and make it out the back door...

103
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,662
Oh, sorry...

104
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,232
It's so dark in here that I was having
trouble picking up the phone...

106
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,934
Hey. hey, hey?!

107
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,472
It seems that the electrical circuit
went out because of this blizzard...

109
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,275
I couldn't open the mail
because of this too...

111
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,275
Phooey...

112
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:34,246
That's what you get for trying to receive
mail in a mountain villa like that...

114
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,481
Hey. wait a minute!

115
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,818
How come your answer phone's working
despite the black out?!

117
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,056
Yeah, well black outs are frequent in
this area because it snows a lot...

119
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,227
That's why I'm using a phone
equipped with a built-in battery.

121
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,263
Oh, I see...

122
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,269
It's amazing how...
you found out I was here...

124
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,371
Ha, ha. ha...

125
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,542
We know all about you...

126
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:04,176
Huh

127
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,514
Don't tell me you were keeping watch
over this villa, were you?

129
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,484
Don't worry, we weren't

130
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,521
Just as promised
we're nowhere near you

132
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:20,426
More importantly,
did you finish the system software?

134
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,394
Yeah, somehow...

135
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,764
Is there anyone with you?!

136
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,168
Hey, answer me!
What as that sound just now?

138
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,003
Sound?

139
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,737
The wind...

140
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,175
The sound of the wind
tapping on the window.

142
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:36,942
Oh...

143
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,445
That's right,
I SS SNOWING Yeaviy over ere 00...

145
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,848
So. I can't use the computer...

146
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,951
I hate to say this,
but won't you give me the info directly...

148
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,021
The time and place of where
I should hand this software over to you...

150
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:50,088
Phooey...

151
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,624
No choice...

152
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,094
I'll say it just. once, so listen well

153
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,197
You know that station that's under
construction called Kenbashi, don't you?

155
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,067
The fashionable station that's going
to be added to the Toto Subway Line...

157
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,403
Tomorrow morning at midnight...

158
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,572
Come and wait in front of coin
Iocker number 0032

160
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,241
Iocated on the basement floor
of the station...

163
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:13,778
Don't forget to bring the
system software, got that...

166
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,917
No...tomorrow s a bad day...

167
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:18,884
What?!

168
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,088
I'm going~to have to be:hospitalized
from this evening for a health check...

170
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,126
You know about it, don't you?
About my bad heart condition

172
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,362
Don't tell me that you're
trying to buy-time

174
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:34,099
because you still haven't
completed that software?

176
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:38,103
No... it's completed all right...

177
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,172
Then, when is it convenient for you?

178
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,475
After I'm discharged from the hospital,
so about three to four days later...

182
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,878
No. give me five days...

184
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,846
You idiot!

185
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,748
We can't wait that long!

186
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,850
Extend your hospitalization!!

187
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:55,421
I finally got an appointment
with a famous heart surgeon,

189
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,122
so I can't move the date...

190
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,358
If I were to hand it over to you
before I enter the hospital,.

192
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,292
It has to be today

193
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,295
but the construction people
will be there at daybreak

195
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,299
It's not convenient for
you guys then, is it?

197
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,501
At 4:00 then...

198
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,937
Four hours from now at 4.00 a.m...

199
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,007
Bring the software to the place *
I just gave you info on

201
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,609
Four hours from now?

202
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,078
From Gunma to Tokyo?!

203
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,612
What's the problem?

204
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,282
If it's completed you should be able to
bring it with you, shouldn't you?

206
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,120
Okay. ..four hours from now,
I'll take it there

208
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,321
Huh?

209
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,290
But, don't ambush me...

210
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:36,795
If I spot any of your people
this entire deal if off

212
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,698
Even if you were to force
this software away from me

214
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,967
keep in mind that doing so may throw
the method of using this software

216
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,969
into the pits of darkness forever...

217
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,004
Phooey...

218
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,040
You're sure a cautious fellow,
just like rumor has it.

220
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,410
Okay. four hours from now!

221
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,881
In front of locker number 0032
at the basement of Kenbashi Station.

223
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,949
Don't be late...

224
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,417
Yeah...

225
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,056
All right. I got them!!

227
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,692
Hey. just what do you intend to do?

228
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:11,497
Don't tell me that you're going to listen
to them and take that software over?

230
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,499
I'm not listening-to them...

231
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:15,434
I lead the conversation so that

232
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,671
the hand over time of the software
would be rushed to 4:00 this morning,

234
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,106
by sounding flustered!

235
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,208
What?!

236
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:28,380
The news of Mr. Itakura's death may
be aired when morning comes. right?

238
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,616
If they find out.

239
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,719
Then this deal as well as clues about
them will go down the drain...

241
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,754
Now. the jewelry robber who is at large...

242
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,856
Fortunately. it seems that none of the

243
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,224
stations are covering news
about his case yet

245
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,628
Which means, this is what you
intended to do to begin with?

247
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,395
Yeah...

248
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,231
I was planning to tell them to rush
the hand over time to an earlier time,

250
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,435
when I receive the e-mail from them...

252
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,506
Let's erase all traces of
us having been here

254
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,776
and get out of here with
your beetle. Doc!

256
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,478
Out of here...

257
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,916
They maybe watching us from
somewhere around this villa, right?

259
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,719
If we carelessly go out just like that
to the car that's parked outside,

261
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,621
they may spot us...

262
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,457
Don't worry!

263
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,960
If Vodka or any of his
people were around

265
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,097
they would've easily seen through my lie
about the electrical circuits going out,

267
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,566
sO that I cant use the computer...

268
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,404
I see. that's why you turned
on the lights to this villa?

270
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,338
Yah...

271
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,975
We know at the least that
none of his people are at a distance

273
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,878
where they can see the lights of the villa!

274
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,948
If"!
They probably tracked this place.

278
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,683
Using some alarm system
that would warn them

280
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,220
and specify the computer of the one
they re sending the mail to.

282
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,923
Just in case the mail that they sent isn't
opened by the receiver of the mail

284
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:46,692
Either way

285
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,360
part of the members of
the their group will be arrested...

287
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:53,098
I'll confirm the contents of this software
with the lap top computer in the beetle,

289
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,335
and if it's some outrageous
software that could

291
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,470
be used for a hideous
crime or something...

293
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,572
You're going to report it to the police

294
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,441
and specify the place of the deal.

295
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,545
So they can ambush the culprits
and arrest whoever shows up!

297
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:08,480
Yeah...

298
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,683
Damn! No good!

299
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,988
You need to enter a password
for this software too!!

301
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:22,027
Just like the e-mail a password's been
set between Mr. Itakura and those guys

303
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,363
Then, just make a copy of it for now...

304
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,331
I can't do that either

305
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,034
It's protected with a copy guard.

306
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,970
Under this condition,
the police won't move!!

308
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,475
Aren't they always secretly
armed with guns?

310
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,577
If you report that there will be
a deal involving guns,

312
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,447
maybe at least two or three
officers will come...

314
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,383
We don't even know how many
those guys have on their side.

316
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,618
So. with 2 only a small
number on our side,

318
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,320
we're more likely to be
biting off our own heads...

320
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,456
Unless we find out what their purpose is

321
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,691
and present evidence to the police
as to how dangerous they are,

323
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,359
as well as how large
their organization is,

325
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,096
and have the police come
equipped with sufficient men,

327
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,665
it'll be difficult to lay our hands on them

328
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,435
Hmm...how frustrating...

329
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:07,206
We know that they're coming
and yet we can't do a thing about it...

331
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,608
Not really. there's still a way...

332
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,209
Huh

333
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,212
It's a bit dangerous. though...

334
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,615
Hey. hey, don't tell me that
you're planning to meet them directly...

336
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,920
Hey. Doc. don't tell me that...

337
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,156
Yeah, you're most probably right...

338
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,361
It's a flat: after all...

339
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:34,867
We've got to call a nearby service station
and have them bring us over a spare tire

341
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,336
Is it going to work?

342
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,772
I don't think there's any service station
that'll come at this time of night!

344
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,976
Well. we may as well relax
and wait in the car then!

346
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,946
We won't make it in time for
meeting those guys if we do that!

348
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,517
I'm sure that this is God's
way of telling you

350
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:54,086
to keep from taking dangerous
action, Shinichi!

352
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,355
Dang!

353
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:58,724
Hmm

354
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,827
A...car?!

355
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,898
Hey! Hey!

356
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,270
What's up?

357
00:11:11,703 --> 00:11:14,806
Oh. well. uh, we got a flat...

358
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,411
We want to go back to Tokyo.
But won't you give us a lift?

360
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:20,846
Tokyo?

361
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,981
Yoh. what do you say?

362
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,284
Why not?
We're going in that direction anyway...

364
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:27,519
Gramps,

365
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,254
are you familiar with the
roads around here?

367
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,789
Well, yes, sort of...

368
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,891
Okay. gramps. you get in the front seat

369
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,626
and the kid in the back seat...

370
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,395
Thanks...

371
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,738
I'm sorry to intrude on you
when you were sleeping. miss...

373
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,108
It's okay. I was just kind of dozing...

374
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,588
Wow, cool!
This is a foreign car, isn't it?!

376
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,223
Um. is this car yours. sir?

377
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,058
Yeah...

378
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,028
I've gotten tired of it and was just thinking
of getting myself another car though!

380
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:13,332
You must be rich,

381
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,801
because this car is really expensive!

382
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,101
Sort of...

383
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,973
Although he may not look it,
he's the heir to a big company, you know.

385
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,113
Oops...

386
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,890
That sure was close...
Snowy roads are dangerous after all...

388
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,994
Well, let's not rush and drive safely!

389
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:45,864
Hey...

390
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,300
Didn't you hear something
funny just now?

392
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,701
Yeah?

393
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,837
I didn't hear anything...

394
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,540
The stuff that we have in
the trunk probably moved...

396
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,743
It's nothing to sweat about...

397
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,978
Hey, don't smoke!!

398
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,949
Did you forget that 1 hate cigarettes?!

399
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,918
Oh, sorry... that's right...

400
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,822
Oh, to go to Tokyo turn left there...

401
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,124
Oops...

402
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,028
It's stopped snowing so I guess
we can get there before 03:00

404
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,701
But why were you guys in Gunma?

405
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,870
Were you skiing with your grandson?

406
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,439
I guess you could say so...

407
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,674
Sounds great...

408
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,519
Hey! Watch where you're going!!

409
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,787
Sorry, sorry...

410
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:45,057
I shouldn't have driven in
the snow after all...

412
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,566
Strange...

413
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,803
There's something fishy about them...

414
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,138
Don't tell me that...

415
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,543
Don't tell me that, they're...

416
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,018
Oops.

417
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:15,954
Whew...

418
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,690
What's with you anyway?!

419
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:22,327
How many times do you think
you got honked at already?!

421
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:26,064
Didn't I tell you that
I'm not good at driving on snowy roads?

423
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,469
You're right!

424
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,138
This car needs a tune up
and hasn't got its safety check yet,

426
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,940
SO you've got to drive more carefully!

427
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:35,440
Huh

428
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,644
You're going to get a safety check
for this car soon, aren't you?

430
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,046
Yeah...

431
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,948
I guess so...

432
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,251
You don't remember?

433
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,856
The number 2 is written on
the sticker on the windshield!

435
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,193
That's the inspection'cértificate
and depending on the number

437
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:58,363
and the color of the.sticker'it tells you
when yousre_supposed to be getting

439
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,465
your next=safety check. rigt?

440
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,769
The color is this year's color.

441
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:07,172
So it's obvious that you have to get
your safety check by February this year...

443
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,808
Oh, that's right I remember now!!

444
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:10,942
Come to think of it.

445
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,545
I got a postcard saying for me to go
get my safety check within this month...

447
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,281
But. sonny. when did you see it?

448
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,250
The sticker was covered with snow...

449
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,484
See.

450
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,121
I saw it when the on-coming
car passed us.

452
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,490
When the headlights shined on it

453
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,893
the number outside could be
seen transparent from the back...

455
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:28,627
Huh

456
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,168
Oh, I see!

457
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,805
I thought it was "2" because
I saw it transparent from behind

459
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,673
but it was actually "5"!

460
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,241
But. t hat's strange...

461
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,844
You got a postcard saying that
you had to go get a safety check

463
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,779
within the month of February. right?

464
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,314
I wonder why...

465
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,816
Oh, well,

466
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,517
you see, that's...

467
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,220
Didn't] just tell you a while ago sonny.

468
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,455
That he's a Richie Rich!

469
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,425
That's why he leaves all the details
up to others to do it for him...

471
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,160
He answered you casually
but the thing is,

473
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,230
he's not even bothered about
the date of the safety check

475
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,198
Oh...

476
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,068
you've got to turn right over there,
or we won't make it to Tokyo...

478
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:10,669
Huh

479
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:15,440
I tell you

480
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,609
I mean the kid keeps blabbing on so...

481
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,644
I'm sorry...

482
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:22,280
He's such a curious child...

483
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,583
Well. I guess it can't be helped...

484
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,951
Okay...there...

485
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,991
By the way sonny...

486
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,093
what are you listening to?

487
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,695
Oh. this?

488
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,197
I'm listening to the news!

489
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,665
News?

490
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:41,800
Yep!

491
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,835
There are all kinds of news!

492
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:49,341
About economy picking up and
the new coach of Big Osaka...

494
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,777
Or about the jewelry robber
who is on the run!

497
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:57,148
you're still so little,
yet you like news...

499
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:57,983
Yep!

500
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,954
And? Was the robber caught?

501
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,189
Nope...

502
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,325
They're still escaping
somewhere in the Gunma area!

504
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,594
But. I'm sure they'll be arrested soon!

505
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,762
Because see.

506
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,999
They seem to have checkpoints here
there and everywhere like over there.

508
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,343
License please...

509
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:26,810
Yeah...

510
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,283
Excuse me, but where did
you come from?

512
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,718
Uh, well...

513
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,154
Agh, Officer Yamamura!!

514
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:36,655
Huh

515
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,524
You're, if I remember correctly, Conan

516
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,493
Uh, Officer Yamamura

517
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:45,931
this Is a checkpoint to arrest
the jewelry shop robbers, right?

519
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,198
Yeah...

520
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,769
There are group of three
wearing baseball caps!

522
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,738
After robbing a jewelry shop in Gunma

523
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,376
they abandoned the car they made their

524
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,011
getaway with in the
mountains and vanished...

526
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:07,385
But one of the three is hurt,
so I don't think they got too far away yet.

528
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:09,254
Hurt?

529
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,555
Ri ht!

530
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,457
When we got the report,

531
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,294
I just happened to be nearby
doing some questioning

533
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,562
When I got to the scene of the crime

534
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,733
I happened to run into the robbers
who fled out of the shop!

536
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,804
So I pulled out my gun and said.

537
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,307
Freeze. freeze. or I'll shoot!!

538
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,476
Wow, cool!

539
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,779
But the robbers refused to stop.

540
00:18:34,946 --> 00:18:37,082
So I fired a warning shot towards them...

541
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:37,849
Hey!

542
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,451
Bang!

543
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,989
And. I hit one of the robbers in the tigh!

544
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:44,589
E-hem!

545
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,592
We, anyway!

546
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:52,364
Either they had another car stashed
away in the mountains before hand

548
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,968
or they stole a car that coincidentally
passed through and are on the run!

550
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,038
Didnst you see some
suspicious looking people?

552
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,806
Yeah, I did!

553
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,242
You mean people who are riding
in a car that is not theirs, right?

555
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,477
Huh

556
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:08,246
That's us!

557
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:08,813
Huh?

558
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,118
My car tire went flat in the mountains,

559
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,021
so we had them give us a lift.

560
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,022
Right

561
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,893
Dr. Agasa. then where is your car?

562
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:26,064
I called the car dealer and they said
they'd come get it in the morning.

564
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,533
So I left it in the mountains
with the key inside...

566
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,536
Then. isn't your car in trouble?

567
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,270
Huh

568
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,107
Maybe the robbers got a hold of it
and are riding it around

570
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,277
That's possible...

571
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:40,378
Then,

572
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:45,083
maybe you shouldn't-be bothering with
us and keeping watch over that car.

574
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,819
It's a yellow beetle, so it's easy to spot!

575
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,121
How strange...

576
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,158
Your voices...sound familiar...

577
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,893
I donst think so...

578
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,629
So. may we go now, officer?

579
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:05,470
Uh will you take that jacket
you have over your lap. just in case?

581
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,438
Hey!

582
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,606
Don't tell me you suspect us?

583
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,177
See. I haven't been shot or anything!

584
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,878
I guess not...

585
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,514
Be careful, then!!

586
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,591
Yawn...

587
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,563
Yes. this is the Agasa residence...

588
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,364
Huh

589
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,999
The Gunma Prefectural police?

590
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,268
According to Dr. Agasa.

591
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,639
He said that the dealers would be
picking his car up in the morning...

593
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:47,512
But, leaving the car as is in the mountains
may give the robbers a chance to use it

595
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:51,583
so we have decided
to tow it away for now...

597
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:57,255
So. please tell him to come and
pick his car up at the station...

599
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,756
Oh. yes. I will...

600
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,858
Goodbye then

601
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,060
Thank you...

602
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,599
I wonder what they're doing in
Gunma at this time of day?

604
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,036
I'll bet he was talked
into by Shinichi again

606
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,272
and went sticking their noses
into a criminal case or something...

608
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,175
Really...

609
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,610
I don't see what thrill they
find in looking for

611
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,211
faults in others at
the cost of losing sleep .

613
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:22,881
I see no fun.at all in playing detective...

614
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,849
Yawn...

615
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,993
Spare pair of pursuit glasses...

616
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,675
Yeah, we're going to pick up
the stuff earlier than scheduled

618
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,511
An hour from now. at 4:00

619
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,280
The place remains unchanged.

620
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,582
It's inn front of the locker in the basement
of Kenbashi Subway Station...

622
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,485
Tell Gin about this too. will you...

623
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,756
Yeah, of course...

624
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,326
Get the men ready armed with guns...

625
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,063
He could've gone chicken
and called the cops...

627
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,467
Either way, after the deal,
it's good riddance with him anyway...

629
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,372
We were planning to get rid of him
inside Kenbashi Station to begin with...
