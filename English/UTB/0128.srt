00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,739
the mysterious organization
of men in black.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,608
Conan's target finally appears.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,743
It smells of a serious crime.

6
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,612
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,747
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult.

9
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:15,915
No case is left unsolved when
Detective Conan comes to the scene

They're robbing the armored
cash transport truck of the bank!!

64
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,465
There are two robbers...

65
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,469
One is armed with a shotgun
d the other with a gun...

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,274
Re he other security guards...

00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,760
It's an cash transport armored car robbery!

77
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,095
What!

78
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,963
Ran:.please call the police

79
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,031
Hey, Conan

80
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,167
Get an ambulance too, because there
seems to be some people who are hurt!

82
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:05,171
Ran, notify the bank first! I'll go check
on the people who are hurt!

84
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,772
Okay!

85
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,047
Talk about high speed

86
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,649
It:s as if we're having a car race!!

87
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,251
I can barely keep up with them!

88
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,860
Great! A railway crossing!
All n ht.éthen!

90
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,462
What the .?!!

91
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,131
He's going to run the crossing?!

92
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:34,800
I'm not letting them get away!!?

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,155
They got away!

94
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:08,167
What?! One billion yen was stolen?!

95
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,137
Yeah: all the cash-that was
suppesed to be delivered

97
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,340
from the main bank to
all the branches were stolen.

99
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,709
One billien, eh...

100
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:21,547
Conan, you're sure of the license
plate number you just gave me?

102
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,950
Yes. I'm sure!

103
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:27,687
There are two of them armed
nth a shotgun and a gun, eh...

105
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:32,491
Well, fortunately, the security guard
wasnit seriously hurt

107
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:37,028
The armored truck stopped. so we
were getting ready to unload the cash.

109
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,699
That's when we were suddenly
tacked by the robbers.

111
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,707
Mr. Koyama?! Mr. Murata?!

112
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,643
Hey! Driver!! Is somebody there?!

113
00:06:55,682 --> 00:07:00,253
Since I got no response from the driver
! dhought they were killed and

115
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,723
had no choice but to open the door.

116
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,659
Strange... I'm sure that back then I...

117
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,862
After hearingathe gun and
the window crack,

119
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,866
Il ran right over to the entrance: of
he parking lot and looked in...

121
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,603
At that time. they were already
Ioading the cash out of the ruck.

123
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:22,141
He shouldn't have had
any time to call the driver!

125
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,544
You understand too, don't you?

126
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,412
I really had no other choice...

127
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:31,217
Excuse me, sir.
You sure are lucky, sir.

129
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,285
Huh?... Why am I lucky?

130
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,755
Because, The window of
the armored truck is smoked

132
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:39,225
so that you canit see anything
from thesoutside, right?

134
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,293
Yeah...

135
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:45,097
The bullet that was fired through that
smeked window, and yet it didn'tihit you.

137
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:49,368
Besides, the bullet hit the coin bag,
so it didnit bounce back at you.

139
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:53,372
You had to either be real lucky,
or had planned

141
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:57,910
where to place theacoin bag and
where-to hide beforehand, right?

143
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,113
Don't be ridiculous

144
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,851
This is still just a possible deduction...

145
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,787
But...

146
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:12,058
Ms. Hirota!" Where were you
at a time like this?!

148
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:15,795
I'm sorry, I changed shifts
and went out to lunch...

150
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:18,464
Talk about the young girls nowadays...

151
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:24,070
Just-what time do you think it is?!
Is your watch broken or something?

153
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:28,608
There is one other ossibility...

154
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,243
Inspecter Megure!

155
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,378
What's up, Detective.Takagi?

156
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:37,183
There was a report that what looked
to be the runaway van was found.

158
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,051
What?! Where?

159
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:43,589
By the rive bed of the Teimutsu River.
Beside the TR railway bridge!

161
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,593
Okay. let's head eff. right away.
Come with me teo, Mr. Mourn:.

163
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:51,597
Sure! Ran, you take:Conan

165
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,199
Okay!

166
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:01,474
Let's get geing then.!Conan... Cenan?!

167
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,944
Ugh, he's gone again!

168
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,685
So, what's the stery, Tome?

169
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,553
Oh. Inspector Megure...

170
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:19,892
I just took a quick look=but-the
fingerprints have been wiped off clean

172
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,760
What other clues are left?

173
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:27,366
Well, as for pretty large sized clues,
there are 5 cases in the bed of the truck.

175
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,769
There are no fingerprints on them either...

176
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,438
Hey, bring me the stuff
we found "a while ago!

178
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:36,175
This was thrown out
on the driver's seat.

180
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,645
H. thanks... Take a look at this...

181
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,781
These are...

182
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,183
A mask-and gloves...

184
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,920
VV, Adllliuylil 111 piewy suie
we can't expect any prints on them either...

186
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,323
Oh, sowyou're here too, eh, boy

187
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,526
Hello. Mr. Tome!

188
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,729
Hey! I thaugfit I field you to go
on home with Ran!?

190
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,199
H. there s something on
Be inside of the mask...

192
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,402
On the inside of the mask?

193
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,606
What's this pink colored soil?

194
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,877
This pink.celer is...~ but, why:.

195
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,546
Okay. then! I'm berrowing this for a while!

196
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,418
Ustias'l thought...

198
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:24,223
You don't "ow me! What do you think
A If, ,_lr\__., . o, -r\_ ,.\_(\»,-¢_,,_¢ A A,
YOU I QGUITIY WILIT LI 11ijpouitarinil ciue >

201
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,359
That's enough, kid!!

202
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:31,964
So, the case started off as
an-ordinary case of robbery...

204
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,769
Hewever... This is no
ordinary case of robbery.

206
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,841
1t didn't take me long to prove
that my hunch was right. .!

208
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,204
What?! The robber
the other day was killed?!

210
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:51,344
Yeah a former racer, Jiro Kaizuka
was found shot to death in bed.

212
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:55,081
I see... No wonder
they earned it out so fast...

214
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,284
How did they figure out
that he was the robber?

216
00:11:58,352 --> 00:12:01,220
A- memo.ofithe blueprint of the bank.

217
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,423
The schedule of the armered
cash transport truck.

219
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:08,694
As well as a map of the get away
route were found in his roem

221
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:16,702
Furthermore... Anoether persen was killed
astinight with same gun.he had...

223
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,838
What?!

224
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,973
Securit. guard, Kishii!

225
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:24,976
Which means that Mr Ki
was also a member of the group...

227
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,914
I'm sure he was an aceemplice

228
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,850
He liked gambling and seemed
o have a lot of debts

230
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,553
He probably played
the role of being frightened

232
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:37,023
into opening the rear of
the armored truck from the inside

234
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:43,428
The rear door of an armored truck cannot
e opened unless from the inside

236
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:49,836
Does that mean that the two were
maybe killed by the other robber?

238
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:53,840
Probably...: because the meney
that was stolen is gone.

240
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:58,110
The other robber prebably killed
he two to take all the-money .

242
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:02,114
It seems that Inspecter Megure is also
going to check in on things on that line...

244
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,051
But, I'm sure that its - nly a matter
of time before they are caught...

246
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:05,618
at do yeu mean...

247
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:06,652
What do you mean...?

248
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:11,457
Pink colored lipstick was feund
in Kaizuka's room...

250
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,058
Lipstick?

251
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:17,864
It matched the color that was found
on the mask that the robbers left behind...

253
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,198
Mereover...

254
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:24,537
It also matched the color that bank teller
Ms. Masami Hirota is using, right?

256
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:26,138
C Conan

257
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:34,947
One of the her colleagues testified that
it matched the color of lipstick she is using

259
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:38,150
She left-the bank saying
she was going out lunch

261
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:43,222
so I'm sure she went to
the back door and joined them

263
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,158
But, why would a bank employee
do somethingdike-that?

265
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:53,633
Il don't know., but 'she has
already quit the bank

267
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:56,034
She handed in a resignation: this morning.

268
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,637
What?!

269
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:02,707
She started working fer this bank
only half a year ago

271
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,043
What do you meanv

272
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,712
She just snuck into the bank to cheek
things out before committing the crime...

274
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:10,183
It's more natural if you think of it that way.

275
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:12,851
Well, I guess that how:it.is...

276
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:17,255
I'm sure... I'm sure that is the way
things took place on the whole .

278
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,125
But there is s ill one question left...

279
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:23,396
I wonder if she would-really
ake her lipstiek.rub off...

281
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:27,934
After all, she spentia half a year
to check the bank out...

283
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:33,272
esides, the lipstick on
the mask-was situated too low,

285
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,742
that the chin would be there and
1 ot the lips And above all...

287
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:42,348
it would've smelled of make-up
if she wore the mask.

289
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,284
But there was no such smell on it...

290
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:51,691
If someon jschemedythis all and
Is trying to frame her up~as the robber

292
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,826
Oh ne!

293
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:56,229

294
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,165

Since the only fingerprints found
on the gun were hers

448
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:35,681
it was concluded that she committed
suicide thinking she could not get away.

450
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:40,486
The one billion yen that was robbed
was safely recovered

452

the case was closed
