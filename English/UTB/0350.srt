89
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,841
In trouble if you don't get up...

90
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,862
You're the one
who's still groggy and not awake!!

92
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:08,580
Check the number
before you make the call!!

96
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,151
Uh=excuse me...but could itabe that...

97
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:13,819
Huh ?!

98
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,555
B,business is...slow?

99
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,323
AY -—

102
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:22,060
we didn't get any calls-all this week...

103
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,397
T,The thing is...Oh

104
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,868
I wonder if it's okay to ask
a detective to do something like this...

106
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,272
Huh? Is something troubling you. Azusa?

107
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,607
Two days ago...

108
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,310
A strange thing was forgotten here

109
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,462
and I was wondering
if you could locate its owner,

111
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:42,848
who is a customer of our shop...

112
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,733
Oh, a search for somebody...

113
00:04:44,734 --> 00:04:47,686
What is it?
That strange-thingathat was forgotten .

115
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,186
NY Lye.

116
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,187
Oh ..yep.

117
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:52,524
It's this

118
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,559
A cell phone?!

122
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,530
It looks tosbe an ordinary cell phone but...

123
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,165
I guess...yes, the pattern is prett odd.

124
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,435
Other than that.
It isn't really all that strange...

126
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:07,739
If the person who forgot
this cell, phone is really looking for it

128
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,939
I'mesure that person will call...

129
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,009
Well. someone did call...

130
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,044
three times...

131
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,011
Three times?!

134
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,681
when I answered the phone...

136
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,783
this is what the first person said...

137
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh? I'm sorry,
I seem {0 have made a mistake...

139
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,921
A mistake?

140
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:24,423
Hmm.

141
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,524
What about the 2nd time?

142
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,859
The 2nd time this is
what the person said...

144
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,362
That's strange...did you hear anything?

145
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:34,299
It seemed like someone else
as beside that person...

147
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,368
Right after saying so,
the phone was cut again...

149
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,769
Oh!! I'm sure that...

150
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,073
the person was.looking for the cell phone

151
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,609
But, since he was looking
in the wrong place.

153
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,944
He couldn't.anything and thought
that he had dialed<the wrong number!

155
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:46,611
All

158
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,548
B.But,

159
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:54,119
it didn't sound like this person was
the owner of this cell phone...

161
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,653
Huh 1

162
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,854
Why not?

163
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,689
Because with the 3rd call...

164
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,692
that person's tone of voice
suddenly changed and.

166
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,829
Hey. you!! Ill bet you're his broad?!

167
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,963
Get him on the line!!

168
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,532
He shouted saying,
I'm going to kill you!

170
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,400
Kill 2

171
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,973
What did you tell him, Azusa?

173
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,675
W...Well...

174
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,641
I hope you explained

175
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:19,111
the circumstances to him" Did you?

176
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,979
I was scared...

178
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,548
so I switched the phone off...

179
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,883
Oh... I see...

180
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,885
Please show me the cell phone!

181
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,522
I fold the master about it the following day,
and was scolded.

183
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,492
So I kept the phone switched
on all day since then,

185
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,994
but the phone hasn't rung so far...

188
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,801
It's no wonder nobody's calling back
on this «cell phone.

190
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,535
Why do you say that?

191
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,271
Because this phone isn't working!

192
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,139
Huh

193
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:54,312
See! Even if I try to make a call
I get the busy signal right away. right?

195
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,514
Truc

196
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,014
I get it?!

197
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,551
The owner of this.cell phone probably
couldn't pay his phone bill

199
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,436
and so his'phone was cut off!!

200
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,388
Which means the rude one

201
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,524
who called
was a money collector!!

203
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,391
In other words,

204
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,177
he called the owner
of the phone thinking he was living alone,

206
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,295
but a woman answered

207
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,531
so thinking he made a mistake,
he hung up.

209
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:16,268
He checked the number and called back

210
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,636
ButOhe [probably blew his top
at the third call!!

212
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,538
But, he probably blew his top
at"the third call!!

214
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,739
Then...

215
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,241
why did the one
who called™the 2nd time say,

217
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,243
Did"it anything?

218
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,980
It's most likely that...

219
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,550
when the collector went to the home
of the owner of this cell phone

221
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,118
and called him from
in front of the apartment

223
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,687
he didn't hear any sound
from inside the apartment

225
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,922
so he thought it was odd...

227
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,392
Do you remember what kind of person

228
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,660
who forgot this cell phone was?

229
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,944
Yup...

230
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,197
He came here a little: after noon...

231
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,800
He was a chubby man wearing glasses
and his hair was parted on the side...

233
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:53,288
He was eating and touching
that flashy cell phone

235
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,656
all the while
so I remember*him very well...

237
00:07:54,657 --> 00:08:00,412
The phone rang for the first time
about an hour after he left...

239
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:04,082
The second call came right after the first

240
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,252
and the third call came in
about 30 minutes later...

242
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,390
The number of the one
who called was notHisplayed...

244
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,560
On top of that,
the record of calls made before that,

246
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,696
as well as the call received records
are not saved at all...

248
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,564
Oh. . there were a lot of

249
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,533
names and numbers left on it

250
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,167
What?!

251
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,604
Then...
why don't you try calling those numbers?

253
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,374
They all seem to have been
random numbers..«and...besides

256
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:33,144
the names all séemed™o be fake 100...

257
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:36,314
It's true...

258
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,918
\ and strange that all the names
are in "katakana characters...

260
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,654
As to the phone numbers...

261
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,123
10277

262
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,658
I see. this is strange...

263
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:51,196
There are no 10 digit numbers
that start with the number one...

265
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:51,663
Huh /!

266
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,500
What's thissblack mark
on the side of the names...

268
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,604
There are some names with black marks
beside them and some without!!

270
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,140
Oh...

271
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,508
True,

272
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,111
there are mankson some
and none on- others

274
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,462
Don't tell me that...

275
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,266
that all these numbers are
all some kind of code?

277
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,819
How annoying!!

281
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,957
19.8
where was this cell phone placed
when it was forgotten?

285
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:19,724
Oh...

287
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,427
Oh:...

288
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,329
Over there.

289
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:24,963
Hmm???

290
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:29,150
Under the sofa
where you're sitting right now, Mr. Mourn.

292
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,403
He probably dropped it accidentally

293
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,071
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

294
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,474
Without realizing he dropped it...

295
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,243
he kicked the cellphone with his foot...

296
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,712
That show think it got there; but...

297
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,432
Like I just explained

298
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,768
I found the cell phone right after

299
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,920
the man called the first time...

300
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,524
The antenna was sticking out besides! 3

301
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,291
What?!

302
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:59,230
Was the cell phone
folded in two like thistback then?

306
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:00,966
Y Yup

307
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,702
That's why I thought he dropped it V
when he tried to put it in his pocket.

309
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:06,171
Don't you think it's odd?

310
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,439
Uh?. What is...

311
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,909
Because if he folded the cellphone
to put into his pocket,

313
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,446
don't you think he 'd-naturally
push the antenna back in too?

316
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,880
Right!

317
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:18,984
Because you don't want
the antenna to break!

319
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,254
He probably didn't do so
because he's either a very sloppy.guy .\=s

324
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:29,561
He did so and deliberately hid it...
wanting someone to find it when it rang...

326
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,031
What do you think, Pops!!

327
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,735
Yeah... I was just about to say so...

328
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,772
Hmm...
but if so. for whatever reason...?

330
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,876
You can't figure out who the owner is...
after all...?

332
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,543
Huh?

333
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,512
Oh if it's the owner of this cell phone,
\ Il know who it is!

336
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,980
\ Huh}! But how?

337
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:58,223
Every cell phone has seal
with its product number written on it...

339
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:02,226
If we give that number
to the manufacturer,

341
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,596
then find out
where the cell phone was bought,

343
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,364
explain the circumstances to the shoy),

344
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,235
we can get the name of the owner
of the cell phone!!!

346
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,736
WwW Wow!

347
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,737
Fuh fuh, fun.

348
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,240
Youtake off-the back cover
of 'the cell phone

350
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,976
And under the place py
where the battery is removed...

353
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:20,678
Agh!!
N Not inside?!

355
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,980
The seal...

356
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,281
Is peeled off!!

357
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,599
W. Why?

359
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,952
Can you tell us more in detail
about the customer

361
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,721
who forgot this cell phone?

362
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,390
More in detail...

363
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,792
Even the slightest detail

364
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,860
even if it seems trivial Anything!!

365
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,862
Well...Come to

366
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:40,765
think 'of it «

368
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:43,301
That customer ordered...

369
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:48,339
fried noodles, spaghetti, fruit parfait,
tomato juice and Caesar's salad

371
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,508
and paid exactly 3,000 yen!

372
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,293
Uh?! T.Three thousand yen...?

373
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,077
Uh?! T, Three thousand yen...

374
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:54,178
Huh 21

376
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,981
Well, ordering the 5 items
he ordered is the only way

379
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,883
to come up with a total of
exactly 3.000 yen,

382
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,952
so I was sort of impressed...

385
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,856
Since Conan said that
any trivial detail would do.

388
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,025
I thought I'd mention it

392
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:12,597
the guy sure is a big eater,
eating § items from\noon...

394
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,134
Right. he seemed to be on the job
and yet I thought to myself

396
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,802
he sure can eat...

397
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:18,837
On the job?

398
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,839
Because.
He...

400
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,475
asked for a receipt.

401
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,343
Receipt?!

402
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,577
W. What the name on it?!

403
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,581
F course. "Customer...

404
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,216
Oh, I guess so...

407
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,889
I'll be waiting for your ballot for me!

409
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,856
I will do my best for you all

410
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:41,126
Is IX
as I have been doing so far!

412
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:42,594
ell! LB

413
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,096
But...

414
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,600
1 If he was eating alone
and still wanted a receipt...

416
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,101
The probability of him
being an ordinary office worker

418
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:52,202
becomes quite unlikely.

419
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:57,108
If so:then...what on earth...

420
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,364
He is most probably an office worker
on a business trip

422
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,866
He is most probably an office worker
on a business trip

425
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,534
or a man who owns his own business.

426
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:11,039
He could be a[person
with that kind of habit.

428
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:11,573
If so...maybe

429
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:14,943
he's'a. journalist or a detective!...

430
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,045
Even the police ask for receipts.

432
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,250
Police officers in police boxes
ask for receipts for meals they have.

434
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:24,219
Oh...no. no...

435
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:26,955
Hello...Agh?!

437
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,741
That only goes for police-detectives!

438
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,793
Ope you on min mesjoining you.

439
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:36,865
When: they go asking around.or
on a stake out,

441
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:37,731
or have to follow the suspect

443
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:40,468
for transportation fee

444
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:42,470
and'fobdsand drinks needed
during the investigation...

447
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:46,941
But, we officers in uniforms rarely use
investigationsfeex

449
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:48,308
O.Oh., you're the one

452
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,478
who's always hanging!
Around with Officer Takagi...

457
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,080
What brings you here. Yuma?

458
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:52,614
What brings you here. Yuma'?

459
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:53,047
What else but to

460
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:57,851
urge Mr. Detective here
who takes forever to pay

462
00:13:57,852 --> 00:13:59,553
for his parking ticket to pay.

463
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:03,157
Oh, well,
I was thinking of going to pay today...

466
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:05,260
Today is Sunday!!

467
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,594
Agh?! EeeeeKk...

468
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,646
I'm only joking...

469
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,699
We're looking for a man...

470
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,483
Huh)!

471
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,068
Dooco

472
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,970
this is the only clue we have...

473
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,072
Three?!

474
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,108
Three thousand yen?!

475
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,075
Is his by chance

477
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:23,011
wearing glasses
and has his hair parted on the side?

479
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:24,913
A chubby.man?!

480
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,283
Do you know where he is?

481
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,184
Well, sort of.

483
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,085
I'm glad!!

484
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:31,452
I'm glad!!

485
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,955
I can finally give the cell phone
back to its owner

487
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,323
Huh?! What do you mean give back?

488
00:14:35,324 --> 00:14:39,827
That man-forgot his cell phone here...

489
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,362
I also got strange calls too...

490
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:42,664
so I was really concerned.

492
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:44,132
Oh...

493
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,601
But. you can't return it to him...

494
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,636
Because...

495
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,238
he passed away the night before last...

496
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:52,173
Pa. ..Passed away?!

497
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,341
Huh'!

498
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:55,343
OO... Oh no.

499
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:58,062
Don't tell me he wastkilled?!

501
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:02,350
He was run over by a truck
at the 3-chome intersection.

503
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,385
Aicar-accident?

504
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:05,637
Yeah...

505
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,804
I remember.

506
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,858
They aired that accident on the news...

507
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:11,993
Yes...

508
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,094
The accident occurred

509
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:14,996
the day before yesterday
just before 14:00...

511
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,365
He was taken to the hospital immediately,

512
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,900
but he didn't make it...

513
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:19,100
He passed away... .that night.

515
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,835
He passed away...that night.

517
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,202
He passed away that night

518
00:15:21,203 --> 00:15:24,105
That's why were investigating trying to

519
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:26,007
identify who he is.

520
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,308
Wait a minute...

521
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,445
Don't tell me this was a hit-and-run case?

522
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,030
00000

523
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:37,452
The driver of the truck that
hit the man didn't flee.

525
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,288
Nor was: he under the influence
of alcohol

527
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,223
According to testimony by the witness. +

528
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:44,559
the man seems to have
suddenly come running

530
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,211
out from behind,a parked car...

531
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:52,000
Which means this excludes
the possibility of homicide...

533
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,335
Don't tell me?!
Could it have been suicide!

535
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,471
That's very unlikely

536
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:59,958
because he seems: to. have asked for
directions at the convenience store

538
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,342
near the accident site:before he was hit...

539
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,012
He seems: to-have been
in a great bigsrush and asked,

541
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:07,782
Do you know where a shop
called Poirot is?

543
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:09,317
If he was planning to kill himself

544
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:11,953
Why would he need to ask
about the location \

546
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,388
of a shop that is 2 kilometers away?

547
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,656
True...

548
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,058
But. I kind of have an idea

549
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,494
why that person rushed out
into the street.

551
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:20,495
Yeah...

552
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,829
In other words

553
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,898
({ the man wanted to go back to the shop
to retrieve the cell phone

555
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,400
he had forgotten there.

556
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,468
And was run over by the truck...

557
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,020
No..lwrong...

559
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,439
The dead man-s lips are sealed.

560
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,542
We're back to zero again...

561
00:16:34,543 --> 00:16:37,345
The cell phone was folded in two
with it's antenna sticking out

563
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:40,348
and left here as if it were hidden here...

564
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:44,986
It's like the cell phone, was ringing
just so that somebody would find it...

566
00:16:44,987 --> 00:16:51,793
Those strange names and numbers
that were saved in the cell phone...

568
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,528
What were they anyway?

569
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:57,165
What on earth was that man
trying to do here?

571
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:02,236
But two days have already gone
by since the accident.

573
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:03,905
It sure took you long to get here...

574
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,807
We couldn't help it

575
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:09,644
because herhad nothing on him
that would givesus a clue to who he was...

577
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:12,113
Oh, right...but he did have

578
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,647
all these receipts on him.

579
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,048
All these receipts ornhim.

580
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:16,217
All of these here...

582
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:20,722
He sure meticulously kept
allithese receipts...

584
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:24,192
iaido...
sen en as il...

586
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:26,861
He's gone all around the city...

588
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,062
Right.

589
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,863
We checked those]receipts
in order of, the dates.

592
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:29,113
We checked those [receipts
in order of the dates,

595
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,964
We checked those receipts
in order of the dates.

597
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:32,366
) and it took us one-whole day...

599
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:35,169
But. we finally got here...

600
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,339
There were people
who remembered him too, however wus

602
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,809
nobody knew who he was
or where he came from...

604
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,479
but. things as they are.

605
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,083
There's a possibility that
he was being pursued by loan sharks too.

608
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:50,585
Loan sharks.

609
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,819
Yeah...

610
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,822
There seems to have been a call
on the cell phone

612
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,759
that he forgot
from a dangerous sounding man

614
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,828
shouting,
If you don't put?him on. I'll kill you."

616
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,562
Really?

617
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,364
Oh...yes,

618
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:06,733
three times. about an hour
after the man left.

620
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:07,868
At any.rate,

621
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,905
I'd advise you
to go check the loan sharks.

623
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:12,373
If he did borrow money,

624
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:16,177
he would've left his address
and name with them too.

626
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,745
Aha. ha. ha, ha. ha, ha!

627
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:19,914
Huh? What?!

628
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:23,117
I think you can easily:find out
without doing something like that.

630
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:23,785
Huh...

631
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:27,188
Because the dangerous man
who called knows

633
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,124
the number of the cell phone. right?

634
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:33,094
If I were him and the phone didn't, work

635
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:36,197
I would give the number
to the telephone company

638
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,466
and have them check on who the man is!

639
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:39,600
And?

641
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,937
If you call the phone company.

642
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:45,740
You'll be able to find out
If the dangerous man called!

644
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:48,576
Fuh...
Fuaaaah!!

646
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,678
» Unless you're the police

647
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:54,415
or something the telephone company
would never give out

649
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,918
the name and address of anyone.

650
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,654
35/7
understand Conan, sonny!

652
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,488
Phooey...

653
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,123
Oh. but...

654
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:05,293
there are times when we panic
and rush to make a call, don't you think?

656
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:06,093
Huh 2!

657
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:11,015
There-was a time
when I got lost going to my friend's house,

659
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,335
and when I tried calling her,
her cell phone was switched off...

661
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:17,738
so. I called the telephone company
and asked for her address.

663
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,191
I asked them'if they could find /
my friend's addressifor me I)

665
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,026
from her cell phone number.

666
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,377
Right, right

667
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:24,278
Huh ?!

668
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:26,981
Does everybody often do things like that?

669
00:19:26,982 --> 00:19:28,983
And?! I
Did they find~her address for you?

671
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:31,385
No. they didn't...

672
00:19:31,386 --> 00:19:33,387
So. I had the police officer
at the police box §

674
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,022
Iook up her name for me.

675
00:19:35,023 --> 00:19:36,357
Well. it's true though.

676
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:38,559
That if the man was in a rush to look for
'e owner oe pope

678
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,529
he would've tried calling
the phone company,

680
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,131
despite knowing that it might not work...

681
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:47,335
Ms. Numata, will you please look up
the number of the phone companies too!

683
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,202
Okay!

684
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,738
Let's try each and every one
and ask them

686
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:53,307
whether they got a call or not...

687
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,842
It's. nice...

688
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,777
that the police get to ask
anything-they want...

690
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,246
7 Some
I guess so!

692
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,115
Although it may'take a while
to get throughtthe red tape...

694
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:06,053
So long as we have the phone number,
it's as if we've already got

696
00:20:06,054 --> 00:20:07,688
his address and name!

697
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,341
Yes...

698
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,094
as long as we kept that e-mail address...

699
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:16,063
we could've gotten to them...

700
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:18,566
if we had what the lady had entered
on her cell phone.

702
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,201
We would've been able to find

703
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,420
the hide-out of the boss
who controls them all...

705
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,337
Yes. 1

706
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,922

I don't know yet.

712
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,952
I've got*to wait for them to call me back.

713
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,587

A mysterious 10 digit number
that begins with the number "17.

A mysterious 10 digit number

And the unexplainable black marks
that are beside the names...

00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,170
