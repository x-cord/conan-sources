58
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,395
Does this mean,
that it was no accident. but something

60
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,097
that happened with the intent to kill?

61
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:57,302
What 1 dirty rat.
The culprit was ambushing me there...

63
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:57,920
Dad, don't you have any idea
who it could be?

67
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:59,538

Dad. don't you have any idea

No. not the slightest!

72
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,344
Well...l guess you can't really say that

73
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,279
there's no one
who has a grudge against me...

75
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,981
You think someone repaid
your kindness with a grudge?

77
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:15,087
Yeah, (if so-we'll find.outrsoon who it is.

80
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,491
If I search for those
who have a grudge against me

82
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,960
it'll inevitably lead togthe culprit.

83
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:25,697
Hey...this cell phone is not yours, Dad...

84
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,001
What. show it to me .

85
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,769

Hey! This jacket isn't yours either. Dad!

88
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,707
What?!

89
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,444
There's a name on It... Kimura

90
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,983
Ingother words, this cell phone is not yours,
but rather of someone call Kimura!

95
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:45,817

Which means this mailiwas not sent to me.

101
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:51,606
Oh! So that's the story...No fun!

102
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,825
Hey! Just where do you think you're going?!

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,362
Yawn--I'm going to sleep

104
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,930
There you go!

105
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,266

00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:02,901

Ouch!

108
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:03,535
Ouch!

109
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,337
C.Conan?!

110
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,340
What a sight...

111
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,578
Hey... what do you think, Conan?

112
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,682
You mean if there's an thine
besides the fact that Pop's life is in danger

115
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,817
because he mistakenly
ore Mr. Kimura's jacket.

117
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,886
And the killer mistook Pops
to be Mr. Kimura?!

120
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,656
Yep... Right,
Ill-try and call Dad's cellphone!

122
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,662
I wonder what kind of person the owner of
the cell phone Mr. Kimura is...

124
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:33,031
Theres... NO answer...

125
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,737
This is unmistakably Mr. Kimura's jacket...

126
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,140
Did Mr. Kimura come last night?

127
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,410
He came when Mr. Mouri
was asleep over there.

129
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:48,080
I think Wt was around 01:00.

130
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:51,650
And... where Is this Mr. Kimura living...?

131
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,221
I rook, era Olh X00] OTR) Or
recently, so...

133
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,626
AS for me, I found out his name f
rom his signature on this bottle...

135
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,195
Oh. is that so...

137
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:03,995
Reverb

138
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:09,568
I'm sure he'll show up sometime soon.
Let's forget about this for a'while,

140
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,153
Do you have the you know what?

141
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,873
The hand-made cheese that
this master makes is super spicy

143
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,944
It blows up your cells,
makes your body hot and sweaty.

145
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,414
If so, one should refrain from eating
too much of it. but that's just not possible

147
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,116
That's how good it is.

148
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,450
See.

149
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,152
So that's why he took off his jacket...

150
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,056
After checking the cell phone
that-sent out:the mall lat night.

152
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,593
We found that it was registered
under a false name.

154
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,397
And, from last night up to
now there have been no accidents

156
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:41,533
or incidents in which a man
by the name of Kimura has been involved.

158
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,651
It's probably just some prank...

159
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:48,123
The polic are busy so you shouldn't
cause them extra problems..«Ran.

161
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,808
B.But.

162
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,845
Besides, they're not after me,
but rather a man named Kimura.

164
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,281
The culprit made a mistake

166
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,135
But if the culprit doesn't realize that
he's making a mistake.

169
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,455
he'll go after your life again.

170
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,857
That's what Ran is worried about.

171
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:12,164
Poof... Officer Takagl don't take what a kid
Iike her is saying too seriously...

173
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,704
Bar "Lemon"... You sure go looking:ifori all
kinds of 'places to drink, don't you ?

175
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,379
About a:week ago. I got this

176
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,750
1 Year Opening Anniversary Free
All You Can Drink Service Coupon.

178
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,485
So I went to check the place out.

179
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,854
They served this super spicy hot cheese
along with the drinks.

181
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,190
Since I've Kind of been hooked on
spicy hot stuff lately.

183
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,292
I got hooked on this place. you see!

184
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,493
Officer Takagi!

185
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,862
Here's been an eye-witness report.

186
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,598
Last night astudontTliving,
near the construction site...

188
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,002
says (he saw a man running from's
the scene right-after the-steel-pipes fell.

190
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,172
He says he didn't..get a good look
at the face of the man though...

192
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,042
However, the culprit seems to have had
a burn wound on his right elbow.

194
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,677
Do you have any idea
who the man could be?

197
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,878
Do you have any idea
who the man could be

199
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,645
Do:you have any idea
who the 'man could be?

201
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:05,584
Unfortunately...there were
no other suspicious fingerprints,

203
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,552
or anything elsesat the site

204
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,190
Which means, you'll have to,find Mr. Kimura
and trace things-from therd.

206
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,259
Dad! You're talking like
it's someone else's problem.

208
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,861
But...what it all boll's down to is...

209
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,029
I'm not Mr. Kimura.

210
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,734
This all happened
because you went to bar Lemon!

212
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:26,071
Pops! Unless we hurry,
the man called Kimura may be

214
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,874
and get into bigger trouble next time.

215
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,244
Mr. Kimura...

216
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,312
Since-the size of this jackét
fits. Dadsjust right.

218
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,082
I think he has the same type
of ph sique-as Dad...

220
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,551
Have you ever kept his jacket for him?

221
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,486
Here no such person at our shop...

222
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,771

224
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,926

Hold it there!

229

A burn...on his right elbow?!

So#the truck:-was a stolen onezafter-all...

231
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,211
Which means it was a planned attempt.

273
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,291
Oh! Just great!
What better chance could there be?

275
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,062
As long as we don't know
whothis Kimura guy is.

277
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,899
I'll serve as decoy and lure the culprit out!

278
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,702
Wait a minute! Just what do you think
you're saying Mr. Mouri?!

280
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,039
I'can-t stop him.if I keep on hiding!

281
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,975
Okay!

282
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,009
Huh?! In.Inspector!

283
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,680
But, I'm going to have those two serve
as our bodyguards

285
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,651
iNo:way! Itill.only put the culprit on guard
fhe finds out:and he won't show himself...

287
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,754
No! Going out alone is much too dangerous

288
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,792
"hate to say this inspector,
but cant listen to you thisdime...

290
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,695
I, Kogoro Moeuri: cannot bear and
don't want any more victims

292
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,397
resulting from getting mixed up
in what I am...

294
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,483
But, if anything should happen to me.

295
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:44,169
DIOERE F190 a= AF wh Roe
to be done after that.

297
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,771
M/Mr. Mouri

298
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,908
Syltsseomed to have the.opposite effect .

299
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,277
He's quite defiant...

300
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:02,287
So... what we've got to do now is
to find the person called Kimura!

302
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,321
Yes, sir

303
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,023
Let's go! Officer Takagi!

304
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,157
O Okay!

305
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,678
He's been walking!
Around for the past three da s...

307
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,916
Yes. sir... And, what about.this Mr. Kimura?

308
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,885
He's looking for the man
doing everything he can but...

310
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:35,452
He's looking for the man
doing everything he can but...

312
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,654
If the motive of the culprit is
a grudge against Mr. Mouri.

314
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,691
I guess he'll eventually get the guy.

315
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,695
But the thing is, he's being sought
after mistaken for a man named Kimura

317
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,332
and her-has' no idea
who or where this Kimura person is.

320
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,301
Moreover, after two attempted tries
on Mr Mouri's life

323
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,803
the culprit left nothing behind,
not even fingerprints.

325
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,842
I really hate to say this, but at present
we re up the creek without a paddle.

327
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,413
Fingerprints... .He didn't want to get nabbed
from his fingenprints?...

329
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,350
So, tho culprit's fingerprints
are already registered

331
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:10,088
y, Which means, this person has an arrest
record. .'One who knows' Pops well...

333
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:14,092
He has no motive against Pops
\NA=IR £2) ON

335
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,362
If the culprit knows Pops
and has met himsbefore...

337
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,065
It.It could be that...

338
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:30,058
This is Mouri...Long time no see.
I'd like to ask you something...

340
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,077

A case in which luck
and coincidence overlapped...

00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,922
Why-don't you rest a while, Conan...

Mr. Kimura seems, to have gone out to
take pictures. which is his hobby. Yes. sir...

380
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,857
And, Mr. Mourn,
Mrs. Kimura just happened to say...

00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:57,095
that a strange man
was checking out their house., \

trailing him... Okay. it's very likely

388
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:12,343
Huh, are you going there too, Mr.«Mouri?!
I think that's dangerous...

390
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,112
What a short-tempered man. 5

391
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,690
Money. * ?

Yep! I dropped it

He's out there in clear view
with nothing to protect-him!

425
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,686
He has no chance against the sniper!
Talk about reckless!

427
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,464
Inspector! On the left side of the lakeside
opposite here. something glittered.

Yes. sir!

Where's Pops? I

445
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,441
Inspector M@gure...

446
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,944
We found this...uh...in"the water.

447
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,613
And?

448
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,149
We could not locate Mr. Mouri. though...

449
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,721
The man from Bar Lemon.

450
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,393
YesOwl suddenly got a call
from Mrs. Kimura.

452
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,929
And co ldn't"-make out
the address she gave me...

454
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,433
I thought I had to relay the message
to Mr. Mouri as soon as possible so...

456
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,070
I had no idea that
things would turn out like this...

458
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,872
Acchoo!

459
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,843
Ugh~it sure gets cold)
when the sun goes down... Mr. Kimura~!

461
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,712
M.Mr. Mouril You're okay!

462
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,647
Huh? I picked this up...

463
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:41,486
I get it! You put a dummy
on board the boat and...

465
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,454
Yes. yes. you tried to lure the sniper out...

466
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:47,658
I'm so glad yes,
you are Indeed Kogoro Mourl!

468
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,228
What about Mr. Kimura...?

469
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,698
Did you find him...
aha. Aaaaa...

471
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,735
Inspector,
you don't have to worry about him!

473
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,520
W.What do you mean?

474
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:03,608
There is no such person
by the name of Kimura to begin with.

476
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:10,248
In other words, it was me. In order to
camouflage his motive towards me,

478
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,684
the sniper made up a character
by the name of Kimural.

480
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,853
Made up?!...A motive?

481
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:22,293
Yes. If I were to be killed, the police
will thoroughly investigate my surroundings

483
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,163
and will be able to
trace the sniper from there.

485
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:29,600
But. if I were to be killed because
I was mistaken for a man named Kimura,

487
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,636
it will make investigation difficult,

488
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:36,007
because there will be nothing
connecting me to this man...

490
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,143
Which means that
the accident at the construction site

492
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,945
the hit-and-run after that.

493
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,947
And the warning mailiof
murder:to: be carried out.

495
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:46,350
Were all camouflage
that the sniper schemed?

497
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:49,070
Do you have evidence
that he doesn't exist?!

499
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:50,655
Then. who is the sniper?!

500
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,790
Now; hold your horses...

501
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:57,261
Mr. Inoue, you have a briefcase
In our car. don't ou?

503
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,896
Could we have a look at it?

504
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,264
Y.Yes. go ahead...

505
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,499
I'll go get it...

506
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,401
It's In the trunk...

507
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:09,106
By the way, Mr. Inoue. ..You used the
free service coupon.and provided only!

509
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,110
With all kinds of services,
and made me frequent our shop.

511
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,712
Waiting for an opportunity.

512
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,813
Huh?!

513
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,049
When I fell-asleep. after getting drunk

514
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,018
you exchanged the jacket and cell phone
that ou had prepared beforehand. for mine.

516
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,905
No. aMr. Kimura really came and.

517
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:26,791
Came, drank and went home?!
He drank water you mean?

519
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:31,162
The contents of
Mr. Kimura's bottle. was water...

521
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,630
Inspector! I found it...

522
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,703
he rifle that fired at me...

523
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,240
D.Do you have proof that I fired it?!

524
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,941
In that dummy over there

525
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,011
you can find the bullet of a rifle
In its left chest. If you match the bullet.and

527
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,748
the traces that the bullet left behind...
and if the rifle mark matches

529
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,284
