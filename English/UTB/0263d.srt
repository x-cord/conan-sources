1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:05,338
The heart contains mysteries,
stars and snow sparkle for the two.

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,477
He sees through the.one and only truth,
a child in appearance with thed.Q. of ah-adult,

5
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:14,881
No case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan.

7
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:56,482
OSAKA DOUBLE MYSTERY
THE NANIWA SWORDSMAN AND
HIDEYOSHI TOYOTOMI'S CASTLE

10
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,486
You know Heiji

11
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,154
you keep talking about a killer...

12
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,957
but this doesn't look like anything else
except suicide...

14
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,225
All right, take a look at this!

15
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,361
Look on Ms. Katagiri's right side...

16
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,763
it's faint because it's wet
but you can still see it...

18
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,498
there are 2 or 3 strange marks...

19
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,632
Hey, you're right!

20
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:16,302
'Fihereislii strange marks here...!

21
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,437
And there're all the same...!

22
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,439
Isnt"that.blood?

23
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,575
Yes, probably from the victim...

24
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,843
From the victim...?

25
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,043
That's right...

26
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,847
Ms. Katagiri died from a blow to the head,

27
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,850
but she didn't get it when she fell and hit
her head on the bridge girder,

29
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,320
someone might have hit her on the head
with something hard

31
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,658
causing blood to splatter onto the killer...

32
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,662
And the blood got on her when the
killer picked her up...!

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,263
What I'm saying is.

35
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:49,268
When Kazuha and Ran saw her on the
bridge, she was already dead

37
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,138
Another thing, the figure you saw.suddenly
burst into flames and fell into the moat,

39
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,409
that's why you came to the wrong
conclusion and assumed it was a suicide!

41
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,810
B. but...

42
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,547
when she burst into flames, it looked
Iike she was struggling in pain...

44
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,715
Yes. that's right.

45
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,051
She was definitely alive!

46
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,852
That's what you THOUGHT you saw!

47
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,654
It was very dark,
you didn't get a good look. did you?

49
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,256
Es; but...

50
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,126
Well anyway, those guys seem
suspicious to me...!

52
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,962
I've got to find those three guys
who were on the same tour

54
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,598
as the 2 deceased people
and question them. .!

56
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,667
Are you talking about us?

57
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,271
We came back right awaypyjust like you
told us to and noticed the big commotion

59
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,140
It looks like the crowd's getting bigger...

60
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,010
What happened here. .?

61
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,346
En?! I don't believe it

62
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,683
Ms. Katagiri fell from the bridge
while burning up?!

64
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,885
From this Gokuraku Bridge?

66
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,089
But why commit suicide
by setting yourself on fire?

68
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:46,025
It hasn't been officially declared
a suicide yet...

70
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:48,627
That's why we need you to answer
few questions...

72
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,198
first off. you fellows and Ms. Katagin
! left this area, where did you go

74
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,534
and what were you doing
efore coming back...

76
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:59,305
I went to get something to eat
at a small restauranttnear here...

78
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,773
I did the same...

79
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,242
Only I went to a different restaurant...

80
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,444
1. I went back to the hotel in Nanayari

81
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,381
where we're all staying and
changed my clothes

83
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,685
So you were with Ms. Katagiri,
weren't you?

85
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,753
Yes, until we got back to the hotel...

86
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,689
I'd known something like would happen.

87
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,824
I should have stayed
with her the whole time

89
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,828
But why did Mr. Kato and Ms. Katagiri
choose fire...?

91
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,365
It's almost as if someone.ordered
them to do...

93
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,766
Ordered...?

94
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,903
That reminds me; Mr. Wakisaka.

95
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,975
You were playing the role of Nobunaga.
Weren't, ou...

97
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,510
Uh, yes...

98
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:38,878
That means,

99
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,381
if you ordered them to do something.
They'd have to obey, wouldn't they...

101
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,582
Well in that case.

102
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,451
Fukushima who could assume
NÃ©bunaga's role for 3 minutes

104
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,520
could also have done it too...

105
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,287
What?!

106
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:52,391
I played leyasu so that leaves me
out of the picturef...

108
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,661
So one of you must have done it...

109
00:04:55,896 --> 00:05:01,000
Their duty was to entertain Nobunaga,
not to take orders!

111
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:05,070
Besides. no one would obey an order
to set themselves on fire...

113
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,872
And another thing.

114
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:10,075
Ms. Katagiri played Nene, that was
just a supervisory role!!!

116
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,212
Also, when the firsttmember of
our party died,

118
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,748
we wouldn't be so callous as
to continue our role playing game!

120
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:18,684
S...l see what you mean.

121
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:20,552
Inspector Otaki!

122
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:24,823
We've found another piece of pottery on
Ms. Katagiri's body!"O

124
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,158
What. again

125
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,330
I wonder why they all had
pieces of pottery like this...

127
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,399
Oh. and we found this photo:too...

128
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:36,468
Huh...?

129
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,470
The your 1 couple in the right corner...

130
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,939
isn't that Mr Kato and Ms. Katagiri=...?

131
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,776
You're right.

132
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,111
So they knew each other from before...

133
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,114
But who are the other 3 people...?

134
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,117
Why that's Hirano!

135
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,719
Here, that's him...

136
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:58,924
You're right. she looks really young but
I think thatfit's him...

138
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,594
And who's this Hirano character?

139
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,929
He planned this tour...

140
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:08,133
We got all together because of
Hirano's home page...

142
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,271
he suggested we all goon atrip...

143
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,608
He came up with the idea of
the role playing game too!

145
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,776
Unfortunately though, just before
we were leaving on the trip,

147
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,312
something important came up and
he couldn't make it...

149
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,780
I see,

150
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:27,119
so the man planned this trip resulting
In strange deaths, isn't in attendance...

152
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,623
Are you absolutely sure Ms: Katagiri
didn't commit suicide?!

154
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,959
Il... we can't say for sure just ye

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,164
Well if the killer is using this tour
to commit murders,

157
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,034
the first thing we should do is
talk to Mr. Hirano

159
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:48,907
All you have to do is access "Legend of
the Lord:of Gold" home page... 1

161
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,146
That's him...

162
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,816
When Ms. Katagiri burned and
fell from the bridge,

164
00:06:58,118 --> 00:07:01,754
that's who the suspicious person
behind Ran and Kazuha was...

166
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,223
s... I thought so t

167
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,824
but there's something
I don't understand...

169
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,894
The killer called Ms. Katagiri
out to the bridge. killed her

171
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:12,164
then tied a rope around her
and propped her against the railing

173
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,302
and waited in the distance for someone
to come by. when the moment was right,

175
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:19,371
the killer pulled the rope and she fell
into the moat, that set up is easy.

177
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,707
But to set her on fire at just the right time

178
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,243
and make it look like she was writhing
in pain as she fell,

180
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,312
that's not as easy thing to do...

181
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,180
Another thing bothers me too.

182
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,984
That strange blood stain on her side...

183
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,254
I'm pretty sure that's from blood
that was on a zipper...

185
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,456
But...

186
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,926
none of those three wore clothes
with a zipper...

188
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,594
There has to be a reason

189
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,730
the killer would go to the trouble of
changing into that kind of outfit

191
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:49,535
then calling Ms. Katagiri
out to the bridge...

193
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,012
And I know what it is...

194
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,013
Yeah.

195
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,550
Now we know why the killer wore
a special outfit that has a zipper...

197
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,821
The question now is,
who used that trick...

199
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:13,158
Well, anyone of those 3 could have...

200
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,427
Come on Heiji, let's go already!

201
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,097
It's getting windier too...

202
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,232
Eeek!

203
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,734
My umbrella. .!

204
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,743
Hey Hattor:...!

205
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,678
I think we...

206
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,481
I think we made a big mistake...

207
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,122
Oh my umbrellas ruined...

208
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:46,525
Well what do you except, it was just a
cheapy thing we picked up at that store...

210
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,462
Hey? Where's Heij...

211
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,198
He took Conan and
went off somewhere...

213
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,800
they probably figured out
who the killer is...

215
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,467
Eh?!

216
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,272
He was positively glowing

217
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,683
Tiheyscouldn't havelgone. so far,
but I don't see them...

219
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:15,888
It's no use!
Only one of them's at the hotel...!

221
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,023
The other two havenitjreturned yet!

222
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,226
There might be another murder. .!

223
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,763
After the first and second cases
are investigated thoroughly,

225
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,834
the trick is bound to be exposed...!

226
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,237
So the Killer's got to finish the job
by tonight . 1

228
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,773
Where could they have gone...!

229
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,177
Over there! That's Mr. Kasuyal!!

230
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,247
It doesn't look like
he's heading back to the hotel

232
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,918
It looks like he's going to finish things...

233
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,353
kay! I'll let the police know...

234
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:53,158
If the police come, there's bound to
be a commotion and he might get away

236
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,695
Let's you and me open this one up
on our own...!

238
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,298
I'm talking about the door to the truth...!

239
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,303
Hattori. where're you going!

240
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,263
That old man went into a suspicious
Iooking warehouse...

242
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,731
Hattori...don't you feel something?

243
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,735
I get this weird feeling
we're being watched .

245
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,940
Hey. what're you doing?
We're going in!

247
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,008
Hey...!

248
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,754
It's so dark I can't see a thing...

249
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,689
! He's over there...

250
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,758
It looks like he's going up...

251
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,562
Kudo, that tranquilizer you've got
in your watch, get it ready!

253
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,630
Yeah, I know

254
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:06,832
Ugu ?!

255
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,170
Ey Kudo, what's wrong...
Need to go to the toilet?

257
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,976
Oh no...I'm going to lose sight of him
I don't get moving...

259
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,513
Listen Kudo, when you finish using the
toilet, catch up with me right away!

261
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,228
Hattori is giving us a tour of
Osaka Castle

263
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:40,231
when we meet up with a tour group
who are fansfof Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

265
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,036
One of their members.

266
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,972
Mr. Kato burst into flames
on the roof of the tower and fell off

268
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,343
Written on the scroll he ad on him,

269
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,545
was the word dragon and the
drawing of a gourd,

271
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,014
They indicated
where the treasure of Hideyoshi,

273
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,816
the so called Lord of gold, was hidden

274
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:04,690
And before Mr. Kato's death was ruled
a suicide or murder,

276
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:09,428
another death occurs, right in front of
Ran and Kazuha!

278
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,930
Ms. Katagiri died
after setting herself on fire

280
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,566
and falling off the Gokuraku Bridge.

281
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,074
Hattori and I noticed the strange blood
stain on her clothes

283
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,077
and realized that this was a murder

284
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:30,582
Later, we followed Mr. Kasuya
Into a suspicious looking warehouse.

286
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,619
11 He's over there...

287
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,621
It looks like he's going up...

288
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,558
Kudo, that tranquilizer you've got
in your watch, get it ready!

290
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,426
Yeah, I know

291
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,694
USU?!

292
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,033
ey Kudo, what's wrong...
Need to go to the toilet?

294
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,772
Oh no...I'm going to lose sight of him
I don't get moving...

296
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,576
Listen Kudo, when you finish using the
toilet, catch up with me right away!

298
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,769
Hey. sorry to make you wait...

299
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,836
Wakisaka

300
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,171
No problem...

301
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,507
id you bring it with you...

302
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,976
It's over there... inside that box...

303
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,712
I see, good!

304
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,182
But there's so much stuff in here

305
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,118
and it's so dark
I can't make anything out...

307
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,923
I put a flashlight on the side of the box,
why don't you use it

310
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,025
here it is...!

311
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,163
Use that and you'll be able to find
what you're looking for...

313
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,632
The tiger scroll...

314
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,033
I wouldn't turn it on if I were you...

315
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,971
You'll be burnt to a crisp if you do...

316
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,811
Just like Mr. Kato on
saka Castle's tower...

318
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,346
Isn't that right, Mr. Wakisaka...

319
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:13,952
You mean both Ms Katagiri and
Mr Kato were

321
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,487
That's right.

322
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,423
Mr Wakisaka killed them. .!

323
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,160
He used the same trick he used on you

324
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,430
he lured the three of you out by saying
hat he'd found the tiger scroll...

326
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,567
It was easy with Mr. Kato...

327
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:31,236
all he had to do was tell him that

328
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,706
he hid the scroll under one of the tiles
on the roof of the tower...

330
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,510
in order to climb out on the roof,
you'd avoid going in the afternoon

333
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,712
when a lot of people would be around
and wait until night...

335
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,914
Going out there at night is fine but,

336
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,784
without a light, you wouldn't be able to
tell which tile it was under...

338
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,353
Mr. Kato had no other choice,

339
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,923
so he took the lighter he had out and
Iit it so he could look around,

341
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,094
and he saw a flashlight just lying there
s if waiting to be found...!

343
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,564
Mr. Wakisaka had left it there earlier.

344
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:05,871
It was rigged to explode
when it was switched on!

346
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,806
I see...

347
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:12,144
SO you're saying Mr. Kato chose to use
the flashlight which was handier

349
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:15,614
but when he turned it on. it exploded...

350
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,681
That's right.

351
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:20,018
The flashlight exploded into tiny pieces

352
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,688
and the lighter with his fingerprints on
was left on the roof,

354
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,626
making it look like he set himself on fire

356
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:33,865
That would explain the dry mark
that was left under the lighter....!

358
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,700
You wouldn't get that kind of mark

359
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,836
unless you put a lighter
on a round shaped mark,

361
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:42,174
besides, we found a burnt battery on the
ground near the castle

363
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,845
But how did he kill Ms. Katagiri...?

364
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,448
According to the girls who witnessed it.

365
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,051
When she set herself on fire,

366
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,121
there was no one else around

367
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,190
and she was writhing in pain,

368
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,259
as she fell into the moat...

369
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,095
And all she had in her hand
as a lighter...

371
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:06,698
Suicide is the only conclusion...

372
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:09,434
I don't blame you for thinking like that...

373
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:13,839
But it wasn't her that set herself on fire
and fell into the moat...

375
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,310
It was Mr. Wakisaka!

376
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,111
Wh. what...?!

377
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,149
After the crowdsthat was gathered
near the tower left

379
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,153
and people walking around thinned out
around the bridge, he...

381
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,823
called her out after making her
change into a coat...

383
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,294
then he killed her by striking her
with a hard object,

385
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,698
then he threw her into the moat.

386
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,933
Her body floated on the water

387
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,503
and he poured kerosene on her,
setting the stage...

389
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,041
All he had to do was wait for someone to
pass the bridge then set fire to his coat,

391
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,245
and pretend to writhe in pain
dropping the lighter into the moat

393
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,514
the lighter would set fire to Ms. Katagiri's
body floating in the moat

395
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,918
After that, he jumped into the moat
and dove underwater,

397
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:07,325
the only thing visible would be Ms.
Katagiri's body burning in the water....!

399
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,329
What you're saying is, even when her
body was lifted obit of the water

401
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,101
and examined, the injury on her head
which was the actual-cause of her death,

403
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,169
would appear to have been a result
of her hitting her head on the girder

405
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,204
because the witnesses would testify

406
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:25,710
that she set fire to herself
and fell from the bridge...!

408
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,544
That's right.

409
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,780
But it only went as smoothly as it did

410
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,883
because those girls happened
to pass by at just the right moment,

412
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,352
if a lot of time had passed
before anyone had Walked by.

414
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,689
The time of death would be off,
wouldn't it?

416
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,423
Not really,

417
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,726
because Mr. Wakisaka had already
prepared a witness

419
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,329
it was mere coincidence that Kazuha
and Ran saw what happened first,

421
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:49,000
it appears the intended witness
ran away from the scene though...

423
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,137
You don't mean that it was...

424
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,105
It was Mr. Fukushima. .!

425
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,942
He didn't know anything
about the incident

427
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:00,412
but when he heard
a burning body fell into the moat,

429
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,747
he immediately said it was suicide...!

430
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,749
Think about it,

431
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,319
if someone were going to commit suicide
by setting themselves on fire,

433
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,288
they wouldn't jump into water,
it would put the fire out...

435
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,991
It would be natural to assume 4
that you'd jump into the water

437
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,593
only if someone else set fire to you,.
Isn't that right

439
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,697
What he said proves that he witnessed

440
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,598
her jumping into the moat
after setting herself on fire...

442
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,867
Judging by the events of the day,

443
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,302
all 2 person would have 10 do is

444
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,471
disguise their voice;
pretending to be the police

446
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,606
and call him out to the bridge,
he would have gone there right away I

448
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,009
But it's awfully strange...

449
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,579
Mr. Wakisakas hair and clothes
weren't all that wet.

451
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,183
And if by chance something went wrong.
He could have been seriously burned...

453
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,553
He was wearing a dry suit

454
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,856
under his coat over his clothes...!

455
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,259
If he wear to put the hood on
before setting fire to himself,

457
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,060
he wouldn't get burned,

458
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:52,230
and neither his hair
or his clothes would get wet

460
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,065
so he could swim underwater.

461
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,469
Until he got far away from the bridge
then climb up the stone wall,

463
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,637
and after he hid
the dry suit and coat somewhere

465
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,908
he went and joined the crowd
SO as not to draw suspicion to himself...

467
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,945
Incidentally, both the flammable fleece
Mr. Kato wore, and

469
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,684
Ms. Katagiri's coat were given to them
y you, isn't that right...

471
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,021
You probably told them
that it would be easy for them

473
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,956
to spot each other
when they snuck off to meet in secret...

475
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,358
Did you Know there was blood
on Ms. Katagiri's coat,

477
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,030
her blood splattered on your clothes
and then you got it on her...

479
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:29,067
It got on her when you carried her...

480
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,737
they were shaped
Iike the zipper on a dry suit

482
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,141
and the edge of that badge
you have on your chest...

484
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,175
Which means,

485
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,545
that if we were to check that
Nobunaga badge you're wearing.

487
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,248
We'll have the proof to nail you!!

488
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:46,551
But why did he want to
kill me and the other two...?

490
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,820
You three weren't-the only ones...

491
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,956
he killed the man
who planned this trip. Mr. Hirano too...!

493
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:57,062
Basked a professor? I know
to access Mr. Hirano's home page,

495
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,564
he founder. Hirano had been putting
new entries on a daily basis

497
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,267
but-he-stopped:-3=weekstago...

498
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,570
Remember that burnt body
they found in the outer moat recently,

500
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,238
hat was probably

501
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,174
Yeah, that's right...

502
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:13,078
I killed them,
Hirano, Kato and Katagiri...

504
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,748
in dedication to my grandfather Masakiyo

505
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,317
who loved Hideyoshi
and was killed for it...

507
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:20,952
Your grandfather?!

508
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,189
Ou saw the picture didn't you...?

509
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,426
The old man in the middle holding
the scroll open was my grandfather...

511
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,695
He always used to tell me...

512
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:34,299
About the scroll he'd found...!

513
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,635
And about the clues
to Hideyoshi's treasure...

515
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,505
He told me he wantedr
to give up looking for the treasure

517
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,508
and donate the scroll to the country,

518
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,213
but that the others didn't agree
and they began to argue about it...

520
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,585
Then 13 years ago.
He told us he was going to Osaka

522
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,687
to try and convince
the others to agree with him,

524
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,755
and he never came back...

525
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,861
You mean the burnt body they found
in the moat 13 years ago

527
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:05,762
Was my grandfather,
he was killed by his partners...

529
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:10,101
Grandfather found
that piece of pottery along with the scroll

531
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,804
but he didn't tell the others about it...

532
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:17,809
That photo was the only clue
I had as to who his partners were

534
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,178
so I had a hard time finding:them...

535
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,716
And I never imagined-that-one of them
would change how they looked...

537
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,320
You mean that old man on the left is...?!

538
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,959
That's me...

539
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,429
Something happened
and I had to change my appearance...

541
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,798
That Ms Katagiri seemed to suspect

542
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,902
that I was a member
of their former group.

544
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,274
I don't care what happens to me

545
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,608
but are you going to
kill Mr. Wakisaka too?

547
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,445
You'll never find out
where the treasure is!

549
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:58,750
I assume you haven't brought
the tiger scroll with you #%

551
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,120
I've already found out
where Mr. Wakisaka lives

553
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,122
I'll just tear his house apart...!

554
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,424
Both of you move to the back, quickly!

555
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,694
Pick up that flashlight and turn it on

556
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,596
I'm going to have
you two fall to the ground...!

558
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,966
It's going to look like
the killer and the teenage detective

560
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,268
fell to their deaths
while engulfed in flames...!

562
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,439
By the way.
Before you die, answer my question...

564
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,143
How did you figure out
Mr. Wakisaka was the killer...!

566
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,846
Anyone could have used
that trick you just explained....!

568
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,616
What tipped you off?

569
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,650
Humph!

570
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,385
Why should I tell you!

571
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:35,787
It was the umbrella!

572
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,793
In his last moments,
Mr. Kato grabbed hold of an umbrella,

574
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,595
it was his dying message,

575
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:47,298
he was indicating Nobunaga's standard,
the golden umbrella

577
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:52,604
That's how he knew
Mr. Wakisaka was the killer!

579
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,872
Why you little brat,
when'd you get up there 7?!

581
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,808
Get down here!

582
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,944
Or I'll fill your friend here with holes!

583
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,246
No! Don't come down there!

584
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,614
I guess I don't have a choice...

585
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:03,881
You idiot!

586
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,618
Humph...what a good little boy...

587
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,259
Y. you're Heizo Hattorir'!

588
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,428
OD, dad?!

589
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,464
You may 've changed
how you looked 13 years ago

591
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:24,702
but it seems like you can't change that
sick voice or that warped personality!

593
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,443
You're under arrest
for possession of an illegal weapon!

595
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,145
And for attempted murder .!

596
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:38,816
Also for the 5 robbery-murders
you committed

598
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,352
because you failed to find the treasure...

599
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,188
You're going to pay for what you did!!

600
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:45,890
Robbery murders...?

601
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,425
I don't know what you're talking about...!

602
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,093
No use pretending!

604
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,896
We've get your voice on tape.
On the spur ofithe moment,

606
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:54,332
the victim recorded it
on his answering machine,

608
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,733
and we've also got your handprint
on the telephone

610
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,536
when you Ming it up!!

611
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,339
There's no"sympathy'for
those-whorturn-against their friends!

613
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,174
If you don t want to get hurt...

614
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,643
Come along quiet like and
Iet us put these cuffs on you!!!

616
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:22,393
And so the case
that:spannedf3 years...

618
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:26,897
was personally solved by the head
of Osaka's prefectural police

620
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,767
while we watched in wonder

621
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,470
it all happened in a blink of an eye...
