1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:03,269
Inspiration flashes piercing through to
the truth once he gets going.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,871
Nothing can stop him.

4
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:07,073
This episode features Sonoko
in her natural state.

6
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,075
Danger, romance & fate awaits.

7
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,877
The one & only truth is
brought into the light.

9
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,678
He looks like a child but he's got
the brains of an adult.

11
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,381
His name is... Detective Conan

12
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:56,615
FA NA
SONOKO'S DANGEROUS SUMMER PART I

14
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,666
Perfect!

15
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,068
Sonoko. what in the world
are you taking?!

17
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:19,071
It's a.close up of your rear as you §
fixedwyourabathing suit.

19
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,441
A real close up! It's an eyeful!

20
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,710
Why did you take a shot like that?

21
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,479
It's obvious, isn't it!

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,348
When (Shinichi gets back.
I'm going to show it to him!

24
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,649
What?

25
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,319
I'm sure he'll be thrilled!

26
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,057
You're nuts! Shinichi would NOT be
pleased by those pictures!!

28
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:41,027
Conan... you agree with me don't you?

29
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,029
Uh... sure!

30
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,165
Hah!! What does a kid know?

31
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:49,568
Good grief.
I wish I werefback to normal.

33
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,939
Sonoko. what's wrong with you! You've
been acting so mean lately!

35
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,443
Don't mind me». I'm just jealous...

36
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,746
Eh. but .why... was it something I did?

37
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,680
Do you know whyy

38
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:07,119
Do you know why we came here to
IZU for these 2 nights & 3 days...

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,256
To. look for guys, as always, that:'s
your motive, isn't"it, Sonoko?

42
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,761
That's right! And this time. I've got
my girl next-door act perfect!!

44
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,898
What do you mean?

45
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,734
Whenever we travel, we always stay at
my family's vacation*home

47
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,269
some fancy hotel!

48
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:28,707
Oh woe... the likes of
her is beyond my reach

50
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,677
To relieve the fears of suchemen,
"deliberately 'picked

52
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,513
this rundown inn for us this trip!

53
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,415
Oh... is that what this is all about

54
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,284
What a waste of energy...

55
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,921
And still... And-still...

56
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,490
Sonoko...

57
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,992
In the train coming over here...

58
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:51,197
and last night, at the fireworks display
site near the inn...

60
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,166
and even here on the beach today.

61
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:59,271
All the guys that have come up to us.
Every one of them... were after Ran!

63
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,806
You're the one!

64
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,476
I don't think that's true

65
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,578
Oh never Mind" forget it!

66
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,546
I took some candid shots ofég
you in your underwear.

68
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,482
I'll just show those to Shinichi too!

69
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,253
Hey. you can't be serious...

70
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,088
Sonoko. wait!
I'll never forgive you if you do that!

72
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,328
I was just kidding, I didn't take
those pictures!

74
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,797
Sonoko, you little...

75
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:26,799
Good grief... she was I ing.

76
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,868
Hey ladies...

77
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,503
are you free?

78
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:36,008
How about having lunch with me?
Of course, it'll be my treat!
Adahiko:Michiwaki

81
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,576
Yes! We'll be happy to...

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,115
I'll bet you're after Ran too,

84
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,752
Go ahead, take her!
She's at her prime!

86
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,953
Sonoko!

87
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,658
But don't try anything funny!
She's already got a boyfriend!

89
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,695
No, the one I was asking out...
was you...

91
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,362
Me 2:1

92
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,131
You're kidding!

93
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,301
Isn't that great Sonoko!
How exciting

95
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:07,006
Id n't believe it! Who'd pick
noko, no one... no way!!

97
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:14,713
Something's fishy here... there's got
to be a catch somewhere!

99
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,217
But there's no sense worrying
about it...

101
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,951
Shall we go?

102
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,819
Sure

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,856
I'll just stay here with Conan for
a while longer!

105
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:40,439
On, so you're a student at Beika
Universit I!

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,775
Ran's father graduated from there!

108
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,310
Yes, that's right

109
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,313
I don't understand, she's always
Iooking for guys but

111
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,949
When she's with
one, she's so uptight...

113
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,220
So what brings you here to 1zu?

114
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,088
I'm just getting over breaking up
with my girlfriend...

116
00:05:56,755 --> 00:06:02,927
she shattered my heart... I felt so
Iost & was looking at the ocean...

118
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,599
then I saw an angel!

119
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:13,838
If my instincts are correct, you're
going to turn out to be my savior...

121
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,043
Your... savior...

122
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,249
Here's your beer!

123
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:23,915
Un, thanks...

124
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:24,850
un, thanks .

125
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,889
Sir, don't drop your cigarette ashes
on the floor, please!
Makoto Kyogoku

128
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,691
It makes cleaning up harder!
Makoto Kyogoku

130
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,025
It makes cleaning up harder!

131
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,994
Sure thing...

132
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,466
What a rude waiter...

133
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,836
Hey, haven't we seen that waiter
somewhere before?

135
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:49,308
Of course we have, his father owns
the inn we're staying at!

137
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,478
I heard he comes back during the
summer break to help out

139
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,780
How do you know all this?

140
00:06:54,781 --> 00:07:00,286
He was staring at us, from the doorway
so I asked someone working at the inn!

142
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,722
Then I wonder why he's working here?

143
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,659
It's probably under the same
anagement...

145
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,794
the Kawara Inn where we're staying...

146
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:12,431
So. you're staying at the Kawara Inn?

147
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,199
Yes, that's right.

148
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,736
That's close to the hotel I'm staying at!

149
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,171
How about it then?

150
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,708
Why don't we all have dinner tonight
at that fancy restaurant on the beach...

152
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,743
I'll picks Ou up in my car!

153
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,645
Really?! Are you sure?

154
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,315
On one condition. you bring your camera!

155
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:30,816
Why's that?

156
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,585
I just heard from one of the locals,

157
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,156
something happened on the beach close
to the restaurant

159
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,691
Like what?

160
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:42,127
Let's see... it was almost a year ago
to this date .

162
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,864
A young girl with long brown hair
was murdered.

164
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,300
She'd been stabbed in
the abdomen...

166
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,436
Murdered?!

167
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:55,774
Yes it seems she was attacked while
on her way to that restaurant but

169
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,144
there were no witnesses and the case is
till being investigated.!

171
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,115
A year's gone by, the customers have
forgotten the incident

173
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,051
and business at
the restaurant is booming, but...

175
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,557
There's one problem. the girl seems
to have taken a liking to the restaurant,

177
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,292
she still appears there

178
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,728
She what?!

179
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:22,968
Photos taken in the restaurant show
her grotesque figure!!

181
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,902
Yipes...

182
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:24,837
Geez

183
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,805
What baloney...

184
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,877
That's why I wanted to test the rumor
and see if such a picture'd turn out!

186
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,646
What do you think?

187
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,616
I still have about 10 shots left...

188
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,985
No way! Don't you dare take your camera!!

189
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,822
But if we showed it to Shinichi, he
could probably figure it out...

191
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,492
Besides. I'm going to show hill the
other pictures

193
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,726
I told you about that are in this camera...

194
00:08:48,727 --> 00:08:50,428
Listen to me!!

195
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,766
What good will it do to show him pictures
of someone unidentifiable!

197
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:58,803
With his.deductive 'powers' I'm sure -heill
be able to figure out who it is-in a snap.

199
00:08:58,804 --> 00:08:59,738
Good grief!

200
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:00,773
Deductive powers?

201
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,876
This girl's boyfriend is a mystery buff!

202
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,177
Oh really...

203
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,046
by the way, what kind of photos
are you talking about?

205
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,548
Wait until you hear

206
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,481
Sonoko!

207
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,218
Here's your order!
FriedPnoodles!

209
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,255
Customers are lining up so
please eat fast!

211

Zs 74

212
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:19,925
zs 7 .

214
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:27,231
What is it with that guy. Does he
have a grudge against us or something?

216
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,635
Shoji Terabayashi
SIEYL L&D LL

218
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:29,935
THEROL L&D UL

219
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:34,940
Let's not go to that restaurant,
it's just too spooky...

221
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,411
Don't worry! It's just a rumor.

222
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,413
Besides, a whole year's gone
by since it happened!

224
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:46,118
If she did appear there as a ghost. I'm
sure she's grown tired of the place by now...

226
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,020
Hey. did you hear?

227
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,657
They found another.in the woods
along the railroad tracks!

229
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:52,724
Another what?

230
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,895
A body! Another girl with long brown
hair's been murdered!!

232
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,599
I'm going to have a look!

233
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,167
Conan, don't go!

234
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,736
Conan!

235
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,609
Good grief, he's so curious...

236
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,457
She's been stabbed in the abdomen.
Detective Yokomizo
Shizuoka Police

239
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,359
Just like the victim last year
Detective Yokomizo
Shizuoka Police

242
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,430
Yes... this victim also seems
to be a tourist...

244
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:34,299
by the way, what's the
estimated time of death?

246
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,036
Let's see, sometime between
8 and 9 last night...

248
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,672
about the time the fireworks
display ended

250
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:46,178
Isn't that about the time we passed
here last night?

252
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,613
Yes. I think:so

253
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,481
That's scary...

254
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,784
Don't be silly, no one would attack
you Sonoko

256
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,955
Bot look! I have brown hair too!

257
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,459
Can you guarantee I won't be the
next victim!

259
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,497
I don't want to die in a place like this.

260
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,768
I haven't done any of the
things I want to yet...

262
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,371
Sonoko...

263
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,278
Don't worry... I'll protect you
while we're here in Izu!

265
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,382
By the way, I think it'll be best to
eat dinner at a different restaurant

267
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,050
Yes. you're right

268
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,418
And no cameras either!

269
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,154
I agree! I'll pick you up at 7,

270
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,190
wait forame in front of the inn!

271
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,492
We'll be there

273
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:40,165
That man... I'm sure he was at the
beachside concession...

275
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,234
I'll seefyou later then

276
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,603
wAliight!: We'lllbe 'looking¥forward to tonight!

277
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,244
Let's change and go back

279
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,446
v Ho]

280
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:59,384
Why if it isn't Ran and Sonoko!
I didn't know you were in*lzu.

282
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,219
Yes, we came to do some swimming

283
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,122
So Detective Mouri is with ou too?

284
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,225
No. only the 3 of us came this trip

286
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,562
Hello

287
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,932
So you're guarding these 2 ladies.

288
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,368
Stay on your toes

289
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,302
Yes sir!

290
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:22,874
And you two be careful too!
There's been a terrible crime.

292
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,776
Yes, we'll be careful

293
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:30,349
I'll be going then!
Give Mr. Mouri my regards.

295
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,216
I will!

296
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:40,325
He hasn't changed at all, he's still
energetic but somehow unreliable...

298
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:44,663
if your father were here Ran. he'd
solve the crime in no time.

300
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:51,370
Detective Yokomizu's much more reliable
than old man Kogoro. trust me...

302
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:13,659
Oh no, it's starting to rain!
I wish he'd come soon...

304
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:18,497
Patience, don't be so anxious!
Heroes always arrive late!

306
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,199
Stop that! You're embarrassing me

307
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,574
What'd he put this uabrella here?

308
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,576
Does he mean we can use it...?

309
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:35,947
Maybe he has a crush on you Sonoko

310
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,015
What?!

311
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,985
Why Sonoko. Arenst you the popular one!

312
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,421
For goodness sakes? he's so gloomy!

313
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,991
You're right, after all Sonoko.
You have Michiwaki!

315
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:49,094
Ran stop, you're enbarrassing me...

316
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:52,029
Oh no! I forgot my wallet!

317
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,900
Wait for me, I'll be right back

319
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,012
Ran, what's the matter?

320
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:12,651
That guy wearing the glasses... I'm
sure I've seen him somewhere before

322
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,053
Yes. probably in this hotel

323
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,355
No, not here

324
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,025
Somewhere else...

325
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,069
Are you sure?

326
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,948
Where? Where did you see him before?
Think, Ran!

328
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,416
Ran!!

329
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,172
Sonoko. what's keeping you?

330
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,245
Don't tell me you're changing
your clothes... eh?

332
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,849
Sonoko! What happened?

333
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,020
A man attacked me, he ran out
through the window!

335
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:22,988
What?!

336
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,660
Rats! He got away...

337
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,930
I was so scared!

338
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,632
Why would someone attack you?

339
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,966
On't know...

340
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:40,105
when I opened the door to this room,
that man was going through our things,

342
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,774
I was going to scream but he grabbed me!

343
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,543
Going through their things?

344
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,679
He probably wanted to steal our
undenear! The pervert!

346
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,816
What did he look like? You saw his
face. didn't you?

348
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,018
I didn't have a chance!

349
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,988
Besides, the room was dark and I was so
scared, I nearly fainted...

351
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,758
But Sonoko...
how'd you know it was a man...

353
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,061
While we were struggling.
I bit him!

355
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,597
Right on his hairy upper arm!

356
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,465
Wow, nice going...

357
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:12,904
What's going on? What are you
doing in the dark?

359
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,439
Mr. -Michiwaki...

360
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,412
I had engine trouble on the way so I
ran over, sorry I'm late *

362
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,914
But. how'd you know this was our room?

363
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,852
You weren't waiting at the entrance so
I asked the clerk

365
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,753
His shirt's wet...

366
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:33,024
and his pants are splattered with dirt
he couldn't be...

368
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,028
Michiwaki, can you take your shirt off?

369
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:37,762
What?!

370
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,532
I want to see your upper arm

371
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:41,800
Conan!

372
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,971
I don't know what's going on but
Is there something on my arm?

374
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,742
Nothing?! There's no sign of
Sonoko's bite...

376
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:52,711
Satisfied now?

377
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,545
Uh huh...

378
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,983
Is something wrong here... folks?

379
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,686
He's bandagedmy?!

380
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,756
What happened to your arm?

381
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,927
Oh this... a guest got drunk and bit me
the other night

383
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,829
When was that! Answer me!

384
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,801
I don't think he's the one... the man
who attacked me was pretty hairy...

386
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,570
You were attacked?

387
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:23,008
Yes! A man came in through that window
and was searching our bags

389
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,111
Sonoko just happened to come bac #to
{the room and she was attacked!!

391
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:30,548
But it seems he got away emptyhanded
because Conan and I arrived!!

393
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:35,887
It was probably just a thief or
something... it happened once before

395
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,491
It happened before...
why didn't you warn us?!

397
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:44,529
D... didn't I tell you to sec
the storm shutters...

399
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,101
Besides, it's quite late and look
how you're dressed

401
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,871
your belly button s showing,
you should thin Fhow you dress

403
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,906
What?

404
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:58,009
You've just asking for trouble...

405
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,712
Besides, you don't even look
good in that

407
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,548
How dare you! This is my favorite outfit!!

408
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:07,419
Don't worry. You look good in anything.

409
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,887
Whether it's"a, kimono or a bathing suit!

410
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,826
What do you think you're doing?!

411
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:19,030
I'm moving you into another room...
we have another room available

413
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,968
But if you prefer to spend the night
in a room a stranger broke into.

415
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,103
Well that'll be fine with me...

417
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:30,742
And I suggest you forget about going out
tonight and have dinner in our dining room...

419
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,280
your assailant may be waiting out
there for you...

421
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,016
Yipes!
What do you think Ran?

423
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,818
Let's have dinner here...

424
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,597
Hey, the food here is pretty good

425
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:56,134
If we'd known before. we should've
had dinner here last night

427
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,503
If you had made reservations,
we could've prepared

429
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:01,039
an even fancier seafood dinner for you...

430
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,876
of course.
It would be on the house...

432
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,078
but in exchange.

433
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,449
We'd appreciate you didn't go telling
people a thief runs around our inn...

435
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,787
Alright. alright. I won't tell anyone!

436
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,788
That there's a knife wielding underwear
thief in this place!! Happy?!

438
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,057
That there's a knife wielding underwear
thief in this place!! Happy?!

440
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,392
He had a knife?!

441
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,493
What?!

442
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,997
That's right! Some light seeped in
through the crack in the door and

444
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,868
I caught<a glimpse of it...
the blade of the knife flashed!

446
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:34,139
Don't tell me it's the same guy
who killed that girl they found

448
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,008
in woods near the railroad tracks
this afternoon...

450
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,512
Last year, a girl with long brown ,
hair was also found

452
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,249
stabbed in the abdomen here in Izu,
Is it the same man?

454
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:49,988
But if it is. Why's he after Sonoko?

455
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,658
Because she has brown hair?
That's ridiculous!!

457
00:19:53,659 --> 00:20:00,331
Wait a minute...the guy.who attacked
Sonoko was going through the luggage!

459
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:06,171
What could have been in those bags that
had anything to do with the murder...

461
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:12,544
A camera! Could there be a picture
in it of the crime?!

463
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,581
Sonoko! Did the man who attacked
Nou 'take-your camera?"

465
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,050
It was still in my bag!

466
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,319
But the back of the camera was open...

467
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,288
Then did he get the film?

468
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,892
It-wasn'tin there in the first place!
I took all 36 shots.

470
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,895
So this aftesnoon.l.brought-it to be
developed so we could look

472
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,230
at them during dinner tonight...

473
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,899
See! They've been developed!

474
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,469
Well then..May I have a look?

475
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,636
Go ahead

476
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,105
wait a ainute!!
Oh no!!!

478
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:44,608
Don't worry! I took your
pictures out, I have them

480
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,480
Sonoko you sneak!
You had me scared!

482
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:53,251
Do you know these people? You sure
took a lot of pictures of couples...

484
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,222
She took those before she met you,
she was in a very foul mood.

486
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:01,192
She took those while making fun of them!

487
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:06,264
That's strange... nothing looks out
of the ordinary and

489
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,533
the victim's not
in any of them either...

491
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:15,440
Besides... although we passed the spot
where it happened last night.

493
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,810
Sonoko didn't take any pictures there...

494
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:26,985
So why did the killer think she took a
picture that might incriminate him?

496
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,688
I don't undererstand...

497
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:36,194
Something she said at the beach
concession bothers me though...

499
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:42,166
With his deductive powers, he'll be able to
figure out who-it is in a snap

501
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,737
If the killer was at the concession then

502
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,941
But... would that comment make him
misunderstand?

504
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:54,612
Hey ladies... you said you were leaving
tomorrow afternoon. didn't you?

506
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:55,713
Yes...

507
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:59,350
Alright then, shall we go to that
haunted restaurant in the daytime?

509
00:21:59,351 --> 00:21:59,951
What?!

510
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:03,121
Yes, let's go! It's not scary
In the daytime!

512
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:05,022
Alright, but no camera!

513
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,891
Vies I know!

514
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,332
It might be my imagination but it
feels like somebody is watching us...

516
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,104
and the guy in the glasses Ran says
she saw somewhere bothers me too...

518
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,875
then there's the man who attacked Sonoko,

519
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:29,047
was he really just some
mall time thief...
