1
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,520
Today's'stage is also at the breakwater

2
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:24,089
The place was'in such
clear view and conspicuous

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,225
, 4 Yet the crime was very inconspicuous
Fish up the trick and the culprit

6
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,093
He sees through the one and only truth

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,895
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,797
No cases. yet unsolved
with, Detective Conan.

11
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,649
Hey. Mr. Ejiri?! Get a hold ofwyourself!!

00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,517
Snap out of it!! 4

13
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,285
Ugh...Ugh...

14
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:04,456
His lips are turning purple,
cyanosis is starting...

16
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,825
This is proof that he cannot
breathe as he should.

18
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:11,662
Still I can feel his pulse by touch,

19
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:15,134
and his:heart is beating.
Quite okay: which means.

21
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,036
A possible brain damage or...

22
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,673
neurotoxic poisoning!!

23
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:27,446
Huh Artificial respiration

24
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,682
Please carry him on board the ship
right away and take him to a hospitallk

26
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,217
Y.Yeah...

27
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,918
Hang in there, Mr. Ejiri, okay...

28
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,254
Hur!

29
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,156
Here goes...

31
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,160
DO Dear...

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,161
Don't move!!

33
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:42,961
Huh?

35
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:48,066
Ites extremely likely that he was poisoned!

36
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,936
And the one who poisoned him...

37
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,906
IS possibly someone
who 1s here at the breakwater!!

39
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,611
Until the police get here,

40
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:03,215
don't touch anything. and stay still!

41
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,716
H.Hey. hey... what's up?

42
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,654
Who the hell are you, sonny?!

43
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,123
Conan Edogawa...

44
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,424
A detective!!

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,398
(BR)
Tragedy of the Conspicuous Pier Part 2

47
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:26,471
First, let's start with hearing about how
you are all connected with each other...

49
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:31,343
We-all belonged to the same
fishing club since our university days.

51
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,897
Including Mr Ejiri, who
was carried off a while ago too.

56
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:37,833
Dosyou come to fish
at this breakwater frequently?

58
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:42,421
Yeah... .on boardthe
ship of the fisherman called Ida

60
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:46,642
Which means all four of you know each
other quite well from some time back..

62
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,894
Yes...especially Mr. Iday
and I because our parents

64
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,963
who are fishermen also
know each other well...

66
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,898
We've'/known each other 4
since our childhood,days.

68
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,602
I see! You were saying that
you're the daughter of a fisherman...

70
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,304
Yeah, she's really
knowledgeable about fish and

72
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,607
was really popular
withsimen in the club too...

74
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,976
Moreover, she's a good¥CooKk...

76
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,379
She"ssalso beautiful so she was
the Madonna of the fishing club...
P {4 BX

79
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,747
Oh. please cut it out.

80
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,350
Let's not talk about something
so long in the past...

82
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,019
Is that why someone
attempted to kill Mr. Ejin?

84
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,653
Huh?

85
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,023
Because Ms. Shirane
was taken away by Mr. En...

87
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,192
WW: What the hell are you talking about!

88
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,228
Just a while ago,
when Ms. Shirane was about

90
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,631
to run over to him. she called him "dear."

91
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,968
Unless they have
an intimate relationship,

93
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,437
she wouldn't be
calling him.that way. would she?

96
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,438
Then, therone who had to
go through a broken heart

99
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:33,639
Then, the one who had to
go through a broken heart
NT 39,

103
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,073
Then othe one who had to
go through a broken heart

105
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,175
held a grudge against
him! Mr. Kanetani!!

107
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,543
You did it. didn't you!

110
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,081
D.Don't be ridiculous!

113
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,284
Besides<if that was my motive...

114
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,453
the fisherman Ida would
also come up. as a suspect

116
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,155
Mr Ida

117
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:54,026
Because Mr. Ida was
Ms. Shiranés fiancé...

119
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,494
Fiance...?

120
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,463
Besides. that's not possible...

121
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,965
Why not....?

122
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:05,537
Because Mr: Ejiri and
I~Ngot a divorce 3 years ago...

124
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,172
Huh? Why?

125
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:09,007
Well a lot of things, were involved...

126
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,543
But, the fact that we both
Iike fishing hasn't changed

128
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,278
$0 on holidays or on oi day off...

129
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,379
We invite Mr. Kanetani
and come fishing together...

131
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,184
And? You always made everyone's lunch?

133
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:25,023
See: this lunchjthat Mr:!Ejiri ate; the sise
of the lunch box and the-handkerchief

135
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:30,595
it's wrapped in is the; same as.-the
one Mr. Kanetani got from MsgShirane...

137
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,932
It's truesthatiitzlooks
just like Mr. Kanetani¥s. lunch...

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,600
Don:tdellsimerthat the I
Iunch was«poisoned...

141
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,905
4 would never do something like that!!

142
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,141
Besides, as far as §
that lunch is concerned.

144
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,478
I got it from
Ms :Shirane on our way

146
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,350
The lunch boxes are exactly
alike and nobody knows:who:ll get it.

149
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,051
How can poison be
put in something like that?

152
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,486
How. can poison be
put in something like that?

154
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,320
T. That's true...

155
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,421
T.Tihat's true...

156
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,155
Huh?

157
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,958
The pole standfis.in the water...?

158
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,563
This is one of the two
) that Mr. 'Ejiri had erected...

160
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:08,600
The other pole stand is: still
standing okay. and yet why 7?

164
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,846
Hmm, this.case sure is hard to grasp...

165
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:25,217
Maybe the poison was smeared
on the hook and swung around?

167
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,019
I see. the wa the do in lure fishinc...

168
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,123
That can't be Besides,
it would be to difficult-to pinpoint

170
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,859
the part where the
skin is exposed in one fling...

172
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,627
If it works. it'syjust mere chance!

173
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,096
And if the poisoned
hook. is. soaked in water

175
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,031
for-some time. the poison would drift off.

176
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,934
So: .the-lunch was poisoned after all...

177
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,570
No. it's very unlikely...

178
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:49,374
If poison were to be in
something that was chewed-on

180
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,745
I would've been poisoned too
because I performed artificial respiration...

182
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,913
I see!

184
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,484
@h...which means that you knew
he wasn't poisoned from the mouth

186
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,218
No...

188
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,754
I just got a glimpse of where the
poison was insewted. but I didn't know...

190
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:09,694
All I knew back then was that
I had to perform astificial respiration...

192
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,063
Or he. would've died there...

193
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,752
Hey, you!

194
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,939
Can't this ship go any faster?!

195
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,508
Please don't be impossible, officer...

196
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,445
Huh? What's. this smell...?

197
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,980
'Fir
Hey. isn't smoke coming out'!

200
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,783
Well, you're the one who
keeps telling me to go faster, officer

202
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,519
The police sure are late

203
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,654
They sure are...

204
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,389
Well, I gucssyevenything-ll be okay!

205
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,493
The culprit is one of the two anyway!

206
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,012
As long as we keep are eyes on them...

207
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,716
Right, the fisherman wasn't
here with us all this time so .

209
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,468
You can't be too sure...

210
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,001
Huh?

212
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:56,208
If he made Mr Ejiri drink some sleeping
drug with delayed effect:beforehand...

214
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,645
When he came to pick us up,
he could-ve gone up to Mr. Ejiri

216
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,249
to check outtwhat was.wrong and
jpoke:him withrarpoison needle then...

218
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,852
Hey. wait!!

219
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,856
You mean you let a possible
killer and Doc go together?

221
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:14,693
Yeah. There was no other
way to save Mr. Ejiri'slife...

223
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,913
I did give Doc the tranquilizer gun though,

224
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,298
just in case something comes up...

225
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,035
Besides, if anything
happens. Doc's going to call...

228
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,938
T.The phone?!

230
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,173
Hello. Doc?

231
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:28,473
Hello, Doc?

232
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,774
Oh, Shinichi!

233
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,913
I just got Mr! Ejiri on thesambulance now!

234
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,448
And. how: is he?

235
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:41,052
T's hard to say yet The type of poison
hasn't been specified either. so...

237
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:45,156
Maybe if a doctor were
to examine his left wrist

239
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,859
the type of poison may be:specified...

240
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,094
Left. wrist?

241
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,863
Right! Although it was
hidden with his sleeve

243
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,600
there were traces of scratches there.

244
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,603
I'm sure that's how hewas poisoned...

245
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:03,775
Incidentally, there was something
that looked like paste on the sleeve!

247
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,010
Paste you mean the glue type?

248
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:09,781
Yeah... That stuff is not
used for fishing. so isn't it odd?

250
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:13,251
Well, I'll give you the
details when I get there

252
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:14,786
Later, then...

253
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,788
H.Hey. Doc...

254
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,505
P.Paste...?

255
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,725
What did Doc say»?

256
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,996
He said he got Mr. Ejiri on ans
ambulance so he's coming backihere!

259
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,263
That's great!

260
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,031
[ That's.great!

261
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,899
I guess everything-srokay for now...

262
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,068
wonder who the culprit is though...

264
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:34,505
He taught me how to
put bait on my hook...

266
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:40,111
And, the lady. see! She picked¥thiis
bobber that got drifted away up for me.

268
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:44,449
She said she saw it-floating in the
water so she picked it up.with a net.

271
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,920
The fisherman seems to
have taken Mr. En to where

273
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,706
the ambulance came to pick him up too...

274
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,960
At first, he seemed to be
Iooking down-on us

276
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,760
because we're Kids. but...

277
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:00,130
Oh ..you mean when he told
you Not to make too much noise?

279
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,335
Yes we may be kids,
but we won't dance /or

281
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,803
carrymg around portable
shrines in a place like this!

283
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:06,638
Right!

284
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,505
Dancing and-carrying portable shrines?

285
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,943
Hey... tell me exactly
what the fisherman said!

287
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,746
Um~~~he said don't
make too much noise

290
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,649
with your friends and start a festival

291
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,586
1"told him we won't start
a-festival. then he said

294
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,154
go ask the other people

296
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:27,892
Oh, "Omatsuri (festival )
is fishing terminology...

298
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:29,760
Paste...

299
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:29,995
Paste

300
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,829
bobbe...

301
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,180
and omatsur:...

302
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,799
see...so, that's it!!

303
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,501
C«Conan?

305
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,137
Don't tell me"you've
figured out who the culpritiis!!

307
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:40,438
Yeah...

308
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,843
I figuredwout who was trying to fish
Mr. Ejiri's life with a poison hook...

310
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,945
as well as the way it was done!!

312
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:47,145
as well as the way it was done!!!

313
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:47,579
As well as the way it was done!!!

314
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,186
Sea bream!! Sea bream!!

315
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,421
This is sea bream for sure!!!

318
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:01,726
\ Okay, all of you, enough for
the detective thing already. right?

321
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:05,930
You're saying that so that
you can-hide the evidence, right?!

323
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:09,933
Listen...it's true-that
Mr Ejiri didn't look all that great...

327
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:14,305
But, we're not even sure If he was
really poisoned or not yet. you know?

329
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:14,505
But, we're not even sure if he was
really poisoned or not yet, you know?

331
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:18,076
In the first place, the Ida, who took
Mr. Ejiridto'where the ambulance

333
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,779
was is also a suspect, right?
If he's the--one. then the evidence

335
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,650
would"ve-been,disposed
somewhere sin the sea long time ago.

339
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,319
1.1 guess so, but...

340
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,322
That's no problem, because
Doc who went with him

342
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,725
IS keeping an.eye on him... Moreover...

343
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,696
the possibility of Mr. Ida being
the culprit has drastically decreased...

345
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:43,168
now that we know he safely took
Mr. Bjiri to the ambulance. and is

347
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,737
heading back this way with Doc again...

348
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,638
Huh?

349
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,640
Is.Is that right, Conan?

350
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,776
Remember what I said?
I said. if Mr. Ida were the culprit... .-

352
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,413
He would vewhaduto run over to
Mr. Ejiri that he put to sleep beforehand.

354
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,649
And poke a poison needle into him...

355
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,286
heypoison.that was used
as p)'i'.db.ably?-'~neb rfc>tbxic=;-'p"6i'Son...

357
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,089
He wunidehave diffieuity Hredthdhgd
but he would Be» riarareafiiftauswa

359
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,476
If someone poked a poison needle
into him. he would know who it was...

361
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,313
The culprit would never.rush;
such a person to the hospital .:right?

363
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,033
Even if he would've done
SO. Not to be suspected

365
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,235
he would've fled off somewhere already...

366
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,071
Because when thespoison
wears off and Mr. Ejiri

368
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,741
1S able to talk. the culprit
would be revealed

370
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:29,347
I seeswhich means that the suspect
IS either Shirane or Kanetani

372
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,654
Hey. how long is it going
to take you to make repairs?!

374
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,424
Please don't rush me like that, Officer!!

375
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,595
N... We still have no 1
what kindof case it is, and yet...

377
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,564
Are you saying either Mr. Kanetani or I,

378
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:49,334
one of us is the one
who poisoned Mr. Ejin?

380
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,503
D2Don:t be ridiculous...

381
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,540
It's true that we were fishing
on both side! of Mr. Ejiri >.

383
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,177
But he was fishing
on the tip of the tetra pod\.

386
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,914
SO he more than
10 meters away from us...

388
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,984
How could we have poisoned him...

389
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,652
Omatsun!

390
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,170
O.Omatsun?

391
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,323
Omatsuri is a fishing
terminology that 1s used when

393
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,426
two lines get tangled with cach other

394
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,563
You know what to do
when that happens. right?

396
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,866
I see! The culprit took advantage
of him wanting to untangle his line

398
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,601
in which he would bring
his fish hook near his hand!

400
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:27,806
So. the comment of the isherman

401
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,608
Don't get too noisy as-if
it were a festival(omatsuri)...

403
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,444
Was not an insulting remark at all

404
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,712
Right...

405
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:39,317
the culprit deliberately got the
fishing line tangled with Mr. Ejiri's.

407
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,288
And, when Mr. Ejiri tried to
untangle the line. 'it's slightly pulled on...

409
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,858
and the poisoned hook
would sink into Mr. Ejiri's hand!

411
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,662
But: you did also say that \
if the hook smeared with poison

413
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,432
is soaked in the water for some
time the poison would dissolve.

415
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,784
Yeah...if the poison was
just-smeared on to the hook.

417
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,971
Then the poison would dissolve,

418
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,273
but its a different story if paste is used

419
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,275
P Paste?

420
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,276
Yeah...

421
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:10,014
if poison is mixed into the paste and then
smeared onto the hook and dried hard...

423
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,585
It would start to dissolve
when soaked in salt water...

425
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:17,222
and by the time it gets
tangled with Mr. Ejiri's line...

427
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,575
it would be gooey and just.
Right for use... As proof of this...

430
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:21,492
Doc just told me on
the phone that there was

433
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:21,743
Doc just told me on
the phone that there was

435
00:14:21,744 --> 00:14:23,795
Doc just toldifime on
the phone that there was

437
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,397
paste on the left
sleeve of Mr. Ejiri's shirt...

439
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:32,003
He also mentioned that there were traces
of scratch marks on Mr. Ejiri's left wrist!

441
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:38,009
That's probably why Mr. Ejiri's
pole stand was in the water too...

444
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,377
His pole stand?

446
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,211
Yeah!

447
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,915
When the fishing line was
pulled to sink the poison hook in

449
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,818
When the pole itself
was pulled. the pole stand was

451
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,354
pulled at the same time
and fell into the water as well...

453
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:52,790
But, can you really do something
Iike deliberately getting

455
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,060
your own line tangled
with somebody else's...

457
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,729
Of course you can!

458
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,900
You use a lot of hooks with poison
smeared on them and use light sinkers...

460
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,769
Then you let it drift along
to the flow of the current.

462
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,071
And it gets tangled super easily

463
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,408
If the poisoned hoo as
a fly hook. when it is pulled up...

465
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,977
even If there were to be
many hooks attached to it

467
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,613
nothing strange would be thought of it!

468
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,450
And? Which of them

469
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,752
did that...?

470
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,253
I just said, didn't 1?

471
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,023
That therling was tangled using
the flow of-the current. right. . 7?

473
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:30,028
Remember she picked up you, 1
bobber that drifted away. Ayumi?

476
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,129
Yes!"She did...

477
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,196
* in other words.

478
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,833
If Ms. Shirane who was on the
right edge picked up your bobber

480
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,569
the flow of the current
was from left to right...

482
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,006
And if the culprit took advantage
of the flow of the current...

484
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,010
Right, the one who was fishing
between Mr. Ejiri and all of us.

486
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,945
Mr. Kanetani!!

487
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,148
You're the one who did it. right?!

488
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,418
H.Hey. is that true? Mr Kanetani...?

489
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,655
N.No,way. No need to take
what kids say all that seriously...

491
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,957
Besides

492
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,826
whit makes you think 1'd do sotnaeth
Iike that at 2 breakwatar lithe this

496
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:02,910
I mean, there're only so many of us.

499
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:03,161
I mean. there're only so many of us.

501
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:03,411
I mean, there're only so many of us.

504
00:16:03,412 --> 00:16:03,661
I mean. there're only so many of us.

506
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,331
JJEC ORT fits

507
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,834
No. the suspects were narrowed
down-merely2because of coincidence

509
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,572
Backathen- if the fish didn't bite
his line. and if we didn't go over to him we

511
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,942
thinking that something was: strange
because he showed no reaction...

513
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,412
he would've been left as is,
and time would just pass by...

515
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:24,816
The estimated time of death
wouldve been expanded

517
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,618
and there would've
been a lot more suspects...

519
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,154
And, you're the very one
who said that you wanted to

521
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,790
change fishing spots
because no fish were biting...

523
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,127
I see...so, Mr. Ejint who said that
he wanted to stick it out here till night

525
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,162
would've been left behind alone...

526
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,932
And, if everyone else
moves to a new fishing spot...

528
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,668
it could've béensmade to
Iook as if someone came along

530
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,571
in a boat and poisoned Mr~Ejiri
who was fishing all by himself...

532
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,774
Yeah. besides, there are many
people here that would testify

534
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,977
that Mr. Kanetani never
once went near Mr. Ejiri too...

536
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,981
B.But if the hook poked him
he would at least let out a cry .

538
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,151
So. you set the timing
for when-to hook-it on. right?

540
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,756
That as, to the sound of the
ship that came torepick us up...

545
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,089
Oh, Doc.

546
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:06,524
Oh. Doc!

547
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,027
I see! He erased the
sound of the scream/of pain

549
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,629
when being poked with
the sound of the of the ship!

551
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,831
Moreover the direction
the ship came from was

553
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,034
opposite the direction
that everyone was fishing...

555
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,219
Everybody attention
would be distracted from Mr. Ejiri

558
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,605
so it would be like killing
two birds with one stone...

560
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,939
{ vs =
B.But. sonny. you don't even have proof...

562
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,140
Jour
B.But. sonny. you don't even have proof...

566
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:23,441
B.But. sonny. you don't even have proof...

567
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,144
This pole of yours is the evidence...

568
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,445
The bobber us sunk

569
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:30,381
so. it should still be there...

570
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:36,471
Mr. Bjiri'S pole that got tangled
with your terminal tackle!

572
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:38,222
Uuuugh...

573
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,126
The paste that was mixed with poison
Is) probably almost completely dissolved.

575
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,695
But... THAT would not dissolve so easily...

576
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:49,467
Mr. Ejiri's blood that is
on the hook that scratched him...

578
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,371
MM Mr. Kanetanu...

579
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,876
Mr. Kanetani, may I ask why
u did what you did to him...

581
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,181
We just went drinking the other day
all three of us together. didn't we?!

583
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,617
The reason is his remark
when we went drinking...

585
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:13,658
When: ou left the seat, I asked
him why you both got a divorce...

587
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,593
A.A lover?

588
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:20,414
Yeah... I just started a new
business back then and...

590
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:23,584
I was going throughua lot of stress.

591
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:27,755
She+found:out that
I was having-an-affair and left me...

593
00:18:27,756 --> 00:18:30,374
H.He said that...

594
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:34,428
Yeah...l had no intention of
saying anything about the fact

596
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:37,482
that he got a divorce ofdthad a lover, but...

597
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:41,786
I just couldn't forget
what he said after all that.

599
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,057
Well. I guess what it:alllboils*down 10; is.
Be it a company. fish or women...

601
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,743
the best part. s:when,
they are alive andikicking

603
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,495
Don't tell-her this: okay.

604
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,133
Yeah. it was like he had shattered
the dream of my younger-days...

607
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,502
just couldn't take it in...

608
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,704
+ Because you were really our Madonna...

609
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,206
Don't be silly...

610
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,644
He divorced me... for my sake

611
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,445
Hung

612
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,815
Back then, his company \
was on the verge of bankruptcy?

614
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:16,020
And he couldn't save his employees
unless he started a new business

616
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,257
But. in order to. do so, he had to
take on an enormous amount of debt

618
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,927
He got on his hands and
knees.begging me to divorce him.

620
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,731
He begged me saying that
If the new business fails

622
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,001
I'd end up having to
face the collectors too...

624
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,337
I wanted to overcome the
situation as husband and wife...

626
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:37,475
But. since his stubborn and
not too strong taking on pressure

628
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:42,613
And -as for me: I wanted to continue
my job as a cuisine essayist I agreed...

630
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:46,951
So. that thine about a lover is
a story he made up to<put on a front...

633
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,188
I don't like that comment
he made of women

635
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,256
who are alive and kicking. though...

636
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,258
No, there's no need to get angry...

637
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,127
Because he was referring-to you when

640
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,062
he said women who
are alive and Kicking

642
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,262
Huh?

643
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,866
While sailing on the swaying boat,

644
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,102
Mr. Ejiri kept repeating to
himself over and over again...

646
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:09,373
A fish that is truly alive and kicking is one
that can freely swim through the ocean...

648
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,608
He asked me if I thought so too...

649
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,012
What an idiot...

650
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,181
Oh. no. my God...What on earth...

651
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,383
What on.earth have I done...

652
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,753
Don't worry! He seems to have
recovered quite a bit already...

654
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,759
Beside dust before we go there,
I got a call from Ejiri, who sounded okay.

656
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,429
He asked me to relay a message>to-you.

657
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,132
He said for you to get
super fresh fish for her today...

659
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,102
If you do, he says he'll
forget what happened today...

661
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,806
He said he would tell the hospital
and police that he was poisoned

663
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,942
by a balloon fish that
he cooked and ate on his own.

665
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,712
SO to not come back
until you get big catch.

667
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,081
Is today a special day or something?

668
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,784
My? Come to think of it,
today is our wedding anniversary...

670
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,355
Your anniversary ?
If I'm not mistaken today is...

673
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,941
Don-ttell me you) forgot?

674
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,959
Happy Birthday. Doc!

675
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,860
Huh?

676
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,829
Genta, which means
that you were trying to...

678
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,733
Yeah, fish something
for Doc's birthday present!

680
00:21:09,734 --> 00:21:12,069
No Genta! Don't say a word about it!

681
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,139

secret from Ai too so that

683
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,741

684
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,975

685
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:21,479

00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,289

an array of odd occurrences

753
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,578
wasn't coming to the ocean a good idea?

754
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,250
Yes...now I understand how fish feel...

755
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,602
Huh? Just what do you mean by that?

756
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:45,556
The body temperature of
humans is .too warm for fish...

758
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,593
Right. it's too wa m for me too

760
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:53,297
that I feel as if 'm going tor get burned

761
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:57,802
Hey. hey. it's still not repaired?!
