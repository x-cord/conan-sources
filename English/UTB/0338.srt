Four Porschesyist like

The case far surpasses all expectations!

He sees through the one and only truth,

Since she came back home,
she's runninc a fever.

19
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,399
Hey! Are you all right...?

20
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:34,469
It's just a cold...

21
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,940
It's not something you have to go out
of your way to come see me for...

23
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,174
So much has been going on recently

24
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,043
that she probably just
psychologically tired...

26
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:49,184
By the way. Are you okay?

27
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:49,785
Huh

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,420
Remember...

29
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,289
The guys the other day,
that were tailing us.

31
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,293
If they tail you back here
and find this house,

33
00:02:58,294 --> 00:02:59,695
we'll get Dr. Agasa into trouble too...

34
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,463
Don't worry!

35
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:03,498
I wasn't tailed by anyone.

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,001
And nobody's watching
over this house either...

38
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:12,808
She should go see a doctor. but...

39
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:14,843
today is Sunday and

40
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:17,613
he hospitals around here are all closed

41
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:21,884
Right! We could ask
Dr. Araide what do you say?

43
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:25,019
Yeah... I called him a while ago,
but he wasn't in...

45
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:30,424
He's probablydbusy because
the trial for that case is coming up...

47
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:36,365
Come to think of it, there's a hospital inside
the Tohto Department Store in Haidocho,

49
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,699
SO maybe we should take her there.

50
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,503
If I remember correctly,
their day off is Thursday...

52
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:43,372
You don't have to

53
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,307
go out of your way to take
me to the hospital...

55
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,708
Well,

56
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,278
there's nothing better than getting rid
of your cold as soon as possible!

58
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,214
Like they say colds may lead
to all kinds of diseases...

60
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,865
You mean you can't see her right away?

61
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:13,452
No... We have a lot of patients today...

62
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,705
You'll have to wait about
2 hours if you come now...

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,740
Well: it cant be helped. S

65
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,576
Let's put in an appointment anyway...Doc.

66
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,612
Oh... excuse-me.

67
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,515
We'd like to make an-appointment...

68
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:27,749
Yes.

70
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:31,887
I guess'we can kill time
in the department store then...

72
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,357
Yes... thank you.

73
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:39,795
Guess so...

74
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,931

Okay... Stop!

00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,377
Okay. we're here, Al!

87
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,547
O-Okay...

88
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,922
Here... hang on to me!

89
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,126
You're still feeling unsteady aren't you?

90
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,967
I'm not that hopeless. ok

91
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,471
Never mind,
will you just move out of my way...

93
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:57,004
Oh... yes...

94
00:05:58,574 --> 00:05:59,708
I can manage to get off the car

95
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,543
There you go again...

96
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,612
by myself...

97
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:14,256
P...Porsche...

98
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:17,192
356A...

99
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,069
Gin's car...

100
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,108
Hey" AW!

101
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,680
Hey. Ail!

103
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:46,288
That is undoubtedly the same model
as that of Gin's but...

105
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:49,624
His is black and this is green!

106
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,910
The color is different...

107
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,995
and besides

108
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:57,265
since all three Porsches are parked
so close together

110
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,735
I'm sure that a bunch of
Porsche lovers got-together to

112
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,903
eat at the department store...

113
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,278
Another Porsche...

114
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,048
It's a 911...

115
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,358
Okay!! We're here...

116
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,460
We're here, Mr. Banba!

117
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,062
Mr. Banba?

118
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,465
Darn...

119
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,534
Another OB...

120
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,936
Ghads. hopeless...

121
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,339
Ghads. hopeless...

122
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,875
Well, it's not something
unexpected though...

124
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:40,842
Okay then

125
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:42,978
why don't we do some
shopping or something like always

127
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:44,679
until Banba's booze wears off...

128
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,515
Hold it!!

129
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,917
Let me go back to
the car and get my wallet.

131
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:49,618
Yeah...

132
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,153
I guess I'll go too...

133
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:54,055
Excuse me, mister!

134
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,126
Are the 4 Porsches parked here...

135
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:59,728
all yours?

136
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:00,795
Y-Yeah...

137
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:04,933
That green, old one is... Mr. Hotei's

138
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:07,369
Porsche 356A...

139
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,906
The new. car to the right edge-is

140
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,742
Ms. Taeyama's Porsche Boxter...

141
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,279
(-1... this is my dear ca

142
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,814
Porsche 911!

143
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,683
And this red one is...

144
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,753
Porsche 928 that belongs to Mr. Banba

145
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,354
who is asleep in my car!

146
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,691
But why were all four men
riding in your car?

148
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,426
Well, that's because...

149
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,064
We're all Porsche lovers as well as
friends who play golf together...

151
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:41,303
When all four of us go
golfing we gather here,

153
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,872
then take Kureko's car and
head off together in one car!

155
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:46,608
The more the merrier...

156
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,177
and the highwayfee is
cheaper that way too...

158
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:55,517
Even the parking fee here is free if
we shop in this department store too...

160
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:58,452
ides... after we make half a rot

161
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:00,589
there's someone here who gulps down

162
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,392
more beer than he can handle
and passes out wasted...

164
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,597
We have no other choice but go shopping
or something until he sleeps it off!

166
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:10,432
Well,

167
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,767
and this parking lot is crowded on Sundays

168
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,537
and it's difficult to find an open stall,

169
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:18,089
so it's like we're saving
a stall for ourselves...

171
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,375
Hey. it's time we get going...

172
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,308
Yeah...

173
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:22,177
See you!!

174
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:26,414
Saving a stall?

175
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:30,418
I guess he means that
nobody has guts enough

177
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,721
to park their car between two Porsches.

178
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:33,388
Oh. I see...

179
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,090
Oh. I see...

180
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:38,659
Okay. so Al... shall we start off too...

182
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,767
Count me out...

183
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:46,635
Huh

184
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,271
I don't feel too well...so

185
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:52,774
I guess I'll wait here in the car until the
» time for my appointment with the doctor.

187
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:00,015
Hey! Al...?

188
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,582
It can't be helped...

189
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,620
She was tailed by people
she doesn't know the identity of...

191
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:08,723
It's no wonder she's all worked up...

192
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,359
W-Which means that!!

193
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,396
The ones who were tailing us
were the Men in Black...

195
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,464
Could be.

196
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:18,199
Although I'm not all that sure myself yet...

197
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,002
I've got to at least find out whether

198
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:24,105
it's me or Ai that they're after

199
00:10:25,441 --> 00:10:27,942
otherwise, I can't make any moves...

201
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:35,650
rday before dawn...

202
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:38,353
It's the follow-up news of the robbery case
which occured in the city of Tokyo.

204
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,088
The killer is still on the run...

205
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,124
The police are collecting
the information from an eyewitness

207
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:47,462
Me... OF Al?

208
00:10:58,307 --> 00:11:01,876
Uh~~= I think it was the 10th floor...

209
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,678
wonder if it's okay. though.

210
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,816
To have left Ai back there alone...

211
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,984
We had no oterh choice. did we...

212
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,433
CA oto pe ramen

213
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,489
They serve western style food here.

214
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,412
Italian food...

215
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,414
And . Chinese food...

216
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,851
There sure is a lot of variety, isn't there?

217
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,420
H...? What is it

218
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:48,957
Boy... what a long line...

219
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,262
Tarugatei Oh!! Here it is...

221
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,433
Hey. hey...

223
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,202
You,gotta be kidding*

224
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:04,739
Iook at this line: Doc!

225
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:08,976
Just as would be expected of
a shop famous for egg porridge.

227
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:13,548
We can kill time just standing in line...

228
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,116
Huh

229
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:20,488
AAAb AA

00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,060
I'll 'be: right back...

234
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,398
They're the people we just saw
a while ago in the parking lot...

236
00:12:31,534 --> 00:12:32,933
Hey!!

237
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,005

00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:45,764
Oh... Ran-and Sonoko too...

243
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,014
Oh... Ran and Sonoko too...

245
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,315
Oh... Ran and Sonoko too...

247
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,750
Hello!!

248
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,218
W-What's up?

249
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:51,853
What brings you here?

250
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,190
We came to eat
the egg porridge of Tarugatei!

252
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,291
Bug ou?.

253
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,694
No not at all...

254
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:03,264
I wasn't referring to you Sonoko...

255
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:06,468
We told Jody that it's really delicious.

257
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:07,902
then she said she wanted
to come and eat it...

259
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:09,070
Yes!!

260
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:12,606
Japanese food is healthy
and very. very good!!

262
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,909
Oh... ll see...

263
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:18,413
And... why are you both here, Conan?

264
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:22,150
You were saying that you were going to
visit Al who is in bed with a cold...

266
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:22,750
Oh... well...

267
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:23,784
Oh... well...

269
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:28,523
Y Yes...

270
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:30,358
SO ai IS here-with. us and

271
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,494
IS here with us and

272
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:36,297
we-were going to eat
the egg porridge-with her...

274
00:13:36,765 --> 00:13:39,267
but her cold is so bad...
and she didn't look like she could make it.

276
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:41,269
So we. left her behind!

277
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,372
Right, Doc!!

278
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,111
Agh. that's the story...

279
00:13:56,018 --> 00:14:00,188
Look-at this .everybody!

280
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:07,028
What a long line of people!

281
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,231
This is the restaurant arcade inside
the Tohto Department Store.

283
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,768
See! It's even popular on TV

285
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,937
SO we had an urge to come eat here...

287
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,807
Oh!! She's Tomomi Kato
of the Gourmet Corner...

289
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:21,042
You're right!

290
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:22,610

Okay. Fl start my interview right away.

293
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:50,405
The serial arsonist
hasn't been arrested yet...

295
00:14:50,406 --> 00:14:52,507
The Metropolitan Police Department
IS calling on the people

297
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:54,776
in the vicinity to be very careful...

298
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:58,146
So...

299
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,514
Come-on..no! It.can't be!

300
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,401

The Place I Promised to Meet You."

Hello, boy!!

Did you come to here to Tohto Department
Store to eat'Egg porridge too?

310
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:33,097
Yep. But, since ther are so many people
in hne... 'guess I'm not...

313
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:36,651
Is that right...

315
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,302
Did you come to eat the egg porridge
here at Tarugatei too?

317
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:28,903
Yes.

318
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:31,305
So...we're

319
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,907

322
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,111

C-Conan!!

331
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,122
People go in and out of
this shop quite quickly so

333
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:49,957

334
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,326

Yep. but...

336
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,197
Kid's wouldn't really know
the difference in taste anyway...

338
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:01,769
Hey?!

339
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:03,771
What's up...

340
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,640
All of a sudden...

341
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,277
Hey! Shinichi!! :Shinichi?!

342
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,024
The person I saw a while ago...

343
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:02,897
He came back...

344
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:11,839
Doc... and Shinichi...

345
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,643
What's up?

346
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:17,578
Y doesn't he look s

347
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,214
dreadfully serious?

348
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,850
Shinichi!

349
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,968
M-Mr. Banba...!!

350
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:53,748
This is...?!

351
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:55,883
What's the matter,

352
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,251
Shinichi?

353
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,555
No good...

354
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,089
He's been strangled...

355
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:05,927
- -Hello... police?

356
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:09,297
I'm calling from the basement parking lot
of the Tonto Department Store

358
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,331
from my cell phone

359
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:14,935
I'll stay back here, so take Ai
and get away from here, Doc!

361
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,137
Huh? Why ?

362
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:21,608
My face was taken by
the TV cameras a while ago...

364
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:25,112
If the guys who were
tailing us the other day

366
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:27,949
were the Men in Black...

367
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,385
we can't be too sure that they Won't
come here after seeing me. right?

369
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,754
Don't worry!

370
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,691
The TV program just a while ago
IS the afternoon wide show...

372
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,227
The viewer rating is only about 1046...

373
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:43,364
It's not a live broadcast that's
aired during Golden Time...

375
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,600
It's most probable that
they're not watching...

377
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:46,934
Heck!!

378
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:50,738
The number of TV viewers in the Kanto
District is approximately 4 million people.

380
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,473
Even if the viewer rating were to be 1%

381
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:55,376
the number of people watching
would be about 400,000!!

383
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:58,546
10% makes it 4 million people.

384
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,600
There's no guarantee that
they wouldn't be watching!!

386
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,056
So... now that you understand
hurry and get Al out of here!

388
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,293
If you look around Tokyo,

389
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,762
I'm sure you'll be able to find
a hospital that opens even on Sundays...

391
00:20:15,564 --> 00:20:16,831
I feel sorry for Au.

392
00:20:16,865 --> 00:20:19,267
But she'll just have to hold up till then...

393
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:33,581
Tarugatel

394
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:43,524
It sure rains a lot. doesn't it

395
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:45,960
Huh 2!

397
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:48,646
Wow! Hey, look!!

399
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,114
There are police cars parked
in front of this~department store!!

401
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,432
There are police cars parked
in front of this department store!!

403
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,501
I wonder if something happened...

404
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,938
Don't tell me that...

405
00:20:57,472 --> 00:20:59,406
the glasses kid is

406
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,076
messed up In some case again...

407
00:21:04,146 --> 00:21:05,746
N-No...

408
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,214
Seeing is believing.

409
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,052
Which means...seeing is believing.

410
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,587
Shall we go check?

411
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,329
Y how come you're not letting us ou

412
00:21:21,563 --> 00:21:22,797
Oh... well,

413
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:26,233
we were contracted
by the police a while ago...

415
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:29,737
\ There's been a grave incident
inside this parking lot that

417
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:33,074
I can't let anyone out of here.

418
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,242
So... now you know,

419
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:39,380
we. can get.out:of here until
the killer is caught... Shinichi.

421
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,681
It can't be helped...

422
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,551
Find an empty'lotand wait there...

423
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,521
it... what if they come.

424
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,957

425
00:21:50,092 --> 00:21:51,791

I don't understand...

478
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:09,897
How did the killer strangle Mr. Banba

479
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:13,000
and how did the killer
collect the murder weapon?

481
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,435
