that is in the charge of Reiko Kujo, who is
also known as the Madonna prosecutor.

Of all things the one who has the key
to the alibi of defendant Usami

19
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:13,531
who was charged with murder, is Pops!

20
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,769
And worse yet,

21
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,975
he was summoned to court-as-a

Where and what were you doing
on the night the incident happened?

30
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:58,110
I was drinking sake at the restaurant
called Mimasu located in Haido city

32
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:01,080
At there, you drunk 2 cups of Sake,

33
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:03,082
And you fell asleep on the counter
of the bar.

35
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,417

How did you find out what time it was?

46
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,830
I got a call on my cell phone
just as I was dozing off,

48
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,466
so the shopkeeper woke me up.

49
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,637
When I looked the watch on my
cell phone showed 21:25.

51
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:29,375
And were there any other:customers
at that time?

53
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,710
I was there alone, but

54
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:36,549
since the reception of my cell phone
wasn't too good,

56
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,652
I was heading outside,
when a man came as I was going out.

58
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,388
Do you remember how he looked?

59
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,789

00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,434
Why would the prosecution want to prove
he alibi of the defendant?...

75
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:01,674
I don't know
I'm sure she's up to something though...

77
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,111
I was surprised because he took the
witness stand for the prosecutor,

79
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,680
but dad is on mom's side after all.

You may cross-examine the

Thank you, sir.

86
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,128
All right. Mr. Mouri

87
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,098
do you remember until around what time
the suspect Mr. Usami was at Mimasu?

89
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,003
I'm sure he was there for 30 minutes,
so I think he stayed till about 22:00...

91
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,040
In other words,
the suspect was at Mimasu

93
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:39,578
from 21:30 to 22:00, the hours that the
victim is estimated to have been killed?

95
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,414
Well, I guess so.

96
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,485
That will be all.

00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,221
Which means that the witness...

00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:49,989
our honor...

102
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,459
May I ask one last question, your honor?

103
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,394
Granted.

104
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,062
Thank you.

105
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,398
Mr. Mourn,

106
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,301
you stated a while ago
that you were awakened

108
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,403
by the owner of Mimasu
fter you doze off...

111
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:06,572
1 Oo.

112
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,544
Then, where was your cell phone
at that time?

114
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,444
Here it comes!

115
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:18,817
Of course it was inside the
inner pocket of my coat

117
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,221
that was on the clothes rack
inside the counter...

119
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,526
Which means that it would've been
possible for someone to fool around with

121
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,530
the time display of your cell phone
while you were asleep...

123
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,134
Let's say
for example the owner of the 'shop...

125
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,335
No way.

126
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,369
Objection your honor!!

127
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,640
The remark.the prosecutor
just made is mere speculation!

129
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,078
Prosecutor please base your
remarks only on facts.

131
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,846
Yes, sir...

132
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,715
Your honor,

133
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,317
I would like to call on another witness,

134
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,152
the former wife of the defendant

135
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,891
as well as the owner of restaurant Mimasu,
Mrs. Masako Kameda.

137
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,528
He got us...

138
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,028
NM. Ms. Kisaki...

139
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,333
It's my mistake for being
overly concerned about his alibi

141
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,867
and failing to check into the details...

142
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,475
What on earth is going on, Conan?

143
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,713
So long as the cell phone wasn't
in Pops hand AN

145
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,449
the defendant's alibi is invalid.

146
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,150
In other words,

147
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:30,623
someone could've fooled around with the
watch of his cell phone,

149
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,860
call Pops at any time, then wake him up,

150
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,495
to make him confirm what time it is...

151
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,266
Next, all that has to be done is
change the time back again

153
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,435
when Pops takes his eyes off
the cell phone again.

155
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,905
It is possible for the owner of
Mimasu to do that.

158
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:49,842
ight...

159
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,278
Your mom, just like you

160
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,716
was already under the impression that the
two were not on good terms with each other

162
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,052
so Ms. Kisaki didn't even think that
the owner of Mimasu

164
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,855
would cooperate in establishing
an alibi for the defendant...

167
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,227
Rs..Masako Kameda...

168
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,862
On the night of the incident
(38)

170
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:14,166
didn't you change the time on the
cell phone of Mr. Kogoro Mourn?
(38)

173
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:14,800
didn't you change the time on the
cell phone of Mr. Kogoro Mourn?

175
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,606
Well?

176
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:26,812
By the way if lie under oath,
you: could be accused of perjury...

178
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,748
Masako?!

179
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,686
T's just as...

180
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,689
It's just as you say, prosecutor...

181
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,330
Then, you admit to having changed the
time on Mr. Mouri's cell phone?

183
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,331
Yes...

184
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,666
What time was it actually

185
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:53,605
when the defendant Usami came to your
shop as Mr. Mouri wentwout?

187
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:59,378
I moved the clock 30 minutes so
I think it was about 21:55.

189
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:00,979
Your honor,

190
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,517
the scene of the crime and the shop of the
witness is only about 10 minutes on foot,

192
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,054
which means the defendant had more than
enough time to carry out the crime.

195
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,991
El; 3)
Would the defense like to question
the witness?

198
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,793
Just one question.

199
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,363
Masako

200
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,433
When I asked you to talk to me
before this trial,

203
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:25,671
If ll remember correctly, I'm sure you said
you hated the defendant.

205
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:31,210
So why would you take on such a task
as making up and alibi for him?

207
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,912
Don't know...

208
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,950

Ran told me to keep an eye on you

00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,021
Huh?

274
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,090
Come to think of I Ohhaven't seen any

275
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,459
Usami probabl doesn't smoke.

276
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,629
But, look there's a match box here.

277
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,931
Huh?

278
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,134
This is the match box of Mimasu...

279
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,070
If so, it's not odd that it's here.

280
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,775
But, wasn't he on bad terms with his wife?
Then why...

282
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,311
Married couples go through a lot of
complicated feelings,

284
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,813
although it may be hard for a kid like
you to understand.

287
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,017
Really

288
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,788
This is...

290
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,310
Xcuse me...

291
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:28,747
Is there iidako in the oden today too?

292
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,449
H, hi, sonny...

294
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,917
1 CO.

295
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,153
After all, it's one of the specialties of
this shop, sol can't do without it.

297
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,455
Do you like it, sonny?

298
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,657
Yep, because it's so delicious!

299
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,560
Oh...all right, then I'll give you some.

300
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,562
All right! Thank you!

301
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,697
You're welcome

302
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,101
You've got that picture too, don't you?

303
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,103
Huh?!

304
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,872
I saw it in Mr. Usami's room too.

305
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:55,941
Oh...

306
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,481
Huh?!
Making him take the witness stand again?

308
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:05,951
Yep, he says he goofed it the last time,

309
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,885
so he'd like to be given a chance
to make up for it this time.

311
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,689
But, with the alibi invalid and all,

312
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,691
what difference is-Mr. Mourn
standing witness going to do?

314
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:16,962
It seems to rave somet Ing to oO wit tye
blank time, that he talked about last time.

316
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,798
And he also said yousd understand
fl show you this...

318
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,101
This is the match box of Mimasu, isn't it?

319
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,371
This is

320
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,373
his and another thing.

321
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,443
He said take a good look at the contents
that was in the victim's stomach...

323
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,077
The contents In his stomach...

324
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,013
Ms. Kisaki...?

325
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:57,202
Then, Mr Mouri, let me confirm what
happened that night once again.

327
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,540
Around what time did you go to Mimasu?

328
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,576
About 19:30 like I always do.

329
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,379
And, when did you doze off?

330
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,580
20:30...

331
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,251
In other words, you were sleeping from
20:30 to the actual time

333
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,455
you were awakened at 21:55?

334
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,257
Yeah, I guess so.

335
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,961
Just what is Ms. Kisaki trying to get at?

336
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,131
Wonder...
I guess she just being a bad sport.

338
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,167
Which means that no matter what
happened inside the shop at that time,

340
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,269
you wouldn't have noticed, right?

341
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,438
Just what are you trying to get at anyway?

342
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,473
Let's say,

343
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:36,975
even if Mr. Usami were to have
brought the victim

345
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,612
to the shop while you were asleep...

346
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,215
Objection, your honor!

347
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,751
That's just groundless guess work!!

348
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,886
I do have something to stand on.

349
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:51,423
Please take a good look at the
victim's autopsy report.

351
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:55,260
There should be iidako inside the contents
of his stomach.

353
00:14:55,928 --> 00:15:00,365
Mimasu always has iidako being that
it is one of their specialties.

355
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,370
By the way, I checked with all the
restaurants in the vicinity and found that

357
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:10,509
there is no other shop that includes iidako
in their menu except for Mimasu!

359
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,477
Let's say it was as the defense claims,

360
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,647
and the defendant did
in fact visit Mimasu that night,

362
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,183
what difference does that make?

363
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:19,284
It:makes a great difference!

364
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,854
Because it means that the victim has met
someone other than the defendant

366
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,792
that has the motive to commit murder.

367
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:30,862
Hey, hey, the only customer that was there
bac {then at the shop was me!

369
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,964
The person didn't have to be a customer,
right?

371
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:33,999
What?!

372
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,467
N,No

373
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,671
D,Don't be ridiculous!!

374
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:45,277
PO PS
1, Kogoro Mouri will guarantee that the
owner of Mimasu would never do

377
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:46,578
Cy Fy Fuge Fur Fd Fear Fy Fd Fay ay Say

378
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,083
Is what I'd like to say, but I can't!

379
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,585
- Cc -
w.ouecatl., LL.

381
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,391
The point that leads to the key
to solving this case is

383
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,894
the actual kind of relationship
the defendant Usami

385
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,364
and his wife Masako had with each other.

386
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,001
It is true that the relationship between
the two became quite hostile

388
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,972
to the point of getting a divorce after they
Iost their beloved son by accident...

390
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,740
But, they also believed that

391
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,343
the man Hirasawa was to
blame for the entire incident...

393
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:19,845
And, that night,

394
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,480
defendant Usami ran into the very person

395
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,350
who had torn them apart
and got into an argument.

397
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,788
After the argument they were chased
out of the shop at 20:30.

399
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:35,493
The defendant took Mr. Hirasawa to
Mimasu where Masako was...

401
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,930
Well, I guess you could say,

402
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,734
he coincidentally ran into the guy he
had held a grudge against for years,

404
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,970
and didn't know what to do,

405
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,139
so he took the victim over to his
ex wife's shop...

407
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,877
And that was about a little past 20:45...

408
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,980
On the other hand, Masako ,

409
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,781
who sees Hirasawa right before her eyes,

410
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,852
finds that all the flames of hatred that she
had almost forgotten revives within her

412
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,388
So, she sends the defendant home and

413
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,791
Iures Hirasawa out to the construction site,
which after she kills him...

415
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,930
After that she rushes back to Mimasu,

416
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:16,067
sees me asleep and
goes ahead to establish her false alibi...

418
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:17,302
In other words,

419
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:22,274
the false alibi that the prosecutor
saw through was not for the defendant,

421
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:26,211
but rather actually of Masako!

422
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,849
Just as expected of a detective.

423
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,685
Your story is very well made up indeed...

424
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,086
However,

425
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,621
this happens to be a courtroom

426
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,690
and not a place to make people
Iisten to your fantastic deductions!

428
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,659
This is a place to battle truth
against truth!!

430
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,996
Do you happen to disagree
with my deduction?

432
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:45,931
First of all,

433
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:49,367
how do you know that the defendant
went home while leaving the victim behind?

435
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,570
How can you tell that
he didn't ask his wife

437
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,174
to make up his alibi and
then take the victim out himself?

439
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:01,713
If so, then the defendant should be
insisting on his alibi to begin with, right?

441
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:03,915
Another thing.

442
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,585
How are you going to explain the car key of
the defendant that was found at the site?

444
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,587
That's simple.

445
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,791
The defendant, himself put it
near the corpse.

447
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:13,658
Huh?

448
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,729
Although the defendant left the shop alone,

449
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,165
he probably got worried and
returned to the shop.

451
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:26,171
There, he runs into the site
where Masako had killed Hirasawa.

453
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:30,008
The defendant probably thought as follows.

454
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,378
That it would be better for him to
be accused of homicide on the grounds

456
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,714
that he was drunk,
rather than his wife being charged...

458
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,185
Maybe he thought that just like Hirasawa
whofhad Killed his son,

460
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:44,456
he would be able to
get away with a lighter sentence.

462
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,191
That's ridiculous!!

463
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:50,962
A sentence doesn't always get lighter just
because a person is drunk, you know?!

465
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,397
It could be the opposite and the person
could be charged with a heavier crime...

467
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,268
That's because the defendant
Ioves his wife even now.

469
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,505
And because Masako deep down
inside still loves him too...

471
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,007
s proof of this

472
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,943
This is, the, match of Mimasu.

473
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,612
On the back side
Mimasu is written in romaiji.

475
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,815
What kind of proof are saying it is?!

476
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,086
A. If you read this fr
the opposite end in roma,

478
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,954
It reads Usami M...

479
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,825
In other words,
it's the name of their son Masaki...

481
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,827
and her name before she got divorced

482
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,363
back in the days,
when they were a happy family...

484
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:30,969
And the defendant after seeing that match,
found out how she really felt

486
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,305
so he went out of his way
to take the blame for the murder

488
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,108
in order to save his wife

489
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,843
That's a lie!

490
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,310
I'm the one who killed that guy!!

491
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:43,081
It's a lie that my wife did it!!
I killed him with my very hands...

493
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,983
hkilled Hirasawa with these hands!!

494
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,118
Stop it already, dear.

495
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,320
It's all right,

496
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,724
I understand very well how you feel now.

497
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,995
I'm so sorry that I testified the way I did...

498
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,331
I didn't know anything at all about the key.

499
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,668
Just as Mr. ouri has pointed out,

500
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,670
I'm the one who killed Hirasawa!

501
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,272
Asako...

502
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,545
e... ..had forgotten who I was...

503
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,883
Haven't we met somewhere before?

504
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:21,419
Huh, with you?

505
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,822
Nope, I don't think so.

506
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:28,226
Because I'd never forget
n attractive woman like you...

509
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,964
He messed up and broke our family up,

510
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,367
yet he doesn't even remember how I look.

511
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,236
I just couldn't forgive him...

512
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,505
Masako...

513
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,839
Kugh...

514
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:47,312
A couple mutually trying to protect
each other at first glance looks beautiful...

516
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:50,647
However, a crime is a crime...

517
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,985
If you really love your wife,

518
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,521
you should help her get back on her feet

519
00:20:56,522 --> 00:21:00,091
after she makes amends for what she did.

520
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,328
Don't you think
that's what real love is all about...

566
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,118
I was completely beaten:today.

567
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,320
I lost completely.

568
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,190
Besides, to have my case turned around
Iike that not by the defense attorney,

570
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,993
but the witness is a first time
experience for me.

572
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:45,063
I guess, same here.

573
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,999
I'll see'you in the courtroom again
with the next case.

575
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,968
Take it easy on me then, will you...

576
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,202
Same here.

577
00:22:54,907 --> 00:23:00,278
I need you to keep up your successive
victory record: yet Ms. Kisaki...

579
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,212
Huh?

580
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:06,017
It's my mission to throw dirt on her...

581
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,887
Dear, thank you for everything today.

582
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,756
I guess I'll thank you for now.

583
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:12,223
Huh?

584
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:16,427
And, about after this,

585
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:22,700
if you have some time
why don't we go to a restaurant for a meal?

587
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,503
Then, we can take our time and talk . .?!

588
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:26,971
Ms...

589
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,041
If it's okay with you,

590
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,776
would you let me take you out
to eat or something

592
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,246
D,Dad...

593
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,182
He seems to be very busy right now,

594
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,451
so I guess we can go to dinner
some other time!!

596
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,053
Let's go, Ms. Kuriyama.

597
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:43,254
Y,Yes...

598
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,390
Ugh, mother, wait!

599
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,392
Mother!

600
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,995
Really!! Dad!!!

601
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,730
Well, well,

602
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,334
it's not going to work out the way
an wants it to for a while...

604
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,738
What?!

605
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,874
Mr. Nigaki is nowhere in sight?!

606
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:07,111
Anyway, let's go search for him
before the visibility becomes zero.

608
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,380
Conan, wait for us in the lodge.
