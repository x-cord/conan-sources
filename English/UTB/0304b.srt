Shiratori!

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,700
It's dangerous,
get out of here, quickly.

11
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,304
Are you all right ¥Shiratori?

12
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,610
Yeah. I couldn't run as you did.

13
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:29,115
Takagi! Block off this
road and get an ambulance.

15
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:30,182
I will.

16
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,418
But: he can speak

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,787
that means he's okay...

18
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,522
Not quite...

19
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:42,061
Bleeding at the side of his head. with
paralysis in the left limbs-this could be.

21
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:44,763
Accute subdural hemorrhage...

22
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,935
We'd better take him ASAP to
the hospital. He's in critical condition.

24
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,170
Oh, no...

25
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,608
Anyway, if the gas catches fire,
it might cause secondary explosion!

27
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,476
Let's m ve Inspector Shiratori

00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,386
This is terrible, really terrible.

32
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,289
Yeah, who on earth
would do such a thing...

00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:15,861

sure that he's after a police officer.

What!

37
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,332
He gave false lead saying that
he set up a bomb in the restaurant,.

39
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,734
and lured the police into the restaurant.

40

In order to exit, thensiteexplodes.

50
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,961
The question is why did Inspector
Shiratori try to get out immediately

52
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,933
What's that?

53
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,603
I wanted to show this
