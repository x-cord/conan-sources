00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,453
With a strong heart and
power of deduction,

3
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,221
step into the essence with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,190
Ttoday the case as well as
the lies will be figured out...

6
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,259
the identity of the beautiful client
sure is a surprise

8
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,160
He sees through the one and only'truth.

9
00:00:28,295 --> 00:00:30,029
A child in appearance
with the IQ of an adult,

11
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,797
no case is left unsolved
ith Detective Conan

13
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,148
A beautiful client appears
at the detective office.

15
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,717
Her name is Shizuka Ikenaml.

16
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,586
She comes to ask Pops to look for

17
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,189
her classmate
from her middle school days,

19
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,323
who belonged to the same Kendo club

20
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,959
and whose name is Shiro Shibata.

24
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,363
He was located immediately.

25
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,399
He seemed to be working
as a PE. teacher in Shizuoka.

27
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,738
We set off immediately to his place,
but...

29
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,173
what awaited us there was...

30
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,677
the dead body of Mr. Shiro Shibata,
who had been killed.

32
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:30,316
He had the picture of Shizuka Ikenaml
gripped firmly in his hands.

34
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,687
What bothers me is
why the client is so full of lies...

36
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,555
Almost everything that she says is
a lie...

38
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,293
What on earth is she hiding...'?

Officer Yokomizo!!

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,876
We've found a blood
smeared wooden kendo sword

44
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,643
that seems to be the murder weapon

45
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,677
Really?!

46
00:02:58,779 --> 00:02:59,644
Yes, sir!

47
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:04,083
It was found by the emergency stairs
right beside the front door!

49
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,386
Mrs. Shibata, did you have
a wooden sword in the house?

51
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:08,354
Oh, yes...on top of that shoe cabinet...

52
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,690
Oh, yes...on top of that shoe cabinet...

00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,696
It's not there right now, is it?

71
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:21,333
By the way,
how many phones do you have?

73
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,637
Just two. One in the living room and
one in the bedroom.

75
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,673
We did have one
by the front door before too, though...

77
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:28,908
I see.--

78
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,709
I got it.

79
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,178
Now I know that

80
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,480
the killer is you, Ms. IkenamnH

00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,782

Shizuka Ikenami (42)

86
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:39,885
Hey, hey, Officer Yokomizo.

87
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,989
You made sure that he had the picture
by calling him beforehan

89
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,094
And ih order to get it back,
you had already come here this morning.

91
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:52,865
However, you got into an argument with
him over the picture at the front door,

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,967
and on impulse struck him
with the wooden sword

95
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,036
that was on top of the shoe cabinet...

96
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,773
Thinking that you had killed him,

97
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,675
you escaped from the emergency stairs...

98
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:07,546
But, Mr. Shibata was
still alive at that time

100
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:12,618
He desperately crawled across the floor
towards the living room phone to get help,

102
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,820
but his body did not move as he willed it.

103
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:20,292
He sees the book
with your picture between the pages...

105
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,530
He uses whatever strength
that is left within himself and

107
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,703
grabs the picture of the one
who killed him, then dies.

109
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,772
But, it's only a picture...

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,109
There must be some secret
nd the picture...!

112
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:41,213
That's why she came back here again
with you Mr. Moun!

114
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,215
To get the picture back...!

115
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:48,754
Please come with me to the station,
Ms. Ikenami, will you?

117
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,790
I refuse!

118
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,159
Huh?

119
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,629
Ifsyou want to interrogate me,

120
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:00,933
please do so after you get an
arrest warrant from the court, will you?

122
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:01,967
Well...

123
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,705
at this stage when you are lacking
in documents with credible evidence

125
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,674
on which the judge needs to
base his impression of me,

127
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,076
I don't even think it is possible for you

128
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,979
to compel him to issue you
a warrant for my arrest anyway...

130
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,116
Of course, it would be a different story
if Mrs. Shibata there,

132
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,254
intends to file charges against us
for trespassing on private property...

134
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,059
W, What the...

135
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,862
Who the hell is this lady anyway...

136
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,832
Wow, look at his left hand!

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,134
It's smeared all over with blood!

138
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,103
E must've touched
the wound on his head.

140
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,672
Strange, though...

141
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,475
there's no blood on
the bandage around his finger...

143
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,512
Come to think of it,
that lady's left hand was also...

145
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:50,549
Wait a sec...

146
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,917
If so, on his right hand...!

147
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,786
H...Hey!

148
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,326
I see, I get the picture now...

149
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,361
1Hey

150
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,196
That's a no, no!!

151
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,099
So, she's the killer after all...

152
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:11,670
She came here before we came here...!

153
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,241
To this blood smeared murder scene

154
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,911
But, Ms. Ikenaml...

155
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,379
the victim, Mr Shibata was found dead

156
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,750
with your picture grabbed firmly
in his hand, wasn't he?

158
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,219
I'll have to have you at least explain

159
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,653
what ybur relationship is
with Mr. Shibata,

161
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:33,725
as well a's why he happened to
have that picture in his possession.

163
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:37,196
I have explained everything
Mourikalready

165
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,233
Then, come with us to the station and
explain it to us too!

167
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,902
Then, let's do this...

168
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:49,540
I'll give Mr. Mouri power of
attorney over me.

170
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,109
Huh?

171
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,081
If he says I should go to the station
to be interrogated as a suspect,

173
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,549
I will.

174
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,185
Uh, well...

175
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,887
Well, Mr. Mourl?!

176
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,891
I,~;I'fthink you should at least 90 for
the interrogation...

178
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,229
BUt maybe it's not all that necessary...

179
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,597
Mr. Mourl!!

180
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,632
Uh, well...

181
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,767
Mr. Mourn?!

182
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,135
Mr. Mourl'?!

183
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:16,769
Hoh-hee...

184
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,477
M, Mr. Mourn?

185
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,146
Ms. Ikenaml,

186
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,747
under these circumstances,

188
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,084
no choice but to be interrogated.

189
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,986
R, Right?!

190
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,220
Only...

191
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,989
not as a suspect but,

192
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,461
as a witness to prove the truth of the case

193
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,030
that I am about to disclose now.

194
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,567
Are you saying that she is not the killer?

195
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,635
No...

196
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,870
If she were the killer,

197
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:57,743
and if she came here with us again to
get her picture back?

199
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:02,214
She would've walked into the house

200
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:05,718
saying that the door was not locked

201
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:08,053
the minute I rang the door bell and
no one answered...!

203
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,091
If she had come here beforehand and

204
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,160
struck Mr. Shibata to death,

205
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:19,598
she should've known that
the door wasn't locked!

207
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,869
The only chance she had to
get the picture back was'?

209
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,337
During the short time

210
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:30,109
between when the body was found to
when the police arrived.

212
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,010
Then, is it you,

213
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:35,647
Mr. Yoshikawa'? Since you seem
to have known that the door was open

215
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,615
Mr Yoshikawa? Since you seem
to have known that the door was open
Ta keso
A friend of Mr.

219
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,316
back then...
Ta keso
A friend of Mr.

222
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:37,516
Ta keso
A friend of Mr.

224
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,082
Hun K
Ta keso
A friend of Mr.

227
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,151
Besides,

228
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,021
you're the one who found
the dead body...!

230
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,159
I'll bet you came back to the scene
get rid of something

232
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,162
that you didn't want the police to see.

234
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,464
Rlflb'y...

236
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,467
Yoshikawa is not the killer either.

237
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:56,368
Huh...?

238
00:08:56,503 --> 00:09:00,239
If the late Mr. Shibata always left
the door open.

240
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,976
It wouldn't be hard to assume that
the door would've been open then too.

242
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,513
Besides, it would be
much too dangerous for Mr. Yoshikawa,

244
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,047
whose alibi around the estimated time of
the killing is not all that Clear,

246
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:13,419
to set foot again into
the scene of the crime...!

248
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,555
If there was something that
he wanted to come and get that badly,

250
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,923
he would've done so,

251
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,760
first thing...He wouldn't come and get it
almost half a day after the murder...!

253
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,364
He would've known that if he called,

254
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,935
there would be nobody here
except for the dead body.

256
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:36,808
Moreover, he went out of his way to
stop all of us who were ready to leave...!

258
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,577
If I were the killer,

259
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,814
I would see to it that
the visitors leave first,

261
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,349
then sneak into the house alone.

262
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,820
T,Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

265
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,991
the one who seemingly has
imate aliblv

268
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,500
T,Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

269
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:02,768
Yes-.

270
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,238
The one who seemingly
has a legitimate alibl...

273
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,409
Mrs. Kyoko Shibata!!

274
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,612
M, Mrs. Shibata-isfithe killer?!

275
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,782
M, Mrs. Shibata, don't tell me that you...

276
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,351
8, But Mr. Mourl...

277
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,988
Mrs. Shibata prepared breakfast and 4

278
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,023
Ieft at 05:00 in the morning, you know?

279
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:31,029
Why was the paper that was delivered
at 06:00 found on the table, then?

281
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:37,436
Moreover, she got back here after 7 pm
when a friend of hers dropped her off.

283
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,473
That's just about when you
arrived here, Mr. Mourl...

285
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,210
Who came back after you arrived here,

286
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,779
have moved the morning paper
onto the table?

288
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,618
It's true that I got here after 7 o'clock

289
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,787
This is indeed a very convenient way of
expressing the time, don't you think?

291
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,625
Whether it's 7:05 or 7:10,

292
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,460
we can say after 7:00 pm...

293
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:02,194
Huh?

294
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:08,767
Inf other words, Mrs. Shibata could've
got back-r'jfisit b'efere we got here!

296
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,069
W Wait a minute...!

297
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,873
N, are you saying that
the breakfast on the table is...

299
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,577
It's probably what she prepared for him

300
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,046
when he got home
at three in the morning!

302
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,384
D to doWas
put the morning papers beside it

304
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,654
to make it look like breakfast

305
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,589
But, what about that video?

306
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,493
The program that was aired at 08:00
was being recorded

308
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,529
All that needs to'b'é'done is...

309
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:43,135
to set the pre-set record time to
Iong and you've got it.

311
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,805
So, this is what Mrs. Shibata did...

312
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,310
First, she urged her husband
who came back at 03:00 in the morning

314
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,681
to take a bath or something,
in order to kill time

316
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,082
At just before 05:00,
she tells him that it is his night snack and

318
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,485
makes him eat the food on the table. .!

319
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,656
Then, she calls her husband
while he is eating to the corridor,

321
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,460
and strikes him to death from
behind with the wooden sword...!

323
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,597
She then set the video up,

324
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,933
Iocks the front door and leaves the house

325
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,803
She gets into her friend's car
that is waiting for her

327
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,973
at the main entrance
of the condo at 05:00.

329
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,177
She returns after 7:00 pm

330
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,814
takes the newspaper out
of the door post box,

332
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,551
and puts it on the dining table.
Then she calls the police.

334
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,022
She has a perfect alibl.

335
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,856
I see...

336
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,192
That's way she can make it

337
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,928
Iook like somebody
who had visited had killed her husband

339
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:48,900
while he was havmg breakfast
at around 08:00 in the morning...

341
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,470
But, when Mrs Shibata returned,

342
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,872
something that
she didn't expect had happened...

344
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,409
Her husband who was supposed to
have been lying in the corridor,

346
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,244
in order to call for help,

347
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:03,248
crawled all the way over
to the living room!

350
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:04,983
IUD...

351
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:08,954
and as she was watching
what had happened,

353
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,223
she gets a phone call.

354
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,292
Don't tell me that it was from me?

355
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,130
Yes, your call saying,
I=Fm going to pickayou'Up soon.

357
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,635
Mrs Shibata who heard the message
on the answer phone got an idea .!

359
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,939
Instead of reporting directly to the police

360
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,709
with the morning paper and food
on the table,

362
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,312
she thought it better to
make somebody else discover the body

364
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:37,082
and return home later.

365
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,918
That way, it would make her
much less suspicious...

367
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,821
Then, where was Mrs. Shibata till then?

368
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:47,659
She was probably hiding
behind the door of the, emergency stairs

370
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,263
beside the front door
until Mr. Yoshikawa came...

372
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:57,169
Although we seemed to have arrived
here earlier than he did...

374
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:01,005
Mr. Detective,
then what is that picture all about?

376
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,643
Why did Mr. Shibata have her picture
gripped in his hand?

378
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:08,279
That's a camouflage that
Mrs. Shibata thought-Up to

380
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,283
on the spur of the moment
to divert everyone's- attention...

382
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,051
Camouflage?

383
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,755
First, please look at
her husband's left-héind!

385
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,925
The'p'alm of his hand is smeared with
blood and yet,

387
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,928
there is no bloodVon the bandage
that is wrapped around his ring finger...

389
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:23,895
Huh?!

390
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,466
Y,You're right!

391
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,968
Then, look at his right hand...

394
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,708
Don't tell me that this is a trace of...

396
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,243
IUD...

397
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,213
when Mrs. Shibata came to
the living room,

399
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,548
Mr. Shibata was already
holding it in his hand!

401
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,552
The marriage ring that is a symbol of
their being husband and wife!

403
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:53,158
Mrs. Shibata who realized that that
her husband, as not wearing

405
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,428
his marriage ring that
he always wears on his left ring finger,

407
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,766
knew right away that
he was grabbing it in his right hand,

409
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,202
and somehow opened his fist that had
already closed tight

411
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:04,803
and removed the ring.

412
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,006
But, if she had left things as they were,

413
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:11,076
his right hand would look
awfully unnatural and stand out...

415
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,946
Therefore, she made him hold
the picture of Ms. Ikenaml

417
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,550
that was between the pages of the book.

418
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,091
I see, so'it could've been
anything if it didn't point at her!

420
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,459
Yes...

421
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,631
she then tried to put theringrb'a'ck
on the ring finger of hisaleft fiahd,

423
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,901
but she couldn't put it back on
because his fingers wereb'ent!

425
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,870
That's why she wrapped a bandage
around his finger!

427
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,439
All to hide
the traces of his marriage ring!

429
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,743
She probably also wrapped
his little finger

431
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,345
so that it wouldn't stand out as much...

432
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,714
Officer Yokomizo, I found it!

433
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,917
The trace of a marriage ring
under the bandage

435
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,419
Okay, take a picture of it right aWay,
will you?

437
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,321
Now, for the ring!

438
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,523
Search every nook and cranny
in this house...

440
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,992
No, that won't be necessary.

441
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:06,565
I'm sure Mrs. Shibata
still has it on her...

443
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,599
Huh?

444
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,036
I don't think she would hide a ring that
would have a Iuminol reaction

446
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,838
even if the blood were to be wiped off,

447
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,708
somewhere inside the house
fore the police arrived...

449
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,278
Of course she wouldn't hide it
by the emergency stairs either!

451
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:25,250
E safest thing to do would be
to get rid of it after the police leave...

453
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,821
at's why I'm sure
she still has it with her!!

455
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,258
The dying message that
her husband left behind to indicate that

457
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,561
he was killed by her!!

458
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,272
Fuh...

459
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,808
I guess evil never wins after all...

460
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,546
The evil things that my husband and
Mr. Yoshikawa had been doing

462
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,881
didn't come out in the open and yet...

463
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,016
Don't you think it's unfair?

464
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:58,917
Huh?

465
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,785
There were gambling playing mahjong!

466
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:04,556
My husband was playing mahjong and
gambling everyday

468
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,458
Moreover, they were gambling
exorbitant amounts

470
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,193
that would make your eyes pop out!

471
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,861
Thanks to them,

472
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,598
I had to sell off the computer, jewelry,
car, laser disc player and speaker

474
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,166
one after the other...

475
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,403
All because of that detestable game

476
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:24,075
My husband told me that the next thing
he was selling was my golf clubs...

478
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,545
And, after that he would even
sell off the sword that

480
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,814
my father gave him as a wedding gift...

481
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,751
et's go to the station
so we can hear you out...

483
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,185
Y. Yes...

484
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,256
right after I change clothes.

485
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,828
A sword...?!

486
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:45,897
Oh no!

487
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,132
D, Don't tell me?!

488
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:50,602
Agh!

489
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,038
S,Stay away

490
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:54,639
Agh!

491
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,079
M, Mrs. Shibata, please calm down!!

492
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:05,784
I, I'm finished, because I've...
killed somebody.

494
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:06,918
Mrs. S, Shibata!!

495
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,253
Will you move out of the way?

496
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:08,887
Huh?

498
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:14,225
Huh'e'?!

499
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,026
Huh?!

501
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,433
W, What's with you, stay away from me!

502
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,437
Stay away I said

503
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,745
Are you going to kill again?

504
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,445
Huh?

505
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,618
I'm asking if you're still going to kill after
having already killed your husband

507
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,124
I was just going to kill myself.

508
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:46,825
You idiot!!

510
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,094
There is no such thing as mine or yours
when it comes to life!

512
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,029
It's something very important
that you're not

514
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:54,499
Those who kill, are all killers and fools

515
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,803
It doesnit make any difference
if it's your own life!!

517
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:00,505
Don't you ever forget that!

518
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,544
Shall we get goingnthen, officer?

519
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,747
Oh, yes...

520
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,684
8, Before that, Ms. Ikenaml!

521
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,820
Will you please tell me?

522
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,758
The reason why you lied four times...

523
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,795
I can't make out why you, with weak
bronchial tubes, like knitting,

525
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,564
when there is yarn flying
all over the place...

527
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,402
Knowing what kind of fish it is,
Just by looking at slices of it,

529
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,670
goes to show that you like cooking...

530
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,839
Moreover, you are married

531
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,144
but ou're hidin the trace of the
wedding ring that is on your ring finger!!

533
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,679
And, the name Reiko...

534
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:46,718
Nobody in that ninja novel has-that name!

535
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,256
And, what is the meaning behind
the reason you mumbled

537
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,858
Reiko in the coffee shop?

538
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,328
Not Reiko, but Rei-(cold) ooh-(coffee).

539
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:02,033
She was probably-"gang to order some
cold coffee, bat decided otherwise...

541
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,903
Because calling iced coffee, rei-co

542
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:08,039
would give away the fact that
he is from Osaka...

544
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,375
In this day and age, though,

545
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,078
the only people who would talk like that
are mom or middle aged women...

547
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,214
Right, old lady?

548
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,950
H, Hem and Kazuha!

549
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,221
Hey, old lady!

550
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,656
You finished what you had to do, right?

551
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,924
So go on back to Osaka!

552
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,625
Hmm, hey you!

553
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,096
Hey, stop calling her old lady, how rude!

554
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,298
It doesn't matter what I call'her...

555
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:34,999
because she's my mother!

556
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,003
Whaaaat'?!

557
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,106
What?!

558
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,776
8, She can't be,
because she's not dark skinned

560
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:47,512
You idiot!

561
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,115
I got my dark skin from grandpa

562
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:52,083
Oh my God...

605
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,471
What? You came to

606
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,906
check me out?

607
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,041
Yes, that's right...

608
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:28,780
Every time Heiji is with you,
he seems to get serious wounds, right?

610
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:29,781
I thought that

611
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:32,283
maybe you were making him go through
a rigorous training-bf some sort,

613
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,919
saying that he needed it
in order to become a detective.

615
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:39,457
Even when he came to Osaka,

616
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,926
you didn't drop by
but went st'raight back to Tokyo...

618
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:47,498
So, I was worried that you may be
a ruthless and callous guy...

620
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,566
Speak for yourself ma.

621
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,435
You didn't even come to
the hospital back then, but you waited

623
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,171
in front of the balloon fish restaurant.

624
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,707
I couldn't let things go by
without checking it out any longer,

626
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,976
and that's why I decided to come...

627
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,511
However, after seeingnyouz
I really got the picture.

629
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,879
That you, Mr. Mouri, you are

630
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,184
a sharp, keen and nice man that
Heiji couldn't help but respect

632
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:08,019
W, Well, thank you...

633
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,488
I arrangedV'thin'g's b'éforehand
With Shiro by'phone,

635
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:11,856
and made like I was looking for him.

636
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,725
You saw through my es and

637
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,261
the murder of Shiro that
happened'c'oincidentally too.

640
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:19,764
You solved it all in no timefat all!!

641
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,733
I'm really sad about
what happened -to Shiro,

643
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:26,738
but I got back the picture that
I had been Iookihg for...

645
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,706
VVhatalady.

646
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:30,408
I thought you said
you didn't want the picture back

648
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,709
because it's a picture of an under
classman beating you, and it vexed you,

650
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,112
so you didn't want it back.

651
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:38,449
Now, I can rest at ease leaving
Heiji and Kézuhauin ydur ha'n'dsl!

653
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,983
Huh? Leave them in my hands...?

659
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:47,725
Huh?

660
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:52,497
Huh? YoCumearuthat phone call was;for.real'?

661
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,302
The message went...

662
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,306
The mermaid will kill me... help.

663
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,541
A, A mermaid...

664
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,776
Will kill somebody...?!

665
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:07,412
That's. . .?!

666
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,485
This crime can be carried out by anyone,
be it a man or a woman.

668
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,623
And, the killer is still somewhere nearby

669
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:19,057
($1415?)
