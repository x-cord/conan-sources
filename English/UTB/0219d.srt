1
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:20,920
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,622
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,657
Finally, the truth of the hat comes out.

5
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,158
The reluctance of Mr. Megure
IS unimaginable.

7
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,194
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,029
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,198
no case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan.

12
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:59,385
THE DITECTIVES COME TOGETHER!
KUDO VS. THIEF KID

14
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:04,991
What?!

16
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,292
Senma died?!

18
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,197
It was rigged so that when you touch
the lights of the car, it would explode.

20
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,199
Oh, no...

21
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,701
Waiting here is just going to get us killed.

22
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:18,170
Let's split up and go check

23
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,706
If there is really someone else
in this house!

25
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:25,244
Then maybe we three women
should form a group.

27
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,713
That way we can even
go to the restroom together.

29
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:28,781
Hey,

30
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,284
By the way, where did that brown haired,
fair skinned young man gov

32
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,519
Beats me...

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,888
maybe he's feeding the eagle
that he brought along with him?

35
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,942
What a fancy thing to find here.

36
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:03,516
There-is a brand new scratch
on the piano cord.

38
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,519
That was probably made
by the claws of the eagle.

40
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:10,456
It goes to show that the young man
also came and searched this room.

42
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,062
There is something stuck
between the keys of the piano!

44
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,537
Is this the secret code that indicates
the location of the treasure

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,039
that he was talking about?!

47
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,578
But why is it mimeographed
on rice paper?

49
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,749
Somebody probably printed
a whole lot of this

51
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,086
when no such things
as copy machines existed yet

53
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,788
and, for some reason,
distributed it to many people.

55
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:44,790
In other words,

56
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,294
the thing he was referring to,
the story about the tragedy

58
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,963
that occurred here 40 years ago
as well as the secret code

60
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,799
indicating the hidden treasure, the
story created after the tragedy...

62
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,302
it's all a bunch of baloney.

63
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,009
This piano is leaking.

64
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,979
Come to think of it, yes, it is.

65
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,717
This is that young lady's luminol fluid.

66
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,420
Which means that
she s been in this room too.

68
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,088
Hey flimsy mustache, turn off the light!

69
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:18,724
Quick!

70
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,617
Where is Aki, the maid?

71
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,454
She said she'd be waiting in the corridor
outside the restroom,

73
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,455
but why don't you go check?

74
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:50,956
Oh, okay.

75
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:54,927
AKI?

76
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,930
Aa Am?!

77
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,479
There are letters written in blood
on the piano.

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,117
Something did happen here
40 years ago after all.

81
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,119
An ace...

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Don't tell me that?!

83
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,103
Just as "thought.
So, it was you, after all.

85
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,575
The killer would never risk danger,

86
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:45,477
such as to ride a car
that has been rigged with a bomb.

88
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:49,515
In other words, the possible killers are

89
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,084
those who stayed behind...You and me...

90
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,386
Ran and the maid, Akl.

91
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:59,258
Oh, my, sonny,
that stuff can be dangerous.

93
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,962
It was under the pillow in my room.

94
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,598
Although you!probably put it there

95
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,665
so that you'; could set me up
as the killer later.

97
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,436
Oh, what a coincidence...

99
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,472
I was thinking exactly the same thing.

101
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,941
I made the exact same deduction as you.

102
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:21,914
G, Gun fire?!

103
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:22,548
G, Gun fire?!

104
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,617
It came from the center tower!

105
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,329
No good...

106
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,298
The bullet's one ri ht throu h his chest.

107
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:42,868
The stairs?!

108
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,337
Somebody's using the stairs!

109
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,116
A computer...

110
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:02,421
He said to come here after
we find where the treasure is.

112
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:06,725
Ms.*S, Sota?!

113
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,027
Take a look!

114
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,098
Fl turn the knob that is on the inside,
a needle is set up to come out.

116
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,737
When the one
who finds the treasure inputs

118
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,073
the location of the treasure
into the computer

120
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,242
and is ready to leave the room,
that person is poisoned to death.

122
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:26,011
But, where on earth is the killer?!

123
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,648
Don't you play dumb with me!

124
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,089
This woman couldn't have been done in
by a trap she set up herself,

126
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,060
and the maid-and your daughter
are snoozing away in the toilet.

128
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,363
If that gunshot was a fake,

129
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,334
the only two people who. can
commit murder are you and me.

131
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,502
I know It's not me, so it means...

132
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,875
that you're the one, right?

133
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,655
Punish the suspicious.

134
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,558
No offense,

135
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,729
Mr. Sleeping Kogoro...

136
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,743
This can't be happening!

137
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,326
Even gathering the detectives did not
result in a solution after all.

139
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,630

All the detectives that I invited

There is no such thing as a 7th detective!

Then, who can it be?! Who on earth...

257
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:43,782
It is difficult to think that
the person who set the bomb to the car

259
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,920
would ride!the 'car unless
it was a suicidal plan...

261
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,588
However, there are exceptions.

262
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:54,159
That is, in the case
you want to make it look like you

264
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,827
yourself died in the explosion...

265
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,231

Detective Senma

267
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,174
Yes...before the explosion you...

268
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,312
snuck out of the car,hid in the bushes,
and confirmed the car falling over.

270
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:18,383
After sneaking back here,
you were watching all of us

272
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,621
from a room somewhere in here
through all the hidden cameras...

274
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,692
Don't be ridiculous...
I got out of the car in the nick of time after

276
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:31,396
I realized the car was going to explode
I just got back here

278
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:35,868
Besides, didn't we decide at that time
who was going to ride the car

280
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,769
even before the coins were tossed...

281
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,039
Not really...it was already decided
that you were going to ride the car

283
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,474
even before the coins were tossed...

284
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,877
You set the coin with the head facing up
on the back of your hand

286
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,045
even before you tossed the coin...

287
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,348
You covered your right hand
over your left hand

289
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:52,217
from above the coin that
you were holding, in order to hide it

291
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,087
and pretended to
catch the coin that you flicked.

293
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,388
You dropped that coin on the ground, then

294
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,856
all you had to do was show the first coin
you put on the back of your hand

296
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:01,126
No matter how many times
you repeat it, you get heads!

298
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,097
Since you had a 10 yen coin on you

299
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:07,566
when checking the tea that
Mr Ogami was drinking,

301
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,601
you would've been able to carry this out,
wouldn't you?

303
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,137
The God Forsaken Child!

304
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:16,942
Are you saying that
the guest who carried out the supper

306
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,377
and killed Mr. Ogami Is me?

307
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,479
Then, tell me.

308
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,183
How did I make only Mr. Ogami take
the cyanide in this dining room,

310
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:29,855
and just how
was I able to predict the time...

312
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,225
There was no poison in his tea,

313
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:37,396
Mr. Mouri was sitting in between
Mr. Ogami and me...

315
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:41,967
Besides, didn't we do rock, paper,
scissors to decide where to sit?

317
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,169
The seating has nothing to do-with it...

318
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:50,142
Because you had swabbed everybody's
cup with,cyanide beforehand anyway...

320
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,479
You swabbed the cyanidefin the upper
part where the handle joins the cup...

322
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,050
That is the place where
Mr. Ogami's rightthumb tip touches

324
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,719
when he holds his teacup

325
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,023
It is also very close to his nails that
he unconsciously bites when he thinks

327
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,025
He started biting his nails right

328
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,394
after the tape recording of
your altered voice

330
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,164
announced the code of the
hiding place of the treasure

332
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,332
If you gave instructions to the maid

333
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,235
to serve the tea a little before
the tape was to be played...

335
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:21,173
Mr. Ogami, after hearing about the code,
would start thinking

337
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,810
and you would be able to kill him
alone just as scheduled .

339
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,180
But, back then, I remember that
everyone wiped their dishes

341
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,949
before using them, just to be safe...

342
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,484
True...

343
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:37,356
It was too careless for a renown
detective, such as Mr. Ogami

345
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:42,327
But, if he was your partner in planning
the supper then

347
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,529
Being so sure that nothing could ever
happen to him,

349
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,897
it's not hard to understand why he
skipped the safety precautions

351
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,699
that everyone else took

352
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:52,337
From the time I heard that
Aki had arrived early in the morning,

354
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,340
the Benz was already parked...

355
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,142
I was suspicious of you...

356
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,812
In order for anyone to abandon a Benz
in such an remote mountain area

358
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:04,049
there had to be someone to ride the Benz

359
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,451
as well as somebody else
to come pick you up.

361
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,887
You would need an accomplice

362
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,455
While I'm at it,

363
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,225
the reason why you went out of your way
to. wait for Mr. Mouri

365
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,060
and make him give you a lift was

366
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:17,529
Ieave an impression on him
that you don't like cigarettes

368
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,632
in order for it to work out so that only
Mr. Ogami died in the dining room...

370
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,969
If Mr. Ogami were to put a cigarette
in his mouth after grabbing a cyanide

372
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,803
coated cigarette with his fingertips

373
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,306
He would immediately
go to the world beyond

375
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,143
The reason why you chose Aki
to be your maid is because

377
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,678
you found out that she has a
habit of biting her fingernails

379
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,947
by watching her through the hidden
camera during the interview

381
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,849
and you figured that you could kill her
using the same method

383
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,484
that you used to kill
Mr. Ogami at any time.

385
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,822
You killed Mr Ogami,
who was your accomplice, and

387
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,391
made yourself look as if you'd been killed
by someone else,

389
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,462
psychologically cornered
all the detectives that you've invited here

391
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,230
into deciphering the code

392
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:56,268
and once you found the treasure you
were going to massacre everyone here.

394
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,239
Just like Renya Karasumaru
did 40 years ago!!

396
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,609
I found the name + osuke Senma
at the end of the words

398
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,211
written in blood on the piano

399
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,880
That was probably...

400
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,316
That's my father's name

401
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:18,356
My father who was an archaeologist was
invited to this Twilight Inn 40 years ago

403
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,159
The story was that a millionaire
who was over 100 years of age

405
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,095
inherited this estate from his mother

406
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,297
found out that there was hidden
treasure in the building.

408
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,234
He wanted someone to find the treasure

409
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,771
for him before his time to lie...

410
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,941
It seemed to be an easy job that paid well

411
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:39,144
and cash was sent to us
everyday with a letter

413
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,314
so my mother and I were delighted.

414
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,450
But, 6 months later, the letters and
cash suddenly stopped coming.

416
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,552
My father who did not tell us
where he was going,

418
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,787
could not be contacted
ever since that time.

420
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,490
We found out the truth

421
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:57,395
only after we raised the last letter we got
from my father up to the light...

423
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,969
It was a letter that my father had written
by opening holes using a needle.

425
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,340
The letter was about a code that indicated
the location of the hidden treasure

427
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:10,475
It said that there were many other
scientists besides my father

429
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,910
who had been summoned to the place

430
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,312
and that Karasumaru,
who was almost at the end of his time,

432
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,115
became impatient and started killing
the scientists within the building

434
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,151
as an example to the others
of what would happen

436
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:22,621
if they didn't hurry up and find the treasure...

437
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,390
My father had also written that
even if the treasure were to be found

439
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,492
he would not be able to make it out alive.

440
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,462
Did you tell the police about this?

441
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:35,066
No, I only found out about the letter written
with a needle 20 years later...

443
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,436
And, besides, Renya had already
passed away

445
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,706
and the building was handed over
to someone else...

447
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:47,712
But, it all, started when I happened
tostalk about this to Ogami 2 years ago...

449
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:54,352
He went all out and found this place and
started like mad to look for the treasure.

451
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:58,323
However, he couldn't decipher the code .

452
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,927
He bought this place and had
a large debt because of it.

454
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,895
So, unable to reverse what
had already been done,

456
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,330
he said the following.

457
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,699
Let's gather all the
well-known detectives here

459
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,834
and have them decipher the code!

460
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:12,003
The bait to get all the detectives to come,
is the Thief Kid!

462
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,105
We'll set him up as the host,
and set up a game

464
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,474
which everyone would have
to stake their lives on!

466
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,811
By making it look as though both
you and me have been killed

468
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,079
part way through the game!

469
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,685
Right! Maybe we should
actually kill the maid?

471
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,120
Once they find out that
they really have to be risking their lives

473
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,289
they have no choice but to get serious!

474
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,227
No problem, we'll just put
all the blame on the Thief Kid!"

476
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:38,496
Which means the one
who chose that maid was.

478
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,131
Mr. Ogami...

479
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,568
He was delighted saying that he found
a maid with a habit just like his

481
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,503
that he could kill,
just as he would be killed

483
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,642
but I guess he never thought that
he'd be killed in the same way.

485
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:54,212
Yes he bit his nails at that time

486
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,816
because I had recorded
something he had not expected to hear.

488
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:01,920
Because he was thinking of killing
the maid after the dinner

490
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,190
But, why did you kill Mr. Ogam?

491
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,860
Because I realized that he had found
the location of the hidden treasure

493
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,130
and was planning to kill everyone
including me

495
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,633
By making it look like we all killed
each other using the guns

497
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:17,335
that he had set up in all of our rooms...

498
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:19,704
I had no other choice but to carry things
out the way I did, f I were to stop Ogami

500
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,239
who was obsessed like Karasumaru,

501
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,912
as well as let the detectives continue
to decipher the code.

503
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,948
The result ended up the same as
40 years ago...

505
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,683
The code could not be deciphered

506
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,085
and the tragedy was repeated

507
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,989
I think your father did decipher
the code, don't you?

509
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,495
Don't you think it's strange that there
is only one clock in this large building

511
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,664
the one in the dining room

512
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,500
the sentence at the top of the code

513
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,301
Iookéd- up at the sky ."

514
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,302
Il0okéd- up at the sky...

515
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,306
means when the long hand and
the short hand of the clock

517
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,740
point to the same direction
at the top, 00:00!

519
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,377
So, let's do that by making
the hands of the clock point at 00:00

521
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:04,649
And the key to solving the rest of the code
Is what your father had left behind

523
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,684
by writing in blood the final ace!

524
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,819
This refers to playing cards in English!

525
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:11,823
The King, Queen and Jack in the code

526
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,627
are the King, Queen and Jack
of the playing cards!

528
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:21,132
The treasure is diamond the chalice
is heart and the dagger is spade

530
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,203
In other words, the treasure and the King
the king of diamonds!

532
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,406
The chalice and the Queen
the queen of hearts!

534
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,476
The dagger and the wainnior
the jack of spades!

536
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,445
First you bring the hands
of the clock to 00:00...

538
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,982
then you move the hands of the clock
In accordance to the direction

540
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,416
their faces are turned...

541
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,453
Left 13,

542
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,188
Left 12,

544
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,491
Right 11, then...

546
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:46,691
Right 11, then...

549
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,569
The polish has rubbed off

550
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,970
and gold is in view on the inside...

551
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,474
Moreover, this clock
IS heavier than it looks...

553
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:06,111
I see...the inside of this clock
IS pure gold

555
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:12,250
to think that my father had to die
for something like that

557
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,352
I guess that's life

558
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,256
So, you promised, Ms. Senma

559
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,925
Tell me the way out of this place!

560
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,928
There is no way out of here to begin with

561
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,698
I was planning to bury my bones here,
you see...

563
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,702
Although Mr. Ogami did believe me
when I told him

565
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:33,338
that I would tell him
the way after dinner...

567
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,106
Just as I thought

568
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,541
Granny Senma...

569
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,310
What're you going to do about
the only valuable I had on me?

571
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:44,949
Remember I told you that something
childish like this isn't worth it...

573
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,053
Complain to sonny over there
If you got any gripes

575
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,490
» He's the one who said that
she may tell us the way out

577
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:53,791
if a child asked to know...

578
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:58,329
You mean you all pretended to be dead
just so that I would tell you the way out?

580
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,767
Because you were even trying to kill
the ones who figured the code out

582
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,370
We figured that you wouldn't tell us

583
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,906
even if we cornered
you so long as we were alive

585
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,976
Besides, throu h the monitor
even ketchup looks like blood!

587
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:17,582
But, at least we did right in putting
Ran and Aki to sleep.

589
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,920
This act of bad taste would have been too
harsh on the hearts of young women...

591
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,357
S,Since when did you know
I was the killer?

593
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,060
From the time,
that boy over there made I toss the coin

595
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,097
Back then

596
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,998
you stretched your hand all the way over
to take the coin

598
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,666
that was farthest away from you, right?

599
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,001
That's when it flashed through me

600
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,271
That you didn't want anyone else
to take the 10 yen coin.

602
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,375
If anyone with cyanide on their hands
touch the 10 yen coin,

604
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,977
redox reaction would occur,

605
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,912
and the whole trick would be disclosed!

606
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,449
That's why we all todk you to be the killer

607
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,618
and joined hands right off the bat!

608
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,187
I had seen through the trick

609
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,990
as soon as I saw
Mr. Ogami's nail of his right thumb...

611
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,425
Y ou little brat

612
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:05,096
So, the problem is...
how do we make it out of here...

614
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:06,998
My, what's that sound?

615
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,535
Oh, probably the police choppers
that I contacted...

617
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:11,603
You called them...?

618
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:16,307
Watson probably took the letter
that I had attached to his anklet

620
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,544
to nanny who was waiting in the car
below the cliff as soon as morning came!

622
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,945
I'm glad that I marked the car with an X

623
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:23,915
so that he'd be able to tell it
apart from other cars...

625
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,351
Why didn't you tell us sooner!

626
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,886
Talk about having to
put on such a crumby act...

628
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,322
No, that's not only
the sound of choppers...

630
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,791
I hear the sound of something
collapsing too...

632
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,827
D.,Don't tell me that...!

633
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,066
So, The Thief'Kidenever showed up, huh...

634
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,035
Did you want him to?

635
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,103
Oh, not really...

636
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,771
But, granny...

637
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:51,009
etd 44
The thing about psychologically cornering
us was Ogami's idea, wasn't it?

640
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,012
Why did you pretend to be dead
after you killed him?

642
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,283
I wanted the code that
my father left behind to be deciphered

644
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:02,253
no matter what the risk...
I wanted to find out in this life time...

646
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:06,291
I didn't think I could ever have
such renown detectives like you

648
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,127
gather together like this, ever again...

649
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:12,130
Maybe it was I,

650
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,666
who was obsessed by Renya Karasumaru

651
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,104
G,Granny?!

652
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,442
Shoots!

653
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,185
What?! T Thief Kid?

654
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,354
Hey granny!

655
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,290
I think you're already too old
to rush to your death, huh?

657
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,593
Don't be ridiculous!

658
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,161
I saved you...

659
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:43,928
What?

660
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,031
As an apology for using your name
to hold the supper...

662
00:22:48,032 --> 00:22:51,536
You would've never been able to escape
the grasp of those two boy

664
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,704
unless I did it this way...

665
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,140
Especially from the little one

666
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,243
that was aiming
a strange looking watch at you!

668
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,712
Oh - so ou knew...

670
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:01,879
Cigarette...

671
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,382
Kogoro Mouri is a heavy smoker...

672
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,819
You didn't smoke one cigarette
since arriving at the inn, right?

674
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,021
Who are they... anyway?

675
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:16,261
Lovers... that I most definitely
do not want to encounter, I guess?

677
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,329
How unfortunate.

678
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:19,329
You came...

679
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,766
Because you were after
Karasumaru's treasure, didn't you?

681
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,235
Yeah, at first maybe, but
I guess not, after all...

683
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:29,007
It won't fit into the cloth
I carry my stolen goods in...

685
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,515
- V,he walls have collapsed and
gold is showing from inside...

687
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:41,452
That clock was the switch
to bring the walls down...

689
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,721
Just a would be expected of
a residence owned by Karasumaru

691
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:45,656
It's worth at least zillions...

692
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:47,525
I see

693
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:51,462
Twilight means the time
when the sky glitters yellow at sunset...

695
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,232
It is indeed the Twilight Inn!
