1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,168
Suspense and deduction
closes the gap between

3
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,203
the love and hatred
between two people

5
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,838
The truth in this difficult case
becomes clear.

7
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,640
Kisaki and Kujo clash in court!

8
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,442
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,243
A child I appearance with the IQ.
Of an adult,

11
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,546
noycase is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:52,611
Hmm. the hot springs eh...
haven't been to one for so long...

15
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,515
and the autumn. colors must be
Iovely this time of year.

17
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:58,484
Yes, that's right!

18
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,388
"Think this open air bath would be great!

19
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,291
They say the water here's
good for the complexion!

21
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:10,429
AMom, you need to take off
from work once in a while and relax...

23
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,231
You<remright...

24
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,632
Midori

25
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,869
How's my schedule for next month?

26
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:21,974
The conclusion of the trial you're
working on now is slated for next week,

28
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,844
SOIT
so all you have to do is decide
whether you want to take this "duty case

32
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,111
so all you have to do is decide
whether you want to take this "duty case

35
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,446
Oh, that's right,
I'd forgotten about that

38
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,415
Can you get me the files on that

39
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,116
Okay

40
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,487
What's a duty case?

41
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:39,358
When a person is financially or
otherwise unable to hire a lawyer,

43
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,827
the court appoints one,

44
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,796
but if no one will take the case.

45
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,698
Then the bar association decides on
a 'duty public defender

47
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,333
and that lawyer takes the case

48
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,200
I see.

49
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,068
Here it is.

50
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:49,468
Here it is.

51
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,736
Thank, you

53
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,707
I've just taken a fast look but,

54
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,043
I don't understand why
no one would take this case.

56
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,347
I think this case is defendable...

57
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,016
I guess it's because of the prosecutor

58
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,650
Who would that be?

59
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:09,155
Ms. Kujo's the prosecutor on this case

61
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,529
I see, so it's the prosecution
office's Madonna...

Excuse me ma:am
What is the case about?

73
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:34,380
Cages:

75
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,083
It happened about a month ago in Haido

77
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:42,288
Office in a building was broken into and
1e company presicen was ound ceac.

79
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:46,025
From the fingerprints and evidence:.
Found in the room,

81
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:49,995
the defendant. a confirmed criminaltwith
a record became the suspect?

83
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:54,300
It sounds like an open and shut case...

84
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,302
Yes it does...

85
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,805
the defendant has confessed that
he broke in thinking the office was empty

87
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:04,043
(-71)
but when the victim found him and
they struggled.he hit him...

91
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,446
The problem is the charge
on the indictment

93
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,981
What's the charge?

94
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:12,618
He's being indicted for burglary/murder

95
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,819
Murder!?

96
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,289
But-this case soundssmore like
accidental death, doesn't it?

98
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,557
Yes...

99
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:24,563
I don't think Prosecutor Kujo would make
a mistake as big as this...

101
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,232
Midon,

102
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,501
I have the prosecutor's
report and. the deposition

104
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,503
but the. crime scene
investigation report isn't here,

106
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,104
could you have them send it up?

107
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,740
And I'll needfthe coroner's report too

108
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,674
Okay

109
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,309
Mom...

110
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,543

00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,378
Sorry Ran, as you can see,

112
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,915
I won't be able to go to the hot springs
with you, maybe another time

114
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,415

119
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,356
Let me ask you one more time,

120
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,158
on the night of the crime,

121
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,358
you entered the Otsu Realty Office o
the second floor of the Nomoto Build

123
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,594
you entered the Otsu Realty Office o
the second floor of the Nomoto Build:
(66)

126
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,195
by breaking the window
(55)

128
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,530
by breaking the window

129
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,798
you searched the office and

130
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,668
then tried to open the safe
in the president's office,

132
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,705
the president, Mr. Otsu
unexpectedly returned to the office

134
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,807
he saw you

135
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,943
and you two fought.

136
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:17,016
You then hit the victim on the head

138
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,689
Causing his death...
(DIS that correct?

140
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,424
Yeah

141
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,860
What happened to the money
that was in the safe?

143
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,595
But according to
the employees' statements,

145
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:33,599
they had just closed a deal and
there was 12 million yen in the safe

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,534
but it disappeared.

148
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:41,240
The prosecutor is saying that
you took the money after killing Mr.Otsu

150
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,109
It wasn't me! I'm telling you the truth!

151
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,813
It's true. no money was found
in your apartment but,

153
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,283
your fingerprints were on the safe so

154
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,653
I don't blame the prosecution
for suspecting you, don't you agree?

156
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,756
I didn't take~the money. CD
honest and about that creep...

158
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,558
That creep?

160
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,694
¢ Did you know the victim?

161
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,973
How many times did you hit
the victim on the head?

163
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,207
I don't remember...

164
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,076
Once, twice?

165
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,578
I don't remember.

166
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,582
He surprised me when he walked in,
my mind went blank...

168
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:28,954
The coroner's report says the victim
received three blows to the head...

170
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,491
The third blow was the one that killed him

172
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,028
Striking him-once, is understandable
at sine ttr'ére was a second

174
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,431
- - ll
and then a third,
could show intent to commit murder.

177
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,100
I honest don't rememberO

178
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,671
I-see. O Well, I'm on your side

179
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:50,509
so I want you to tell me the truth, even
if it's-detrimental to your case, alright?

181
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,213
I just want to make absolutely sure,

182
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:58,016
are you positive you-had
no intention of killing the victim

184
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,518
I'm positive

185
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,986
Alright.

186
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,356
We'll argue our case on that point
alone in court.

188
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,558

Iocated at 3-2-9, Haido Street.

220
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,340
While he was ransacking the president,
Mr. Toshiyuki Otsu's office,

222
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:25,511

he had te threaten the Victim

225
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,151
and forced the victim
to open the safe in the office.

227
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:37,189
The defendant then struck the victim
three times on the back of the head

229
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,991
causing the victim's death...

230
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:44,663
Defendant then escaped with the 12
million yen in cash which was in the safe

232
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:47,933
According/to penal code 240,
the prosecution asks

234
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:52,838
the defendant be sentenced-to
Iife imprisonment for burglary/murder.

236
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,041
Does the defendant have anything to say

237
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,110
regarding the charges
the prosecution has just stated?

239
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,912
Do you wish to deny the charges?

240
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,916
1. 1 just broke in to rob the place,

241
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,684
I didn't mean to kill anybody.

242
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,819
Your honor!

243
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,054
The defense may speak

244
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,890
The indictment states my client
is guilty of burglary/murder

246
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:16,328
but my client would like to plead not
guilty to the charge of murder.

250
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,231
So you're pleading not guilty to
burglary/murder, is that correct?

252
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,199
@€orrect.

253
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,004
The defense asks the defendant be charged
under penal code 205, accidental death

255
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,709
The defense is challenging
the prosecution's indictment,

257
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,177
do you have anything to say?

258
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,513
Yes. I do.

259
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,683
Could the defendant tell me why
he chose to break into the victim's office?

261
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:39,918
Well,

262
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,491
I was looking for some place to break into
and it just caught my eye, that's all...

264
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:48,594
Then you are claiming
it was mere coincidence

266
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,963
that you broke:into- the: victim:s office

267
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:55,933

269
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,436
Right.

270
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,272
I wonder what she's trying to get at...

271
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,474
Your honor.

272
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,811
The prosecution's line of
questioning is unclear!

274
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,312
Alright.then...

00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,671
Aren't you going to answer me?

290
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,440
Objection!

291
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,476
The prosecution is merely trying to
confuse the defendant

293
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:42,448
by mentioning a family member's name!

294
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,784
Does this daughter have anything
to do with the case? ,

296
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,353
Yes.

298
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:54,092
NorikolEndo runs a pub:in another building
the victim's company, manages

301
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,397
There are rumors that she and the victim,
were involved ina personal relationship

304
00:09:59,131 --> 00:09:59,364
.00'-

305
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,501
So you are claiming the defendant
had a premeditated motive

307
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,803
for breaking into the victim's office,
is that correct?

310
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,005
we have proof that the defendant held a

311
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:10,976
grudge against the
victim over his daughter

313
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:14,913
You're wrong!
I don't even know the creep!

315
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,549
Would you like to ask her'yourself thenr'?

316
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,688
She's in the gallery, we can have her
take the witness stand if you'd like

We are prepared to call Ms. Endo
to the witness stand if necessary,

334
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,856
7 So what the prosecutor said was true?

335
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:02,861
Yes, that man tricked me.

336
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:08,500
He told me he'd let me have
my own business, then he used,me...

338
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,836
When did you start communicating
with your father?

340
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,606
We met"2 years age
when mother died after an illness.

342
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:19,545
He'd drop in to my pub
every now and then to see me.

344
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,080
Seagoan!
And you told him; about Mr. Otsu?

347
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:22,514
And you told him about Mr. Otsu?

348
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,920
He said he'd get him to pay me
consolation money.

350
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:31,089
This case isn't looking too good...

351
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,291
What do you mean?

352
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:36,428
Well. if you hada motive
and Struck the victim 3 times

354
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,766
no one would believe
you didn't mean to kill him.

356
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,433
I see...

357
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:45,571
One last question and I'd like you to
give me an honest answer...

359
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:50,108
Po you think your father killed
Toshiyuki Otsu?

361
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:55,581
No! He maybe a good for nothing thief
but"he's not capable of murder)!

363
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,283
I see

364
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:03,088
She's going to have it hard this time...

365
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,536
Oh good grief, dad

366
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,838
sleeping again!

367
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:24,409
I always close my
eyes when I'm thinking!

369
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,311
Who.says "was sleeping!

370
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:31,883
I see. so you must've thought of
something that would help mom then!

372
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,186
Well. uh, you see

373
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:39,291
It-s;her-fault for taking .a
case like this in the firstiplace!

375
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,628
The defendant had a
motive for committing murder,

377
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,365
and what's more, he went and left
his fingerprints all over the safe's dial

379
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,301
How in the world can she
think she can get him off!

381
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:54,139
I wonder why his fingerprints were
only on the safes dial though

383
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,476
Eas . he srobabl
wore gloves when he broke In.

385
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:03,248
But he couldn't turn the dial with
them on so he took them off!

387
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,117
That's when the victim
came in and wham,

389
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,784
he hit him over the
head with the ashtray

391
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,686
If that's how it went

392
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,789
then there. should've been
fingerprints on the ashtray

394
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,859
I guess, since he took his gloves off

395
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,962
But they didn't find any.

396
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:20,666
Well, he probably wiped
them off, that's why!

398
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,600
Give those to me!

399
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,237
Read this part carefully!

400
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,172
It says that there were traces that

401
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,142
it dabeen-wiped with
a cloth containing oil. see!

403
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,945
Then why didn't he wipe the
safe at the same time too?

405
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,481
Welleethatlfibecause
he'd just killed someone.

407
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,951
He panickedsand forgot,
he just ran out of there

409
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:44,755
Oh, okayeso when'd he take
the money from the safe?

411
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:48,193
Well, after he=killed-the victim, he
opened the safe-one more time

413
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,063
But you just said he
panicked and ran out of there!

415
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,497
Well, uh...

416
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,433
It ixudoesn't make any sense...

417
00:13:55,434 --> 00:14:00,138
You're a:fool!
Criminals aren't logical, that's why!

419
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,974
What's that supposed to mean?

At about 9 that night, I was watching

00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,364
Why Mr Arima

511
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,634
Did you see the boss?

512
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,539
No, nobody was in the office
when I made my rounds at 8.00

514
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,109
That's strange, when he left
my place a little while ago.

516
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,244
He said he was coming back here...

517
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,080
Then he must've come in
through the emergency it

519
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:54,186
But his office door's locked
and I called but there was no answer

521
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,122
Maybe he's in back, in his office

522
00:15:57,657 --> 00:16:00,425
He forgot his glasses,
I came to give them to him

524
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,695
I hate 10 ask but can you come
with me and open the door?

526
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,863
Okay.

527
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:11,169
That Mr. Arima is Mr: Otsu's
son-in-law, isn't he?

529
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,307
Yes: he runs an Italian
restaurant in the neighborhood

531
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,743
And this door was locked. you say?

532
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,614
Yes...
I used this spare key to get in

534
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,892
It doesn't look like he's here after all

535
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,032

It's me. Masahiko.

553
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,133
Mr. Akiyama, call an ambulance!

We:d like to take a look around
your father-in law's office

582
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:58,777
Isn't anybody using this office?

583
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:06,318
No. the police said we could but since
father was killed in here so tragically,

585
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,421
I haven't decided what to do with it yet.

586
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,425
Go ahead. I've left it
exactly as the police left it

588
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:14,492
Thank you

589
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,509
By the way, Mr. Arima, where
was the victim's body lying?

591
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,980
Let's see; right about
here in front of the safe,

593
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,016
he was lying clutching his head

594
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,351
I see...

595
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,386
I've got it!

596
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,887
What do you mean?

597
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:49,493
I'll bet Mr. Otsu caught Inoue
trying to open the safe.

599
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,829
The defendant confessed to
that in the very beginning

601
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,834
I'm not finished
Inoue was hiding a

603
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,938
knife or something. he threatened the
victim and forced him to open the safe.

605
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:06,144
When the safe was opened, he hit
the victim with the ashtray from behind

607
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,181
You're net implying the
defendant was lying".'»"are».you?

609
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,751
Well, I guess you-could:say I am

610
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:16,454
How can you expect to defend
a chient if you don't believe him!

612
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:22,360
You'd better open your eyes of that
Madonna's going to fry you in court!

614
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:22,927
What's that?

615
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,000
Wait a minute, it couldn't be...

616
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:34,572
Hey, is that the window you
saw the Killer through, sir?

618
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,074
That's right

619
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:36,808
Okay...

620
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,885
Hey Conan=whatsre you-up to?

622
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,822
Uncle Kogoro::could you stand in
front of the safe one more time for me?

624
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,059
Oh good grief,
now what.

626
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,228
Here)?

627
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,397
Hold it right there!

628
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,801
I knew it!

629
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,003
don't get it...

630
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:09,040
The partition Is blocking the way,
I can't see you from here!

632
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,909
Whatdmn ou*say!

633
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,645
Mr. Akiyama,
what is the meaning of this?

635
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:17,182
Well, uh,
I wasn't looking over there

637
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,085
I was only:looking at the person's
shadow reflected on this wall over here

639
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,054
Didgyou say the
reflection on the wall...

642
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:23,954
Yes...

644
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,858
there weren't any lights
on in the room that-night

646
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,495
and the neon lights from
outside the window came In

648
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,597
that's how I saw the killer's shadow...

649
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,601
He hit Mr. Otsu over
and over again

651
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:43,374
Besides, I heard Mr Otsu fall after
that, I'm positive about that!

653
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,777
Let me clarify one point,

654
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,115
you didn't actually see the defendant
Sr e evicim, cic you.

656
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,716
But Ms. Kisaki...

657
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,319
I don't see how much
difference it makes

659
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,887
The defendant himself has confessed
hitting my father-in-law, isn't that right?

661
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,490
That's where you're wrong Mr Arima

662
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,092
There's a big difference in
actually seeing the beating

664
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,329
and seeing the shadow of
someone being beaten!

666
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,230
Besides...

667
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:11,769
until the defendant is found guilty
in court, he is presumed innocent!

669
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,141
Unfortunately, most
people forget that fact

671
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,376
Well excuse me.

672
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,011
Excuse me, sir

673
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:20,712
What is it?

674
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,414
This clock isn't working.

675
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:28,987
I know, the late president won
that in a golf tournament

677
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,191
he just left it there for
decoration, he never used it

679
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,058
Oh...

680
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:36,694
Mr. Arima, I need to ask you

681
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,329
Yes,
what is it?

683
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:44,769
Was there anyone besides the victim
who knew the combination to the safe?

685
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:47,038
No. he was the only one.

686
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:52,243
He was a man one operation,
he didn't even tell the accountant

688
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,243
Ouch!

689
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:55,512
Watch out,
stop wandering around!

691
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:56,247
Ouch!

692
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,816
And what's this?

693
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,820
That's it, I'vergot it now! I've solved
the mystery behind this case

695
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:08,793
The silhouette of something
being hit that Mr Akiyama said he saw

697
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,462
and the sound of something falling,

698
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,432
everything can be this
trick will explain everything

700
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:17,635
and the only one who
could've have set it up-is

702
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,704
that person!
