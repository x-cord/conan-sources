35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,718
One day, this man named "Clock" came
to me.

37
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,821
Clock... You mean. that ¢c ock?

38
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:53,989
Yes .

39
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:58,827
He doesn't have either a first or last name
1st "Clock" .

41
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,230
He as your mother s grandfather.

great-grandfather...

48
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,454
I didn't know I had a great-grandfather

49
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,174
With his shrewd instincts and guts.

50
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,775
He dominated the Japanese stock market
after the war.

52
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:16,445
Eople called him "Raging Bull

53
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:18,513
He was a legendary market player

54
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:19,982
who achieved numerous wealth in one
generation.

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,655
Unfortunately however

57
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:28,656
Last winter...

58
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,278
Clock...

59
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,897

61
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,203
Master

62
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,504
Huh...

63
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,106
Io whoever solves this question
However...

65
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:48,944
I the Raging Bull, shall give my entire
fortune.

67
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:52,664
However. the time limit is 24 hours

68
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,333
Once the<time is over.

69
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,620
One will lose the right of both inheritance
and challenge forever.

71
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:02,324
Tho challengers\will be restricted
to my sons, wife, and grandchildren,

73
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:05,060
with the ones with-closer blood relationship
flit

75
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:08,630
I Andi] want you to see it through.

76
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,833
Oh please. you're not dying. Master...

77
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,901
Huh.

78
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,772
In the end. nobody ever visited me.
Well. one gets what one deserves. huh

80
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:21,510
I know that, but still, dying alone 1s a
Ionely thing.

82
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,645
What the hell is my family for!?

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,715
Please, calm down
You should completely rest.

85
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:30,385
The Raging Bull was 1 miserable cow
after all

87
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,067
So. that was my great-grandfather's end.

88
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:46,068
So! that. was my g eat-grandfather's ¢nd

90
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:46,835
And...

91
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:49,788
As the secretary and executor of
Mr. Gozo Isegawa

93
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,441
I'm here to tell you something.

94
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,975
Ms Yuriko Matsunaka.

95
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:55,076
Ah, yes

96
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:59,814
You are the one with the
17th right of inheritance. Now it is your turn.

98
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:00,415
Me. .1?

99
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:00,966
Me...17?

100
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:05,754
Of course you have the right to, "bstain
is up to ou...

102
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:11,126
By the way, I have heard that the
Youth Detective Squad.

104
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:14,663
The smart kids are at the same school
ours...

106
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,799
That's why you asked us. huh?

107
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:23,638
So he is actually trying not only Yuriko,
but us to solve the question.

109
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,275
What does:your family say about that?

110
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,812
My father died in a car accident right after
I was born...

112
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:34,216
$6 as my mother with a sickness last year
So I'm the only one left

114
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:37,085
Oh, I'm sorry...

117
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:41,990
AW my relives disagreed wih my parent's
marriage.

119
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:43,959
So they eloped and got married.

120
00:05:44,327 --> 00:05:48,330
So I really-don't know: imy- relatives.

121
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:50,365
ERE YON EF Ee ORY Oe Ne Ll « A

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,701
Ok. How do you feel about it now?

124
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:55,504
Kind of afraid.

125
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:58,439
But if I cha lenge to solve the question.

126
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,575
I can see the house that my mother and
great-grandfather once lived together

128
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,576
when she was young.

129
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:03,712
R. Clock told me that...

130
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:05,047
That house is

131
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,382
Called the Angel's Mansion.

132
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:11,253
Yuriko. and the Youth Detective Squad.

133
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:12,788
Mr. €lock!

134
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:14,256
You're the O€lock...

135
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:17,993
Pleasure to meet you ll

136
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:23,331
It's pretty far, isn't it?.
That Angel's Mansion...

138
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:27,069
It's not far once we get out of this forest.

139
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:35,076
Oh yes... I told your parents that

140
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:39,414
you were going to be camping tonight, and
I have already got permission from them.

142
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,982
What!?

143
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,485
So you've done a research on us already

144
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:48,689
It's there. Look.

145
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,136
That's the South Angel

146
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:02,954
That's the West Angel

147
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:05,574
That's the East Angel

148
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:10,011
And that's the North Angel
They are named this way

150
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:14,282
since they are located in the four cardinal
points precisely. And also...

152
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:17,619
I've heard that the statues faces are made
to look like Mr Isegawa's wife

154
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,621
who happened to die young

155
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,256
My great-grandmother...

156
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:28,396
Yes He spent all of his earnings,
just to see his wife's face agdin

158
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:31,867
Probably he looked like a cold father to his
00S,

160
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:35,270
Theygleft.the house as soon:as-they
became. adults.

162
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,522
In the end. he was the only one left in the
house .

164
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:44,146
Sure his sons visited him sometimes,
but always ended up with a big fight...

166
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:49,151
t was very snd that the people couldn
understand 'him well...

169
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:55,490
raws U0

170
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,262
See the house with the South Angel?
We call it the South Mansion.

172
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,331
That's where Mr. Isegawa spent his last
moment.

174
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,500
Nd the East Mansion over there.

175
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:07,569
As mainly his workplace...

176
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:12,841
And that North Mansion was where his
sons and housekeepers used to live.

178
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:16,444
No one lives there now hut it looks prett, .
Neat still.

180
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,314

183
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:29,257
Actually it is Mr. Iscgawa's will that
nobody goes in there, &

185
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,625
How come?

186
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,043
I have no 'idea...

188
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,130
Hey! What Is that?

189
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:36,932
Oh! It's Minotaur

190
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:37,265
Oh! It's Minotaur.

191
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,832
Minotaur!?

192
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,605
It's an imaginary monster, half human .
And half bull .*

194
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,276
He had been ca led "Raging Bull"

195
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,146
What else could decorate this hous
better?

197
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,115
Oh yeah. Everywhere is

198
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,317
Bull and

199
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:56,151
Bull and

200
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:57,219
Bull!

201
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:00,772
In sthesstock market, the bull 1Is_a symbol of
power.

203
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,125
You can find statues of bulls in
Wall Street. New York,

205
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,327
which is the center of the stock market.

206
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,997
Bulls are like guardian 'angels for market
players.

208
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,267
Hat the heck?

209
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:15,737
It's one of the security systems
Mr. Isegawa made

211
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:19,140
It switches on at sunset. on its on

212
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,883
Even after Mr. Isegawa passed away?

213
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:33,321
Right. Until somebody solves his question
and finds the treasures in this mansion...

215
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:37,125
the security is going to be on.
And so am I...

217
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,994
Oh. it's scary. The-angel...

218
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:40,195
Lo -P h X

219
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,332
It's an angel's mansion under the daylight

220
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:50,038
and a witch's mansion under the moonlight.
I guess.

224
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,467
Don't worry! I'm with you!

225
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,286
MM. Me too! Kind of.

226
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,471
We are at? the center of Mr lsegawas
propert .

228
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:10,225
Here is the fifth mansion,
the Mansion of the Raging Bull

230
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,478
So my mother was living In this house,
right?

232
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,865
Even after her parents left his mansion...

233
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:21,436
I heard she cared about Mr. Isegawa,
so she used to visit here alone often.

235
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,538
Hey. Mr. Clock.

236
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:28,677
I think it's time for you to tell us about the
question Mr. Isegawa left behind.

238
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:31,546
Right. That's what we're here for.

239
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,950
I'm sorry but it's not time yet, so please

240
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,355
I guess time really matters in this question,
doesn't it?

243
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,629
Well. it's time for me to serve you dinner...

244
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,064
To he North Mansion, please

Phew! I'm stuffed!

246
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,645
Yeah, it was delicious.

247
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,117
Now it's time.

252
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,121
Here is the question Mr..dsegawa left
behind

254
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:14,189
V QQQQHO

257

When the bull's horn disappears and the
tail becomes the head

When the bull's horn disappears and

00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:38,046
An angel will come down and play the
flute.

277
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,247
And ah.

278
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,717
The song of angel is my very treasure.

279
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,020
24 hours from now

280
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,723

282
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:51,259
More importantly, which bull is he talking
about

284
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,799
Now. please. be careful.

285
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,520
Some of the security systems are actually
quite dangerous.

287
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,207
I've seen the previous challengers getting
severely injured.

289
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,543
Some of them have never returned

290
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:15,350
Keep in mind
We Hats Meson 18 a Tuo lo dati

292
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:19,053
Keep in mind,
this Angel's Mansion is a huge labyrinth.

294
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:31,166
That must be it. That humongous bull gotta
be the one, man!

296
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:31,633
That must bo it. That humongous bull gotta

but shouldn't we go with everybody else?

300
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,041
Hey. you'll never beat Conan if you're like
that

302
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:43,244
That bull's gotta be the one in Gozo's
question.

304
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,447
I don't know. man...

305
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,652
That bull looks to be raging. you know.

306
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,588
I'm gonna find the treasure map inside
its horn and then...

310
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,742
Genta..you're amazing!

311
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,462
Hehehe...

312
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,730
Ah... I don't think its that simple...

313
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,850
We should go with the boys
It's dangerous

315
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:09,788
Yeah, but did you see Yuriko's face?
She didn't show a smile. not even once.

317
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:11,806
She's really sad.

318
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,342
I want to solve this question her great
grandfather left her.

320
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:15,476
So she can smile again.

321
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,746
Alright then how come you are not
checking this bull?

323
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:20,949
Because I'm scared...

324
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:26,321
When the bull's horn disappears and the
tail becomes the head...

326
00:13:26,956 --> 00:13:29,123
The bull's horn disappears.

327
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,326
It disappeared!

328
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:34,178
What... . 7?

329
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,197
AI. you're fantastic!

330
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:42,303
Oh I get it!

331
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,206
It must be the West Angel
that's coming down. isnt it?...

333
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:47,408
Sigh

334
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:52,413
Ayumi and Al are saying that the
West Ange is the one

336
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,084
Hey. we are men of iron bill!

337
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,420
I don't really get what you m

338
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:04,826
Oh, you don'tiknow?
It means to achieve the original intentions.

340
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:07,829
Oh. you mean.iron will. not bill.

342
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,198
Oh « od!

344
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,402
I smell something fishy from the
East Mansion.

346
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:20,174
It is Mr. Isegawa's will that nobody goes
in there, so...

348
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:25,079
Maybe the question is a lie, and
the treasures are In the East Mansion... l?

350
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,781
G. Genta...

351
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,199
Man! This thing Is too smooth!

352
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:49,037

How should we

358
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:10,925
make the angel

359
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:11,960

360
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,062

Ail?

368
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,343
I guess we better go back.

369
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,284
So. here's the East Mansion. I suppose?

370
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,152

This bull has no horns!!

373
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,344
When the bull's horn disappears...

374
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,568
The tail becomes the head"

375
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,970
The tal is the head.... Head?

376
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,118
Why aren't you moving? You! Cow!

377

You gotta believe this

Bones!?

395
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:04,539
Is that true?

396
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,475
I guess that's how rats end up in this
Iabyrinth.

398
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,545
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to call the
police?

400
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,747
Certainly. I will...

401
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:17,285
Now YOU, focus on what you have to do
Time is money.

404
00:17:23,392 --> 00:17:24,759
here's everyone?...

405
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,227
They said they're going to the washroom.

408
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:28,496
It's boon too long.

410
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:30,214
Phew.

411
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,236
Ah I can't sleep. So

412
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,505
I'm gonna go for a little walk, ok?...

00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,510
Don't worry. Just for a while

417
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:54,856
In the end, nobody ever visited me
dying alone is a lonely thing.

422
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,540

424
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:17,078
Oh! I'm gonna pee in my pants!
Mr. Clock. where's the washroom?

426
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:20,748
- Nat

428
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,964
I don't know sf we should trust what
Mr. Olock told us. man.

430
00:18:37,398 --> 00:18:38,499
What do you mean'...

431
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,903
You know. this Gozo guy left the question,

432
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:45,506
Yuriko was the 17th challenger
Things like that...

434
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,108
Yeah I know...

435
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:51,179
There have been 16 challengers in the
past few months.

437
00:18:51,814 --> 00:18:56,250
But nobody left a memo or whatsoever
It IS strange...

439
00:18:56,285 --> 00:18:57,385
Yeah

440
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,786
Maybe this question thing is a lie

441
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:02,190
and is something he used to get Yuriko
LO come here.

443
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,693
Getting her to come here. and then what?

444
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:06,894
Yeah.

445
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,298
Actually...l don't know

446
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:15,970
I don't think Mr Clock was lying
Just m guess.

448
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,206
'2 S One sure ung...

449
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,142
Even if the previous challengers left some
kind 0 hint to the question,

451
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,644
that Clock guy could've cleaned them
all up.

453
00:19:24,012 --> 00:19:26,514
For the sake of being fair to all the
challengers?

455
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:28,182
Voile I

456
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:31,052
But the thing is what does he gain from
doing so

458
00:19:38,994 --> 00:19:39,594
Hmm 2?

459
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,829
Shoots!. .10 hours left...

460
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:45,900
I'm so sorry...for causing you a trouble.

462
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,535
Maybe I should just.

465
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,772
Don't you worry. Yuriko.

466
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:55,309
There're still many other bulls to soc!

467
00:19:55,744 --> 00:20:00,248
We got 10 hours! It's long enoug wfor
me to break all the horns!

470
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,319
Wait a minute Why is it the Bull

471
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,788
And why does it have to be the horn... 7?

472
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:12,727
Simple Yuriko's great, grandad was
called "Raging Bull

474
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:15,262
And. there's a bull with horns.

475
00:20:15,263 --> 00:20:19,267
Which Genta got HANGED ON last nigh!
In the Mansion of the Raging Bull

477
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,203
And there's a gold bull with'no horns In the
East Mansion

480
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:25,139
where Mitsuhiko pissed in his pants. right?

482
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,944
W. what are. ou talking about,
I didn't pee In my pants!

484
00:20:30,846 --> 00:20:34,882
The "bull" in question cums not refer to any
of the bulls in this mansion That's...

486
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,820
A character?

488
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:42,456
The bull's horn disappears

489
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,557
That means...

490
00:20:44,792 --> 00:20:46,160
Sheep!?

491
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,362
Oh. please. Genta!

492
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,364
It's "Go". Like when you write noon
in Japanese

494
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,366
In the Chinese zodiac, it means "horse".

495
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:55,503
Horse? There's nO horse in here...

497
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,307
It's not just animal. This "horse" also»
indicates a direction.

500
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,041
And one more thing...

501
00:21:01,743 --> 00:21:02,777
Shoots!

502
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,849

No. this black crystal is the key to solve
the next question

520
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,740
The bull's horn disappears
and the tail becomes the head

522
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,541
It means the opposite of "horse"

523

is north!
