Don't worry.

Yo. Hattori. what brings you here?

57
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,152

There are a lot of girls here, don't you
think?

73
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,665
Oh are there?

74
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,117
Oh, come on!

75
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,804
So. this guy is Dogo Hoshikawa...?

76
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,074
That's right! Don't you think he is
handsome. Ran

78
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,078
He's not just a handsome guy but also a
great magician!

Hey! She's a hot girl. huh.

Yeah...

88
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,104
What? I thought he was hanging on strings

89
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,172
That's what I thought too...

It's amazing.

98
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,845
Nope.

102
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,400
Nod.

107
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,874
Oh no!

108
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:35,779
No way...

109
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,516
He vanished...

110
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,862
It's unbelievable

111
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,397
He must be a wizard

113
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:53,999
Are ou stupid?...

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,066
Huh!?

115
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,669
There's no such thing called a wizard

116
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,538
I think so too...

117
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,341
That cage looks impossible to escape from,
but it actually has a door in the back.

119
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:06,478
So, after the cloth covers the cage.
He goes out through the backdoor...

121
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,948
We didn't see him anywhere on the stage
though!

123
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,884
The girl assistants on the stage are the
key to the trick...

125
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,787
Inside, the cage. that magician probably
changed his clothes

127
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,424
to the ones thatthe girls are wearing in?
Order to camouflage himself

129
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,163
Nobody was counting how many assistants
were on re's age

132
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,567
so we wouldn't know whether it was 8 or 9
assistants on the stage. right?...

134
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,168
By walking closely with the female
assistants

136
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,436
he disappeared into the wing.

137
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,106
While people are watching the clothes
burn up. he comes to the audience seats!

139
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,441
Yeah.

140
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,378
But you thought the levitation magic was
amazing. right!?

142
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,116
It looked like he was really flying!
I didn't see any wire at all...

144
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,452
For that, he used a bar to hold his body In
place,

146
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,722
and there was a crane behind the curtain
to move the bar.

148
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,925
The curtain can be cut lengthwise and
sideways.

150
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,961
The audience only believes that the
magician is being suspended by a wire

152
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,430
and therefore is only paying attention
to the magician up in the air.

154
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,965
Enough!

155
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,033
Both of ou stop speaking!

156
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,041
For God's sake. You're the ones who
wanted to know how the tricks worked...

158
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,918
Now . It's time for today's/last illusion...

159
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,988
It's just a LITTLE dangerous magic,
Escape from water"!

161

162
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,235
<P >>
he will try to escape from this aquarium
which is sealed with a chain.

00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,077
Hey. Ran...It's been

170
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,080
almost 10 minutes since he went into the
water, right?

172
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,281
Uh, yeah

173
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,216

Somebody. bring an axe!

175
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,556
Uh, there has been a minor complication...
Please wait for a moment...

177
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,927
That's what the legendary magician
Harr Houdini used to do.

179
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:36,961
It's classic, man...

180
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,598
Yeah...It's the most common escape trick...

181
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,700
Let's go! Ran!

182
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,767

Don't worry about it...

In" fact, I'm still alive partly thanks to you

233
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,012
Really!?

234
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,981
I heard you...

235
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,084
I heard your voices when I was half
unconscious underwater...

237
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,687
Your love brought me back to life

238
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:43,755
Yoah?

239
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,956
Did you really?
Really?

241
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,558
It's obviously a lie.

242
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,625
Ha ha.

243
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,830
He wastprobably hiding a pin or something
\ in his'mouth to unlock the handcuffs.

245
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,499
I guess he*was out of the aquarium way
before. What do you think?

247
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,268
Yeah, by initially showing the audience the
aquarium with the door open

249
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,537
and sealing that door shut with a chain.

250
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,140
Then obviously the audience will believe
that it's impossible to open.

252
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,844
But the truth is, some part of the cover has
no chain on it. And from that space

254
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,745
It is possible to escape...

255
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:11,049
All he needs is to wait behind the curtain
until the audience starts to worry

257
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,687
As the staff goes berserk, he pours water
over his head and shows up...

259
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,657
Now, the great breathtaking escape illusion
Is done!

261
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,997
Well. well, it was great, Hoshikawa.

262
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,599

I was just thinking. about you and I.

264
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,535
Doing some collaborative performance?
What do you think 7?

266
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,971
Sure... Ifat's ok with you...

267
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,306

269

00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,377

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,013
would you mind if I Joined you guys?

272
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,985
We should make clear

274
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,791
which one of us three is the true heir of
our sensei, Mr Masakage...

276
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,896
Mr. Masakage

278
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,565
He was a mysterious magician whe used
to be on=TV and stage

280
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:04,435
but disappeared all of 1 suddon abeut
10 years ago

282
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,006
I heard he's still alive somewhere...

283
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,375
Mr. MasEkage.

284
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,812
I never knew these three people were
Mr. Masakages -pupils...

286
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,115
Oh. eahl

287
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,483
If we wanna perform together,

288
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,353
then why don't we get Kazumi Sanada
since he's as popular as Hoshikawa,

290
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,090
and name the event "Dream Collaboration
of the Four Magic Kings"

292
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,926
Kazumi Sanada?

293
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,094
\whottkelnO™t tanlimcly

294
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,330
I don't know if he'd be up for it though...

295
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,698
3! p-
True

297
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,534
We actually never met him before although
we were in the same field.

299
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:40,471
Hey Ran, you've met this Kazumi Sanada
guy before. right?

301
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,606
Uh, yeah...

303
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,975
First, it was when Sonoko invited me at the
cruise part

305
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,128
for the Suzuki Zaibatsu's 60 anniversary.

306
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,647
Kid sent us a letter

307
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,351
So for the entertainment at the party,
Sonoko's mother hired Mr.Sanada

309
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,286
to disguise as Kid

310
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,924
I met him\for the second time:when
Motoyasu Tsukumo...

312
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,895
A geniusymagician's wife asked my dad to
Investigate the cause:of his death...

314
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:08,132
Mr. TisiKumo had three pupils and
Mr. Sanada was one of:them...

316
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,836
Reqlly, you never know who's connected
to who. huh.

318
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,507
Then, we should ask this lady to get in
touch! with Sanada.

320
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,278
Now, I think we should head to sensei's
house and talk.

324
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,313
How about you guys?

325
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,049
We could show you a simple magic show
Wffter dinner of you like

327
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,317
0 Ohgnro you sorious

328
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,518
Can we do that?

330
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,289
But why his house?

331
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,791
For God's sake, have you forgotten?

332
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,761
Today is the day sensei disappeared
Oe oo

334
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:41,966
He may just decide to return home today
you know?

336
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:43,601
Ts 40

337
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,009
Oh, hello there!

338
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,047
Dim-jib it Tenko and Heshlkawa back there?

339
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,565
Hello .

340
00:16:57,566 --> 00:16:58,700
Long time no see!

341
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,253
It's been quite a while. I guess it's been
what. 10 years?

343
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,222
Oh, sorry. who are those people?

347
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,190
They're our special guests tonight

349
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:06,824
Nice to you meet you!

350
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:07,625
Nice to you meet you!

351
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,062
Alright, then I guess I should go and
get some more grocernies: for tonight...

353
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,797
Oh no, don't...

356
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,799
We thought $0. so

358
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,601
Herel

359
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,874
I see. So you've been visiting here the
same date every year.

361
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,110
Yes. in anticipation that sensei might just
come back

365
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,647
Unfortunately. we ve heard nothing from
him these past 10 years

367
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,517
FY S ay
Well. this brings back memories. eh...

369
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,987
Yeah. we used to live here together

370
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,122
and went through senses intensive
training together...

372
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,726
Well, Hoshikawa, even before my husband
decided to have pupils

374
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,461
I think you used to stop by here, right?

375
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,564
Then, Mr. Hoshikawa is his first pupil

376
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,500
It doesn't even matter who's first and
who's last

378
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,789
What matters is, who s surpasses sense
as a magician

380
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,774
Hey. hey. Tenko...

381
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,545
If we're really going to do a show
together!...

383
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,714
The highlight of my magic will be
Witch Reborn"!

385
00:18:04,715 --> 00:18:06,017
What?

386
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,087
Um gonna place a huge cross in the middle
of the alidience

388
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:12,522
and tie myself to it.

389
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:15,193
I'll have the audience fire il up, and before
the cross burns out

391
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:18,945
I'll vanish...

392
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,283
Next time you see me as when I emerge out
of the ashes...

394
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,105
What do you think?

396
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,373
It's breathtaking and exciting. isn't it?

397
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,975
Yeah

398
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,178
Well, I should start preparing dinner now...

399
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,381
Ok. let us help you then. Yeah?

400
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,850
Sure!

401
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,185
I think I'll look around the.house
since it's been a while

403
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,788
That's a good idea

405
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,391
Actually,
I'm gonna go to my room and take a nap.

408
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,693

Where is Mrs. Masakage

446
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:39,076
She went out to get some seasoning
because we ran out.\

448
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,279
and although it's been quite a while,
she still hasn't come back.

Hey. where're your friends?

They're treating their wound in the kitchen.

00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,891
\AAnx=%

470
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,126
It seems one of them cut their finger
with the knife...

472
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,396
Ok. I'll go and wake'Handa up.

473
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,533
I think he's In the room*way In the back of
the first floor. where He usually is...

475
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,736
Hoshikawa,
would you please go and, get Tenko?

477
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,171
Sure... ok.

478
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,808
She's most probably in that room
that)! think she's in?

480
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,409
Which room?

481
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,813
Oh. I mean Mr. Masakage's room

482
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,550
There're pictures and instruments
for old magic tricks there.

484
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,253
There are many memorable objects
in that room.

486
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Hat!?

487
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,355
Old magic tricks?

488
00:20:57,388 --> 00:20:59,323
Would you like to take a look?

490
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,926
Why not

491
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:07,765
Mr. Masakage designed
and built this house himself

493
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,933
I see

494
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,335
His room is on the second floor

496
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:22,997
It's a narrow hallway .

497
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:25,483
It's Kinda dark and scary too...

498
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,553
That door on the right is sensel's room...

499
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,596
Maybe the light bulb burned out...

500
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,031
Oh no

501
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,199
What is it?

502
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,233
A blackout?

503
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,635
Where's the breaker?

505
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,141
I guess It's not in this room.

506
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,378
Hi. Mrs. Masakage. Where's the breaker?

507
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,681
It's In thesanext room. In the bathroom.

508
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,687
Ok: I found it.

509
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:19,603
