The killer Is Mr. Kato!

73
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,966
e deceived Officer Chiba
and used him to establish his alibi...

76
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,903
He twisted the passage of time
with blood smeared hands...

79
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,441
Hmm. I can't find a thing...

80
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,644
Neither can I find the parker .

How is it over there

85
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:44,683
Nothing hero

86
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,717
Nothing here

87
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,085
How about over there?

88
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:49,721
Nothing anywhere...

89
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,658
Nothing scorns to be around

90
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,925
guess not...

91
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,127
t least not here...

92
00:04:56,428 --> 00:05:03,068
I guess Mr. Kato who is freelonding hore
with you is not a suspect after all .

94
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,169
O Oh. yeah...

95
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,504
Then, who on earth is it?

97
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:13,078
they saw near the scene of the murder...

98
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,914
I 'was probably another man,
who looked very much like him!

101
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,783
Because during the time of the crime.

102
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,685
Mr. Kato has an alibi

104
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,721
that he was here watching Merning
Live Seven!with Officer Chiba...

106
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,254
that he was here watching Morning
ive Seven with Officer Chiba...

108
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,228

131
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,314
and stay here with-Officer Sato

Well. if it's going to take long

143
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,633
all you gotta do is
have someone else take over

145
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,034
It's as simple as that...

146
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,403
T.That's right.

147
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,937

Huh?!

150
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:49,875
Everything'll go fine!
Officer Takagi...

152
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,213
I don't think'll take that long...

153
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,887
I've been telling you. haven't 17?!

154
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,356
During the time of
the crime from 7:00 to 7:30.

156
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:04,656
During the time of
the crime from 7:00 to 7:30.

158
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,592
I was watching TV together
with Chiba in the living room!

160
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,061
Uh, Mr Kato!

161
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:10,829
Huh?

162
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,096
Huh?

163
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,132
What was that program
you were watching?

165
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,233
IR 17

166
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,836
I.Like I said. Merning Live Seven!

167
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,171
Which one?

168
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,205
Ugh!

169
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:24,042
Which one but the one aired on NiChiur
TV from 7:00«n the morning?

173
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,845
WP NsN5 4404

174
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:31,349
Morning Live Seven is also playing
on cable TV from 9:00 in the morning too.

176
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,021
True...

178
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,690
Which means

179
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,194
even if It were to take
an hour and a half by car from here.

181
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,198
He could've killed Mr. Nakamoto
at a little after 7:00 in the morning

183
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,499
come back here.

184
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,468
Wake Officer Chiba up at 9:00

185
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,671
and watch Morning Live Seven.
Playing on cable TV together

187
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,407
It scems possible for him
to establishf fake alibi...

189
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,476
Huh 2!

190
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,813
Chiba you said that
you both drank last night

192
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,915
and you fell asleep
In the living room. right?

195
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,117
QffiQG $5110...

196
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,020
If he made Chiba drink
to make him groggy: in the morning.

198
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,623
And if Chiba who was awakened
in.the morning still half asleep...

200
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,626
He probably wouldn't have realized it
if it were the cable TV program...

202
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,193
WW, WEIR & mllsu EH

203
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,862
WwW. Wait a minute! J

204
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,931
could've been half asleep but...

205
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,933
You ca it trick the video. can you?

206
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:25,370
Tho vidoo I rocordod this morning of
Morning Live Seven's cooking corner

208
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,740
had the time and
everything recorded too. didn't it?

210
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,476
QO {he bot ne vO Soven
that played on cable TV

212
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,612
thoesidivie avourkdn't besdisplayed!

213
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,529
It's aired two hours later. you know...

214
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,699
That's true too...

215
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,452
Besides,
after watching Morning Live till 8:00.

217
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,120
We watched a 6 hour video.

218
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,189
And like I was saying
he was with me all the while

220
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,325
while we watched
the live baseball broadcast from 2:00.

223
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,645
Ben Cho-san nd ll of you came
part way throuch the game

225
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:52,531
The only time I wasn't with him was

226
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,399
when I went to take 1 bth
for about 30 minutes.

229
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,534
It would've been impossib e for him

230
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,670
to even make it to the scene of the crime

232
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,206
that would've taken
more than an hour vb car

234
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,576
Well, I took a bath
after watching the video half way.

236
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,311
I think it was about 11:00.

237
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,345
So I think

238
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,048
it would've been impossible for him
to commit the crime to begin with... l

240
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,216
But,

241
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,021
with 30 minutes
there's .1 lot you um do

243
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,991
You can make coffee
watch TV...

245
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,961
Dub videos...

246
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,462
Dubbing!

248
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,163
D Dubbing!

249
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,201
Right! Dubbing videos.)

250
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,224
I see!

251
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:39,694
If he had set the timer to record
Morning Live Seven before going out.

253
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:41,763
He could've dubbed it.over

254
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,231
the cable TV program
that Officer Chiba recorded!

256
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,768
Moreover, what he taped was

257
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:48,870
Yoko Okino's 4-minutc cooking!

258
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:50,755
Hone are two decks

259
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,874
$030 minutes would he mere than enough!

260
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,377
B But if there's no time display

261
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:58,647
I think I would have noticed
when I recorded the program...

264
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,081
Oh. I wonder about that?

265
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:05,520
'Hose memo stickers
that are stuck all over the TV...

267
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:10,558
If youiroc usod to scoing all these memos
onthe set all the time like that

269
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,297
even If you can't sce the time display
on the upper left. you would just.figure

271
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:17,332
that's the reason
why you can't see the tame.

273
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,701
And it wouldn't even bother you. right?

274
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,002
You seem to have known that

275
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,404
the cooking corner was
after the weather forecast so

277
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,306
the cooking corner was
after the weather forecast so

279
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:28,443
you don't have to see the time to record it...

280
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:29,744
And, you also mentioned th

281
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:33,448
the flash news about Hide was
displayed on the screen during

283
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:35,383
Morning Live Seven. right?

284
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,418
Y.Yeah...

285
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:38,720
f the program that
you were 'watching was really

287
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,523
the news variety program
from 7:0 in the morning.

289
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:45,360
I think they would have talked about
that news during the program...

291
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,861
In other words,

292
00:10:46,862 --> 00:10:50,665
even If it's a live program If it's a recording.
New news coverage is impossible?

294
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,766
Chiba!

295
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,770
You said that the news on the video
wasn't mentioned in the program. right

297
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:57,205
Y, Yeah

299
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:01,943
I think that sort of news wns on display
when Chiba left to go to the restroom...

301
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,678
B.But. don't forget

302
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:08,116
we were watching the Kamen Yaiba video
from 8:00 in the morning for 6 hours!

304
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,018
We were watching the Kamen Yaiba video
from 8:00 in the morning for 6 hours!

307
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,987
If you include the time
that Chiba was taking a bath.

309
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:14,389
It's 6 and a ha f hours!

310
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,594
If we werefwatching Morning Live Seven
on cable TV from 9:00 to 10-00.

312
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,097
Then we would've finish @
watching the video at 16-30!

314
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,949
The live baseball broadcast was until 16-00

315
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,284
so it would've been finished

316
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,604
and you all came here
a little before16:00. right?

318
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,307
In I,
Now that he 'montions it, that's true...

320
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,609
So. I wouldn't have had tho time

321
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:39,047
Uh, what time did you begin
watching the Yaiba video

323
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:41,783

Huh?

327
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,956
A little before
we began soarching this room

329
00:11:48,324 --> 00:11:49,224
-aO 7

331
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,092

334
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,563
Right...

335
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:55,897
Fright.

336
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,165
Hay. you guys...

337
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,134

The last scene of opisode #6!

His is the good part, you know!

343
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,882
Stop bugging us. Conan!

344
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:15,817
Episode #6 .

345
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,051
What is the meaning of this?

346
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:20,889
If the apisodes are 30 mimates long.
Three hours should've gone byt

348
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,659
Mitsuhiko. quick! The continuation!

349
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,894
Yes. yes.

350
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:27,762
Uh:the next one is...

351
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:31,900
It's not only the commercials!

352
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,903
They:can:t.wait to watch the next episode

353
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:37,404
that they. re:iskipping
the.opening theme song as well as the.end.

355
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:40,675
Preview of tho noxtiepisode.and
the 'summary of tho previous episode

357
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:41,976
before the title scene...

358
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:45,613
So, it only takes them a little more than
20 minutes to watch an episode...

360
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,417
WwW. Were you doing that too?

361
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,653
Y.Yea...probably...

362
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:54,956
sl hen, watching 12 episodes
would be 240 minutes,

364
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,724
that's only 4 hours!

366
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:00,829
Between the hours of 9.00 to 10:00

367
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,598
if programs that were 2 hours delayed
were shown to you...

369
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:06,534
if after that Chiba was shown that video

370
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,869
the discrepancy In time
would be compensated

372
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,040
and you'd mako it.for
the live baseball broadcast at 14:00

374
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,758
Very smart. sonny...

375
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:15,810
Moreover.

376
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:17,912
Since Chiba took a bath part way

377
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:20,548
his concept of time
could've been thrown off a bit...

379
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,952
Even if he were to watch
the baseball game from after all started,.

381
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:26,888
he wouldn't be able to
tell how much time passed.

384
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,556
SO. LM can be
connectad very Conveniently!

386
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,927
B.But, @hibh1 went te the restroom
and-to the kitchen to get drinks too!

388
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,529
Od you look eR ho « » fo?

389
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,731
NEE Ro) GREENER Cid
there-was anything odd going on though...

391
00:13:39,301 --> 00:13:40,935
So. he must ve rigged it. right?

392
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,374
R.Rigged?! The clock?

393
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:51,079
He mgged the clock two hours backwands
before waking Officer Chiba up.

395
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,615
He moved the hands of the clock
herein thesliving room and the kitchen...

397
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:56,417
hile Officer Chiba was
absorbed in watching the video,

400
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,721
Mr. Kato slowly¥moved
the clock back to the original time. right?

403
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:05,159
The living] room. clock is opposite the TV.

404
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,847
And as for the clock in the kitchen,
if ou c ose the door ou can't see a thing

406
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,132
so it ll be easy
to move the hands of the clock!

408
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:14,202
But there arc clocks
in the bedroom and the front entrance too.

410
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:17,505
Officer Chiba fell 8816(4)
in this living room last might...

413
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,509
And when he took a bath,
his change of clothes are here so.

415
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,511
The clock in the bedroom was
probably left untouched.

418
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,180
thinking that Officer Chiba
wouldn't go thoro 1nywny

420
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:28,283
Then, what about
the clock at the front entrance?

422
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,618
He can't touch the clock
at the front entrance!

424
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,054
When the courier comes
at the specified time.

427
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,523
and thot4ime on the clock Is not night.
It'll be odd!

429
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:37,425
I.] see

430
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:37,659
1.] see.

431
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,194
I'm pretty sure that
Mr. Kato made sure that...

433
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:45,733
when somebody came to the door he
would answer it. in place of Officer Chiba.

436
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,502
Come to think of it.

438
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:49,971
when we got here you...

439
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,308
Hoy, kid! Where do you have such proof .

440
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,210
Why don't you ask Officer Chiba. then?

441
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,412
W.What /!

442
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,347
Kite...

443
00:14:59,448 --> 00:14:59,914
Kato...

444
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:04,452
The clocks in this house were
UNSC Hannules carly

446
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,638
So that I wouldn't over sleep

447
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,256
b JON

448
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,427
I just went lo check, but only
the clock in the living room and the kitchen

450
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:16,998
had been returned to
the original timelby someone...

452
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,702
K,K1to
You're the only one who could've...

454
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,470
Y.You gotta be kidding!

455
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:26,274
I'm called a killer just
because your clocks were delayed!

457
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:31,245
If you suspect me, show me
proof that I killed the guy!

459
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:34,349
Oh I'm suro that
at can be found on thdway here...

461
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,783
beep!
It's been found!

463
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:36,050
Huh?!

464
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:36,985
Huh?!

465
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,269
Just now .

466
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,287
Huh?!

467
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,056
Between the scene of the crime ind here

468
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:45,259
the black.knapsackiwas
found with a weight tied on it,

470
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,577
at the bottom of thc~Teimusu River

472
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,697
Inside, it were 1 blood smeared
shirt and slacks...

474
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,934
as well as a parker smeared
with blood on the inside.

476
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:55,970
Which he seems to
have been wearing on top of shirt.

478
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,156
Moreover

479
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,907
here and there on the knapsack.

480
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:02,243
Thoro.secemaoed to be
blackencd red fingerprints

482
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:05,980
which probably got on there
when he took off his shirt

484
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:07,882
that wns splattered
with the blood of the victim...

486
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,353
And, of course, you know who
those fingerprints belong to. don't you?

488
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:16,391
Well,

489
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:21,729
it seems that thc car you rented last night
was also found at a nearby parking lot.

491
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:24,232
So we'll check it out later too...

492
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:26,200
That's a problem...

493
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:29,871
As for those red fingerprints,
I was going to wipe them off clean later.

495
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,907
That they're still all ever the car...

497
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:36,477
It was you. after all!

498
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,279
Y.You used me?!

499
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,615
You deccived me to establish your alibi...

500
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:46,154
Yeah I figured the police would believe
your testimony since you're a cop...

502
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,423
Kato. how dare you.

503
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,457
Sorry

504
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:54,629
I couldn't think of Any ether way to let out
y anger of having my girl taken away.

506
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,266
I knew that
my girl's feelings for me had waned

508
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,201
whie I was abroad on my business trip so

509
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:04,605
I wasn't 1ll that shocked when I heard that
she was getting married to Nakamoto.

511
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,408
TYR Ue Ck eta
when I went to give him a piece of my mind

513
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,261
andy was shown the letters
and postcards that I had sent.

516
00:17:10,646 --> 00:17:14,182
He had the nerve to say.
What a push over."

518
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,784
while grinning as he threw them at me...

519
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:23,156
All th stcards and unopaned leiors
What I had wiltten whalo I was abroad

521
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:26,260
So. he probably kept them from her even
before she could read them

523
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:31,232
That's what made me lose my temper:...

524
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,501
I was so furious t at I didn't even notice

525
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:37,672
all the clocks here were
set 5 minutes earlier...

528
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:42,076
the sneakers that you saw
inside the shoe cabinet?

530
00:17:42,077 --> 00:17:43,177
Yeah.

531
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,913
The seams of the shoe strings were damp.

532
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:49,283
While all the other shoes were
clean and dry...

534
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:50,918
Wouldn't you think it's strange?

535
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,188
If he washed his shoes, he would've
removed the shoo strings at least. right?

537
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:57,425
So. that's how
you figured the killer was Mr. 'Kato!

539
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,961
Hat he hastily dried his shoes with a. dryer

540
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:03,998
after he'washod the mud
from the roan off has shoes

543
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,601
right... and after that I dispatched
mvestgators to places

545
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,435
between her. and the scene of the crime

547
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:13,474
where he may have thrown
the black knapsack away...

550
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:18,079
I did it all after I confirmed that
Chiba wasn't lying to protect his friend...

552
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,116
I didn't want to think that way
but if Chiba were an accomplice.

554
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,052
They would've thrown
the stuff away somewhere farther...

556
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:26,854
What.do you moan?

557
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:31,776
Then. you suspected Officer Chiba too?

558
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,261
Yah,

559
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:34,896
A police detective is

560
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:40,168
1 crummy job where you have to
suspect even the nicest people...

562
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,805
I'll bet Officer Chiba-who is facing that

563
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,474
man in the interrogation room right now
is taking the blow right now...

565
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,077
So 10 you

566
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,846
I'll leave the roost up to you...

567
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:55,383
A. ER
Oh, yos sir... .wo'll tako tho childron homo.

570
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:02,690
I get to sit in the front seat!

571
00:19:02,691 --> 00:19:05,159
What? again?! That's not fair!

572
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,230
Genta! You should let us sit
In the passenger's seat sometimes too!

574
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,366
Come. come...don't fight and hurr inside!

576
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,102
Oka it's stone-paper-scissors!

577
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:16,771
C. Conan, coma horo ploaso!

578
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:17,972
Never mind him!

579
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:19,106
Right!

580
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,942
Police detective...

581
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,745
A police detective is a crummy job
where you have to suspect people...

583
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,184
Officer Sato. aren't you going to doubt me?
I'm. going to Tottori. you know?!

585
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,290
I might be hit on by some cute co-worker

586
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,842
If ou real! like me...

588
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,862

He! Come on. get lin.

590
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:46,868
You could at least show
a tinge of anxiety or something...

592
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,102
\ ah!

593
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:48,803
Huh?!

594
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:55,810
O.Officer Sato...

595
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:59,146
Who 1s it?! Who's the one
that played a prank like this?!

597
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,348
How terrible!

598
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,618
This is a challenge to the police!

599
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:07,255
Oh, no. that's what
Officer Sato did herself... Huh?

601
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,757
Huh?

602
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:13,394
You mean shes a bit concerned? No...

603
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:16,297
Uh...You won't, right?

604
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:21,685

Huh? Oh, of course not

606
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,143
Even if a super cute mini skirt
police woman or a sexy actress

608
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,279
comes to the station
as one day chief of police?

610
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,147
You really won't?

611
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,486
O.Officer Sato...

612
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:43,424
I'll go over there...

613
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:46,193
and become a way finer
police detective than I am now!

615
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,963
