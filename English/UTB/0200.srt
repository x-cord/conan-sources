1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:04,704
Just as flowing water has no form,
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:06,739
deductions take all shapes and sizes
In each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,641
Kogoro the suspect is in a real pinch.

6
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,676
Only a certain person can save him.

7
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,345
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,813
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult,

10
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,948
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

12
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,188
The three of us are staying
in a hotel here in Karuizawa,

14
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,324
where by mere chance,
we run into Eri Kisaki

16
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,393
who is also here with
a group of her lawyer colleagues.

18
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,394
Later that night,

19
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,497
Kogoro becomes drunk and
when he doesn't return

21
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,031
to his room, we go looking for him,

22
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,802
and discover the body of fellow lawyer
Ritsuko Usui in her locked room.

24
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,339
On top of that,
we find Kogoro asleep in that room.

26
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,677
Naturally, Kogoro is
considered the prime suspect

28
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,212
and he is taken to the station
for questioning.

30
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,415
We are left behind and.

31
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,754
Does this mean the reason you didn't go
with dad was so you could stay here to...!

33
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,088
Of course silly...

34
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,257
I've known your dad for a long time!

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,061
Sure, I wasgmad at-first

36
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:46,198
but I know better than anyone
that your dad isnitscapable of murder

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,138
iii £5)
KOGORO MOURI THE SUSPECT
PART II

41
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:58,277
I'm sorry, please tell him
I'll repay the money

43
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,144
that sounds strange

44
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:00,379
It seems hard to believe

45
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,948
but it sounds like there was a money
matter between the 2 lawyers...

47
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:08,154
I know for a fact Miss Usui, the victim,
and Mr. Hayashi have never met!

49
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,158
Besides, I hadn't even told her
about him yet,

51
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,894
so they couldn't possibly
have been making a money deal

53
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,662
I didn't think so either!

54
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,566
And Mr. Hayashi, who
would be working with her

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,503
wanted to contact her
as soon as possible

58
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,239
So he asked Mr. Shiozawa,
one of her colleagues

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,275
where she could be reached
and called her here...

62
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,711
And judging from the memo
we found in the waste basket

64
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,447
and the bell boy's statement,

65
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,118
it is certain they were
going to meet the next day at 2

67
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:43,055
But how do you
explain the note on the door?

69
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,425
I remember you...

70
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,495
I'm positive you were with
Miss Yukiko

72
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,097
when I was working on another case
in the past...

74
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:51,831
Yikes,

75
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,273
I knew I'd seen this
guy somewhere before,

77
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:01,974
He's that incompetent detective with
the Gunma Prefectural Police....!

79
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,776
He's that incompetent detective with
the Gunma Prefectural Police....!
Elji Yamamura

82
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:04,043
eiji Yamamura

83
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,845
Oh, that

84
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,913
what are you doing here, Karuizawa is

85
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,782
in Nagano prefecture, isn't it?

86
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:13,119
Yes...but this place is right on
the borderline and it's

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,520
In our jurisdiction!

89
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,357
So you've met Yukiko
and this boy before?

91
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:22,495
Yes...ll think her husband
came later though...

93
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,598
They certainly caused a lot of trouble,

94
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,233
disrupting our investigation and all!

95
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,534
Especially this kid

96
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:34,206
Oh...th, that grouchy man was guilty,
wasn t he!!!

98
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,975
Uh, yeah, I guess...

99
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,512
Detective Yamamura!

100
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,346
Huh?

101
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,253
A, are you sure about that?!

103
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,159
Madam. .l regret to have to tell you

104
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,427
but.it;seems your husband¥is:guilty...

105
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,262
Wha?!

106
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,266
Your husband's fingerprints

107
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,635
were on the telephone cord,
which was the murder weapon!

109
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,103
And on top of that.

110
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,239
We have witnesses from the bar 'stating that
your husband was drunk and making

112
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,874
advances to Miss Usut!

113
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,278
I'm almost positive
your husband is the murderer!

115
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,448
Now wait just a minute,
weren't you listening?

117
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,852
I told you there were no marks
from the cord on my husband's hands!

119
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:21,921
He s a top notch private detective!

120
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,023
In other words, he's a crime specialist.

121
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:26,358
He d know how to avoid
getting marks on: his hands

123
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,828
B., but just because he was
drunk and making advances doesn't...

125
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,699
The real motive though,
is probably his job...

127
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,304
he sees mutilated bodies
nearly every day...and he snapped,

129
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,007
he decided he wanted
to commit a murder too!!

131
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,576
Gee that's scary...

132
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,479
This is bad...

133
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,982
if we let this dummy handle the case,

134
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,218
he'll get Kogoro convicted for real

135
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,122
Listen! I found something
weird by the door!

137
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:57,623
I ER?

138
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,825
See, here, here!

140
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,532
If youaestalking about the thread, I gave
it to the officers from the crime lab

143
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,701
Thread?

144
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:09,835
IUD...

145
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,770
I found it...

146
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,374
it was about 3 centimeters long
with one end tied...

148
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,309
It was on the floor along with

149
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,946
a piece of the door chain which probably
flew off when the door was forced open

151
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,817
Then did you take a good
Iook at that piece of chain?

153
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,951
Yes, I did

154
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:30,489
I saw a strange mark on it

155
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,725
Eh? Then...

156
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,260
That's right...

157
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,028
I'm pret. sure
1 figured out the trick as:to

159
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,629
how the room was locked, but...

160
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,665
1, trick?

161
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,100
But...

162
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,436
I know ..proof...!

163
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,406
We know why the killer used the
telephone cord to commit the murder,

165
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,379
and even why the sign
was left on the door

167
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,250
we even know who the killer
is but there s no proof!!

169
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:03,088
Do you have that MD player
I bought for you?

171
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,990
Eh? Right here, but...

172
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,292
Can I borrow it?

173
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,694
I"*can'tithink straight unless!
I listen to music

175
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,266
What I can't figure out is that strange
note on the door'.

177
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,235
Hey?

178
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,871
There's no music on this disk...

179
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,739
Eh? You're kidding...

180
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,108
Oh no! You're pressing
the record button!!

182
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:23,509
Oops...

184
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,744
I'm sorry.

185
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,647
The MD player we have
in the office is only used for recording,

187
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,349
I pressed it without thinking...

189
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,383
Good grief!!

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,319
Without thinking...

191
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,988
wait a minute...

192
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,657
I'm pretty sure it was on the desk...

193
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:40,526
Im-pret. sure

194
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:42,628
yes, I'm sure...

195
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,136
Now I etit...

197
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,706
so that's why that person left that note...

198
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,543
No! You mustn't do that.

199
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,411
You shouldn't§stand on chairs
with your shoes on

201
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,281
But-l-m:hungry

202
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,582
Good grief,

203
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,451
sometimes you act like such an adult

204
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,186
but sometimes you're such a little kid

205
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,621
I can't help it, I'm starving .

206
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,123
Oh all right.

207
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,792
I'll order you something from
room service later

211
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,430
What you just said...

212
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,970
Oh, Saku...

213
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,808
How did it go?
How is he doing at the station?

215
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,876
Actually...

216
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,748
it seems Mr. Mouri was so drunk, he
doesn't know why he was in her room...

218
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,553
even the police
can't believe he's the suspect

220
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,422
so they're in a state of confusion too...

222
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,289
I OTC...

223
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,826
Ms. Kisaki, I hate to say this but

224
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,695
your husband is the only
one who could've done it.

226
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:54,733
Miss Usui's room was
Iocked from the inside!

228
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,635
And Mr Mouri was asleep in her bed...

229
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,106
There's the issue of how he killed her...

230
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,642
it would be considered
an accidental death if she died

232
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,077
as a result of say, hitting her head
against something when he pushed her

234
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,379
while he was in a drunken stupor,

235
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,249
but she was strangled to death
with a telephone cord.

237
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,084
That's first degree murder...

238
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,519
I agree...

239
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,321
he stands to face
a minimum sentence of 10 years

241
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,490
if he's charged with murder and rape...

242
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,759
at worst, it'll be a life sentence...

243
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,395
and there's always
the possibility of the death penalty...

245
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,798
Mother, how can you say that!!

246
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,401
Didn't you just say, someone else did it?!

247
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,704
Oh that. I guess I was wrong after all

248
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,274
Oh, by the way, Ms Kisaki...

249
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,542
what did you want to ask

250
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,412
Yes...there's was something
I just couldn't figure out

252
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,282
so I thought I'd get your opinion.

253
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,617
Your specialt is criminal law, isn't it?

254
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,887
So I thought you'd know
more about these things...

256
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,222
Uh huh.

257
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,192
Come on, let s go!

258
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,126
Ms. Kisaki

259
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,962
WM. mother!

260
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,634
What do think will happen to that trial...

262
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,337
You know the case she was working on,

263
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,872
the one dealing with
that pollution problem...

265
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,876
Do you think I should take over
that case then?

267
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:14,513
But unlike Ritsuko,
the issue's not what I specialize in

269
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,049
so at best, I'd probably just

270
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,484
get both parties to settle out of court...

271
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,419
oh, it's my phone,

272
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,556
sorry, but you could you go
on ahead to her room

274
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,390
Sure...

275
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,060
Let's see

276
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,827
where was her room

277
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:30,596
huh?

278
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,433
Good grief...

279
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,572
Oh, it's Mr Saku!

280
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,442
Hey? are you all alone, kid?

281
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,445
Uh huh! The police are all gone!

282
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,779
What are you doing here?

283
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,351
Oh...Ms. Kisaki said
she wanted to talk to me...

285
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,887
I bet it's about

286
00:10:54,888 --> 00:10:58,056
that short piece of thread
that we found on the floor by the door

288
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,691
along with a part of the door chain!

290
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,895
I heard her talking!

291
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,831
She said thatsyou could
use that thread from the

293
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,633
outside to make it look
Iike the door was locked!

295
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:09,301
That's ridiculous,

296
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,571
I can verify that the chain
was fastened securely, that's why

298
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,439
I had to break the door down

299
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,842
to get in

300
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,779
how can you lock the door with such
a short piece of thread...

302
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,883
What if the chain was
cut from the very beginning?

305
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,720
What if the thread was holding the

306
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,923
Ioose ends of the chain together?

307
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,659
And what if the knot and the parts

308
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,827
of the chain that
had been removed where put

310
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,430
on the floor in a spot

311
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,868
that when the door was opened, it would
be in a blind spot...

313
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,337
Well?

314
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:54,513
Yes...and after that, when the
door is opened with force,

316
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,749
the thread will break,
the chain separates

318
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,553
and all of us there
will have the illusion,

320
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,122
that the door had been
chained from the inside...

322
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,558
Isn't that right, Saku?

323
00:12:13,131 --> 00:12:15,867
You did it, didn't you, Saku...

324
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,570
1, 1 don't know what you're talking about!

325
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:23,108
Mr. Mouri was asleep in the room,
if he'd gotten up and taken the chain off

327
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,612
the whole plan would be blown...

328
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,848
That's why you used the
telephone cord to strangle her

330
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,416
So the phone wouldn't ring

331
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,918
and you took my
husband's phone away

333
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,920
from the bedside
and put it near the door

335
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:39,725
then you put:the Do Not Disturb) sign out

336
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,827
SO No one would ring the
door bell, isn't that right?

338
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,731
All that so my husband wouldn't get up...

339
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,433
But then I'm sure you put
his celluar phone near the door

341
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,037
so that we could hear it ring from the hall,

342
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,573
and that way we'd know he was inside

343
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:59,510
you knew that would make us
get the master key to get inside

345
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,481
If I hadn't called his phone then,

346
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,617
you would have, I'm sure of it

347
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:06,752
Humph...

348
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,553
Nice going Ms Kisaki.

349
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,255
What you say makes sense...

350
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,491
But it would be wiser for you

351
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:16,028
Ondo san up wn ours ee ense
and charge me for it...

353
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,996
after all, you have no proof I did it

354
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,332
and your perfect record would be ruined,
you wouldn't want that, would you...

356
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,568
You fool,

357
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,103
the only reason I have a perfect record

358
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,904
is because I've had
a streak of ood luck...

360
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:29,441
it's about time it ended anyway,
then at least the pressure would be off.

362
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,710
Unfortunately though,

363
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,378
it seems my luck is still strong.

364
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,880
Want to know why?

365
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,648
It's because you're confessing...

366
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,651
it started the moment
you stepped inside this room!

369
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,723
I'm surprised you knew
this was her room...

371
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,662
Wh, why shouldn't There's
the hayashi rice outside the door...

373
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,433
Oh my, how did you know
about the hayashi rice

375
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,170
Well, uh...

376
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:02,207
That's right the door bell
probably rang while

379
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,178
you were s 1 In e room
working on the door chain

381
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,512
after killing Ritsuko...

382
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,215
when you looked through the view hole,

383
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,117
you saw the bell boy standing there,

384
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,587
and saw the memo on the desk,
Hayashi 2

386
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:20,325
Then to prevent the bell boy
from ringing the door bell again

388
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,195
for when the bell boy would returned,

389
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,265
you wrote a note inferring that

390
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,570
the hayashi rice should be taken back
but you would pay for them

392
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:36,274
then you taped the note on the sign
and hung it on the door knob...

394
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,477
Unless you did those things,

395
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,546
there's no way for you to
know about the hayashi rice

397
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,116
It was just coincidence that I saw them...

398
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,451
I saw the bell boy standing

399
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,787
in front of her room
holding the plates and he looked upset...

401
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,890
that's how I knew this was her room...

402
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,625
I hate to tell you this.

403
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,494
But that memo you saw

404
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,730
meant she was to meet
Mr. Hayashi at 2 o'clock

406
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,871
You saw the memo on the desk along
with the open room service

408
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,639
menu and you jumped to the conclusion

409
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,008
that she meant hayashi rice...

410
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,046
Uh, uh...did I say hayashi rice...?

411
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,949
I meant to say I knew this was her room
because I looked at the room number...

413
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,851
Oh my, haven't you noticed?

415
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,925
the door chain in this room isn't cut, is it?

416
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,565
We made a sudden request
for the hotel to let us use this room...

418
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,934
her actual room is 2 doors down...

419
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,470
which means...

420
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,841
you had absolutely no reason
to enter this room,

422
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,844
unless of course,
you were the murderer...

424
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,553
Please forgive me for setting this trap...

425
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,221
but when I realized
you were the killer, I knew

427
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:58,223
I had to be convincing or
you'd never fall for it...

429
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,627
I think I understand for the first time.

430
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,630
How the prosecutors must feel
going against you in court...

432
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,168
but how are you going
to convince the prosecution?

434
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,371
You're the only one that
saw me come into this room

436
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,108
and being a part of Mr. Mouri's
family, your testimony wouldn't count...

438
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,945
Oh but I'm not the only witness

440
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,447
You're not talking about this kid, are you?

441
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,749
And I'm not the only one either!

442
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,919
Isn't that right, officers!

443
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:28,720
Eh?)

444
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,290
That's right, we saw everything!

445
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,827
Right through the view hole in the room
across the hall!

447
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,064
Isn't that right, men?!

448
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,366
Yes we got a good look!

449
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,101
A real good look...

450
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:47,205
And.we have everything
on video tape too!

452
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,778
But it was all this little guy's idea...

453
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,282
Now tell me, was the case

454
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,918
she was working on
your motive for killing her?

456
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,019
1 OO...

457
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:05,390
the village that suffered
from the pollution is where I grew up

459
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,893
I really wanted them to win the case...

460
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,963
Actually, I intended to drug her in
the doorway and after she was asleep,

462
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,665
I was going to lock the room up

463
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,501
and make it look like she
committed suicide...

465
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,037
But Mr Mouri was asleep in the room

466
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,406
and no one would believe
she would commit suicide

468
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,977
after inviting a man into her room
and then orderin room service...

471
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,615
so I decided to strangle her instead
and frame Mr Mourn. .

473
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:36,320
It would have given the judge
a bad impression if

475
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,325
the villagers killed the lawyer
so they could win the trial, wouldn't it...

477
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:45,096
I intended to settle the case out of court
quickly then turn myself in...

479
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:49,067
But even if you turned yourself in, unless
there's evidence to prove you did it...

481
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,002
Oh, but ll do...

482
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:55,106
It's that weird shaped mark left by the
pliers you used on the chain, isn't it?

486
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,210
There's only 1 pair of pliers
in the world that leave that mark...

490
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:03,682
you were going to take that
to the police, weren't you?

492
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,450
Uh, yes

493
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,721
Ritsuko only took that case because it

494
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,089
was assigned to her,
you didn't have to kill her...

496
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,160
I would never have done it if

497
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,896
she had taken the case to
support her livelihood or because she

499
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,364
considered it her job...

500
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,600
but when I learned she was
deliberately making things

502
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,368
hard for the villagers and
taking the case

504
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,171
so she could outdo you
and gain recognition, well,

506
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,739
I just couldn't let her get away it

507
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,441
To outdo me?

509
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,346
and I think she took
Mr. Mouri up to her room

511
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:35,814
for that very same reason

512
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,216
I don't believe it, it can't be true...

513
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:42,420
As lawyers, our job is to trust our clients
and defend them as best as we can,

515
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,522
but you're too trusting...

516
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,093
there's a hidden side
to every human being...

518
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,498
To be perfectly honest, I was one of the
men who was trying to get you...

520
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,001
Why, thank you...

521
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,904
But flattery's not going
to make me take your case!

523
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,873
Oh, sorry!

524
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:07,945
Boy, I wished you could've seen it!

525
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:11,216
Your wife's reconstruction of the
crime was brilliant!

527
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,884
She's Sleeping Kogords wife,
no doubt about it!

529
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,987
The Queen of the court room!
I got goose bumps watching her work!!

531
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,890
And what were YOU doing while
she was doing all the work?

533
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,293
I followed her instructions and put the
hayashi rice where it was supposed to go

535
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,096
and then I went to the room
across the hall and waited as I was told!

537
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,401
When I saw them coming down the hall,
I called your wife on her cellular,

539
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,602
and then and then,

540
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,771
when the suspect entered
the staged room,

542
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,573
fan fare went off in my head!!

543
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,377
Boy, I'm glad I became a detective!

544
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,679
And then?

545
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,579
So where IS she now?

546
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,017
Over there, see!

547
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,253
At that table over there...

548
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,858
It's dad

549
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,828
We're in luck!
Now we can get some breakfast!

551
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:58,496
Oh...

552
00:19:58,763 --> 00:19:59,664
Hold it!

554
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,108
Don't they look friendly,
this looks promising...

556
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,044
1, uh really appreciated it Erni...

557
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,712
I had faith in you...

558
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,515
I knew you would prove I was innocent...

559
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,952
And uh, by the way,

560
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,588
I'm kind of getting tired
of Ran"s cooking...

562
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,659
I guess I sort of miss your
rather strange cuisine...

564
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:28,860
What I mean is...

565
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,700
would you mind coming home now...

566
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,469
I can't take it anymore...

567
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,208
and oh,

568
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,877
since'today's our wedding anniversary...

569
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,213
I thought it'd be a good time
to get back together

571
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,716
Hey you!

572
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,983
Did you hear me?

574
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:54,285
Yeah

575
00:20:58,991 --> 00:20:59,691
What is it?

576
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,927
Uh nothing

578
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,262
Mom!!

579
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,134
Quick, tell me what
you were talking about?

581
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,938
I was just telling her that for a first rate
Iawyer, she sure was working slow

583
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:17,208
getting her dear husband
cleared of the charges...

585
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,345
Did you say dear husband,

586
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,347
it should be darn husband, shouldn't it?

587
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,714
What did you say?!

588
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,783
Well I guess you've learned your lesson,

589
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,020
you should go easy on the liquor,
you moustached, lecher!

591
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,990
Why you, you.

592
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,525
Dad!

593
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,026
Oh Ran, I nearly forgot...

594
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,329
I'm going to hang on to this disk!

595
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,064
I've gotten to like this song...

597
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,003
Well, I'll be seeing you

598
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,905
Mom!!!

599
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:47,539
Humph!

600
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,641
Don't you ever show your face again!!

601
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,776
For goodness sakes, dad,

602
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,011
you're a fool, a foo!!!

603
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:54,646
Ho hum...

Not quite yet!

655
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,725

isn't going to get you off the hook...

657
