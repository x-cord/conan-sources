A cheerful andspopular
convenience, store

6
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,391
A case arises from the back of the store

7
00:00:09,392 --> 00:00:11,143
He sees through the one and only truth,

8
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,012
A child in appearance
with the l.Q. of an adult

10
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,114
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,650
Yes, this is the Mouri

14
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,786
Oh.Conan?!

15
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,988
Where are you? It's already late.

16
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,256
What?

17
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,859
You're going to stay over
at Dr. Agasa's house tonight?

19
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:11,196
Yep. Ars cold got worse because of me

20
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:14,733
so I want to take care of her.

21
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,468
Yup.

22
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,337
But what about your change of clothes
and school things?

24
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,872
Yep! Don't worry.

25
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,807
I brought them all here

26
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,674
Besides. itss almost winter vacation.

27
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,410
May I. Ran?

28
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,612
Well.

29
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,347
Okay!

30
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,215
Take good care of her now

31
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,217
Thank you, Ran.

32
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,485
See ou.

33
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,458
You don't have to spend!'the night here
to take care of Al. Shinichi.

35
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,361
I can take care of her myself.

37
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,398
It's because there have been a lot of

38
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,001
weird people around us lately

39
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,671
I feel like something
disturbing may happen soon

Jodie?!

53
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,120
You look very tired.

54
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,926
I understand that
you may be having a tough time

56
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,595
with the bad behavior
of the brats of Japan.

58
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,396
But don't let them get to you!

59
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,464
No! No!!

60
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,800
They're all good students!

62
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,004
I'll have to say goodbye to all of you soon

63
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,139
It's so very sad.

64
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,326
What?!

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,411
Jodie. you re going to quit 7!

66
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,879
No'!

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,550
She has some family affairs to attend to.

68
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,019
So she'll be leaving us at the end
of this month to return to the US...

70
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,391
I wonder what
\er real affair as all about...

72
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,192
I wonder. 4.

73
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:20,725
Ehem.

74
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,996
Although it was only for a short time.

76
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:28,467
I really enjoyed studying
together with all of you!

78
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,937
I'm sure that you'll be going through
a lot:of things from now on too.

81
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,540
but I know that you'll all pull through!

82
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,610
So. good luck and stick it out!

83
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,280
J. Jodie.

84
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,016
Uh. Jodie.

85
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,885
Isn't it about time you tell usy

86
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,954
Tell you what?

87
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,088
The reason why you're quitting school

88
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,692
What is this family affair that
you're referring to?

90
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,028
Oh! That's a lie!

91
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:56,461
Huh?

92
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:56,828
Huh?

93
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,430
The truth is

94
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,216
I've been looking for
something for a long time

96
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,603
It's a map of a very precious treasure

97
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,204
and I finally found it.

98
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,341
Well. I think I found it!

99
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,009
A treasure map?!

100
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,213
Maybe she's talking about her first love?

101
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,783
But if so, I don't think
she'd say map because it would be

103
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,752
the treasure itself that's precious.

104
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,888
Oh, wait Jodie!

106
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,090
You're not making sense!

108
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,825
No. No! It's a secret!

110
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,361
can ee you wo.

111
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,963
A secret makes a woman a woman!

112
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,165
Okay?

113
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,168
O. Okay.

114
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,236
But, how disappointing.

115
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,373
I really wish he could've taken
your classes too.

118
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,711
Oh!-You mean Shinichi?

119
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,611
Oh. es.

120
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,280
Let him be!

121
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:48,814
What?!

122
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,818
He leaves his wife all alone saying that

123
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,088
he has cases to solve. the pits.

124
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,956
W. Wife.

125
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:02,494
I mean how long is he going to take,
to solve one case

127
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,430
Hoe should just give up and come home

128
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,299
No way. he would never.

129
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,236
He'll never run from something part way

130
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,106
Because he loves to put on airs.

132
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,176
that's the thing you
Iove. love. love about him.

134
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,311
Just totally irresistible

135
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,379
Excuse me!

136
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,116
I'm just saying that
he likes to put on airs and is stubborn...

138
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,185
W.Who cares if he comes home or not.

139
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,855
Oh! Talking about coming home,

140
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,357
did the cool kid come home?

142
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,426
What?! You mean, Conan? ,
That brat with glasses?

144
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,097
Yes! Hews always at Dr. Agasa's house
when I call recently!

146
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,300
What?
You mean he ran away from home?

148
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,035
How sassy of twine -
Next time I see him I'll.

150
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,570
No! He's taking care of Al
wince she has a cold!

152
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,237
What?!

153
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,108
He says that he's to blame
for Al catching a cold

155
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,711
so he's going to take care of her
until she recovers completely and

157
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,846
brought his change of clothes
and everything over

159
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,049
Oh.you mean that brat has a soft side too

160
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,651
Well, sorry.

162
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,854
Right!

163
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,924
Why don't we go to
your condo and have a party?!

165
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,793
What is it, all of a sudden?!

166
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,194
Party?

167
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,130
A small farewell party for you. Jodie!!

168
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:14,533
We can buy snacks
and drinks at the convenience store!

170
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,001
Sounds great!!

171
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,369
What do you say: Jodie?

172
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,270
Okay!

173
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,972
Let's go to the convenience store
in front of the station then!

175
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,208
Oh, the one that Aya is working at!

176
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,776
Ava?!

177
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,279
Was there a student by that name?

178
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,448
She's our classmate
when we were inf intermediate school!

180
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,782
She's a cheerful girl.

181
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,384
So I'm sure you'll like her too!

188
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,265
Huh?

189
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,767
Excuse" me.

190
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,234
Yes?

191
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,738
Is there a girliby the name of
Aya Nanakawa working here?

193
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:54,873
Q.Oh

194
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,943
she's inside with the shopkeeper...

196
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,277
Huh?

197
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,981
How many times do I have to tell you?!

198
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,483
Ghads .

199
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,886
During peak hours we're desperate
and needfall the help we can get

201
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,857
It seems we're just going to have to hire
someone new to take your place

203
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,658
Oh no.

204
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,926
WwW: What's wrong. Aya??

206
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,394
Aah...

207
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,829
Ran?

208
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,933
Uuugh...Ran!!

209
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:22,734
AAya?!

210
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,237
What's the matter. Aya?

211
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,372
Who are you people?

212
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,875
Friends, f-r-i-e-n-d-s!!

213
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,344
I'm a high school teacher!!

214
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,178
What seems to be the matter?

215
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,047
A lot's the matter.

216
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,150
The total sales of the store
and the number of items

218
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,485
In the store don't match!!

219
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:44,422
And this happens only
when Aya's in charge of closing the store! >

221
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,657
How rude!!!

222
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,193
And. why should Aya be blamed for it?!

223
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:51,529
Maybe one of
your customers is shoplifting?!

225
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,834
Aya tells me that this shop is
crowded in the mornings and at nights.

227
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,068
SO maybe then.

228
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:57,601
Yeah.

229
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,105
I thought so too,

230
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,574
that's why I set up surveillance cameras.

231
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,176
when this shop was renovated!!

232
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,213
I kept very close watch,

233
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,048
but there was no such customer.

234
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,651
Then, maybe it was a burglar?

235
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,486
I thought of that too! That's why

236
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,123
Iast night,
I parked my car opposite the store

238
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,891
and kept watch right through!

239
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:23,028
But, all I saw was Aya
who came out after cleaning the store

241
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,130
and closing:the shutter.

242
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,066
Nobody Came to-the store from then

243
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,401
to the following morning
when the store was opened

245
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,904
When I opened the shop
and checkedrthe storeroom

247
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,838
the figures didn't match.

248
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,907
The only thing thinkable is that Aya stole.

249
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,577
1.1 didn't steal anything!!

250
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,844
By the way,

251
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,747
what was stolen?

252
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,416
A lot of things.

253
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,635
Game software: DVDs~CDs

254
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,255
Iunch boxes and riceballs,
mineral water--Oolong tea

256
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,725
Cokes and snacks including chocolate...

257
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,995
I can just see young kids gather around,
playing music

259
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:01,499
and games, watching DVDs
and catching their thrills!

261
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,438
But. if Aya were the one,

262
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,940
wouldn't Aya be displayed
on the surveillance camera?

264
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,211
The surveil ance cameras are
set to go, off at closing.

266
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,748
Because the electric bills aren't
all-that cheap either.

268
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,984
Then, the light here is turned off
because of that?

270
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:22,053
Well, I'm trying to.economize to

271
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,189
regain what fl can. of my losses.

272
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,292
Besides the customers who come to use
the restroom are all regular customers.

274
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,294
So they can find the
restroom: even if it's dark.

276
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:30,695
Uh, Aya,

277
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,731
have you noticed anyone
who looks suspicious .«m

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,367
N.No.

280
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,469
I wouldn't say suspicioussbut

281
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:40,672
There are three customers that
I'm concerned about.

283
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,306
Huh?

284
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,907
Is something bothering you?

285
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,743
What type of people are they?

286
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,279
They all come to use the toilet a lot.

287
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:49,880
Tell us more about it!

288
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,016
Oh: Uh-huh.

289
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,085
One looks to be a university student

290
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,056
and occasionally stands and reads
game magazines until almost closing time

292
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,991
A game freak.

293
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:03,862
But. he never bought any_games_here

294
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,731
All he buys are cup noodles
and pouched food ¥

296
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,601
Besides. he's pretty selfish,

297
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,604
and cuts in line at the register.

299
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,741
The second one is a man
who looks to be a salaried worker

301
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,194
He seems to be very timid and is
overly hesitant over even thing

303
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,779
Overly hesitant?

304
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,649
Yes. he's always looking.down

305
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,252
Even when the university student
I mentioned earlier cuts in line.

307
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,120
He lets him do so without getting angry.

308
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,189
Even when using the restroom,

309
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,391
he lets everybody go on before him
saying that he's not in a rush.

311
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,829
He always buys things
Iike a toothbrush set. batteries.

313
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,098
Shaving razor sets and towels.

314
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,201
All things you would
take along when traveling.

316
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,639
The third one is a stubborn
and thrifty old woman.

318
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,742
Yeah. I know that old lady too!

320
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,946
She asks for discounts-on-lunches
that are almost past the expiration date.

322
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:59,284
She lectures telling us'to compare prices
with other stores and to stay-on our balls.

324
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,854
But that old woman's not a bad person!

325
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,058
She turns off unneeded lights,
and-also told me what temperature

327
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:12,029
I should set the air conditioning at,
to save money.

329
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:13,565
Well,

330
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,635
she talks all she wants with us
and leaves without buying a thing. though.

333
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,539
which makes all three of them suspicious.

334
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:22,373
Why?

335
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,641
Why do you say that?

336
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,143
Because

337
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,846
it could be that the game freak wanted

338
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,148
the game software that he couldn't buy.

339
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,834
The salaried worker may
Iike to go on trips

341
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,419
and maybe wants snacks
to take along with him.

343
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,921
And. the granny could've been ¥
checking'out which / lunch.

345
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,058
Shc: wanted to eat
without buying anything.

347
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,628
All three of them have
a possibility of being the culprit -

349
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:44,529
Phooey.

350
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,165
I think that it's more appropriate
to suspect Aya

352
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,801
before suspecting the customers.

354
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,339
I've been trying to tell you
that Aya's not that type of girl!

356
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,274
Give me an explanation then,

357
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,177
of why after scolding Aya last month
about the same thing

359
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,746
the items stopped missing!!

360
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,747
Huh?

361
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,848
Really?

362
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:04,983
Yeah.

363
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,219
Since the items stopped missing
for a month now

365
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,507
I was determined to stop watching
the store.after closing last. night.

367
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,994
I figured that Aya finally repented
what she did.

369
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,428
But. when I opened.the store this morning

370
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,231
a lot of things were missing again.

371
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:23,701
She probably. couldn't
stop herself any longer!

374
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,807
If you apologize for what you did,
up to toda

376
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,308
I'll let you-go this time! If not you-re fired!

377
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,776
He . Ran

378
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,611
things look really bad!

379
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,480
Right!

380
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,082
Why don't you talk about this to Shinichi?!

381
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,918
He can probably solve something
Iike this in no time at all.

383
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,721
But. I don't have his phone number

384
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,957
His number is never displayed.

385
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,558
How about you. Sonoko.

386
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,093
No inspiration at all?

387
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:52,430
If I was inspired I wouldn't be saying
things like this, would 1? Aha.

389
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,233
Maybe we can ask Conan?

390
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,436
He always comes up with interesting
ideas and.notices odd things!

392
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,005
0,0 guws s@oooooAhap ha;

393
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:03,207
although it irks me

394
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,944
to ask that glasses kid. a bit.

395
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,013
Uh. he's at Dr. Agésas house so.

398
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,717
Jodie?

399
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,219
Shhh

400
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,220
Huh?

401
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,189
It's not good relying on somebody

402
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,459
without trying all we can ourselves first!

403
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,330
Let's try to work things out
for her ourselves.

405
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,865
B.But.

406
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,701
I really haven't stole anything!

407
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,269
You still insist.

408
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:38,243
You never know when you will loose
the one you can rely on so.

410
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:44,716
SundayMart

411
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,384
SundayMart
Be.honest with me, will you!

413
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,586
You're the one who did it. right?

414
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,738
Y.You've got me wrong, shopkeeper!

415
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:54,576
I haven't stolen anything from the store!

416
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,963
I'm sure Conan would be able to
come up with something but

418
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,533
Are you sure that
I shouldn't call him. Jodie?

420
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,068
Yes, yes, I'm sure

421
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,472
The-cool Kid is busy looking after Ai!

422
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,574
We shouldn't bother him!

423
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,844
I.I guess so. but.

424
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,813
But ..if we leave Aya as is

426
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:17,782
Huh?

427
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,183
She'll be fine!

428
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,953
We don't have to rely on that kid!

429
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,322
1. the Queen of deduction Sonoko will

430
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,990
solve this case without his help!

431
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:26,457
Oh?!

432
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,926
RR. Right...

433
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:28,726
Oh?!

434
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,229
First, let's organize what went on.

435
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,298
The total sales of this convenience store.

436
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,800
And the number of items.in the. storeroom
for some reason don't match.

438
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,937
And the items start
missing for some reason

440
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,674
Aya is in charge.of cleaning the store
and closing the shop.

442
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,342
Therefore, it's only natural
that the shopkeeper suspects

444
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,377
Aya of having stolen the items.

445
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:47,946
But. we've known Aya

446
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,914
since intermediate school
and know that she's a good girl.

448
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,651
So, we think there's another culprit
and begin investigation.

450
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,653
Everything's okay up to here, right?

452
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,421
tight.

453
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,625
What concerns me are the three
customers that Aya referred to.

455
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,096
One is the university student
type game freak.

457
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:09,634
The other is the timid
and hesitant salaried worker type man.

459
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,086
And the last one is

460
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,706
a stubborn granny.

461
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:19,677
Each of them buys
different things such as

463
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:24,549
The game freak buys only cup noodles
and;pouched food.

465
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,552
The salaried worker buys
toothbrush sets, batteries,

467
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,437
shaving razor sets and-towels.

468
00:16:29,438 --> 00:16:31,489
They were all things
that one would take on trips.

470
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,324
The granny buys nothing!

471
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,294
All she used to do was talk to
the personnel of the store

473
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,879
and buy nothing!

474
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,734
All three of them seem suspicious
and yet it could be otherwise.

476
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,903
Maybe it's just that somebody shoplifted
or the store was robbed. after all?

478
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,805
I think that's impossible!

479
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:48,940
The shopkeeper,

480
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,142
had surveillance cameras set up
you know?!

482
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,945
No chance for burglars.

483
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,380
No can do!

484
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,248
The problem is,

485
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,752
when she was scolded by the shopkeeper
after he suspected her,

487
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,921
the items stopped missing.

488
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,957
And yesterday, a month after that,

489
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,725
again on the day that she is in charge,

490
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,328
a large amount
of things were stolen again!

492
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,997
C.Come to think of it, Aya

493
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,666
You like snacks and juice, don't you.

494
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,568
You used to be hooked on games too.

495
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,137
Hey!

496
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,939
We're trying to prove. Aya's innocence.
Aren't we?

498
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,775
I. Know.

499
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,493
Think what he would think

500
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:26,878
at times like this.

501
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,079
What would Shinichi think.

502
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:29,747
What would he think.

503
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,418
The point is the discrepanciessyou find
when compared with the usual situation.

505
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,685
Whenever a case occurs,

506
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:36,854
something is different from the usual.

507
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,992
First observe very closely
ance pimMpoinNn "waa 11s.

509
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,228
No matter if it's something
that anyone would do

511
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,497
or something that's so trivial
and apt te occur.

513
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,866
If it's different frem the usual,
It's a great problem!

515
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,402
Those more than usual
and plain things are

517
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,304
the most worth noticing as different.

518
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,606
Something different from: the usual.

519
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,641
I see

520
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,011
so If the items only start missing
when Aya's in charge.

522
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,450
Huh?

523
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:09,287
B.But, all I do is clean the store.

524
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,223
Is there anything you noticed,
shopkeeper?

526
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,425
N.No, not really.

527
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,961
Anything, no matter
how trivial it may seem!

529
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,163
Huh?

531
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:19,997
It's nothing much, but.

532
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,499
It's nothing much, but

533
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,201
What is it?

534
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,069
When Ava i1ssln charge

536
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,305
The inside of the store is-especially clean!

537
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:28,606
See.

538
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,008
The boxes with the items inside
that arrived just

540
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,327
before closing are all in order!

541
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,048
The other employees and I leave
organizing the boxes to the employees

543
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,751
who come in the morning and go home.

544
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,620
It's the same with you too,
isnrt it, shopkeeper?

546
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,688
Phooey.

547
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,524
She probably did it to rid herself
of her guilty conscience,

549
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,392
but I won't be deceived.

550
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,927
O.Oh no.

551
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,030
Even for the lunches.

552
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:56,300
She probably thought it was okay

553
00:18:56,734 --> 00:19:00,204
because all of them were
near the expiration date.

555
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,140
But a thief's a thief!

556
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,643
I could go ahead and call the: police
and have them investigate: you"know!

560
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:07,845
The police .

561
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:08,445
Huh?!

562
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,082
Aaagh

563
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:12,950
Then what is it?

564
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,386
Are you people going to figure out
what's going on?

566
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,156
And capture the real culpri...Huh?

567
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,694
A.Agh.

568
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,270
Shinichi...

569
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,022
Shinichi

570
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,824
Shinichi!!

571
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:54,559
Huh?

572
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,227
Ran?!

573
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,630
Just my imagination, I guess.

574
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,709
Hey. Shinichi!

575
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,294
Where were you?

576
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,680
Nowhere special

577
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:19,350
Huh?

578
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,086
Ail doesn't seem to be around?

579
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:26,224
Oh, Ail is In her room.

580
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,791
Hey. hey.

581
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,560
She's still not all that well, is she?

582
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,895
She's fine!

583
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,297
The heater is on,

584
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,601
and besides; I thought it best
to leave her alone.

586
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,872
She's probably listening to
thatstape again.

588
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,476
Shiho...

589
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,512

Wow.

00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,086
Look at the people at the cash register!

609
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,254
Oh my.

610
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,957

Yes really

614
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,264
Even the restroom's starting
to get crowded.

616
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,334
Come to think of it, Aya was saying

617
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,771
that the suspicious three customers
used to use the restroom a lot.

619
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:47,738
Yep.

620
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,008
We'll get back to this after
we take care of all these customers.

622
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,077
Go back to the cash register. will you.

623
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,245
YO, Sli

If you two have no intention of buying
anything. go on outside. will you?

626
00:21:59,084 --> 00:21:59,850
B.But.

627
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,685
You're interfering with business!

628
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:02,687
Go on...

629
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,055
There, there, there you go!

Agh., w, wait.

631
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,758
If.If we leave things as is

632
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:09,643
Aya will be

633
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:12,029

00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:15,533
