00:00:00,831 --> 00:00:01,664
Liar...

2
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:03,532
Thief...

4
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:15,277
S.Sonoko...?

5
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:20,049
All the programs for today have ended.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,785
Thank you very much
for your patronage

8
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:23,152
Sigh

9
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:23,519
Sigh

10
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:26,989
W.What's the matter, Sonoko...?

11
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,659
You're the one who wanted to
come watch this thief movie, right?

15
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:35,030
Part 1 was really good so I expected

16
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,333
this one to be even better...

17
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:40,953
But, they're just doing
the same thing over again?!

19
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:43,005
Talk about a meaningless Part 2!

21
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:44,774
O.Oh I see

23
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:47,209
I kind of enjoyed) it

24
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,911
Kind of isn't good enough!!

25
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:52,114
Well,
most second editions are like that.

27
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,852
How I wish that somewhere,
an incident

30
00:00:56,853 --> 00:01:00,856
so incredible would make my heart
beat so badly that it would

33
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:04,126
erase all the sounds around me!!

34
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:05,827
S.Sonoko...

35
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:06,162

Today's suspect is Kaito Kid.

39
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:38,160
Even if you fool everyone's eyes,
the jewels and dreams will be protected

41
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:39,728
He sees through the one and only truth,

42
00:01:39,763 --> 00:01:41,664
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

44
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:43,732
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

46
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:59,548

00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:16,211
Was this statue here from before?

139
00:05:16,212 --> 00:05:18,047
Yeah, it's

140
00:05:18,048 --> 00:05:22,651
the Golden Goddess that was decorated
on the bow of the Sea Goddess

142
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:29,058
during the Grand Navigation Era
when the pirates used to raid ships!

144
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,460
That thing that she is holding
up in her right hand is

146
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,862
the legendary aquamarine,
which is said to have turned

148
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:36,665
Into a gemstone fiom
the tears of a mermaid

150
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,600

event disasters at sea

the miracle of the ocean

It is valued very highly
as an artistic work

164
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:49,611
and I had a hell of
a time bidding it off.

166
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,680
I finally got hold of it last week...

167
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:53,082
Then,

168
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,451
don't tell me that this is the bait
that you mentioned just a while ago...

170
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,752
Exactly.

171
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:57,953
This is the bait

172
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:00,289

00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,394
In.Inspector!?
Not softly!

279
00:08:52,395 --> 00:08:54,596
Strongly. like this!!

280
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:56,265
Firm and tight...

281
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,866
Understand!

282
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:02,053
Inspector Nakamori...
IS really into this...

284
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:04,539
rr ns os I

285
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,407
Huh 2!

286
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:07,476
So. Sonoko!!

287
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,877
Aha, ha. ha

289
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:12,681
ta flashy appearance....r

290
00:09:14,117 --> 00:09:15,417
Hey! Hey!

291
00:09:15,418 --> 00:09:17,419
Did Thief Kid appear already?

292
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,955
Nope...not yet...

293
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:26,395
This man with the slight
mustache is Ran's father.

295
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:27,896
The Sleeping Kogoro!!

296
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:29,231
S.Slight mustache!

297
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,567
I've heard a lot of rumors about you...

298
00:09:32,568 --> 00:09:35,202
OO. Oh is that so...

299
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:36,872
ey!! Are you the one...'?

300
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:39,675
Who started this riot to begin with?!

301
00:09:39,676 --> 00:09:40,542
What?!

302
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:43,178
Do something about
your helicopters up there!!

304
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:48,216
They're in getting in the way
of the police choppers!!

306
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:50,885
There's no need for
police choppers is there?

308
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:54,089
The Thief Kid announced he was
going to walk over here after all!

310
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,356
Huh

311
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:58,760
Then why do you have sO many
helicopters up there like that?!

313
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:02,497
Those helicopters are up there
to film my autobiography!

315
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,567
F.Film an autobiography!

316
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:09,688
WwW, Wow

317
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,308
It's like a outside broadcast
van of the TV station...

319
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,777
The helicopters aren't
the only ones shooting the film

321
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:19,598
All the images that are filmed by
the cameras that are set in 100 places

323
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,950
all over the museum
can be viewed here!!

325
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:23,685
H.Hey!! Hey!!

326
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,687
There's nobody inside the museum!!

327
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:27,089
What?!

328
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,758
There were too many up to now!

329
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,159
Since there's nobody there,
even if he were to

331
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,695
disguise himself and sneak in there.

332
00:10:33,696 --> 00:10:35,430
It would be plain for all to see right?

333
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:38,700
Since it's possible to open and
Iock all the doors

335
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:40,836
of the museum from here

336
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:44,906
even If he were to get to the roof
where the Golden Goddess is

338
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:47,509
the most that he'll end up
doing us get locked up...

340
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:49,444
That is

341
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:52,581
if he shows uprjust
as he said he would!!

343
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:55,117
Gah, ha, ha. ha...

344
00:10:55,118 --> 00:10:56,118
Ont!
Huh! ?

346
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,519
I think he's here...

347
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,587
What?!

348
00:10:58,588 --> 00:11:00,789
W Where?

349
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,723
Oh!!

350
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:03,058
Huh 2!

351
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:06,595
Can't we get a larger view?!"

352
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:08,930
Over here!! Right here!!

353
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:10,599
H.Hurry it up!!

354
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,733
Y.Yes: sir!!

357
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:21,976
So, he's appeared...

358
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,213
Thief Thief Kid!!

359
00:11:25,982 --> 00:11:27,616
Hey!! Which one is it?!
Kyaaah!!

361
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:28,884
Which helicopter
My darling Thief Kid

363
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,752
Is the image coming from?!
He came, he came to see me

365
00:11:30,753 --> 00:11:32,487
Which helicopter is shooting the film?!
I tell you, Sonoko...

367
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:36,658
SIE rt rultt eimai nprisc ui,
I think

369
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,528
B.Behind the museum?!

370
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:40,395
Okay!!

371
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:41,396
In the back!

372
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:43,865
Oh!! C,Conan?!

373
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:44,132
Oh! C, Conan?!

374
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,500
W.What shall we do?

375
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:47,536
Shall we move the Golden Goddess
inside using that device,

377
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:49,404
just In case.

378
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:51,540
Come on!! Cool it!

379
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,810
He's just checking the place out
tonight...He won't steal it yet!!

381
00:11:54,811 --> 00:11:57,879
Besides. he announced
he'd come on foot...

383
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,281
Hey!!

384
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,049
"Hey, 'haven. "

385
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,250
Outta the way!!

386
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,786
Let's watch how the

387
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,988
great thief, thexso=called illusionist
under the moonlight

389
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:08,924
will make his appearance...

390
00:12:14,096 --> 00:12:15,130
H.Hey!!...

391
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,516
W. Where is the Thief Kid?!

392
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:18,900
Well,

393
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:21,670
after he went across between
the buildings...he hasn't come out...

395
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:25,407
Come on out... Thief Kid!!

396
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,210
You can't walk unless you
come down on the ground.

398
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,047
Come on out... Thief Kid!

399
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:34,082
Huh

400
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:51,500
W.What the?!

402
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,908
N.No way~! No way

403
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:04,212
Wow~~~!Darling Thief-Kid.
He's floating in air.

405
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:05,380
Fantastic!!

406
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:12,988
No way! That can't be!

407
00:13:12,989 --> 00:13:15,856
A human being defying gravity

408
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:21,246
and floating in the air is impossible!

409
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,175
Don't be deceived!! This is a trick!!

410
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:35,560
Thief Kid is

411
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,946
just riding a black
blimp or something

413
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:40,582
with his body suspended
Nn air with a wire!!

415
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:45,053
Any helicopters that are nearby,
film his head and confirm!!!

417
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:51,860
C.chopper # 7 here. There's nothing
above Thief Kid's head...

419
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:52,861
WwW. What?!

420
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:55,497
Thief Kid sure is amazing.

421
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:56,798
Don't you think.so...Ran?

422
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,133
Y.Yeah...

423
00:13:58,134 --> 00:13:59,935
Nugh. nugh...

424
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:03,939
Chopper #7 here!
What shall we do?

426
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,540
Don't move fromuthere for a while...

427
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,741
Roger!

428
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:08,009
Nugh. nugh...

429
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,145
That Thief Kid, just what kind of
trick is he using anyway.

431
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:12,880
There's no way he can float like that.
Look for the rope.

433
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:16,751
Fuh, fun, fun.

434
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:20,021
Already making such a big fuss.
The show's just begun.

436
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:22,023
If he's not up there...

437
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,091
The side?!

438
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:24,092
I get it!

439
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:25,760
The wire is hooked on to the
buildings on both sides

441
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,228
and he's suspending
himself with it!!

443
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:29,297
Okay
Il go to the building on the left.

445
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:32,534
SO you go to the one on the right
and look for the wire on the roof!!

447
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:34,002
Y Yes sir!

448
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,670
Darn!!

449
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,005
That Thief Kid!!

450
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:39,207
How dare he play around
* - my e-

453
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:45,480
Phooey. it's nothing more than magic,
plain illusion...

455
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,882
Just you wait, Thief Kid...

456
00:14:47,883 --> 00:14:50,018
All I have to do is see
through your trick...

460
00:14:50,753 --> 00:14:51,886
N.Nothing?!

461
00:14:51,887 --> 00:14:54,856
There's no wire anywhere?!

462
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,093
There's nothing 'here!!
T.There's no wire anywhere...

464
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:02,764
Inspector Nakamori!! There's nothing
on this side of the building either...

466
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:03,965
It can't be?!

467
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,368
Then how the hell is he up there...?

468
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:08,236
How is he floating in air...?!

469
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:09,604
E-hem!

470
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,343
Ladies
an... er emen...

472
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:18,913
Wow!

473
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:22,951
So. on this day before my actual
feat will be carried out,

475
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:26,354
please watch to your heart's content
the miracle that my legs will perform...

478
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:31,559
He's walking!

479
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:35,764
Huh 2!
H.He's walking...?

481
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:40,702
WwW. Wow. he's walking.

482
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:48,243
This is chopper #3, Thief Kid is
still walking in air...

484
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:50,578
It can't be...
What kind of trick is he using anyway...

486
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:03,124
Huh-21 H Hey.

487
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,327
My darling Thief Kid is walking!!!

488
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:07,462
WwW. Wow...

489
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:11,533
I see, so that's what he meant by
he'll come on foot to get his target...

491
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:15,236
Detective Mouri, never mind that,
but please tell me.

493
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:19,474
How is he performing this feat
that goes against all laws of nature...

495
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:20,775
This is chopper #3.

496
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:23,545
Thief Kid is now walking over
the skies of Shiodome Park...

498
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:26,214
If he goes on as is.

499
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:28,550
He will reach the roof of
the Suzuki Museum where

501
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:30,385
Blue Wonder is
in less than a minute...

503
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:41,129
Aaaah...

504
00:16:41,664 --> 00:16:45,667
Thief Kid will reach
the Blue Wonder in a few seconds...

506
00:16:47,036 --> 00:16:48,536
U.Uncle...

507
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,575
You mean we can't do a thing
but just watch him steal

509
00:16:53,576 --> 00:16:55,610
the stuff right before our eyes?
That Thief Kid...

511
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:58,012
How is he planning to flee,

512
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:01,483
when there are police officers on
the ground and choppers in the air...

514
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:02,751
Advisor,

515
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:05,553
don't you think it's time
we start the device?!

517
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:08,623
We've got no choice...

520
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:24,072
0. this will be all for the show
the night before...

522
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:28,309
I will see you again tomorrow night
at 20:00 at the same place...

524
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,847
Darn!

525
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:35,567
Didn't I tell you?!

526
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,319
That you're going to be sorry if you
underestimate Thief Kid!!

528
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,456
Nah- Iiwon'tilet him steal it...

529
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:44,993
Because I went all Over the world
to look for it and finally got hold of

531
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:48,496
the "Miracle of the Ocean
Blue Wonder...

533
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:52,967
Why is the Golden statue inside
and moreover, upside down...?

535
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:55,370
This is how it's rigged...

536
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,295
fl SEQ,

537
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:08,650
It rotates so the real one is
exchanged for the fake!

539
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:09,651
Phooey...

540
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:12,387
Thief Kid will see through a childish
thing like this right away...

542
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:16,257
Of course I don't intend to:deceive
him with something like this...

544
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:19,727
If so, leave everything to
the police tomorrow

547
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:23,264
And keep your helicopters from flying.
Stay put and stay still

549
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:24,899
m doing just-the. opposite...

550
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,301
The opposite?

551
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:30,637
He vanished saying let's meet at
the same place tomorrow night...

553
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:33,174
If he so wishes, I will do exactly
that and ambush him!

555
00:18:34,276 --> 00:18:37,045
Uh...what do you mean
by ambush him?

557
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:40,748
I'm going to rent practically all
the buildings in this area and...

559
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:42,750
be prepared for him with
a helicopter squad

561
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:44,652
and security guard unit even
greater than tonight's!!

563
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:47,856
I don't know what kind of trick he's
using to walk floating in air but...

565
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:49,791
If he dares come out again

566
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:50,525
I'm going to nab him

567
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:53,461
and add him on to the final episode
of my autobiography.

569
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:54,596
Whaaa?!

570
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:54,829
Huh?!

571
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,597
Huh 2!

572
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:57,165
D.Don't, move!!

573
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,499
Don't move!!

574
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,567
Stay still!

575
00:18:59,568 --> 00:19:01,169
Kugh kugh. kugh

576
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,304
WwW. What's happened?

577
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:05,139
Never mind and just don't move!

578
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,043
If yo move you'll never
walk before me again!!

580
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:11,312
W,Where...Where.is it?

581
00:19:11,313 --> 00:19:12,512
Don't you dare:move.

582
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,214
Bow -wow

583
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:15,383
Whaaa!!

584
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:19,704
Oh, there it is!!

585
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:21,456
W. What's with this dog?!
Woof

587
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:23,992
Just as expected of Lupin

588
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:26,794
He will never let a prey
that he is after go...

590
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:28,096
Woof woof.

591
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:29,264
Contacts?

592
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:32,400
I didn't know your eyes were bad,
Uncle Jirokichi?

594
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:34,669
Well, at 72 years,

595
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,206
all parts of my body are refusing
to work the way they should...

597
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,408
Your body seems to be
working just fine...

599
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:43,611
I would at least like to nab him
while I'm still alive and kicking

601
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:46,881
What makes you want to pursue
Thief Kid as much as you do...?!

603
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:47,882
Kid,

604
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:49,150
Thief Kid.

605
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:50,685
The sound of that name itself.

606
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:53,354
The one who stole everything from me,
that Thief Kid...

608
00:19:53,355 --> 00:19:55,456
I'll never forgive him...

609
00:19:55,491 --> 00:19:56,758
Listen,

610
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:01,496
I, Jirokichi Suzuki will nab him!! I wonst
Iet anyone get in my way!!

612
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:03,698
I won't:let your have your way.

613
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:08,236
Kid, just you watch!!
I promise, I swear...

615
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:13,174
the many honorary; gifts and
awards-l have won so far...

617
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:16,778
They veralways covered
the headlines of the papers!

619
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,047
All except for one time...

620
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:20,714
D.Don't tell me that's
why you're going after him .

622
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:21,649
Yes, exactly!!

623
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,851
That Thief Kid not only stole
the headline from me

625
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,503
he also stole
the 2nd page from me!!

627
00:20:25,504 --> 00:20:28,489
My article of having flown
the world over on a manned plane

629
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,092
was pushed over to a corner on
the 3rd page because of him!

631
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,127
Do you understand
how humiliated I felt!!

633
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:36,130
Can you understand how sad I felt!!

634
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:37,999
A bit, I guess...

635
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,268
When I do get my hands on him...

636
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:44,539
I. Suzuki Jirokichi will be once again
be the center of all media attention!

638
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,275
Aha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
Ha ha ha...
