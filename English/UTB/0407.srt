Alright. So why were you in this house?

135
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:29,061
We met three magicians at the magic show

137
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,729
and they invited us to their master's house.

139
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,097
which is here And then

140
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,434
ne of them happened to
be murdered b somebod

YX Dooy

143
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,004
the lady who was murdered
was Also a magician. 2

145
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,173
Her name 1s Tenko Hymemia,

146
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,576
She was pretty famous outside Japan.

147
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,812
We were just planningsto

148
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,213
have a collaboration magie, show
all the three of us together

150
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,450
But I never thought
it was gonna be like this...

152
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,152
Ok. So who found her first?

153
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,220
Ne em TO - = ay
Me. and

155
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,487
those ladiesover there...

156
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,525
Dinner was ready

157
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,260
so we went to call, enko...

158
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:03,929
This Is her sensei's room.

159
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,797
E thought she might be here...

160
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,566
When we came up here,

161
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:11,002
there was nothingilin the hallway: at first

162
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,438
But when ll turned on the light
since: it. was dark

164
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,006
the breaker went down

165
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,109
and after the light turned back on...

166
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,879
Tenko was lying at the end of this hallway,
just over there...

168
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,481
I see...

169
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:26,218
The fact that this hallway was dark
was part of this homicide plan

171
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,519
I think.

172
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,687
The Killer loosened!
The light bulb beforehand...

175
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,459
he/she will turn on the light *
and cause a blackout.

177
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,097
I found out some work was done on this
Ch GO Ao or Yee Clie

179
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:44,802
Beside the dead body is the reference
room where the important file was stored.

181
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:47,439
And there is no window in that room
which people can go in and out of

183
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,640
One more thing,

184
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:52,076
the window In Mr. Masakage's room
was left open...

186
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:56,748
Considereing all this, it is likely that
the person manipulated the switeh

188
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,717
so he/she can safely stew!
Masakage's notes and runway.

190
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,119
To runaway.

191
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,387
That's right...

192
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,555
the breaker has goes down...

193
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,491
Somebody has to reset the breaker on the
first floor. right?

195
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,962
While somebody is downstairs,

196
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,064
the murderer:jumps out of the window

197
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,233
of Mr. Masakage's room and runs away...

198
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:20,172
But it didn't go like the murdercr planned.

But then. Kazuh1 and the others came up
to call for Tenko.¥

213
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:48,900
Fortunately for him, this time the breaker
had gone down.

215
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,736

there 1s one possible suspect among us.

Among us

234
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,939
It's the person who caused the blackout.

235
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,124
It is. Mr nshlkawa!

236
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,292
What?

237
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,728
You were here during the blackout

238
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,866
It wasn't that hard for you to move Tenko
from the reference room to the hallway

240
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,804
then to go back to where the girls were
before the lights turned back on. right?

242
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,105
That's impossible! I think.

243
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,473
Right?

244
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,541
Yeah,...

245
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,877
Because

246
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:36,248
We were holding Mr. Hoshikawa
while the power was out.

248
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,683
Holding him!?
Gosh!

250
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,085
Why?

251
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,487
What do you-mean why

252
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,755
Because it was-dark and scary...

253
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,558
Are you sure

254
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:47,676
it was this guy?

255
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,095
Yes I am!

256
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,666
I was

259
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,302
holding Mr. Hoshikawa's arm like this...

00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,754
nd I was holding.Kasuha hike this...

261

See? Mr. Hoshikawa couldn~t do it!

262
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,545
It's just like the case of Doctor Nude

263
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:06,912
isn't it. Conan!?

264
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:07,312
Isn't it. Conan!?

265
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:07,846
Isn't it. Con:an!?

266
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,047
Yeah...

267
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,248
Talk about nuts!

268
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,284
Mean it was just 1 mere blackout,
and god you're not a kid anymore. either!

270
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,254
Ell Hew. They're gels
They couldn't help it

272
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,056
Huh!? What's with you?!

273
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,528
By the way,
Wor WR YO) ehiding) 2) Talker wit

275
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,832
I was taking a nap in the reem
right below thé bookroom.

277
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:33,404
I went mm ms roam to wake him up
That was when the power went out.

279
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:37,008
Ok, then there's no way
you guys murdercd the vietim.

281
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,844
0, RUIN
that the murderer was-an outsider.

283
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,481
Anyway, could you tell us
more about that important file?

285
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:50,055
It's my husband, Mr. Masak1gc's notes
and it is filled ideas on his original tricks.

287
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,723
Oh! I rcmomber

288
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,993
I used to watch Mr Masakago's
Show on 'V when I was a kid!

290
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:59,798
His magic included beautifu assistants
and fantastic illusions!

292
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,771
God. I still remember it! Ha ha ha...

293
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,141
Actually. I was his assistant.

294
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,409
(OANN@ AAO SAO (XXX Vv

295
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,446
Then, where 1s he now?

296
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,816
Somebody told me ho disappeared...

297
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,783
Oh. Is that true?

299
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,320
cs. It was teday 10 years ago...

300
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,690
He used to go on outings suddenly
without notice

302
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,326
So I wasn't really wor red at first.

303
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,327
Half a year past but he nover came back.

305
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:35,367
Hoshikawa, Handa and Taonko were living
here. since they were live-in students

308
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,969
But they left and became independent.

309
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,473
So this 1s actually our reunion
for the first time ing10 years.

311
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,376
So you're the one who called everybody...

312
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,409
Actually...

314
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,444
It was me...

315
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,712
I told them to coma hero

316
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,748
mii he
SO that we oculd discuss
the collaborative magic show together.

320
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,385
Well, I used to come hereon thissd to,
every year

322
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,454
and stay to cat Mrs. Masakage's meal

323
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:01,426
Alnght. Wns there anybody
who hated or held a grudge on

325
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,927
Mr. Masakage...?

326
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:03,827
Huh?

327
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,999
According to Hatteri's deduction,

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,369
Ws likely that the murderer know
that Mrs. Masakage is living alone.

330
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,875
As well as being knowledgeable about
the layout of the room and such...

332
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,175
as well as being knowledgeable about
the layout of the room and such...

334
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:21,613
Mr. Masakage's notes would've been
worth quite a price. I would figure...

336
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,615
Would somebody who would've been

337
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,817
interested in getting 1 hold of it,
ever have come by here?

339
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,019
But sensei is not the kind of person

340
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,789
anyone would want to
hold a grudge agaist...

342
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,823
Actually.

343
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,426
There was a man...

344
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,363
Who visited here many times, ww
saying that he wanted to see my husband...

346
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:43,068
I just thought he was one of his fans,
sO. let him in.

348
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,836
But as soon as he went
Into my husband's room...

350
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,438
He started yelling.

351
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,873
Where are you? Come out

352
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,576
You crook! You stole my-trick!

353
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,647
Hey, Handa, I told you 1bout
WU DO, AAR FR

355
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,882
Uh. yes. I thik you did.

356
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,884
What did the man look like?

357
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,720
IR WES I \Lk=h 3 EX JO

358
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,488
I don't really remember how he looked.

360
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,992
The layout of the hwuse seems to have
changed a bit after that incident tough...

362
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:10,361
Although It could just be my imagination.

363
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,746
Thelayout has changed...?

364
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,599
Ran. what's wrong?

365
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,800
Uh. no. it's nothing.

366
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:19,037
I just thought that something's changed
before and after Tenko was murdered.

368
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,306
But I don't know what it is

369
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,575
Oh, you think so too?

370
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,176
What? You too?

371
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,446
Yeah. but I don't know what it is either...

372
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,715
Maybho I should call Shinich
and ask him what it is.

376
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,120
I thought his,number was unlisted?

377
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,154
Yeah. but he finally gave itto me!

378
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,974
Shoots!! I didn't turn it off!!
Where's it! Whereis it!

380
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:43,762
Ok, then call him and. ask
Kudo is a gen us!

382
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,331
If you tell him about this case.

383
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,566
He'll probably say that,
he's gonna solve it with Heiji.

385
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,970
>Orry. Ran
Erik

387
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,706
I'm going to keep this
cell phone untii*we crack the case...

389
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,874
VV ht!
H. Ho!

391
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:56,441
What!
H. Heiji!!

393
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,509
He Co
You can't do that.

395
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,810
Hey!Hem!
Give it back to hor!

397
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,882
Ok. Now, let's hear
the truth behind this murder.

399
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:06,351
Right. Mr. Genius?

400
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:10,221
What do you mean. truth
You said it a while ago.

402
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:14,159
You lair! I know you got something!
Something that's bugging you...

404
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,661
Uh. yeah. Just a little...

405
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:21,099
First of all, why did the murderer
choose today of all the other days...

407
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,053
Yeah Today is the day Mr Masakage
disappe red 10 ears ago .

409
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:29,374
If the murderer was familar with the
mside detals of this housed,

411
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,775
that person should've been aware that

412
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,212
Mrs. Masakago would not be
none today boa-muse

414
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,614
Mr. Hand had been
siting her every year...

416
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,284
Secondly why can't we,find the splattered
blood. of the victim. Tenko anywhere...

418
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,320
If my deduction is correct.

419
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,190
She must've been murdered n the
hallway or the reference room,

421
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,791
but there's no blood
whatsoever in these places...

423
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,359
You're right...

424
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:52,130
Destruction of evidence seems
too well-prepared

426
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,666
for a murder that happened aceidentally...

427
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,633
Yeah. .-

428
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,268
We should be able-to find blood

429
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,105
hoetwoeen the tiles on tho floor or
in between the spaces of the wooden pillar

431
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,041
And thirdly.

432
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,709
Ou mean there's some more?

433
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,311
Kasuha.

434
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,545
What?

435
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,148
I don't know what it 1s.
But something's bugging me.

437
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,449
Ha ha

438
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,985
You know, she's acting frivolous...

439
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,854
Lighthearted and all that

440
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,090
It just irritates me
I can't concentrate on my deduction...

442
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,058
Why is it?

443
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:20,358
Why is it?

444
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,059
Wi rd
HT...

446
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,727
Huh?

447
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,473
Why 1~t?

448
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,316
Look, I don't think it's about her just being
frivolous or lighthearted.

450
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,187
It's more than her just being frivolous and
Iighthearted WITH another guy

452
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,288
don't you think?

453
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,205
Oh yeah!

454
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,624
You're right! That must be it!

455
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,958
How did you know, Kudo!

456
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:54,525
Huh?

457
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,927
What?

458
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,328
K. Kudo!?

459
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:58,663
Hattori!

460
00:14:58,664 --> 00:14:59,964
What's wrong with you!

461
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:00,498
Oops

462
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,885
Uh no. Dud,

464
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,870
I mean! It's the dude

470
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,405
That dude on TV was saying

473
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,274
the temperature went up to 39 degrees
yesterday afternoon

475
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,475
It was hot. wasn't it?

476
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,343
Oh eah,

477
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,847
I remember I saw something like
that on TV at the airport this morning.

479
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,882
Alright So. why am I feeling irritated?

480
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,917
Don't you know?

481
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,320
Kudo...?

482
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:24,956
Hattori...

483
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,541
You knowswhat...

484
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,129
Cause you're a kid...

485
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,766
Scre ou. man!

486
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,268
I fnanot letting a brat call mesa Kid you brat!

487
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,671
Haiji.

488
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,240
What're you getting all upset
over a child for!

490
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,676
Poor Conan.

491
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,878
What do you mean poor Conan!

492
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,314
He's the one who started talking nonsense!

493
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,249
Oh. come on ourre he one.

495
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,421
Besides your husband's pupils,
Mr. Hoshikaw: and Mr. Hand:

497
00:15:56,755 --> 00:16:01,092
were there any other magician fiends
of your husganc who visited you?

499
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,193
Well...

500
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,895
10 ea s ago

501
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,732
until My husband disappeared,
many people had been visiting this house

503
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,701
so ll can't really tcll who was who.

504
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,804
Since my husband designed
and built this house.

506
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,006
He would even invite the people
he just met at work over too.

508
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,109
Wanting to show this house off...

509
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,310
I see .

510
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,179
So he designed and built this house

513
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,716
In fact,
he showed them not only this house.

515
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,318
LT Ta,
but also the tricks that
mu d be done only in this house.

518
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,822
Therefore, even more people came here
after hearing about it...

520
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,058
The Christmas tree magic was
a really popular one.

522
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,562
Especially during tho Christmas season,
\ OU Know

524
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,599
Hmm? ls anything wrong?

525
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,134

526
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,236
Sorry...

527
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,039
This has nothing to do
with the case. I guess...

530
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,009
could you tell us what kind of trick it was?

531
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,877
We'll

532
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,747
Only sense! can explain that trick...

533
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,983
But since he's disappeared

534
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,486
there's no way
we can figure out how it works

536
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,855
Too bad we'll never find 1 clue
whatsocver about it

538
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:06,257
The man that you mentioned

539
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,192
visited you 5 years ago.

540
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,595
Could you tell us more in detail about him?

541
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:15,233
If he really snd that your husband
Mr Masakage stole his trick?

543
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:19,137
Then it is probable that ho ronlly wanted Lo
ace the Masakaaqu notes

546
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,656
PX IORERU CO) WARCRT ES WANK
Mr. Masaki1ge kept his ideas

548
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:25,610
regarding the magic tricks he performed.

549
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:30,048
If we assume that the murderer sneaked
Into this house to steal Masakage's notes.

551
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,151
And silenced Tenko.

552
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:37,422
Since she saw that person searching for
the notes in the reference room...

554
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:41,592
It's plausible to think that this man who
visited yous years ago is the killer.

556
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,462
His height or
something characteristic about his face

558
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,265
Anything. Anything you can remember,
Mrs. Masakage.

561
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,401
Yeah. I'm trying but I can't...

562
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,337
Do you remember whether
he was Japanese or not, right?

564
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,338
yeah,-

565
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,607
He was speaking fluent Japanese

566
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,776
and his hair was black...

567
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:03,314
I don't know what kind of hnir style he had
since he was wearing a hat...

569
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,515
Also.

570
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:08,586
RO REC) CU WEED on 619)
his face was covered with a beard...

572
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,322
So I couldn't really tell how he looked

573
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,723
I really can't

574
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,795
tHe seemed to be taller than me though...

575
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,097
Ummm...

576
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,999
A aco with 1 beard, wearing 1 ht,
and-sunglasses,.

578
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,002
Maybe he/was.disguising himself.

579
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,537
Probably...

580
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,139
Anyway,

581
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,842
have you checked whether Masakage's
notes have actually been stolen or not?

583
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,009
No...

584
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,846
But. I heard that he kept it put away
somewhere in the reference room.

586
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,581
I never knew exactly
where it was though...

588
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,549
Maybo it wasn't thoro fromitho'boginning

589
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,551

when he disappeared...?

00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,389

Thero should bo pictures since thore
wele 0 many visitors in this house. night?

597
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,663
Maybe we can find the man
in those pictures!

599
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,866
Or at lcast someone that looks like him.

600
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,501
LS(.P...

601
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,569
Mrs. Ma-akage,
where do you keepiyour photo albums ?

603
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,238
In my husband's room...

604
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,509
What is this. Mrs. WM: sakage?

605
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,578
his door cannot b0 opened completely

606
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,713
Oh that

607
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,616
My husband wanted to make his reem big

608
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,085
so he narrowed the hallway

609
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,087
He must hate a small rooms...

610
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,557
He was a great magician,
but certainly not a great architect...

612
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,992
Irsee that...

613
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,294
Yo. Kudo...

614
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:23,560
Yo. Kudo...

615
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:24,662
Yeah...

616
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,098
What are you guys doing there

617
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,800
You're net coming in?

618
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,637
Uh ..Yeah. Ha ha...

619
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,810
How is it, Mrs. Masakage .

620
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,047
Did you find anybody-that
Iooks like the man you met 5 years ago?

623
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,882
INOHINTINYE

624
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,319
You sure have a lot of pictures,
Mrs. Masakage...

626
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,420
Hey.Hem

627
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,923
I think it's impossible 10 find the picture of
theaman from a nong these p ctures

629
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,223
don't you?

630
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:52,690
Don't you?

631
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,059
Yes we can!
Because what we are looking for is...

634
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,929

635
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,633

So. this is the Christmas tree magic. huh

637
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,203
Look, the tree is standing
at the end of the hallway.

639
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,704
That's actually where
Tenko was lying on the floor, right?

641
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:10,208
There must be something behind it.

642
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,143
Hey! Look at! this. Kudo

644
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,810
This picture.

646
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:16,480
Huh? A picture of the three young pupils

647
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,015
Maybe this is.

648
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,987
She must be hiding something...

651
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:25,506
What? What is it? What's going on?

652
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,226
Oh, It's that...

653
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,460
There.

654
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,195
The thing on the ceiling.

655
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,299
Isn't that a screen for a projector?

656
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,535
What about it...?

657
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,272
People usually put that kind of screen
on the wall, right?

659
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,307
Cause they don't wanna watch it too close?

660
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,176
It's better to watch it that way

661
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,979
But it's not like that here.

662
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,649
See? It's so tar from the wall
Dont ou think it's strange?

664
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,987
You know what. you're right. It is strange...

665
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,623
It's no ordinary scroen, actually

666
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,458
It Is cut so that people can go through it...

668
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:00,691
It Is cut so that people can go through it...

670
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,692
It Is cut so that people can go through it...

00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,262
You guys have probably seen it.

676
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,329
You know the trick.

677
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,700
When a real person comes
out of the screen that you're watching!

679
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,237
Yeah I know. I've seen it before!

680
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,006
We used that screen for practice

681
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,441
That's why it's not on the wall.

682

But now. you're on your own.

687
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,685
This room is no longer in use...

689
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,525

We practice practice. practice.

700
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:46,103
Until we can do the trick so that
nobody can recognize how it works.

703
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,940
Man... Who would think that
there's a cut on that screen?

705
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:50,691
Man... Who would think that
there's a cut on that screen?

707
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,977
Never crossed my mind...

709
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,579
They used to come to-this room
everyday back then.

711
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,184
They used to check on when
they should come out of the screen and

713
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,153
Tried to avoid
unnecessary shadow on the screen

715
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,554
Shadow!

716
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,789
Yes. the shadow!

717
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,656
Oh yeah

718
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:08,092
It was the shadow of the vase
It looked different!

720
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,261
The shadow of the vase

721
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,497
The moonlight was shining
on the vase from behind.

723
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,766
So we couldn' see the patterns on it...

724
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,868
But after the blackout,

725
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:20,771
when we found Tenko's dead body

726
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,940
the moonlight was shining
on the vase from the side

728
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,975
SO we could see the patterns!

729
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,810
It doesn't make sense!

731
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:29,447
