and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

Today's stage is on the Bullet train.

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,941
There is another locked room
in an already locked room

00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,743
He sees through the one and only truth

00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,545
A child in appearance

Hey, hey...

23
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,375
Isn't that your cell phone?

24
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,309
What...?

25
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,613
I wonder who it is...

26
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,751
No ID?

27
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:38,190
Could that be a Ion -awaited call from
your sweetie Shinichi?

29
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,257
What?!

30
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:43,095

He'll hang up if you don't sooner!

32
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,466
I don't have to answer a call from
somebody who won't identify himself.

34
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,869
Don't be so shy! Come on!

37
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,707
I know! Three's a crowd! I'm leaving!

38

00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,148

Shinichi!!!

42
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,887
What do you mean it's been a while?

43
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,221
Hey, Ran's dad!

44
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,290
I know what's bugging you!

45
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,025
Why should I?

46
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,362
Oooh! Bull's-eye!

47
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,335

48
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,971
I have no way of contacting you...

49
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,474
But...

51
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,545
But then, how did you know
I am in Osaka?

53
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,750
Hattori called me and told me...!

55
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,756
you're in contact with him all this time.

56
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,459
But, but... Just a coincidence!!

57
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,894
You know the K-3 event...

58
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,030
There was that event right?

59
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,902
Let me see...

60
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,004
which one should I pick...?

61
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,674
Well,

62
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,877
I don't need any lunch,
so what about newspaper A

64
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,179
Why, you just bought one a while ago!

65
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,115
What happened. Ran...?

66
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,918
Well, then Shinichi...

67
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,521
Do you know about that casey

68
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,057
You mean...

69
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,725
I saw the news In the morning...

70
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,561
That case about Ray Curtis...

71
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:26,332

To tells ou the truth... lsasked him...

75
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,745
Maybe you're thinking of...

76
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,715
The uniform that Ray autograph?

77
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,782
Yeah...

78
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,985
I heard about it in a phone call

79
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,786
That wasn't necessary.

80
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,889
But...

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,326
Sorry, but I want you to keep it
until I get home.

83
00:04:56,263 --> 00:05:02,635
No matter what happened,

00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,979
There's something, Shinichi...

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,713

90
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:21,520
Don't you want to know...

00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,992
I can't stop him.

142
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,994

What's that fuss about?

146
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,867
It was a phone call from Shinichi.

147
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,870
The line went dead
when she was about to get to the point.

149
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,006
No! Not really!

150
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,841

chickened out by hanging up...

158
00:06:58,585 --> 00:06:59,485
What?

159
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,421

What s going on, Ran?

189
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:48,300
Are you planning to play baseball?

190
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,303
Well yes, sort of...

191
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,939
Don't throw straight into the bull's-eye.

192
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,209
I think you should sound out
strategy with a curveball...

194
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,911
No, wait

195
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,479
What!?

196
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,880
Mr. Mourn!

197
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,415
Officer Takagi!

198
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,654

00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,690
Youwsre transporting a crime suspect!

200
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,328
Turn it down Mr Mount...

201
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,863
I'm sorry, Takagi...

202
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,467
What about the guy...what did he do?

203
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,435
His name ls Senzo Ogura.

204
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,003
A narcotics dealer.

205
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,107
We were about to arrest him in Tokyo,

206
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,709
but he made a narrow escape...

207
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:35,047
We organizedra dragnet in
the Kansai region, and he fell into it.
Senzo Ogura

210
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:35,614
We organized a dragnet in
the Kansai region, and he fell into it.

212
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:39,151
Yes, I remember reading it
in the newspaper...f

214
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:43,255
That such a guy is being transferred
from Osaka to the Police Agency.

216
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:44,490
If I remember correctly,

217
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:49,094
a huge supply of narcotics were found
in his home in Tokyo.

220
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:49,827
1 CO...

221
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:56,135
That's why we're hoping that
he'll confess the name of his boss.

224
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,537
Coffee...

225
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,772
What did you say?

226
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,307
I want to drink some coffee.

227
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,476
Boy, you are troublesome.

228
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,245
Takagi can you go get one?

229
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,178
Uh...Yes.

230
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,883
But we can only get you cold coffee.

231
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:17,022
I don't want you spilling hot coffee
over us to try to escape...

233
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:17,656
Huh...

234
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,126
I wonder if I have small change...

236
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,770
Here it is

237
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,108
It's a ticket to
the Ichizo Sanada Magic Illusion show!

239
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,143
Wow! Are you going to see it?

240
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,547
Yes, on my next-day off.

241
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,884
I didn't know you were interested in that!

242
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,351
Well...

243
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:47,952
Well...

244
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,053
Well...

245
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,558
To tell you the truth, Yumi
in the Traffic Control Section asked me

247
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:55,194
because she had an extra ticket.

248
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,862
Huh...

249
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,198
Yumi did?

250
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,468
1.1 told her I'm not really interested.

251
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,972
Well, Takagi!

253
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,207
1 TO...

254
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,742
That might be a good idea. Why not?

255
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,146
Let me know
if you catch the trick behind it!

257
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,682
Well...

258
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,718
How about this?

259
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:24,923
You casually tell Miwako that
I asked you out...

261
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,924
What?!

262
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,395
If she turns pale,
that means she has a thing for you...

264
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,399
If she turns pale...

265
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,870
A straightforward pitch isn't going to
work on a girl like Miwako.

267
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:41,473
Try sounding out with a curveball!

268
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,274
Get it?

269
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,209
What is it with you?

270
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,478
What? Well...lim going...

271
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,448
We'll be returning to our seats.

272
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,949
Okay. See you later!

273
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:57,322
Who's going to catch MY curveball...?

274
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,497
We should see Mt. Fuji soon...

275
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:06,698
Huh?

276
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,470
Looks like something happened...

277
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,940
What's wrong?

278
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,509
Has something happened?

279
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:23,148
First things first, I'll check the restroom.
You staylhere.

281
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,483
Okay.

282
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,629
Excuse me! Let me through!

283
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,298
It's here.

284
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,146
Contains Bomb. Do not touch!"

285
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,316
When did you find this?

286
00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:00,519
A passenger found this just a while ago

287
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,553
I think it hasn't been very long.

288
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,590
I see.

289
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,924
Thanks.

290
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,314
It seems people are gathering over there

291
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,517
There must be something going on.

292
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,119
You must be kidding.

293
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:41,726
Huh?

294
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,663
I think I'll go and check.

295
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,564
Wait! Stop!

296
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:45,998
Wait! Stop!

297
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,205
No! It's dangerous...

298
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:54,873
Sit still!

299
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,044
Hey, Officer...

300
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,115
I need to go to the restroom.

301
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,182
What?

302
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:09,121
I've been trying to wait
until we get to Tokyo, but I can't anymore.

304
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,758
Then, wait till Officer Sato returns.

305
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,827
I'm telling you because I can't anymore...

306
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:19,765
It's okay by me if I do it here.

307
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,267
No way!

308
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,802
Darn it!

309
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,939
I'm sorry about that.

310
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,174
Darn it!

311
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,976
Where are you heading, Officer Takagi?

312
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,445
The bathroom!

313
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,191
Did you find something...? Officer?

314
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,094
Do you hear something?

315
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,395
Yes.

316
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,663
I hear clock ticking...

317
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,298
What?!

319
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:55,067
Anyway,

320
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,968
we must have
the passengers evacuate from the car.

322
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,870
Tell the driver to stop the train...

323
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:18,957
III!

326
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:19,324
Bet

329
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,000
It was just a hoax.

330
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:35,373
I'd like to speak to
the person who found this bag...

332
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:42,547
Hey!

333
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,716
Are you done?

334
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,019
Don't rush me, officer!

335
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,223
I've only got one hand free!

336
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,092
That's a problem in itself...

337
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:56,995
Darn it...

338
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,000
By the way, I heard you say something...

339
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,203
that you are going to make me
confess the boss's name.

341
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,273
I'm sorry to tell you that it's impossible...

342
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,141
Huh?

343
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,448
Because this bird won't be
singing any more.

345
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,719
What's on on!

346
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,090
What's this!!

347
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,160
How did you get the knife...?

348
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,800
I need to call Ms. Sa

349
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,836
Oh, no!

350
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,306
I'm out of ran e in a tunnel!

351
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,376
Darn it!

352
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,283
I'll be back right away!

353
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,288
I'll be back... Stay there...

354
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,837
What did you say!!

355
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,005
The suspect in the restroom?

356
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,675
He had a knife stabbed in the abdomen.

357
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,343
Why?!

358
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,846
He shouldn't be in possession of a knife!

359
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,681
I know, but...

360
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,851
But, when I opened the door,
he was splattered with blood...

362
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,854
Anyway, please come!

363
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:30,488
All right!

365
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,306
Officer Sato, ittS'here!

366
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,312
Gone? The knife is gone!

367
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,614
What?)-

368
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,720
It's too late...

369
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:04,022
He already died.

370
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,091
That's impossible

371
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,922
Strange...

372
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,892
There is something fishy here...!

373
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,598
What!!

374
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,669
The suspect killed himself
during transport! -

376
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,237
Fool!!

377
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:56,675
What have you to been doing!

378
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,944
Well... starting from the beginning

379
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,579
I took the suspect to the bathroom.

380
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,049
Suddenly, he began to suffer.

381
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,187
When I opened the door, he had a knife
in his abdomen and he was bloody.

383
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,558
That is why, I went to report to
Officer Sato to receive orders.

385
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,762
I locked the handcuff
on the handbar in the bathroom.

387
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,397
I had him confined inside
the bathroom to call Officer Sato.

389
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,303
Although he was injured,

390
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,738
I believed that it is dangerous
to have a suspect

392
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,240
in possession of a weapon to
be left abandoned inside the car.

394
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:33,878
When I returned with Officer Sato,

395
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:37,015
he had pulled out
the knife and was bleeding.

397
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,550
Anyway,

398
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,653
I will be heading to Tokyo Station with
the medical examiner and forensic team.

400
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,656
Don't let anybody
inside until we get there.

402
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,156
Yes, Sir!

403
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,062
A police officer making
the mistake of allowing

405
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,864
a suspect to
commit suicide during transport...

407
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,666
That's a scandal.

408
00:18:55,734 --> 00:19:00,204
This means reprimand
or a pay cut or even suspension...

410
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,573
No. no...

411
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:09,079
It might mean a dishonorable discharge

412
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,250
Poor Officer Takagi!

413
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:16,287
What are you saying? Officer Sato, you're
speaking as it it's no concern of yours.

415
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,692
Hello Takagi speaking!

416
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,294
Hi, it's me. Yum.

417
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:24,796
It's you, Yum...

418
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:25,296
It's you, Yum...

419
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,432
How was it? You know

420
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,500
Well

421
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,404
You know what! Operation Ticket Chase!

422
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,972
Did it succeed?

423
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:37,342
Was Miwako jealous? How did she react?

424
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:41,479
Come on and tell me! I'm dying to hear!

425
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,649
I'm not in the mood to talk about that!

426
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,751
Don't call me about such matters!!

427
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,025
It bombed as expected...

428
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,761
What did Yumi say?

429
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,531
It was nothing...

430
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,766
Is that so...

431
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,676
But, the problem is
the knife used to kill himself...

433
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,212
Yes...he is not a magician...

434
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,284
It's impossible for a suspect to
hide and carry a knife during transport

436
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,018
without the police officers knowing...

437
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:20,852
He's not a magician!
Without the police officers knowing...

439
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:21,419
He's not a magician!

440
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,789
DNis man is a samurai!

441
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:25,690
What?

442
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,426
Look at the knife on the floor!

443
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,363
Look at how it is on the floor.
The blade is looking upward...

445
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,066
and he was holding it this way...?

446
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,570
This means that this man was
holding the knife...

448
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,207
This away to pull it out ike a samurai.

449
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:48,413
Takagi... How did the suspect hold
the knife when he stabbed himself?

451
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,682
Of course, in reverse,

452
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,750
it's easier to hold that way.

453
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,787
Reverse when stabbing,

454
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,722
and normal when pulling...

455
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,990
that's weird...

456
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:03,194
Does that mean that someone else
had pulled the knife?

458
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,597
That's impossible...

459
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,665
Talking about weird...

460
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,434
this blood as funny, too.

461
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,702
What?

462
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:17,142
Look, the blood splattered all over
the man and the blood on the knife.

464
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,077
It is wiggling like jelly.

465
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:25,483
But, the blood on his hand is
not hard yet and is liquid like water...

467
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,287
Does that mean that
what is on his hand is not blood?

469
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,656
But, but the color
Iooks so much like blood...

471
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:33,925
Might be heparin...

472
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,861
He...heparin?

474
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:37,962
ITO...

475
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,766
It may have been mixed with blood.

476
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,702
You mean, that anti-coagulant?

477
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:45,403
Yes...

478
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,740
Usually, blood begins to clot over time,

479
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,742
making it difficult to transport.

480
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:54,179
If blood is mixed with Heparin
and sealed tight in bag,

482
