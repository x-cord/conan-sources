1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:09,342
Happy New Year, everybody!

2
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:13,946
Detective Conan
enters the eighth year, and

4
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:17,283
We have broadcast
more than 300 times.

6
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:22,154
We will do our best iin

7
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,421
TV's

8
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:24,357
movies

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,225
magazines and books.

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,461
So, be sure to stay with us€folks!

11
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,978
This is Location One, the explosive has
beenforocessed and disposed of.

13
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,747
The helmet is equipped with
a duct for cooling for respiration

15
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,749
that alternates as the
mist remover for the lens

17
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:28,086
And, we, are heading to Location
Two with officer Matsuda with us

19
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,157
To protect against
the hot air of explosion,

21
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,592
the structure of the protective gear
does not allow any openings.

23
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,696
The structure of the protective gear
does not allow any openings.

25
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:42,134
The gear is so complex that
you cannot put it on by yourself

27
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,071
It weighs 40 kilogram

28
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,408
In the protective gear,
it's' a sauna even in cold winter

30
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,046
You can't keep wearing it
for more than five minutes

32
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,948
I'd say it's impossible.

33
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,592
Head quarters to everyone!

34
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,626
First area the...

35
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:10,196
1035

36
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,998
All roads are blocked

37
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,067
The second area...

38
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:23,042
Capture all suspicious
Iooking suspects

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,477
from head quarters

41
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:33,586
Keep cool and collected.

42
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,123
No baggage. please.
Vacua e quic yan quie Yy.

44
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,892
It's dangerous, please move swiftly

45
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,328
Do not get scared

46
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,926
Evacuation of the residents
of this building is completed.

48
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,761
Confirmed.

49
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,799
Well, let's start...

50
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,182
You've done a good job, Matsuda.

51
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,450
How's Hagiwara ?

52
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:43,389
Lets see,
bomb with automated timer...

54
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,758
Silver lever with a white wires...

55
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,393
Moniter to the...

56
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:50,129
Matsuda? What's up?

57
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,499
Hagiwara!
What's taking you so long!

59
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,235
Go. tear it apart fast.

60
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,873
You're too loud. man
You're making\mylfingers shake.

62
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,875
Have you finished already?

63
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,913
Yeah. I opened it and found
out it's rather simple clockwork

65
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,815
it's sO simple...

66
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,984
Three minutes was long enough?

67
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,751
Right?

68
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:17,356
How about yours?

69
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,994
Takes more than 3 minutes for sure.

70
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,866
It looks simple but
there're so many traps around it.

72
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,537
I suppose this is the real one.

73
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,271
Right

74
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:36,809
By the way. you're in
protective gear. aren't you?

76
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:41,213
In that hot torturing thing?...
No way.

78
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,748
Darn! You want
to get killed "man? I

80
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,820
Well. you can get the guy for me...

81
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,221
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

82
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:54,927
Can't take a joke?
I'm not @ klutz.

84
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,430
Anyway, finish ASAP
and get on back here.

86
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,799
I'll buy you a drink tonight.

87
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:07,039
Lucky me!
You lured me into full throttle...

89
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,108
What's that!

90
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,710
What's up. Hagiwara?

91
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,413
Run, everybody.

92
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,382
Runaway!

93
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,785
The timer started counting again!

94
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,756
Hagiwara! Hey!
Hagiwara!

96
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,675
Hagiwara...

97
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,219
Hagiwara!

98
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,296
Why? How did you find out?

99
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,533
I asked that boy wearing glasses.

100
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,701
So. that's why.

101
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,338
By the way, Shin'ichi,

102
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:15,140
\ what-'re you going to do
about the all-country sim-test?

104
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,275
All-country sim-test?

105
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,378
You can't make it, can you?

106
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,151
I'll bet you're going to say you'r tied
up with-a new case or something

109
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,020
What s-this?

112
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,122
What's this?

118
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,025
I've leaded it in again.

119
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,493
You...

120
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:27,272
Pad. €@onan!

121
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,076
Don't be late
Breakfast is ready!

123
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,678
J Dad!

124
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,648
What stall the commotion¥about
from so early in the morning!

126
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,384
It's noon already.

127
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:42,321
I-m-:going to prepare for tomorrow-test.
Sonoko and I are going to work-on .it-today.

129
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,390
Will you finish up quickly?

130
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,925
That's your problem. not-mine.

131
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,730
You're-taking your report
to a client; aren't.you? .

133
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:54,332
And, @onan, you promised
Ayumi and the-others that

135
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,669
you'll go to
Hairdo Shopping Mall with them.

137
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,004
Yeah.

138
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,740
Haido Shopping Mall?

139
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:05,510
Oh, the mall with
that huge Ferris Wheel.

141
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,577
Yeah...

142
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,116
January: 6th "Monday.

143
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,119
The Winter holidays were-almost over.

144
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,388
That first day started very peacefully

145
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,724
but theffollowing twordaysiwere
Burned out to be a nightmare.

147
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,797
Unsettled Metropolitan Police Department,
12 million hostages

149
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,376
Sato-san, what do you think of
this disguise of mine?

151
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,112
It's cool, isnt it?

152
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,648
Sato-san?

153
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,450
What's the matter with you?
Anything wrong?

155
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,924
Sato-san?

156
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,062
Miwako!

157
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,597
Hey. Miwako?

158
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,365
Miwako!

159
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,471
Oh. Yuma.

160
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,307
What's the matter with you?
IN a coma or somethings'

162
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:09,975
I'm alright.

163
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,144
Just a little tired. I guess.

164
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,681
I'm going out for a while.

165
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,485
I thought you said you were going
to do paperwork all day today.

167
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,720
I just remembered something
I have to go out, and take a look.

171
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,691
Don't forget the karaoke tonight.

172
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,527
Oh. yeah. What time was it?

173
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,162
Nine o'clock.

174
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,764
I sent mail to your cell.
You can look at it.

176
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:36,401
Oh. ah...

177
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,005
Sorry. I've deleted it already.

178
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,407
Stop deleting mails right after
you finish reading them.

180
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,009
That's one of your bad habits.

181
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,745
If I don't delete them

182
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:51,717
I'll soon get a mailbox full of junk mails'
and lose track of important mails.

185
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:56,188
So, you mean mine is not important.

186
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,556
That's not what I meant

187
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,757
You better not.

188
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,692
Okay. nine o'clock.

189
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,394
Donitibe.late!

190
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,562
Roger and out.

191
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,571
Mail that you can't delete...

192
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,148
Wow; it-'s-so high!

193
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,484
Wow Really.

194
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,618
Great!

195
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:32,858
This Ferris Wheel is 125 meter high.
It's the highest in Japan.

197
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,728
It takes 18 minutes
to make one round.

199
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,264
You can make:6.instant noodles!

200
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:45,437
Diameter of the circle is 105 meters and
it takes 18 minutes to go once around

202
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:50,509
That means the speed of this car is
about 30 centimeters per second.

204
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,680
Can't you think of anything else?

205
00:11:54,914 --> 00:12:00,786
Oh? Such as the power
necessary to make one round?

207
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,921
Cut it out.

208
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,767
It's been three years now

209
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:19,705
Everybody.
Let me introduce...

212
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,842
Mr. Jimpei Matsuda.

214
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:29,181
He will start workin with us as of toda
In the Criminal Investigation Section.

216
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,351
He has been in the Securit Department,
Special Task Force »

218
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,387
and I'd say that he is a bit of
a stranger here but...

220
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,656
We can do without that kind of
introduction, Insp&ctor.

222
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,592
I'm not exactly a new kid
from the country.

224
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,896
I don't think this show and tell about
me would be of any use to anybody.

226
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:50,936
I was stationed where I donst want
te be and lyn upset about it.

229
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:58,644
Well then, Detective Sato!
Ou ep IMOou an

233
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,545
Me: sir?

234
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,380
Don't shy away!

235
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:07,385
He is here for certain reasons, and they
asked me in person to play-along.

237
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,354
Will you take care of him?

238
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,722
Yes. Sir.

239
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,632
Hey, what kind of questioning
was that supposed 'tobe?

241
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,202
Questioning people like a mobster I
ike that, nobody will answer you!

243
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:30,742
You have been with us for 6 days new.
Why doMt you listen to me and

245
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,310
do as I say?

246
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,380
Oh'; you got mail?
F Fast

248
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:39,651
Yeah- I just-happen
to be clever with my fingers.

250
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,454
Are you mailinggyour girlfriend?

251
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,824
No. to my pal,
I'm sending my best friend mail.

253
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,461
Though I know he's
not going to write back to me

255
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,898
because he blew up 4 years ago.

257
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,772
Pass? Pass what?
Are you crazy?

260
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,808
I have to wait here-today

265
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:08,080
I'm sure -you guys
can bring the old suspect

268
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,715
from the local police 4
up here withoutime.

270
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,650
Now, you listen to me.

271
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:16,521
I am. Yiou said you receive it on
January 6th every year. Today is the day.

273
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:22,194
Yes, every year for three years,

274
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:27,165
yousmean the fax with
just one large number on it, right?

276
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,934
Number 3 was written
Oh it three years ago

278
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,070
number 2, two years ago.
And number 1, a year ago...

280
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,876
I'm sure it's the time bomb count down.

281
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,912
If the guy's making
any moves, today is the day.

283
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,817
Inspector!
We got one this year, too!

285
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,687
That fax with a number
on it. you mean

287
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:52,224
And?
What is the number this time?

289
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,627
It. it's not a number this time.

295
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,198
Let the foolish, cunning police know
that today at noon, at the 14th hour,

and in his memory,
we will set off fireworks

336
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,809
If you want to stop it. come to us.

337
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,246
We prepared the 72nd
seat for you and we are ready.

339
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,648
What does it mean?

340
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,989
Hey!
Just where do you think you're going?

342
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:30,595
Where else? The knight of the round
table says there are 72 seats.

344
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,499
If it's round and has 72 seats,

349
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:39,538
its the big Ferns] wheel
in the Hairdo Shopping-Mall N\

351
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,306
Thanks for coming!

353
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,853
Gosh! We are too Mie

354
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:59,057
But it's thirty minutes to noon

355
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,460
pm the police.
What happened?

357
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:07,866
The control room suddenly blew up.
Wescanit stop the wheel

360
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,034
We-:d like to get the
people out of cars but...

362
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:09,868
Wed likelto get the
people out of cars but...

364
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,872
Where is the 72nd car right now?

365
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,076
What!
Oh, it's coming down soon.

367
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,013
J Id yg

368
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:32,457
The knight was not waiting for us
but there's something beneath the seat.

370
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,360
You don't say. a bomb?

371
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,394
Hey, Matsuda!

373
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,400
Let a pro handle work like this. \

374
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,239
Wait a second. Matsuda!

375
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,274
What does he mean by pro?

376
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:55,280
He was at the explosives disposal team
until last year. in the Security Task Force.

378
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,182
Then the pal he was talking about

379
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,251
that he said had passed away...

380
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:04,089
That's probably his
pal Hagiwara of the same team.

382
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:10,295
Killed on duty while he was disposing
a bomb, four years ago. on January 6th.

384
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,249
In that case.

385
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,552
There were two
bombs in separate places.

387
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,055
Matsuda disposed of one bomb.

388
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,225
But, Hagiwara didn't
have enough time.

390
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,993
The bomber has not yet been identified.

393
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:43,194
The bomber has not yet been identified.

394
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,264
Matsuda requested
transfer to the special team

397
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,499
that is investigating on the bomber.

398
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,235
He kept requesting the transfer,
but was turned down.

400
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,272
Since they thought
he wanted to do things for his pal

402
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,375
they chose to transfer him, so he
could cool off. and sent him

404
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,345
to-our section...

405
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:05,684
Inspector. what shall we do?
It's six minutes to noon

409
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,822
- L€_
WW Lake the car/40 more minutes
to make a round and return.

412
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:16,594
It stopped. we have no choice,
but to leave it to Matsuda

415
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,048
It stopped.

416
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,284
Put-out-the-fire-quick.

417
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,822
We've got trouble.

420
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,863
Hello!
Matsuda? Are you alright?

422
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,597
Yeah...

423
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,402
but with the shock just
now. and odd switch was turned on

425
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:57,902
What?

426
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,938
The mercury lever.

428
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,439
Mercury lever?

429
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,143
A-slight shake can
make the mercury-drop roll.

431
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,512
And if the drop touches
the wire, that it.

434
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,149
If you don't want to see me blow up

435
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,819
keep the ferris wheel
still until I dispose of this bomb.

437
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:19,290
B-but. we have less than five
minutes:-untilthe blow up.

439
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:24,596
Three minutes would be more than
enough for this kind of device.

441
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:33,137
To the Brave Police officer, in praise
of your courage we will give you a prize

443
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,906
B-but, we have less
than five minutes until the blow-up.

445
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:39,944
A clue to another bigger
firework will be displayed

448
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:40,145
A clue to another bigger
firework will be displayed...

451
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,980
A clue to another bigger
firework will be displayed...

453
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,249
at 3 seconds before the explosion

454
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,916
With best wishes'

455
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:51,322
These are the words displayed
on the LCD panel right now.

457
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:55,126
I suppose if we stop the
bomb and turn off the power,

460
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,096
we will n ver be able
to read the clue again...

462
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,634
That is, the guy intended to put someone
into this car and show these words to him.

464
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,570
This ferris wheel and show
these words to him...

466
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:11,509
Then, that blow-up was turned on
because the guy saw you enter the car

468
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,679
In other words, the
bomber is somewhere close by...

471
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,350
It's very difficult tolidentify him»
out of this crowd &fpeople. but...

473
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:22,620
I can guess where
he set the other bomb.

475
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,858
The fax says,
the head of our fellow knight,

477
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:35,500
Those medieval knights wore helmets
designed with a cross in front.

479
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:36,935
Itislabvious now. isn't it?

480
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,137
A diagram sign of a hospital!

481
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,038
You guessed right.

482
00:20:40,705 --> 00:20:43,675
I'll tell you which hospital
it is after I read the clue.

485
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,879
You-liOtell me after you read it. but the
clue comes up just 3 seconds before

487
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,516
Well. the battery is almost out. bye«now.

490
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,653
Matsuda! Matsuda!

491
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,123
Matsuda...

492
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:15,039
Allow me, for today, will you?

494
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,009
This is bad.
Tthere's only one minute left.

496
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,745
Everyt™ddy!
Get out of here!

498
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,216
Matsuda!

499
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,819
Don't, Sato!
It's too late.

502
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,387
But, but he's still there.

503
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,295
TOO dangerous.
Back off, please.

505
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,695
But he's still...

506
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,534
He's inside!

508
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:50,575

I guess I couldn't keep my word...

515
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,858
What!

516
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:11,629
What are we going to do?
The fax says there's another bomb...

518
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,897
I already know that!

519
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,267
Beika Central Hospital...

520
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,335
What?

523
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,137
Beika Central Hospital...

524
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,873
The other bomb is there!

Hello!

545
00:22:57,276 --> 00:23:01,379
I didn't know such a thing
took.place three years ago.

547
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:08,653
If she still has lingering memories about
the incident, we don't have a chance

549
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,688
I suppose so...

550
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,160
If you want to be like him,
you can die on duty.

552
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:20,298
Hey! Don't say things like that.

553
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,200
Say! It's Satoh.

554
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,336
Oh! Takagi and Shirator:.

555
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,673
What's the matter?
Conan and the kids.

557
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,541
I just happened to run into them

558
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,278
Because I am grateful to them
for helping out in the case,

560
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,481
I'm going to get them
sweets or something.

562
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,783
All the cake we can eat.

563
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,318
And, what brings. ou here?

564
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:44,155
We sort of got a squeal...

565
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:48,826
We looked through inside this
restaurant. but nothing showed up

567
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,362
It'-s very likely to-be-a false-lead.

568
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,999
OK, then, I am gong to
karaoke with Yumi this evening,

570
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,233
would you guys care to join us?

Well, then, you go ahead. Takag:.

I'm not in the mood for singing today.
And I guess I'd rather not.

Hey, letss hurry up and go.

576

Yeah!

577
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,051
What kind of squeal was it?

578
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:19,290
Yeah. It was a phone call, a warning,
that a bomb is set up in this restaurant
