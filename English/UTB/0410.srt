Huh? Where did he go?

287
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,188
Mr'. MOUTH?

288
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,989
Detective Takagi
Yes?

290
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,558
Bring everyone outside here.

291
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,294
Huh{?
Uh es.

294
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,862
There's one more thing...

296
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,130
There's om, more-thing...

297
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:54,432
Uh... es

298
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,022
What is it. Mr. Mouri?

300
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:03,074
Detective llakag!

301
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,609
It's already on the screen.

303
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:05,376
*"> 64

304
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,947
I Asked them to forward this
from the investigation headquarters.

306
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,917
The problem is the chimney
seen here on the screen.

308
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,671
[ITER e EN 5,
this' was taken down 4 days ago.

310
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,056
What!

311
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,793
This public bath was taken down to
be remodeled.

313
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:27,031
In other words, this was not
taken on the same day it was sent.

315
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,766
Which means...?

316
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,936
So long as the image was
set up to be forwarded.

318
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:35,306
The kidnapper could've been
on the receiving end too.

320
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:40,745
In other words, what you're drying
to say is...the kidnapper was among us!

322
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,180
Deteclve akag)

323
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,782
Yes. I looked into it just like you sald.

324
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,652
I chocked on who wis 1lwnys
on the receiving end of

326
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:53,725
the image: sent.out by the-kidnapper
as well as the instructions by phone...

328
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,966
Kn4knock it.out.

329
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:07,171
And: .take a look at-the
recorded image of the security camera.

331
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:14,279
Mr. Ohnuki: instructed
to do so by the kindapper,

333
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,682
you tried to shake off the police.

334
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:18,650
That's right

335
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,385
When was that?

336
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,719
When...

337
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,725
I was stopped at the traffic light. I.m.sure
I you detectives heard the oxchange too...

339
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,162
But. we couldn't hear the kidnapper's voice

340
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,565
Th. that's because it
was a telephone call.

342
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:38,303
That telephone call,
did it really come in?

344
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,705
MH: How absurd...

345
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:46,744
Then why did the kidnapper
take the cellphone with the ransom?

347
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,831
Th that's...

348
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,249
Huh?

349
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,702
What /
no but .

351
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,123
If understand.

352
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,627
This is .

353
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,713
As ou can see he is not using the phone.

354
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:12,537
If we look at the cell phone, we
can tell that there is no call log.

356
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,906
That's why he didn:t leave it behind...

357
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,442
It is probably somewhere
along with the ransom...

359
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,795
If wessearch the area,
we will soon have tho results.

361
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:25,516
But before that, we will
need toirescue'the hostage.

363
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,785
What's this suposed toe'mean?

364
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,389
The kidnapper himsélf should know.

366
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,326
Il don't know!

367
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,195
I don't. know .a.thing!

368
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,063
Quit fooling, Ohnuki!

369
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,804
Where's my daughter?

370
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,806
Where's Range?

371
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,108
Chairperson'...?

372
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,644
If something happens to:my daughter,
you won't get away, with this!

374
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,613
Just remember that!

376
00:16:55,614 --> 00:17:00,218
Nino! I just helped your daughter
to do what she asked me to do .

378
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,552
Helped?

379
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,587
Uh oh!

380
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,957
Right. in the beginning it was just an act

381
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:10,428
So, Miss Renge candefinitely
say who helped her out

383
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,498
That is.:she can name
the real kidnapper!

385
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:18,935
So. the kidnapper can't just release her.

386
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:21,339
Were you planning. to Kill her
from the beginning!?

388
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,440
I don't know!

389
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:27,412
