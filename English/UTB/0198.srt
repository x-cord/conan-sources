00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,206
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,808
Tonight, we solve the case
Involving the super car.

7
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,543
No one's ever seen anything
Iike it before.

9
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,211
He sees through the one and only truth.

00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:13,946
A child in appearance
with the l.Q. of an adult,

00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:16,682
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

We have come to the Izu Highlands
after winning first prize in the

18
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,421
neighborhood association's drawing
which was a 1 night's stay in a hotel here.

20
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:06,058
The owner of the hotel
turns out to be a real car buff

22
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,096
and a historic car show
is opening at the hotel the following day.

24
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,234
The uests that
show up though, all have had

26
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,704
their valuable cars taken away
by the owner through deceitful methods.

28
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,943
That night, the owner of the hotel
goes for a late night drive

30
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,678
and the next morning

31
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:28,881
he is found dead
in the driver's seat of his car!

TRAP OF THE SUPER CAR

35
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,835
What do you think, Doctor?

36
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,239
The cause of death is probably

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,042
carbon monoxide poisoning
caused by the exhaust fumes...

39
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,878
And I see no other external injuries

40
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,649
The estimated time of death is
between 9 and 10 AM

42
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:08,454
That's right, he was still alive when
I called him on his cellular a little past 9

44
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,055
You talked to him?!

45
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,124
How did he sound?

46
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,527
He sounded like
he was in pain and he said

48
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:19,632
Where am 1? and It's pitch dark',
gibberish like that...

50
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,968
I guess the carbon monoxide was
making him delirious

52
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:27,406
That means he must ve died
right after you called

54
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,674
Excuse me, Detective Yokomizo...

55
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:35,147
doesn't that mean
Mr. Teraizumi was'here wa Tbefore 9:00?

57
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,016
Of course, you nincompoop

58
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,617
By the way Mr Mouri

59
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,419
About the window on the driver side

60
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,289
why do you think it's slightly open?

61
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,291
Survival instinct!

62
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,963
The exhaust fumes were suffocating him
and he must've opened it in desperation

64
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,900
But why did he die then?

65
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,804
Because by the time he got the
window open, it was too late...

67
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,845
What is this?

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,081
It breaks off straight across

69
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,716
Hey you there...

70
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,153
You shouldn't be
wandering around here!!

72
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,088
I'm sorry...

73
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,390
I was just wondering
what this black stain was...

75
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:23,362
That's coal tar, it s made
when fuel is imperfectly combusted!

77
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,298
It dripped out of the muffler!

78
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,368
It happens arlotsintthese old cars

79
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,037
Gee, but it looks*rso shiny and new

80
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,709
Yeah, it s been polished so good,
there's hardly any fingerprints on it...

82
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,945
What is it? Is something wrong?

83
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,581
It seems this car's been in
an accident lately...

85
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:47,353
there's a crack in the left head lamp
and we found some fibers in it

87
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,655
A crack and fibers...?

88
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,727
Well, here we are...

89
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,862
Sorry to keep you waiting so long

90
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,697
Let's start right away...

91
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,700
which of you ls Mr. Sagara,
the one who first discovered the body...

93
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,402
That's me

94
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,139
Will you give us the details of
how you found the body?

115
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,682

116

You see, the fog hadn't lifted yet

117
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,921
And when look in the car,

118
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,490
I saw Mr. Teraizumi
slumped in the driver's seat

120
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,625
Is there anything else you noticed?

121
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,861
Now that you mention it,

122
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,963
I saw all these other people
all gathered near the parking lot...

124
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,766
Uh, that was my fault

125
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,902
Eh, what do you mean, Ran?

126
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,805
Ran let out this loud scream
that scared us

128
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,007
so we all ran out to see what was up

I see...

134
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,584
by the way, about the late Mr. Teraizumi,

135
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:57,088
we assume he returned from his drive
and sat in his car with the engine running

137
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:59,992
and died from
carbon monoxide inhalation

139
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,131
does anyone know why he would sit
in his car with the engine running...

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,099
The truth is, Mr. Teraizumi loved that car
morelthan anything, why just yesterday...

Sir the other cars are already
In their places.

156
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,343
Why don't you take yours there now

157
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,212
Hold it just 1 minute, don't rush me...

158
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,616
I want to spend tonight with 'my friend!

159
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,954
Once it's on display, I won t be able to
take it for a spin whenever I feel like it

161
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,024
I guess that's why he couldn't tear
himself away from his beloved car

163
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,693
after he got back from his drive...

164
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:39,632
see,.
and then he must have fallen asleep

166
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:44,737
Mr. Teraizumi was really looking forward
to the opening of the show room today...

168
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,172
I feel so sorry for him...

169
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,708
You can stop the charade now,
Mr. Kuroiwa...

171
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,177
Tell us the truth, you're relieved
he's dead, aren't you?

173
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,114
Wh, what are you talking about!?

174
00:06:55,315 --> 00:07:00,119
I know all about it, Mr. Teraizumi was
just about to lay you off

176
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,289
ouswere being, laid off?
Is that true?

178
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,491
Yes, It 1s true

179
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,996
Bull didn't hate him!
Not like these me here!

181
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,666
What do you mean by that?

182
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,935
They all hated him....!

183
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,238
They had their precious cars
taken away by Mr. Teraizumi

185
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:21,607
when they couldn't repay their debts

186
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,109
And don't forget the.threatening letter

187
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,478
A threatening letter!?

188
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,415
Oh that was nothing but a prank...

189
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,521
Hmm...but this could mean
his death was a murder...

191
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,755
A murder?

192
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:41,193
How can kill you someone
by carbon monoxide poisoning?

194
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,162
But you see, Mr. Mouri...

195
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,630
Detective Yokomizo?

196
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,199
Mr Kogoro always says that

197
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,034
the most important thing is
everyone's alibi, {isn't that right?

199
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,170
Yes, you're right Conan...

200
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,305
Well, does anyone have anything to say?

201
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,275
When that private detective over there
called Mr. Teraizumi,

203
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,876
he was still alive, wasn't he?
Od Br

205
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,714
We were all with that detective after that

206
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:08,087
that's right...the only ones missing were
Mr. Sagara and Suguro, over there...

208
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,455
Eh!? Are you talking about me?

209
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,791
Oh come on...
the only time I left everyone is...
Hisashi Suguro
flu,

213
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,192
Oh come on...
the only time I left everyone is...

215
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,327
to prepare for the opening ceremony

216
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,797
and that was for only 5 minutes,
from 10 to 10:05...

218
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:24,403
That's when we heard Ran scream
and we all ran out into the parking lot

220
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,173
I couldn't have killed him
In just 5 minutes!

222
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:29,975
You're right about that...

223
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,546
Mr. Sagara, you stated that
you were out for a drive?

225
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:41,153
That's right and it was Mr. Sagara
who found Mr.Teraizumi dead!

227
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,822
Mr. Sagara! Don't tell me it was you...

228
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,891
No,, ou're wrong! It wasn't me

229
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,295
I was on the veranda yesterday and
I heard Mr. Sagara talking on the telephone

231
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,432
Don't worry about it!!
I'll take care of it!

233
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,635
The opening ceremony's
at 3 tomorrow afternoon

235
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,904
Tonight's going to be our last chance...

236
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,841
that's right, don't worry

237
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,577
We're going ahead as scheduled,
understand...

239
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,582
Do you want to explain, Mr. Sagara?

240
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,556
The truth is, I borrowed
some money from a friend...

242
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:18,490
You borrowed money?

243
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:23,195
Yes...l was going to repay
Teraizumi and get my car back...

245
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,531
but I figured paying him back
wasn't good enough,

247
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,200
I was going to throw the money
In his face at the opening ceremony

249
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,202
and put his nose out of joint...

250
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,973
That's why I rushed to Tokyo
Iast night to get the money.

252
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,577
If you call my friend,
he'll confirm my story

254
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,981
It seems everyone has an alibi...

255
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,219
It must have been an accident after all

256
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,522
Excuse me, Detective...

257
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:56,094
I d like to put the Dino on display
In memory of Mr. Teraizumi.

259
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,629
Yes, you're right

260
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:01,266
We're done inspecting the crime scene,
I guess it'll be all right

262
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,001
Thank you very much!

263
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,938
If it wasn't Mr. Sagara...l wonder?

264
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,440
Last night, he...

265
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,045
Mr. Kuroiwa, excuse me...

266
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:14,580
Huh? What is it?

267
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,849
That guy fromethe crime lab
just told me that

269
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,586
the Dino's headlight cover was cracked...

270
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:25,090
Eh? Is that true?
It wasn't there yesterday,

272
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,426
and If Mr. Teraizumi hit something,

273
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,428
he'd have made a big fuss and
have it get it fixed right away

275
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,364
I knew it...

276
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,869
Mr. Teraizumi hit something
when he got back from his drive...

278
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,940
But how did the killer commit the murder?

279
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,378
Wh, what was that?
Are you sure about that?

281
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:50,649
Yes, I checked the parking lot
a little before 10

283
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,351
but Mr. Teraizumi's car wasn't there

284
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:56,822
But the fog was very thick,
maybe you overlooked it

286
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,125
No, I'd never make that mistake.

287
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,427
There was another car
parked in his space

289
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,696
Another car!?

290
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:09,568
Yes...l didn't get a good look because of
the fog, but I think it was gray

292
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:15,240
And I'd never heard that engine before so
I know it wasn't one of our regular guest

294
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:18,343
Then the car's engine was running

295
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:22,714
Yes, and I d recognize
Mr. Teraizumi's car engine anyfdlay

297
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,816
What does all that mean!

298
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:26,183
Detective Yokomizo

299
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:27,519
Please come with me

300
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,854
What's up...

301
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,188
That's it!!

302
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,392
Excuse me, Mr. Noda,
at that time, just by chance...

304
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,827
What!? Mr. Sagara did what!?

305
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,196
Yes, he said he'd repaid
the money he owed

307
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,365
so he was taking his car back right now...

308
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,069
Darn. .we ve already got our hands full!!

309
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,670
Let's go!!

310
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,170
Yes sir!

311
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,508
How'd you know that, kid!?

312
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,777
So I'm right!!

313
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,745
Yes, you sure are, kid

314
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,214
Now I know everything!!

315
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,818
I know why the tar was
broken off straight across...

317
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,555
and why that gray car was
in the parking lot!

319
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,558
And I've solved the mystery of
the cracked headlight and the fiber....!

321
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,729
I have all the answers now...

322
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:14,099
He's the killer!!

323
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,105
Wn Stop it, MreSagara!

324
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,106
You can't do this!

325
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,541
What do you mean!?

326
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,876
I just paid the money back
didn't 11?

328
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,412
I'm taking my car back
no matter what you say!!

330
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,247
Wait a minute Mr Sagara!

331
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,916
What's going on here?

332
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,120
I'm glad you're here.

333
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,790
Mr. Sagara insists on leaving with his car

334
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,425
We can't allow that.

335
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,729
You have to stay here
until we've cleared everyone

337
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:47,199
What do you mean,
wasn't it an accident?

339
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,569
Well, it appears it may not have been...

340
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,471
Did you find something?

341
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,474
When the security guard Mr. Noda
checked the parking lot a little before 10,

343
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,677
instead of Mr Teraizumi's car,

344
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:03,148
he claims that he saw
a gray car parked in his spot!

346
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,617
What!? That means...

347
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,219
oh boy

348
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,387
here we go again...

349
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:09,788
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

350
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,523
Mr. Mount???

351
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,427
I've finally figured everything out,
Detective Yokomizo.

353
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,498
What you just said confirmed it all

354
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,400
What do you mean...?

355
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,436
Mr. Teraizumi s death
was not an accident.

357
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,272
It was pre-meditated murder!!

358
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,680
Detective Yokomizo

359
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,049
before I start explaining
how the crime was committed,

361
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,984
I'd like you to prepare something

362
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,520
I understand. What do you need?

363
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:45,257
First, could you call Mr. Noda,
the security guard here

365
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,091
Go on...

366
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:46,825
Yes sir!

367
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,927
And another thing,

368
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,397
I need a large vinyl sheet If possible

369
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:56,568
one like the kind they use to cover cars...

370
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,570
A car cover.

371
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,572
If it's one of those, Suguro,

372
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:04,509
your car in the parking lot is
always covered, isn't it?

374
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,310
Uh, huh...

375
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,082
You have one!
Do you mind lending it to us?

377
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,984
Sure, no problem

378
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,062
Now that everything is ready, let us begin

379
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,200
When Mr. Teraizumi got back
from his drive,

381
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,435
the killer used a sleeping drug
to put him to sleep,

383
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:35,273
then put him behind the wheel of the Dino
and left him there with the engine running

385
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,343
Hah, that leaves me out.

386
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:46,518
When I left for Tokyo,
Mr. Tieraizumi wasn't back yet!

388
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,520
I wouldn't be so sure about that

389
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:49,488
What!?

390
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,726
No one saw Mr. Teraizumi return

391
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:59,731
So can you prove
he didn't get back before you left?

393
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,799
How dare you!?

394
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Just calm down...

395
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,669
Let me remind you Mr Mourn,

396
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,605
when Mr. Noda the security guard

397
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,307
made his rounds shortly
before the body was found,

399
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,944
he claims Mr. Teraizumi's car was
not in the parking lot

401
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:18,984
But in truth, it was already there when
Mr.Noda checked the parking lot

403
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,320
He s already stated
there was a gray car in that space...

405
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:26,825
And that car was Mr. Teraizumi's!

406
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,161
What was that!?

407
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,798
Uh, but still Mr. Noda said
the engine wasn't Mr. Teraizumi's

409
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:33,565
Yes,

410
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:39,571
That engine wasn't Mr. Teraizumi's Dino.
It was another car!

412
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,773
Alright Detective Yokomizo,

413
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,776
turn the 1 nition on

415
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,578
Alright

416
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,946
Yes sir

417
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,155
Mr. Mouri, the engine's running

418
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,825
OK .how about it, Mr. Noda

419
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,364
it's not the same, that's not
the car I heard in the parking lot

421
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:12,237
Now, Detective Yokomizo
could you cover the Dino with that cover

423
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,841
This cover?

424
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,111
All right Mr. Noda

425
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,380
Listen very carefully

426
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,181
All nght

427
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,227
Thus IS it!

428
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,528
This is the engine I heard!!

429
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,663
Are you sure!?

430
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,333
But why cover the car

431
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,203
I've got 1it!! That's why the window...

432
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,807
That's right!
That's why the window was down...

434
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,143
so that the exhaust fumes
would enter the car!

436
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,948
After the killer put Mr. Teraizumi to sleep

437
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,718
he lowered the window

438
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,120
then covered the car

439
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,659
and anchored it down securely
so that the fumes wouldn { escape

441
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:11,129
Does everyone remember

442
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,634
Mr: Teraizumi's last words
over the telephone...

444
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,574
Oh...hello Mr Teraizumi?

445
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,511
W's me, Mourn . Where are you?

446
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,314
Ugh, wh wheream ll 7?

447
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,983
It's, it's pitch dark...

448
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,585
Pitch dark!?

449
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:41,026
I've got it! Mr. Teraizumi said it was dark
because the car was covered!

451
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,928
That's right.

452
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:48,666
And the exhaust fumes trapped
under the cover

454
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,670
entered the car through the open window

455
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:54,372
causing him to die of
carbon monoxide poisoning

457
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,475
Then the killer waited
until the right moment,

459
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,844
returned to the car,
and took the cover off leaving us with

461
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,381
what he thought to be the perfect crime...

462
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:08,286
But then something the killer
didn't anticipate occurred!

464
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,756
And what was that?

465
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:16,695
One, Mr Noda saw the car
with the cover on...

467
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,701
It was coincidence that you went to the
parking lot at that time, wasn't it?

470
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,401
1 CO,

471
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:28,440
Mr. Kuroiwa had asked me to look for
Mr. Teraizumi, that's why I went there...

473
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,576
The second thing was Ran"s scream...

474
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,411
Huh my scream...?

475
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:38,249
Yes, I'm sure the killer had gone
to take the cover off,

477
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,820
but when Ran screamed he got scared

478
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,622
and forgot to close the window...!

479
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,993
Which means, that the killer,

480
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,997
is the person who arrived
Iast where Ran was

482
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,906
Suguro, it was you!!

483
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,445
Ka ..Suguro...

484
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,384
You can't be serious

485
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,320
Just because I arrived late
when your daughter screamed

487
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,921
don't make me out to be the killer...

488
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,959
Suguro, explain
the stain on your trousers

490
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,632
The stain IS from the wine
you spilled on them last night...

492
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,701
That's night

493
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:33,972
but when you brought
the room service order to our room...

495
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,576
I'm very sorry about
ruining your pants earlier

497
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:42,313
No problem...it was nothing.
I changed right away

499
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,785
So why did you change back
Into a pair of stained trousers?

501
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,120
That's none of your business

502
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:52,690
The head lamp on Mr Teraizumi's car

503
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,661
was cracked and
- -ell -
Some « er Was Suc oO.

506
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,698
when Mr. Teraizumi returned

507
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,901
you stopped his car
and it accidentally hit your knee

509
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:07,137
and it tore your trousers, didn't it?

510
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,377
You're just making everything up...

511
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,545
Mr. Noda,

512
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:19,184
when you saw the strange car in the
parking lot, why didn't you check it out?

514
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:23,688
Well Suguro told me
to check the front entrance

516
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:24,722
He's lying!!

517
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:27,992
Please check under Suguro's car cover

518
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,929
Iook at the part that goes over the muffler

519
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,866
you should find some black liquid on it?

520
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,935
Some time has past, hasn't it!

521
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,208
I found it! A black stain
just hike you said, Mr. Mourn!

523
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,143
At the scene of the crime,

524
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:49,280
we found stains from the tar
that flowed out of the Dino s muffler

526
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:55,553
It looked like it was cut off straight
across, as if it had been blocked off...!

528
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,423
I'm sure when we have it analyzed,

529
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,693
we'll find the composition
of the stains are identical...

531
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,128
What have you got to say, Katssuro?

532
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,698
Are you going to insist you're innocent?

533
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,339
OK you got me!! I killed Teraizumi!

534
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,743
That Dino...was once MY car.

535
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,213
But he cheated me out of it!!

536
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:25,216
You killed him over something like that...

537
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,385
Something like that!?

538
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,755
Don't put me In the same boat
as those rich good for nothings!

540
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,225
That car was about to be scrapped
en go 1, sacriice my OO money

543
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:38,496
and worked hard on it to get it
Iooking like it does now.

00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,166

Getting there was so much fun

591
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,296
but when it comes time to leave,

593
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:22,834
Like they same, getting there is
half the fun but leaving is horrible

595
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:26,070
I guess we should have take the eat
all you can Shabu shabu dinner after all

597
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:32,076
Hey dad, maybe we should have asked
Detective Yokomizo to drive us.,

599
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:39,784
That rat! He didn't even offer! #8

600
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,289
Are you coming down with a cold, sir?

601
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,091
I don't know, I suddenly felt a chill...

602
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,960
Take care of yourself

603
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,962
I've never caught a cold

604
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:51,695
