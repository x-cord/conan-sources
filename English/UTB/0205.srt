1
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,120
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,921
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,192
Officers always busy at work
Take time out between cases for love

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,160
He sees through the one and only truth.

7
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,862
A child in appearance with
the I.Q. of an adult,

9
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,097
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan

11
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,873
uh, fuh. fun...

12
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:32,418
There, that's a good boy...grow...

13
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:39,358
grow huger...
and leave the claws of flames behind...

15
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:02,882
Just once more, just once
more and the eve will be over...

17
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:03,916
Hmm?!

18
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:09,888
This rotten town will be lighted.up:.
Th crimson flames...

20
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:15,528
And the beautiful carnival shall begin...

21
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,433
ee, hee, hee...

22
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,474
Ayumi?

23
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,310
What are you doing?
H, mother...

25
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,678
me on, let's go home...

26
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,279
Okay!

27
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:48,994
TA AA
Love Story At Headquarters-Ill
PART I

30
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,931
Metropolitan Police Department

31
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:53,632
I see...

32
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,369
And how did the eyes of the man

33
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,142
he had eyes like a fox

34
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,344
It was like this!!

35
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:10,316
His eyes were-slanted...
ybe...

37
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,451
He looked like this?

38
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,386
His is completely different...

39
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,921
Oh. - really?!

40
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,623
You re not a very goodz:drawer,
are you...

42
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,092
That's no better than a child's doodling...

43
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,294
Isn't there anyone
who can draw better...?

45
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,896
It can't be helped

46
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:27,099
because Mr. Tomogawa,
the onein charge is out sick!!

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,567
Whaaa...

49
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:29,969
Excuse me...

50
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,338
But... Ms. Sato.

51
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,340
Yes?

52
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,342
We can't pass this sketch

53
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,411
around to the investigation officers,
I don't think...

55
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,479
Well,

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,383
I guess it does have a sort of
Interesting touch to it, however...

58
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:50,022
Oh=~.so what, are you two going to
sketch for me instead?!

60
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,992
Uh, well, I don't thinks so, I can't draw...

61
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,561
I only draw abstract...

62
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,696
Agh, Inspector Shiraton!!

63
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,499
Dirty rat!

64
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:06,939
Agh! Besides, we're not really sure if the
man she saw is really the arsonist yet...

66
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:11,043
What?! Are you saying that Ayumi is lying?

67
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,013
Don't take us lightly because we're kids!

68
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:19,451
But, it's not like you saw
the guy actually cause the fire, is it?

70
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,953
No doubt about it!
Huh?!

72
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,157
He was wearing a leather jacket
despite this hot weather.

74
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:30,663
He had gloves on
and his pants smelled of kerosene

76
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,098
as he loitered around the back alley
fire took place,

78
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,434
and was grinning.

79
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:40,105
It would be more difficult not to suspect
him of being the arsonist.

81
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,307
Well...?1

82
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,008
0713

83
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,411
t's right, isn't it, Ayumi...

85
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,413
All right...

86
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,482
Let's head off to that back alley,

87
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,284
and check the place out!

88
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,019
You're going to check the site

89
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:56,689
I'll go with you.

90
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,592
Et me take you in my car...

91
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,861
Okay...
but I have to stop over some place first...

93
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,930
It's on the way to the site, anyway...

94
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,999
What?!

95
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,735
Today is a special day for me...

96
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,804
A special day...?!

97
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,240
Your birthday or something?

98
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,708
No...

99
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:17,743
he opposite...

100
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,078
The opposite?!

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,021
I wonder where's sheis stopping over...?

102
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,890
A special day...

103
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:52,177
Oh I see, now I remember...

104
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,514
Today is...Police Commissioner,

105
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,716
Her father's memorial...

106
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,852
The day that he died on duty...

107
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,854
Oh? It is?

108
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:02,921
Eah...

109
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,391
It was exactly 18 years ago today...

110
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,695
When he was going after a robber...
this intersection...

112
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,363
At this intersection?

113
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:16,468
Yes, he was run over by a truck
this intersection...

115
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:18,370
Unfortunately,

116
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,640
it was raining hard that day
so the ambulance arrived late...

118
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:26,612
Inspector Megure told me that the
Commissioner died in the ambulance

120
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,015
that Ms Sato rode along in
with his family watching over him...

122
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,219
If I remember correctly...
the name of the case was...

124
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,155
hushiro...

125
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:36,789
What?!

126
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,326
Right!
Hushiro!! Shushiro...

128
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,062
The officer who was run over
by the truck...

130
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,297
repeated that name over and over

131
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,099
towards the person
hat fled from the scene...

133
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,834
Because of this mysterious name...

134
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,103
this case was name The Shushiro Case,

135
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,441
and an all out investigation network
that saw no precedent was set up...

137
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,078
However, since the officer
who was thought to have the key

139
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,713
to the case passed away...

140
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:05,084
the case remained stagnant...
And expired 3 years ago.

142
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,755
That's what Pops told me!

143
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,059
Yeah...I've seen that case repeatedly
Nn TV sol know about it too...

145
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,661
Oooh, that was close, real close...

146
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,797
It was a crime
that was carefully thought out

148
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,966
that the only clue was the 10 second
image of the robber

150
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,570
on the surveillance monitor of the bank
that was robbed...

152
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,173
Nobody even knows
how thelofficer who died

154
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,775
duty was able to specify the criminal

155
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:32,510
The case was thrown into oblivion
and is still unsolved...

157
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,380
But...

158
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:38,250
I had no idea that the officer back then
as Ms. Sato's father...

160
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,885
It can't be helped...

161
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,154
Although the name of the case...

162
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,456
And the name of the criminal remain
in the minds of people...

164
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,993
Nobody except police personnel...

165
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,564
could ever be expected to member
the name of the officer

167
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,466
who died on duty In the case...

168
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,601
Ms. Sato...

169
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:02,174
Well, after all we're not doing our job
because we want to be remembered so...

172
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,009
But...

173
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,279
maybe the driver-of the truck saw
who the robber was?

178
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,717
The robber was wearing a long raincoat,

179
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,420
but we don't-even know
If the person was a man or woman.

181
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,755
Even in the picture taken by the
surveillance camera the robber was

183
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:20,325
wearing a cap, sunglasses...
a mask and coat...

185
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,228
But, the name of the criminal was know,
wasn't it?

187
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,663
That was Shushiro?

188
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,532
There was nobody by that name

189
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,601
that was capable
committing the crime...

191
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,440
Well...l guess that
case was bound to go unsolved...

193
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,476
Because all the police had to
go on were three clues...

195
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,745
The picture left on
the surveillance camera,

197
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,746
the fact that a raincoat was
worn and the name Shushiro.

199
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,713
There were four!!

201
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,152
The fourth clue was written in
my father's police l.D. memo book,

203
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,355
three mysterious letters written in
atakana...

205
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,957
KA-N-O'...

206
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,525
KA-N-O?

207
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,094
Hat's a first...

208
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:00,299
The police seemed to have kept
It from being disclosed...

210
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,837
It was deduced that the word was deeply
involved with the case,

212
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,974
so my mother and I were
repeatedly asked,

214
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,109
Did you ever hear
Masayoshi say this word?

216
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,711
And?

217
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,080
I've never even heard him say it
and besides,

219
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,981
I don't have any idea
what it means either...

221
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,650
When I was a child I used to...

222
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,553
glare at the three letters,
and always thought...

224
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:26,225
that if anyone ever appears
and nabs Shushiro

226
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,327
I would grant that person's every wish!

227
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:30,229
Huh?

228
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:30,562
Huh?

229
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,197
Grant every...

230
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:33,298
VVIOoltl...

231
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:39,137
If I find out will you treat me to
a thousand eel over rice bowls?

233
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:40,305
Yes, of course!

234
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,609
I d llke 10...
Iive in the castle at Tropical Land...

236
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,479
I'd like a boarding pass
to the International Space Station...

238
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:51,517
I'd like a brand name bag...

239
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,420
C,Could I have the ticket to
the next World Cup Soccer game?

242
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,855
IF VCO...

244
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,792
OCT...
how frightening, they're so realistic,

246
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:01,527
hmm. [J

247
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,295
What if the matter with you two...?

248
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,097
Hmm &

250
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,369
Oh, flowers...

251
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,336
Huh?

252
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,440
Aah...

253
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,209
It's been a long time
since I've seen you last!

255
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,345
Oh Is it you Miwako?

256
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,980
You've really grown to be
a nice woman...

258
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,715
Do you know each other?

259
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:24,550
Yes...

260
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,385
he used to be on the same high school
baseball team as my father!

I'm a 50 year old middle

301

What brings you all here today?

302
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,815

so we've decided to
get together for a drink...

306
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,553
But, before we go,
we came to say hello to

308
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,323

the captain of our team...

310
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,158
Oh, I see...

311
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,394
He sulks if we don't ask him
to come along too...

313
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,832
We re going to the pub

We're going to the pub

So why don't you pop by too, Miwako...?
Yes...Shiratori here...

320
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,168
So why don t you pop by too, Miwako...?

321
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,836
Oh, Inspector Megure...

322
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,172
Huh? Now?

323
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,308
We are at 4-chome Haido-cho... :

324
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:25,444
Huh?!

325
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,380
A suspicious person who looks to
be an arsonist was witnessed?!

327
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,385
Right!
The address is 6-chome Shinagawa.

329
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,456
The officer who was on patrol was
questioning him, when he fled!

331
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,257
They're in the midst of pursuing him now!

332
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,996
He has long hair, is wearing
an hat and a gray coat.

334
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,431
He seems to be near where you are now!

335
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,067
Leave the children to officer Sato.

336
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,270
You and Takagi
head for the site on the double!

338
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,240

Agh?! Oh no!!

346
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,323
Officer Takagi!!

347
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,827
The handcuffs... I left the handcuffs on
the desk of the 1 section at the station...

349
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,362
Hey, hey...

350
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,331
we've got no time to go back and get it,
you know...

352
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,600
Are you all right, officer Takagi...?

353
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,004
I'm okay...if worse comes to worse,
officer Shiratori has his...

355
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,240
and besides, my fortune in the magazine,

356
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,709
it said today is
a super lucky day for me...

359
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,047
I can do without handcuffs,
he's only an arsonist...

361
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,084
Please be careful, dear...

362
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:43,288
Don't worry! According to today's fortune,
I'm supposed to be super lucky...

364
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,026
Hun 7
Father forgot to take the handcuffs...

366
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,899
Huh? M My husband...
My husband was run over by a car?!

368
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,435
And, where is he now?!

369
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,442
It's not right...Why...

370
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,845
Father is. ..fighting for justice and yet...

371
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,816
He's fighting against the bad, and yet...
Why...

373
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:15,353
You idiot. .the word "justice".

374
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,623
The word "justice...

375
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,826
Officer Sato?!... Officer Sato?

376
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,427
Huh?...Oh...

377
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,995
Are you all right?!

378
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:24,796
Yes...

379
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,735
We ll be on our way, then...
Please take care of the children!

381
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,603
Uh, wait...

382
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,371
Please-wait-Officer Takagi!ls

383
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,174
Officer Takagi!
Oh yes?!

385
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,250
Huh?

386
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,292
These handcuffs sure are rusty...

387
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,995
If you don't have your handcuffs,
take those!

389
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,297
Okay...

390
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,767
hose are my father's keepsake...

391
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,739
I broke my handcuffs during
Mr. Hi ashida's case

393
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,942
so I was...
using those for a while.

395
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,111
They're just right as
a lucky charm for you!

397
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,784
C,Charm...
I thought your father died on duty...

399
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,919
Just take them, okay...

400
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,654
Be careful both of you.

401
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:23,488
Agh, Officer Sato.

402
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,322
Officer Takagi,

403
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,190
Oh...yes sir...

404
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,727
Bye...

405
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,169
What's going on?

406
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,006
Why be armed with a gun
when,dealing with a mere arsonist. %?

408
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:45,710
Well... .they're both officers of the
violent crime investigation section...

410
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,747
I don't see why they have to go
after the arsonist...

412
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,349
A stabbed body was found,

413
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,819
near the fourth site of the
fire set by the arsonist!...

415
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:58,323
We don't have proof, but the victim...
most likely witnessed the crime...

417
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,426
or tried to stop the arsonist
and was stabbed.

419
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:06,765
That's what we suspect!
So, I want you all to stay close to me!

421
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,000
O Okay...

422
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:21,513
Shinagawa Station

423
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,616
Oh, Inspector Shiratori here!

424
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:29,688
We just caught the suspicious man who
was on the run...at Shingawa Station!

426
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,857
No I'm not the one!

427
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,191
However...Inspector!

428
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,094
He insists that he is not
the arsonist... but, just a thief...

430
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,995
Huh?
He insists that he is not
the arsonist... but, just a thief...

433
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,129
He insists that he is not
the arsonist... but, just a thief...

435
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:42,634
I get it! So that's what it was...

436
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,836
I've solved the mystery!!

437
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,038
Today is my lucky day after all...

438
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,740
Okay, I'm going to call Officer Sato...

439
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,574
Officer Takag:.

440
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:50,742

Yes, yes, this is the one.

451
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,164
I was buying this toy of Kamen Yaiba,
when a weird man...

00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,400
ame out of there...

454
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:16,601

Oh. Officer Takagi... l
So, what with the suspicious man...?

458
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,518
What?! You've figured out
the criminal of 18 years ago?!

460
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,423
1 CO...
according to my deductions... most likely,

462
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:44,829
Listen to this...... he was there...... today.
Mong the people that we met...

464
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:46,865
That person...

465
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,233
Agh?!

466
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,770

467
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,807

468
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:00,078
A,Ah come off it...give me a break!!

469
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,692
Yes...Yes...that's right!

470
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,927
I've figured everything out!

471
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,831
The true meaning of Shushiro too...
he secret of kanno as well...

473
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:28,606
now I know why your father...found out
and was able to specify the killer.

475
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,410
Although the case has
already expired...

477
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:36,448
And? Who... Who is it!
Who is the killer?!

479
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,952

Yes, Shiratori here...
Oh Y Officer Sato,

495
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,746
the suspect was just taken
to the Shingawa Police Station...

497
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,416
Huh, Officer Takagi?

498
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,319
Yes... I was with him. just 4
to 5 minutes ago.

500
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:51,122
Then the place and time
where you last saw him...

502
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,258
call headquarters and give
the central command room the info!!

504
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:53,825
What?

505
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,660
Officer Takagi's been attacked
by someone!!!

507
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,896
Just a while ago while he was talking to
me on the cell phone!!

509
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,166
The attacker may be the arsonist
that we're after so please be careful!

511
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,169
Uh...Officer Takagi was attacked just
when he was about to tell you

513
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,373
who the killer of 18 years ago was,right?

514
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,707
Hen...the killer is...

515
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,412
No...
because that case expired 3 years ago...

517
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:18,416
and we can't even be sure
if Officer Takagi's deduction is right.

519
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,286
You know the four
that we met at sundown...

521
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,822
They were saying they were going to
drink at the pub they usually go to, but...

523
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,290
where is it?

524
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,724
Here...

525
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,462
The name of the pub is..."Nanamagari.

526
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,464
It's located...

527
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,333
In front of Shinagwa Sation...

528
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,539
If Officer Takagi said
that he saw the killer of 18 years ago

530
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,175
mong the four that we met...

531
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,278
then somebody within that group who
was also in front of Shinagawa Station

533
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,882
could've coincidentally
heard his conversation with you...

535
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:55,753
The killer may have attacked
Officer Takagi to shut:him up, right...?

537
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,759
I'm going to head off to
Shinagawa Station...

00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,597
so you all go home by train and
come to headquarters again tomorrow...

541
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:12,670
But the one who attacked Officer
Takagi may also be the arsonist, right?

543
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,541
Then, I. don't see why
you're not taking Ms. Yoshida's

who's the only one
who witness the criminal...

548
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,848
