Don't worry!

31
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:02,447
They don't have any speed traps here
and I'm'being very careful toe...

33
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,950
Hey. fool!

34
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,921
What you gotta be careful of is
not the police/but the speedometer!

36
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,126
Could I ask you something?

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,261
Huh...What is it?

38
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,598
Where are we headed?

39
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,833
It's about time you tell us!

40
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:23,569
Please!

41
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,740
To-a.place that you'd all leve to go!

42
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,376
Gee, how mean...

43
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,379
MrsfEdogawa!

44
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:38,684
I told you that she's not my mother,
but a middle aged relative™of mine...

46
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,392
She's my older sister...

51
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,037
Se oe

52
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,539
Hello?

53
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,708
What's wrong with calling her middle aged,
when that's what she is...

55
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:03,208
Huh

56
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,510
Oh. Mr. Karata!

57
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,513
Huh

58
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:13,318
You're having trouble with the timing
and the time for Zero may be delayed?!

60
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,687
Okay. okay...

61
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,957
We're on our way there, so I'll see you!

65
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,633
What is this Zero about?

66
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,736
The number of a robot or something?

67
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,604
Come on, please tell us!! (

68
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,073
It's a secret.

69
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:40,045
What!! Stingy-! What's the big deal!

70
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:40,612
We're probably just

71
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,516
going to see the prerelease of "Kamen
Yaiba the Movie II" or something, right?

73
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,183
Huh?

74
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,953
Is that true?

75
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,271
Wow-~~!!

76
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,056
4 I want to see it! I really want to see it!

77
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,158
Here goes. Joker!!!

78
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,364
Kame, Yaiba

79
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,975
How did you...

80
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:13,778
figure out.that we were going to the see
the prerelease of Kamen Yaiba...?

82
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,884
Because timing means adjusting
the color of the images and

84
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,987
zero means a film that
has just been made.

86
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:28,410
Both words are a jargon of
the movie and drama industry.

88
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,094
Then,

89
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:34,566
That's how I figured out it must
be "Kamen Yaiba the Movie".

91
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:36,268
Oh...

92
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,604
Since we get to see zero'...

94
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,474
It probably means the release
date is coming soon,

96
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,744
ge'!
SO they're going to use "zero
for the prerelease, right?

99
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,312
Right!

100
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,780
Just as expected of you!

101
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,318
Hey, the signal's changed
to green some time ago!

103
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:53,685
Huh»?

104
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,953
No: joke...

105
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,757
«Oh no, it's changed to yellow!

106
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,991
I'm sorry...

107
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,526
How absentminded of me...

108
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,576
Hey! Cut it out, will you!

109
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,311
You got children in the car, you know!!

110
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,513
Okay! Okay!

111
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,987
Hey, wow!

112
00:06:29,105 --> 00:06:31,490
It's like we're riding a jet coaster!

114
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:34,893
Ouch!

115
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,263
Hey!!

116
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,070
Conan. your mother is sure a lot of fun!

117
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,340
Keep telling you she's...

118
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,782
So; this is the Toto Processing Station...

119
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,350
It has a very long history...)

120
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,722
It has walked the path along
with the movies of Japan.

122
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,924
Come on, lets: go.

123
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,294
Behave yourselves, okay.

124
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,096
Okay"!

125
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,206
Hey th Ye. Yukiko. Long time no see!!

126
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,476
You're as beautiful... as ever!

127
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,911
Yes. of course.

128
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,146
You haven't changed
a bit yourself Mr. Karata...

130
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,581
Oh, that's right.

131
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,417
He's Mr. Katsuta the one who's going to

132
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,786
show us.the-newly made
Kamen Yaiba movie!

134
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,688
Nice to meet you!

135
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,090
He's the timing man and

136
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,094
he finishes all my movies with nice colors!

137
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:43,662
Right!!

138
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,498
Huh

139
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:47,999
Whichemeans...

140
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,669
Did you used to be an actress?

142
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,270
Yes.

143
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:59,344
Maybe I was
adored by your mother and father.

145
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,213
What?

146
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:01,913
No joke!

147
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:02,948
Really?

148
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,485
I see...

149
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:06,985
Huh?

150
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,655
Your power of deduction was
handed down. from your father I see...

152
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,790
Liking to stand out,

153
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,328
your confidence the acting talent that you
display when using the voice changer...

155
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:21,533
Moreover, your dangerous character of
acting on impulse when angered...

157
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,003
you inherited from your mother...

158
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,839
Well, sorry...

159
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,374
And?

160
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,743
When will you be able to)
show the zero preview?

162
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,446
Well, I think it's going to take a while yet...

163
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,016
I think we can manage to get it
done around 7.00 p.m. though...

165
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,519
I'm sorry, but could you
wait around till then?

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,687
You can takefa tour around
this place'if you like...

169
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:43,455
Okay!

170
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,426
Mr. Hojima and Mr. Megami!

171
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:54,332
Do me a favor and show:Yukiko
and the kids inside the processing station?

173
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,867
Sure...

174
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,269
Okay!

175
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,226
This is the preview room where you'll
all be watching the movie later!

177
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,213
Wow -----1! It's like a theater!

178
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,481
I want to see it quick

179
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,420
This is the dark room! This is the room
where you check for scratches

181
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:20,625
and spots before putting
the film through the developing machine!

183
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,765
And this is the developing machine
for the 35 mm films!

185
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,433
Well? Isn't it interesting
with all the machines around?

187
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,769
Yes!

188
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,171
It's' like a laboratory!

189
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,643
What's this sound?

190
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,781
It's a warning telling us
not to open'the double door

192
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,717
because someone's
going Into the: dark room

194
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,321
While the film is being checked

195
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,257
even a slight amount of light with
over expose the film and damage it!

197
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,860
After the film is checked, Mr. Megam/
here is the man who makes

199
00:09:55,962 --> 00:10:00,665
the negatives by putting the films
through the developing machine

201
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,970
Then,
I make his negatives into positive prints!

203
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,371
Oh...

204
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:12,177
Then, the films are edited and
dubbed with sounds, the timing man,

206
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:16,014
Mr. Karata who you met earlier adjusts
the color and the finishing touches!

208
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:18,016
Oh...

209
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,219
How come only you don't have
man" at the end of the job you do?

211
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,287
Huh?

212
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,624
Come to think of it,
we don't say, print man...

214
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,159
Right...

215
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,962
Could it be that-you-re weak?

216
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,968
W.Weak...I'm not a transforming hero
or anything lik" tba you; know...

218
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,171
Oops.it's almest™6:40 p.m...

219
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,241
Shall we go into the preview room then?

220
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,976
I guess so...

221
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:49,380
It's going to take a while
to see that preview!

223
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,851
But Mr. Karata told us a while ago
that it would be, ready about 7:00...

225
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:58,056
According to Karate.
He says it'll take till about 11:00

227
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:01,659
It's going to run that late...

228
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,865
Well, I guess it doesn't concern me
cuz I goofed and I'm out of work...

230
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,068
You sure look sleepy!

231
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,536
Did you play mahjong again?

232
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:12,337
Sort of...

233
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,739
But...what a fix...

235
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,207
What seems to be the matter?

236
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,077
I won't be able to make my flight back
if it's going to be 11:00,

238
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:25,150
I can't make the children stay here
till that late, besides .

240
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:29,821
Then
shall I watch the children in my room?

242
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,423
Huh?

243
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,092
My condo is right clo. 8 by...

244
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,895
They can sleepgthere
until it's time for the pré-iew.

246
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,029
Then I'll take them home by car
after they finish watching!

248
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,367
Okay...Could I ask you to do so?

249
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,638
Are you going to imakethe children sleep
in that sloppy room?

251
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,308
How rude...
It may be sloppy. but it's not filthy

253
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,112
Well, it's only
if the children want to though...

255
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,048
Let's stay over and watch-it,
okay Conan?!

257
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,851
Bedsides, tomoerroldis: Sunday 32

258
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:04,789
We can boast about it to the other kids
in school too!Okay, Conan?!

260
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:11,730
Okay, then call. your folks and
tell them that you're going to be late!

262
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,933
Okay!!We did it!! All right!

263
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:22,407
Okay then, let's get work over with
and take: a snooze too then!

265
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,709
Right! We'd better get ourselves ready

266
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,912
for the usual film completion celebration
all- night mahjong game, man!

268
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,582
What's an all-night mahjong game man?

269
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,717
Does it have something to do with
the developing man?

271
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,454
It means we're going to
play mahjong all night!

273
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:39,924
What?

274
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,994
What's with you!You sure are
popular with girls, aren't you!

276
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:46,464
Oh Ayumi...

277
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,066
And the other girl too...

278
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,536
Ms. Haibara...

279
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:52,887
What?!

280
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,142
She...stared at you at least
10 times today!!

282
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:01,513
Ha.ha...l guess she was watching
the growth process of the guinea pig

284
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,883
who drank the drug she made.

285
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,887
How Ty! Girls look at boys...

286
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,923
either because there's something
on his face or because...

288
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,359
she's in love with the boy!

290
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,363
No way...

291
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:25,170
I hope you got rid of that car
that was tailing us on our way here!

293
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,273
Oh, so you noticed them too, Shinichi?

294
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,408
@f course...

295
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,279
You were stoppedwall-the while the traffic
signal changed from green to yellow,

297
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,683
butitheicar behind us
didn't"even toot.a horn.

299
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:42,821
In other words.
They didn't want us to notice them...

301
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,490
That is, they were tailing us!

302
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:51,362
They were tailing us for quite some time...

303
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,099
Right... thought so too.

304
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,570
So I was planning to take off
as soon as the light turned red...

306
00:13:58,938 --> 00:13:59,904
I wonder who they are?

307
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:06,311
Well...if that car was after me...

310
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:12,550
it's highly likely that it 'those guys...

311
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:18,223
Those guys that shrunk my body
The probability is high

313
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,693
that they are the men in black...

314
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:37,275
if that car was after me...

315
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,745
it's highly likely that it's those guys

316
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,016
Those guys that shrunk m body
The probability is high

318
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,552
that they are the men in black...

319
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,989
Hmm.

320
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,195
Nos .there is another possibility...

322
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,767
The person who is riding that car...

323
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,173
is a great fine of mine!!

324
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,580
That person probably wanted to kn
where I live and get my autograph!

326
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,516
Oh my-poor thing

327
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,652
I sure hope so...

328
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,389
You'd better protect them nice and good,

329
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,791
because you're all they've got...

330
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,526
Yeah...

331
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,929
I Know...

332
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,612
See you then, everybody!

333
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,415

and go home safely!

335
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,351
Okay! Thank you!

336
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,353
Oh, that's right!!

337
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:56,955
Uh, come here...

338
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,558
Huh? What is it?!

339
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,094
And the girl that was staring at you...

340
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,496
Make sure you escort her all the way,
and see that she gets home safely

342
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,100
I know.get off my back...

343
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,769
You're going to be late for your flight...

344
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,506
Oh. right. see you then, Shin-chan!

345
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,176
I'll see you all some time again!

346
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:46,220
T,This is...

348
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,795
It's way messier than I imagined it to be...

349
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,064
Don't you know how to clean up...

350
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,871
Hmm~~~Okay then,

00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,275
Ugh!

370
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,677
This room is messy too...

371
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,279
You can say that again!!

372
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,416

381
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:21,566

Lord of Potatoes right?

They're fast asleep...

404
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,745
It can't be helped...

405
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,747
They're children...

406
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:44,882

407
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,030

Huh

00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,245
Guaaah!!

00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,986
