But his luck makes others envious.

4
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,260

45
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,025

56
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,339
I think...

So beautiful!

60
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:35,547
Hmm?

61
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,752
He won the lottery ticket...

62
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:43,388
Really.

63
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,023
The lottery ticket too. huh...

64
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,191
He must be lucky.

65
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,293
He's too lucky, man!

66
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,261

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:55,200
it"was last week that he won
Union Beer too, Mom told me.

70
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,270

and a digital camera within a week...

81
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,507
He won money, Union Beer,

00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,108
he won money, Union Beer,
and a digital camera within a week...

86
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,309
ALL within a week!

87
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,445
What is going on? *

88
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm home!

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,285
Yes!

90
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,586
Yeah!

91
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,254

92
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,022
I got it!

93
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:17,990
Hm!)

97
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,560
Oh. come on Union Beer...
You can't do this!

99
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,830
Pops...

100
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,865
What happened:to them?

101
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,600
I thought I got this letter 'cause I won,

102
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,072
but it was actually a letter of apology
that the drawing had been.postponed,

104
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:34,673
damn it!

106
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,042
The drawing had been postponed?

107
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,410
Yeah. truel!

108
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:39,244
But then...

109
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,347
What did Dr. Owada win?

110
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:47,352
THE LUCKY MAN'S SUSPENSE

111
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,942
Dr. O@wada didn't win the prize!?

112
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:54,225
Yeah

113
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,861
It AN Not be true...

114
00:04:56,428 --> 00:04:59,197
Because the drawing is
postponed till next month...

116
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,400
oure right...

117
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,735
If this is what's really happening

118
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,837
then the rest of the prizes
cannot be real too.

122
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,139
WW; At do. ou mean?

128
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:07,706
ba? LU 4

132
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,275
it's true that he On the lottery. I saw it!

135
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,644
think it's also true
that he w 7 the digital camera!

139
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,246
We saw it, right!?

140
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:15,614
Es, ll did...

141
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,317
And you guys all saw it too...

142
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:19,835
BUT. not the exact moment...

143
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,058
(Eh. cheatingr

145
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,328
Hey. can you stay here?

146
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:30,996
OK. this way...

148
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:39,971
I admit. that I

149
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,073
cheated a bit...

150
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:42,240
Ildid it:.

151
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,112
Alright. go ahead!

152
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,626
Here goes the winner! The third prize!

153
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,564
So-it was

154
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,032
cheating

155
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:07,966
Its not fair!

156
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,600
Just as I thought...

157
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,670
Oh, but the doctor doesn't know this!

158
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,073
#iThis was actually,
Ce his wife's request...

160
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:15,907
What!?

161
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,043
The doctor's wife's request. you said?

162
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,244
Right

163
00:06:19,327 --> 00:06:23,281
She asked me to give him
the third prize when he came over.

165
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:26,118
She said she wanted to cheer him up

166
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,186
since he had lost confidence
as a doctor...

168
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,257
Dr. Qwada saved my life before,

169
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,493
so Irwanted to: help him too

170
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,828
So you did it to return the favor...

171
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,431
But'it's still cheating!

172
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,235
That digital camera could have been
given to somebody else, right!?

174
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:43,835
Well.

175
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,871
Actually: the doctor's
wife.brought the camera,

177
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,873
when she came over to the tent.

178
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:48,407
What!

179
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,542
She brought it herself?

180
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,143
So that means.

181
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,246
Mrs. Owada gave you
the digital camera she bought.

183
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,316
And you gave itt ) Dr. Owadayamiisight?

184
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,386
Yeah: Nobody was victim,
even if it was atcheating.

186
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:02,653
Then...

187
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,991
This isn't a crime. is 1t?

188
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:08,693
I asked him!?

189
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,963
NO, I didnate
I @idnrt-ask Kim. to doithat.

193
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,833
the guy said the doctor's wife came...

196
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,769
Ok. first.of all. my husband is
doingipretty well at-work.

198
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,137
Hmmm,

199
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,339
e lost confidence as a doctor...

200
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,609
No. It can't be!

202
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,845
Why is it so different...?

207
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:27,813
It's weird

209
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,614
Yeah, it is...

211
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:34,786
I heard that you won Union Beer.
Is that true?

213
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,088
I heard there's been a rumor like that,

214
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,090
but that's not true either

215
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:42,093
because neither of us can drink.

216
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,697
There's no need for us
to send the letter in the first place.

221
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,966
Notieven the letter. "huh?

222
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:52,971
I think somebody has justimixed us up
with some other Owada

225
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,374
What's going on- 7?

226
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,446
She really asked me. trust me!

227
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,348
She was the doctor's wifé!

228
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,783
Em net lying!

229
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,053
She said she was Dr. Owada's wife.

230
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,990
She was a tall. slim, beautiful woman.

231
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,726
What's the point.of telling you a lie!?

232
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,028
I gotta go. I'm busy.

233
00:08:17,146 --> 00:08:19,698
She was a tall, slim...

234
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,766
Beautiful woman...

235
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,637
Heh.,he...It can't be her...

236
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,973
It seems we're getting somewhere...

237
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,443
It seems to be true that
Dr. Owada won the lottery.

239
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,711
But the digital camera was a setup.

240
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:38,116
And, the Union Beer
wasn't even given to him.

242
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,284
It was a total lie.

243
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,151
Probably...

244
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,421
The tall, slim, beautiful woman
Is probably trying to

246
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,391
make everybody think that
Dr. Owada is a super lucky man

248
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,829
But what's the point of deing so anyway?

249
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,598
Yeah, she even bought
a digital camera herself.

251
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:54,699
It«s that!

252
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:59,437
What's waiting for her, after making
the doctor a super lucky man?

254
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,210
Here's your grand prize, a pocket tissue!

255
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,745
There's gotta be something...

256
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,914
Some kind of reason to it...

257
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,483
We never, win a.prize, do we?

258
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,551
But you know

259
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,153
Dr Owada at Beika Hospital

260
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,689
Yes I heard!He won the third prize. right?

261
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,457
He also wen the Union Beer.

262
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,863
Sounds like the doctor ,
IS sucking up fortune from us.

264
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,064
Yeah.

265
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,066
SO SO body was saying that,

266
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,634
too much luck ean actually
make other people envious,

268
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,371
and that could bring
about misfortune on the doctor.

270
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,573
Making others envious....?

271
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,242
That's true.

272
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,110
Envy IS a scary thing...

273
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,178
Yeah...

274
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,198
People envy others
when they are too luc +...

276
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,002
Maybe the purpose of that
woman s~action is...!

278
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,455
Or Owada is an amazing guy, right?

279
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,791
What? Yeah. he is.

280
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,961
I told you, nobody says bad about him,

281
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:56,595
right?

282
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,829
Yup!

283
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,764
He's not a guy
people hold a grudge against

285
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,433
He is not...

286
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:05,202
and maybe that's why
the woman has been acting that way.

288
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,239
What's the matter...Conan?

289
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:10,558
Maybe that woman is...

290
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:14,178
trying to make a forest.

291
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,347
A forest?

292
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,599
What.do you mean by a forest?

293
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,117
So then...

294
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,137
There should be many other luc « stories

295
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,623
about Dr. Owada. There must be.

296
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,291
Other lucky stories...?

297
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:27,692
Yeah,

298
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,562
andralso stories
about people envying him.

300
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,964
Perhaps the tall. slim. beautiful woman

301
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,933
IS where all those stories are coming from.

302
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,402
We're-gonna go out separately

303
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,771
to findout:who this woman is!

304
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:42,474
I'll do it-by"using some other route!

305
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,476
What. wast, all of a sudden?

306
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,379
If my deduction is correct,

307
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,347
then something is gonna happen
pretty soon!

309
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,582
Whaaat!

310
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,034
Huhuhuh...

311
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,042
He told me to find out who,
but where should I go???

313
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:02,243
Hmmm...

314
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,546
You mean Dr. Owadaiat Beika Hospital?

315
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,847
Yeah!

316
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:07,349
O. Owada?

317
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:09,117
I heard he found tons of gold coins

318
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,869
when he was digging a hole
in his bac \ ard!!

320
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,622
Really? Oh my, he must be lucky.

321
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,957
It's not all good stories though.

323
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,861
His tremendous luck is
actually making many people envy him...

327
00:11:20,196 --> 00:11:20,928
Ah, excuse me...

329
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,898
About that story,
where did you hear about it?

331
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,302
About the people envying Dr. Owadal!

332
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,903
What!
A hundred million yen (a million dollars)!?

334
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,589
He founda big bag
with a hundred million,yen in it!?

336
00:11:31,707 --> 00:11:33,141
Dr. Owada did?

338
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,209
I heard $0,

342
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,010
when he returned
the money to the owner

345
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,047
he received 5,000:000 yen
from the owner as a reward

347
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,915
He s a luc « guy. really.

348
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,685
From who.did yeu hear that story!?

349
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:46,721
It was one.of our customers, I think...

350
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:49,391
Wasn't that a woman
with a tall, slender body?

352
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,058
FT ee . *
Hmmm...

354
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,794
But why

355
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:53,928
That's ah...

356
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:55,363
I really don't know

357
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:58,433
but I swear some terrible thing
IS about to happen for sure!

359
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,869
- WA person who hates Dr. Owada?

360
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,620
It's a woman...

361
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,372
Tall and slim

362
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:08,493
I don't think there's anybody
that hates Dr... Owada in this world.

364
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:10,211
Dr Owada is loved by everybody

365
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,180
Not only by the patients

366
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:14,682
but also his co-workers

368
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:15,884
Fifi OU

369
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:16,683
Be...

370
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,153
Good afternoon

371
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:19,788
Oh. Dr Owada

372
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:21,556
How are you feeling today?

373
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:22,824
I-m quite well, thank you

374
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,225
That's good!

375
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,144
But take it easy, 0 «

376
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,029
Thank you, doctor.

377
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,697
Ok. take care...

378
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:31,766
There's nothing in the hospital...

382
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:38,206
Auch

383
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:43,595
Hiro!
I told you not to run inside the hospital!

385
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,279
I, I'm sorry.

387
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:46,147
But I'm glad that you can run now.

389
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:47,981
But I'm glad that you can run now.

393
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:48,650
Yeah!

395
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,692
Having a fight with Dr. Owada?

396
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:58,560
Yeah...

397
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:02,430
Who would do
such thing to that great doctor?

399
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,200
It was a... woman... was shocked!

400
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:05,967
What!

401
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:09,137
Ah... Excuse me!

402
00:13:09,638 --> 00:13:10,672
About what you just:said

403
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,408
a woman was having a fight
with Dr. Owada?

405
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:14,776
Hm? yeah. .

406
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,409
When?

407
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:18,012
It was about a'month ago...

408
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:28,856
Mrs. Shiina! Mrs. Shiina!

409
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,492
Please calm down, Mrs. Shiinal

410
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:32,460
Please. Mrs. Shiina

411
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,163
So she was called Shiina?

412
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:36,197
She was...

413
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,999
tall. and slim...

414
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,884
That must be her!

415
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:42,504
I think she was dressed in black.

416
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:43,705
Dressed in black...

417
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:48,510
It's me.

418
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:49,611
I found her

419
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,713
I found the woman!

420
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:57,752
Mitsu

421
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,952
Conan...

422
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,989
She's the one on the right.

423
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:07,428
She's living in
an-apartment around here.

425
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,231
Her name as Akiko Shima...

426
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:11,115
Shiina!

427
00:14:12,568 --> 00:14:14,135
So you found her?

428
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:15,770
The one on the right.

430
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:19,407
I think I've met her before...

431
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,775
You're it, Mom!

432
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,845
Hey! Wait!

433
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,114
H, hey, Conan...?

434
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,753
I'm glad that Mrs. Shiina has got better.

435
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:32,687
Yeah.

436
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,356
I thought
she would never get over the shock

438
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,925
when her husband passed away.

439
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,393
Excuse me, Ms...

440
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:41,129
Shiina. .lose her husband?

441
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,996
Es...

442
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,532
A month ago. Mr. Shiina was hit
by a car. It was, a hit-and-run...

444
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:48,436
The ambulance came and took
him to the hospital right away, but...

446
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,106
Is that the motive?...

447
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:53,341
I heard

450
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,843
it was already too late

451
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,179
when the ambulance came to
1e scene O we accicen...

453
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,583
$0, it's not the doctor's fault?

454
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,320
What the heck is she trying to do?

455
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:08,990
Looks like sheers a Kind modther to me.

456
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:10,758
Who is she?

457
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,526
Conan...

459
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:12,560
What were you asking?

461
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:12,760
What were you asking?

462
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:13,561
If!"
What were you asking?

465
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:14,729
06600

467
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:16,531
Now I remember!

468
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:19,200
I knew I saw her somewhere before.

469
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:20,501
She was there

470
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,891
He won the lottery

471
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,611
How can you laugh, you....!

472
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:31,479
As if nothing happened at:all...

473
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,514
witheut-moeurning'the'patient's death...

474
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,216
Hew could you act like that!

475
00:15:40,556 --> 00:15:41,856
Now I see...

476
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:43,808
Perhaps

477
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,143
that was when she
decided to make the plan.

479
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:46,661
Let's go home...

480
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:47,629
What?

484
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,498
ou said something
IS going to happen soon...

488
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,900
Nothing is going to happen

489
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,370
I think. I was just imagining things .

490
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,071
Imagining things!?

491
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:00,875
Then why was
that woman making all those rumors

493
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
That's right!

494
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,113
The mothers told me that
she is a habitual liar,believe it or not.

500
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:06,714
A habitual liar...!1?

501
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:08,916
What a troublemaker

502
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,653
Man, you're the troublemaker.

503
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:14,922
Even you make a mistake sometimes,
Conan

505
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:16,424
Yeah.
3, 2%

507
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,960
Heh, heh. Now, let's go home!

508
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:19,327
FN ~~ 7
vs Lay!

510
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,805
I won't let anything happen.

511
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,323
I will not!

512
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,177
Where the heck are you going!? Conan!

513
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,345
To Doc s house!

514
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,280
I left my stuff there... Heh, heh.

515
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,281
Be careful!

517
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:15,283
Does it make you feel better,

518
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,835
if you kill Dr. Owada, Mrs. Shiina?

519
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,672
I'm Mouri,.a private detective.

520
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,060
I heard some strange rumors
about Dr. Owada

522
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:29,764
so I did some investigation
and ended up with a person...

524
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,632
you, Akiko Shiina.

525
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,570
I heard your husband was hit by a car
A'month ago

527
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,410
When the ambulance

528
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:45,546
arrived at Beika Hospital

529
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,050
Everybody knew that nothing
could be done.it was too late.

531
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:51,018
But it was

532
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,988
Dr. Owadawho was on duty
that night.He did his best.

534
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,191
You're gonna be just fine! I'm gonna
save you, so don't die!

536
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:58,259
Come on!

537
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:02,764
He tried the best he could do,
to save your husband'sife.

539
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,727
Of course it was Dr. Owada's fault.

540
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:34,896
And you knew it too.

541
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,181
You knew it, but.

542
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,400
How come:you couldn't save him!

543
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,069
Why! Why!

544
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,070
As a matter of fact

545
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,673
The driveriTWhQ hit your husband [is * \
the one to be hated,

548
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:46,741
He ran:awa

549
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,443
so there's noiclue whatsoever
about who he is...

551
00:18:49,778 --> 00:18:52,980
Dr. Owada was the only 'one.
Whom you 'could: vent your:anger out on.

553
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:55,916
Evenrif'you knew that it was wrong...

554
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:57,552
Then,

555
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,521
\ your irrational anger against
the doctor reaches its peak...

557
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:04,125
after a half month passed.

558
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,361
How can you laugh, you...

559
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,897
As if nothing happened at all...

560
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,333
without mourning the patient's death...

561
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:13,534
How could you act like: that!

562
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:16,671
You felt it was unforgivable...

563
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:20,308
and:you-even:felt:that
you-wanted:to Kill'him.

565
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,477
You, however, knew that

566
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:27,397
Nobody hates or holds a grudge
against Dr. Owada.

568
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:29,250
If you just murdered him,

569
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:31,919
It was obvious thatgyou were
going to be the first suspect.

571
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:33,621
Because

572
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:36,474
people witnessed

573
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:40,261
you having a fight-with Dr: Owada...

574
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,463
You wanted to kill the doctor.

576
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:45,399
you cannot be arrested no matter what.

577
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,335
If you get arrested...

578
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:51,472
there will be
no future for your little children...

580
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,243
So you came up with a plan...

581
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:57,745
TheJrumors

582
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,480
about Dr. Owada as a man ofigood. luck.,

583
00:19:59,848 --> 00:20:01,582
umade them up...

584
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,218
Dr. Owada is so lucky,
he's almost too lucky.

586
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:07,204
So: there are many people, envying him...

587
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,491
That's'what:you wanted
to make people-think.

589
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,993
They weren't just simple rumors.

590
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:16,264
You changed them
to make them sound more realistic.

592
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,868
This circumstance made it is safe
for you to murder Dr. Owada,

594
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,341
since the police would think that
one of the envious people murdered him.

596
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,877
Moreover, it would be impossible
to find out who actually did it.

599
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,683
You created a fake situation

600
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,253
in which there were a lot of people
with motive of killing the octor.

602
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:43,257
That way, you would
just one of those people

604
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,476
who might be envious
enough to kill the doctor but didn't.

606
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,346
It's like hiding a tree in a forest.

607
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,298
If there's no forest, then you can just make one.

608
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:55,303
You made up all those rumors
so they would disguise you

610
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,641
But Mrs. Shiina...

611
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,944
No mattenhow well you try,
t's just a matter of time.

613
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,547
A criminal attempt
can never be-kept hidden.~...

615
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:09,750
But...

616
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,752
It's not too late...

617
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:17,124
Because nothing has happened yet...

618
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,728
Nothing has happened yet...

619
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,699
you can always still turn back.

620
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,601
Now, please go home,

621
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,338
before. your-beloved children wake up!

622
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:32,323
MM... Mr. Mourn...

623
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:40,381
I will...l will never do this again.

624
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:42,049
I Know

625
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,017
It's gonna be alright.

626
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,271
You will be able to get over it
I guarantee it.
