1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,802
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:04,604
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,505
e ucions a ea S apes an Syes
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,374
The story takes a sharp turn.

6
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:09,976
The secret of the Black
Organization is coming to light.

8
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,911
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,046
A child in appearance with the l.Q. of
an adult, no case is left unsolved

11
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,716
when Detective Conan
comes to the scene.

13
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,688
On the way back from school,

14
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,057
Al and I run into the car of Gin,

15
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,126
one of the men of the
Black Organization.

17
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:11,063
I set a transmitter and wire tap
into his car:and pursued him!

19
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,768
But, the devices were destroyed
by Gin who found them.

21
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,437
They have realized the existence of Ail!

22
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:28,314
Finding out by wire tap about the
murder plans of Gin and the men,

24
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,516
we headed for the memorial service

25
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,918
of movie director Sakamaki to be
heldesat the Haido Ci. Hotel.

27
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,287
During slide showing time at that hall,

28
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,189
the chandelier comes
falling from the ceiling,

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,190
and a politician named Nomiguchi

31
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,459
was crushed when the chandelier
came falling right at him and died.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,396
Moreover. Ail was
kidnapped by someone,

35
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,599
and was locked:up in the
wine cellar of the hotel!

37
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:53,606
Listen, Shinichi, listen very carefully...

38
00:02:54,207 --> 00:03:00,212
The "Apo" in the Apotoxin
4869 that{shrunk my body.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,349
Means death of program...

41
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,219
es...cells have a
self-destruction structure,

43
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,223
and is existing because of a
signal that keeps that in check...

45
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,292
Hey...Haibara...

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,197
But, this drug not only guides apotosis,

47
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,599
it also waits for the
activation of, trimorphism

49
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,968
and increases multiplication efficiency...

50
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:28,107
Cut it out, Haibarall I'll listen to all you
ave say after you get out of there...

52
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,509
Never mind, and just listen, willfyou!!

53
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:36,682
Because I'm never going to be
able...to...to talk to you again..."

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,550
What?

56
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:38,651
Can't you tell?

57
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:45,925
(Case
Re-Encounter with the Men in Black"

59
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,062
I'm going to download the
data of the drug into the" MO,

61
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:54,700
and hide it here. so come
get it later, okay.!...

63
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,870
After they come to get me...

65
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,805
n,ney...

66
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,640
S Shinichi, in front of you...

67
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,341
Huh?

68
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,781
1.It's them

69
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,616
Don't tell me they've come for Pisco...

70
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,485
No, no way!

71
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,857
Before the seven people are released the
Inspector is supposed to call me...

73
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,927
Al, big trouble! They're coming!

74
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,629
Hide in the fireplace or
something for now... now...

76
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:28,734
Hey, what's up?!

77
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,469
Hey?!"

78
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,874
Inspector, Shinichi here!!

79
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,915
Huh?! A man in black?!

80
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,118
IIsco's not here...

81
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,121
He promised to meet us in 30 minutes...

82
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,989
But, we don't hear a thing from him...

83
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,991
SO we use the transmitter
as a guide and came here,

85
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,427
only to find the computer
and no sight of him...

87
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,665
Where on earth did he disappear to...?

88
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:37,069
What's with this liquor cellar anyway...?

89
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,472
Probably a room that Pisco
had kept, just in case...

91
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,109
If the goofed in killing the guy at the hall,

92
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,247
he was probably going to kill the guy
some place else and bring him here...

94
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:53,419
I think we'd better get out of
here really fast, boss...

96
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,222
Yeah...

97
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,434
Hey?

98
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,503
Yes.

99
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,073
And? What:about your cloth IN

100
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:14,974
You lewd bastard!

101
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,475
I'm dressed!

102
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:19,411
In the overalls that I found in the cellar.

103
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,449
I also have the MO with the data
of the drug that I copied too.

105
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,084
What a surprise!

106
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,519
I wonder if that liquor called Paikal...

107
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:32,424
has an enhancing factor that quickens
the speed of cell multiplication?

109
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,794
That's nothing to be relieved about,
because the effect is only temporary!

111
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,698
Get out of there from the chimney before
your body returns to that of a child!

114
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,403
I feel just like Cordelia
crawling out of the well...

116
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,507
h...talk about a long way to go.

117
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,778
Sigh...by the way...

118
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,513
Did you figure out who Pisco is?

119
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,814
No, not yet.

120
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,751
I don't have enough information...

121
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,489
Look, Shinichi, tomorrow morning's
5Â» paper that is on the internet!

123
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,858
I saw that a while ago,
ut I didn't see anything...

125
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,960
No. the place to look
is the show biz section!

127
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:08,927
What?!

128
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,563
The camera man.who was at.the hall

129
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,667
seems-to have taken it
just before the chandelier fell...

131
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:18,070
They are the two among
the seven, right?

133
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,208
Ait a sec! Maybe...

134
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,978
The traces of a burn!!

135
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,414
Which means that this chain...

136
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,419
CL OD

138
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,621
So, that's what it was...

139
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:40,626
Haido City Hotel
The old building
RT )vi8

142
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,036
I.I'm out...

143
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:55,174
Good work, All
Can you tell where you are?

145
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,510
On a roof somewhere...

146
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,580
Is Shinichi there?

147
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:05,718
He was talking to Inspect
Megure till just a while ago,

149
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,287
but he went rushing into the hotel...

150
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,388
V Rushing ins'

151
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,989
Don't worry!

152
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,791
He told me to relay this message to you.

153
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,362
I figured out Pisco's identity!
I'll. go pick you upright away,

155
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:19,198
so stay put and wait for me."

156
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,001
Fuh...I'm fine!

157
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:28,807
Even if I wanted to move...
I'm so worn out, I can't move an inch...

159
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,525
missed you, Sherry...

160
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,093
(G,Gin...)

161
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,295
(G,Gin...)

162
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:58,604
how beautiful, white
snow that flutters in darkness.

164
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:02,641
Bright scarlet blood that
spreads over the snow...

166
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,077
That glasses and overalls you
are wearing to deceive us

168
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,281
are miserable attire for dying...

169
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,219
But, this place is just a great place to die,

170
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:16,989
right, Sherry?

171
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:22,461
H.How did you figure out I was going
to come out of this chimney...?

173
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,031
Your hair...

174
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:34,072
I found your reddish brown
hair near the fireplace...

176
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,142
I don't know if Pisco got you,

177
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,779
or if you snuck into that
Iiquor cellar yourself, but...

179
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:47,686
you trembling as you
breathed from within the fireplace...

181
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,093
I could've killed you right on
the spot in that dirty fireplace.

183
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,931
But I thought I'd at least let you die
a little more glamorously.

185
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:05,704
Oh, well thank you so very much, for
waiting in such a cold place for me...

187
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:10,576
Phooey! Now, won't you tell me
while your lips are still moving?

189
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:14,313
The trick that you used to disappear from
e gas CC am er o e organiza ion...

191
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,220
Huh? The liquor cellar?

192
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,523
Uh-huh! I think it's a room
with a large fireplace in it...

194
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,593
I wonder if we had that kind
of a room in this hotel...?

196
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,330
Maybe)it's-inzthe.old building that
Is,going to be renovated soon?

198
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,564
Old building?

199
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:37,034
Yes! I heard-that, they're using one of
the rooms there as a storage room

201
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,771
A storage room? That's it!!

202
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,174
Hey, wait, sonny?!

203
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,879
I'm sure that: Pisco is headed there too.

204
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:51,950
If he joins those two. theyll. find, out
that Ai shrunk because of the drugÂ»

206
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:57,255
Damn! If only Inspector Megure could've
kept them confined another 5 minutes.

208
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,557
Hmm?

209
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,297
What?! Al was shot?!

210
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,700
Right!! On a\roof somewhere by
them!! Hurry and go there or.

212
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,436
Hey, Doc! Doc

213
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,872
Damn! The battery's dead!

215
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,385
s...she won't tal

216
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,856
We've got no choice...

217
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,725
I guess we'll just have to send her off...

218
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,629
To where. we: sent her older
sister before 'her...

220
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,789
A needle'?!...

221
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,731
Agh, boss?

222
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,900
The chimney!!

223
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,803
Go inside the chimney!!

224
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,972
W...Who are you? You're?!

225
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,440
Hurry!

226
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,582
Shoots!

227
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,020
Boss!! What's the matter, Boss?!

228
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,899
Oh~~~how wonderful!

229
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:25,570
I guess you don't remember
because you were still a baby,

231
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:30,142
but I was on very intimate terms with
your parents who were scientists.

233
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,379
They told me a lot about the drug
they were in the process of developing

235
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,315
Who is he?

236
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,421
But I didn't think you
had developed it'this'far...

238
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,090
I'm sure that your parents
who have died of an accident

240
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,092
is truly happy about this too.

241
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,594
Who. are you?

242
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,264
Ut this is an order...

243
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,003
Shiho...

244
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:00,138
That's it!!

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,007
Mr. Masuyama?

246
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,980
Or should I call you Pisco, instead?

247
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,449
Who are you?...

248
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,720
You may think that you
succeeded in-dropping

250
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,522
the chandelier,on Nomiguchi
and made it look like an accident but

252
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,791
You're not getting away with that

253
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,461
You're the one who dropped it, right?

254
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,263
When you used the gun with a silencer!

255
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,000
Your guide was the fluO ascent
paint that you had painted

257
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,403
on the chain of the
chandelier beforehand.

259
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,439
When the lights were turned out for
the slide show and the room got dark...

261
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,142
The glow of the chain could be seen!

262
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,945
If you fired just like that,

263
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,682
then the people around you would
notice the sparks from your gun...

265
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,885
If you put the handkerchief
on the tip of the silencer

267
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,688
the handkerchief would go off
at the same time you fire your gun,

269
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,823
so the sparks wouldn't be visible!

270
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,495
You probably used the handkerchief
that was handed out at the hall

272
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,499
because you thought that you wouldn't
have to go and retrieve it but...

274
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:01,700
unfortunately...

275
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:06,505
Most of the guests who hadereceived the
purple handkerchief had alreadyjgone home,

277
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,174
and the suspects left were
only the seven of you

279
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,445
Mr. Tawara and Chris who were right
below the chandelier

281
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,046
and couldn't aim it are innocent

282
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:19,184
Mr. Mikame who spit out the piece of chain
from his mouth, that was used as proof,

284
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,521
and the MC Mr. Mugikura are also innocent

285
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,590
Mr. Tarumi and Ms. Nanjo
who were embracing each other

287
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,993
just before the incident
are out of the question.

289
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,531
In other words the only one who could've
committed the murder at the hall is...

291
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,867
you, Mr Masuyama!

292
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,335
There!!

293
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,875
And, Mr Nomiguchi came below
the space in the wooden box chandelier

295
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,512
because fluorescent paint was
paine ono re oorrig un er

297
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,783
You probably threatened him, who
was going to be arrested any minute

299
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:52,717
by saying,

300
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:56,054
You'll be given another chance so when
the lights go out, go to the glowing spot

302
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,190
and wait for further orders!"

303
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,791
Isn't that right, Pisco?

304
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:00,992
A speaker?!

305
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,128
W., Who are you?!

306
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,263
Who the hell are you?!

307
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,068
Conan Edogawa, a detective!!

311
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:11,937
A A detective. 7?

312
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,208
Don't-tell me thatÂ§you're the one
who called the police

314
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,877
while w, we were being questioned?

315
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,148
Uh... You 1nd the other two "bove
will be arrestedrby the police anyway.

317
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,951
Before that I'd like you to tell me,

318
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,355
why did you have that purple
handkerchief on you during questioning?

320
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:34,626
That's why the Inspector had
no choice but to release you

322
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,562
Why in the world did you
have that handkerchief...

324
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,032
Phooey! There are things in this world
that you don't need to know about.

326
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,437
Besides, take a good look at the situation!
You couldn't have called the police

328
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,640
You had better t
a good look yourself...

330
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,508
at your feet!

332
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,714
Spiritas

333
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,919
It has an alcohol content as strong as 96!

334
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,254
You understand, don't you?

335
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,391
What will happen if you smoke in a
place where such liquor is evaporating?

337
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,270
A fire broke out from room
404 of the old building.

339
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,473
I repeat, a fire broke out from
room 404 of the old building

341
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,807
What?!

342
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:23,875
Let's go check it out!

343
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:24,809
Hmm!

344
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,046
Hey brat, where the hell are you?!

345
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,381
Come out here!

346
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:29,647
Damn!

347
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,385
Where the hell are youl!

348
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,389
So that's where you:are...

349
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,858
J.Just what do you think
ou're doing, Gin

351
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,931
Have*you gone senile, Pisco?

352
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,868
Why didn't you kill that camera man off
right away and get rid of the film?

354
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,672
Camera man? What're you talking about?!

355
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,474
The picture that's supposed to make
the front pages tomorrow morning

357
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,877
has been switched to your face

358
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,281
The zoomed up picture of you
pointing the gun at the ceiling!

360
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:09,154
D.Don't! If you kill me, you
won't be able to find Sherry

362
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,156
I have an idea of where she is

363
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,160
And, besides if you kill me,
who has served that person,

365
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,493
you'll get yourself in trouble too

366
00:18:16,494 --> 00:18:21,967
I'm sorry, but I just got orders personally
from that person a while. ago to kill you!!

368
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,034
What?!

369
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:28,339
You borrowed the power of the organi
zationiarid'made it all the way up here

371
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,443
I'll bet you've already
seen enough good dreams...

373
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,748
Dream the rest of your
dream:in the world beyond...

375
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,457
What?! Gin shot Pisco to death?

376
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,929
I heard this throug
glasses that Ai left by the fireplace,

378
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,666
but it seems that he fled from the
chimney right after shooting the guy.

380
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,805
Strange! Why can he move despi
te being shot with the anesthetic gun?

382
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,841
I figured that though such a big man

383
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,510
He wouldn't be able to flee from
the police if he fell asleep...

385
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:11,383
And it also bugs me that they new too
much of what Ail was planning to do...

387
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,287
It seems that they knew that
Ai was going to be at the hall,

389
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,291
and besides can you usually tell who
the person is just by looking at the hair?

391
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:25,096
You know what Ail. when
you were at the organization .

393
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,297
And,

394
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,835
Did they find out that I shrank...?

395
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,507
No, I don't think so, nojneed for worry.

396
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,310
And what do you intend
to do from now on?

398
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,180
Well...

399
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:49,254
As long as they know I'm hiding in this
town, I can no longer stay near all of you

401
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:54,993
And besides, the MO that I had in the
overall probably went up in flames too,

403
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,195
that I have no reason to stay here anymore.

404
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,733
Don't worry, I'll leave by tomorrow...

405
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,070
Hey, hey. you can't possibly
Ieave in your condition!!!

407
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,005
All righto

408
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,873
Don't worry about that!!

409
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:09,774
Huh.

410
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:18,883
Aren't you going to look
for the chick here in this town?

412
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,353
I don't like to waste time

413
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,961
She's not stupid enough
to stick around in this town

415
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,298
knowing that we know what she looks like!

416
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:39,304
You're really into that lassie, aren't you...

417
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,540
Phooey! Well, I'm so sorry, Bellmott.

418
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,679
A woman of your,rank was called
in just to assist that old fogey,

420
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,248
and all he ends up doing is goof.

421
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:56,654
Really..l went out of my way to give him the
handkerchief before questioning and yet...

423
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,724
He did right to die...

424
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:05,597
Doesn't the guy who's sticking
around with that lassie bother you?

426
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,034
Ah...l sure would like to see the f

427
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,238
of the guy that's drooling all over her

428
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,375
es...his dead face distorted with fear.

429
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,981
Are you gong back to the States again?

430
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:27,252
No, I'm going to rest working
as an actress for a while

432
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,921
I'm going to take it easy in Japan...

433
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,258
Besides. I have something
that concerns me too...

At any rate, Inspector! Please don't leak
the fact that I was involved in this case

480
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,758
That's all right with me, but what
on earth is going on anyway?

482
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,228
The family of the murdered
Nomiguchi disappears,

484
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:20,298
and the house of Chairman Masuyama,
the suspect, burns down completely.

486
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,101
I don't have the slightest
idea what is going on

488
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,969
I can't tell you anything just yet!

489

I'll contact you when I figure it out...

491
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,712

and anything suspicious

493
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,781
This is the way they carry on.

494
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:39,916
Now you know, don't you?

495
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,788
That we can't afford to have
anybody know our true identity...

497
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,591
Yeah! Do I!

498
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,995

WwW. What was that?

501
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,346
This is...

502
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,754
Strange... What's that supposed to mean?

503
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:20,491
Did he get hurt in the restroom or
something? But...Why...?

505
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,829
Doc! This is homicide!

506
