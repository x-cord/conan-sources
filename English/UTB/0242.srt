and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

The star of the show today, is Genta

Like you know he's not all that reliable,
so let's all helpthim.out.

8
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,410
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,312
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,481
no case is left unsolved

Don 1 be picky and chew well

Yes!!

What is this...

26
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,129
I tell you, eating from a lunch plate
in high school...

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,731
I feel like crying...

29
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,001
Oh, I sort of like this.

I used to eat alone in the cafeteria...

That's wh eatin to ether with ever bod
Iike this is interesting and very enjoyable

35
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,214
Well, I felt nostalgic
the first few time too, but...

37
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,819
Oh, Mitsuhiko, you're not eating
your carrots again!

40
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,789
Oh, I'm going to eat them
all together at once later...

43
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,292
There«are guys like him
who push the food they don't like.aside.

45
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,397
And, they are those who brag
about how fast they can eat too

47
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,099
Well, in this class the guy
who just can't help but do so is

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,602
'did it I'm number AY!

00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,138
I was sure it was going to be Genta...

51
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,976
Ms. Kobayashi,

52
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,346
I don't feel well so may I go to
the infirmary and rest a while?

Huh?

56
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:02,882
What?!

57
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,517
Huh?

58
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,286
Whaaaaat 211

60
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:14,727
Genta's Misfortune

61
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,363
We've got a case here!

62
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:20,833
Genta has virtually
not touched his food at all!!

64
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,802
I wonder if he's on a diet?

65
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,604
No way, he's too fond of eating...

66
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,540
Come to think of it,

68
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,275
Genta hasn't been playing with us
the past 2 to 3 days, has he?

70
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,446
Even after school, he'd go home
ahead of us, all by himself...

73
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:37,249
Maybe he's being bullied by the seniors...

74
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:42,054
Don't be ridiculous,
Genta's not the type to be bullied,

76
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,191
and even if he were, it would be safer
for him to go home with us, wouldn't it?

78
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,760
Maybe he s got problems at home...

79
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,195
Huh?

80
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,598
Maybe somebody in his family
Is seriously ill

82
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,667
or maybe their having
all out quarrels everyday.

84
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,971
=f that's th€¥case though, it's not
something that-we can do anything about.

86
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,141
OO. Oh no

87
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,510
No such thing is happening!

88
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,078
M,Ms. Kobayashi...

89
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,548
His parents are healthy and well,
managing a liquor store!!

91
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,752
I went to visit Genta's house yesterday
because I was wornnied too...

93
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,790
But it is true he is afraid of something.

94
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,826
They told me thatthe would pull
the covers over himself

96
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,629
as soon as he got home and tremble.

97
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,233
But, what is he afraid of anyway?

98
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,369
Well, no matter how many times
I ask him, he won't tell me.

100
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,338
All he says is, It's nothing.

101
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:36,108
Maybe he'll tell you people!

102
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,245
When you find out what it is,
will you please tell me about it too?

104
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:40,879
Okay...

105
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,431
Wait, Genta!

106
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,802
What are you sneaking around for?

107
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,841
Oh, are you training to
become a ninja or something?

109
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,176
I see!

110
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,545
You're on a diet, that's why you didn't eat
Iunch, so that you could get into shape.

112
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,813
R.Right!

113
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,415
I saw a real cool Ninja movie
the other day so...

115
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:18,784
Don't be ridiculous!

116
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,854
Why would a guy like that
be trembling under covers?

118
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:22,754
Uylit.

119
00:05:23,255 --> 00:05:25,157
Lull bet you dreamt that
you were being slashed

121
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,525
by some blood smeared samurai warrior,

122
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,062
and running around from
an illusionan enemy of some sort.

124
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,534
Dream, no way!! I really

125
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,802
You really?

126
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,240
You really, what?

127
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,576
1.1... .to tell the truth...

128
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:48,581
My life is being sought after by a killer!!

129
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,782
K,Killer?!

130
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,783
K,Killer?!

131
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,187
Stop joking, Gentah

132
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,790
There's no way that a killer would
come after a grade school student!

134
00:05:59,059 --> 00:05:59,658
She's right.

135
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,727
After all, he's not me nor you...

136
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:02,728
Hey...

137
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,566
I was stupid to have told
you guys about it...

139
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,034
Hey, wait...

140
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,306
Genta, please tell us
more in detail about it!

142
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,276
I won't laugh at you anymore so...

143
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,513
I heard strange footsteps

144
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,816
when I was walking along the road
under the railroad track...

146
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:27,953
It was pitch dark
that I couldn't see the guy,

148
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:33,158
but when I stopped he stopped
and when ll ran he ran...

150
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:39,531
It was most likely your own footsteps
echoing off the wall of the road...

152
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,600
That's not all!!

153
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,169
I was pushed off the stairs of
the pedestrian crossing,

155
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,473
and even last night, a motor bike ran
a traffic light and came right for me...

157
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,675
It was probably only coincidence,
mere coincidence!

159
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,377
It was no coincidence!!

160
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,746
Because that guy...

161
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,181
The guy...

162
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,549
Huh?

163
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,388
What a large screw...

164
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:03,722
Dangerous...

165
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,924
I wonder where it came falling from?

166
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,872
T,The neon sign of the department store...

167
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,943
1.I'm sure the bolt was old
and it fell off coincidentally...

169
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,413
This:is just a bad day: Ymerely bad day!

170
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,449
Genta, maybe you'd better
go get exorcised...

172
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,852
No... It's neither a bad day,
nor a coincidence.

174
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,720
Huh?

175
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:36,055
Look,

176
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,058
there are traces of the wiring
having been cut by a knife...

178
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,193
It was cut beforehand,

179
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:45,197
so that when the bolt is loosened and
the neon sign falls it doesn't get stuck.

181
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,299
If so.

182
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,935
It would fall indiscriminately
on anyone who walks below the sign...

184
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,339
0 It seems that the target was set

185
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,741
Take a look at this!

186
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,745
Isn't this the Kamen Yaiba toy
that Genta is always looking at?

188
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,515
Which means that...

189
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,050
Yeah...

190
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,187
It seems that just as Genta says,
somebody is after his life...

192
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,656
There seems to be no doubt about it...

193
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,097
Genta, tell me more in detail about this...

194
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,933
Abo why you're being targeted!

195
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,000
O Okay

196
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,443
Whaaat?!

197
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,213
You saw a serial purse snatcher?!

198
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,917
Yousrmean you saw
that purse snatcher who's been attacking

200
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,586
only aged people and women
In this area recently?!

202
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,988
Yeah...

203
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,592
He looked ju 'Mike the wanted poster
composite drawing at the police station.

205
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,360
Did you tell the police?

206
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,194
Yeah,

207
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,330
about a week later...

208
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,366
Because when I first saw him
there was no composite drawing posted.

210
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,537
I remembered that I saw the purse
snatcher after I swaw the wanted poster,

212
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,839
but I forgot where I saw him.

213
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,311
But, I found the young man who
saw the purse snatcher together with me!

215
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,447
Saw him together with you?

216
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,048
Yeah...

217
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,485
About 5 days ago, there was a purse
snatching incident near my house,

219
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,720
so I went to look.

220
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,123
Then, I found the blonde guy
who was standing beside me

222
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,659
when the purse snatching incident
happened among the onlookers!!

224
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,130
And, what happened after that?

225
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,568
Of course, I took that young man to
the police that was over there!

227
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,373
But that young man said, I don't know
the boy nor the purse snatcher.

229
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,909
Are you sure you saw the purse snatcher
together with that man?

231
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,211
Yeah...

232
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:43,449
When I saw the purse snatcher, it
seemed that man was sitting next to me.

234
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,484
So I was sure that he saw him too...

235
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,052
What do you mean by it seemed...

236
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,788
I was sort of sleepy then,

237
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:53,392
so . I just happened to notice
that the man was beside me!

239
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,494
What about the purse snatcher then?

240
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,630
He may have been around
and he may have not

242
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,733
People usually get sleepy,

243
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:02,835
when they are in a movie theater...

244
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,137
Or, in a train...

245
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,539
Judging from what Genta is saying,

246
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,476
it seems that
the purse snatcher is after him...

248
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,311
Gosh...

249
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:15,981
and why didn't you tell the police
that somebody was after your life?

251
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,784
1.1 got a phone call.

252
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,154
I'll kill you if you tell anybody about me!

253
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,524
I'll kill your friends family
and everybody around you..." He said!!

255
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,529
That's why you didn't.
say anything till now

257
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:31,430
Yeah...

258
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,699
But, we do have a problem...

259
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,202
If he hasayour phone: number,
he probably knows your address too...

261
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,270
Yeah...

262
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,939
If we rush over to the police,

263
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,842
the culprit may«mistakenly thin 4
that Genta recalled something,

265
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,544
and God knows what the culprit will do...

266
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,282
He could be watching us here
in this shop right this minute...

268
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:50,983
What?!

269
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,388
- Ww. ~
And, don't you remember anything else

271
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,190
that could serve as a clue
to finding the culprit?

273
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,694
I told the police officer too, but he was
smoking a cigarette with his left hand!

275
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,731
Which means that
the culprit is left-handed!

277
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,534
Uh. He was wearing
a strange looking T-shirt...

279
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,004
A black T-shirt with a white skeleton on it.

280
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,339
Like that! Like that!

281
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,808
He was wearing
the same T shirt as that one!!

283
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,378
Excuse me, sir!

284
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,112
Huh?

285
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,448
Are you the man
who is after Genta's life?!

287
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,349
Huh?

288
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,151
His face is totally different...

289
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:26,784
What?!

292
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,053
30400

294
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,154
Illl
What do you guys want with me...?

299
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:35,994
Besides the T-shirt of the man
I saw had 202 on it, not 1999!

301
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:39,431
Uh, do you remember
where you bought that T-shirt?

303
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,198
Huh?

304
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,001
Oh... a clothes store
in front of the station called Bones!

306
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,670
Thank you, sir.

307
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:45,904
0,Oh, okay...

308
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,274
Okay, let's go check out that shop then.

309
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,380
Yes, that skeleton T-shirt is...

310
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,417
an original item of ours!

311
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,053
But, I wonder if we had
anything that said 202"?

313
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,488
What other kinds of T-shirts
did you have?

315
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:09,461
1999, HELP, ESCAPE,
all with some kind of pleading; message.

317
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:14,800
Remember in the year 1999, people made
a fuss because of that prophecy, right?

319
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,835
We pushed our luck
and starting making those Ti-'shirts!

321
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,273
Did you notice anyone suspicious among
the people who bought that T-shirt?

323
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,041
I wonder

324
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,945
It was quite some time ago, sol don't
remember the faces of the customers.

326
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,716
Found no

327
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,121
If you could only remember
where you saw the culprit, Genta...

329
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:40,292
Wasn't it in a movie theater
or on the train 2?

331
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,295
No. . because smoking
Is not allowed in those places...

333
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,897
What about a family restaurant, then?

334
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,699
I'm sure that's it!

335
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,402
You probably were full and got sleepy!

336
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,472
But that guy wasn't eating anything.

337
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,141
I wasustaringaat him for a while,

338
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,344
but all he did was glare
at the newspaper and smoke cigarettes...

340
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,047
How come you can remember all that

341
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,683
and still cannot remember
where you saw him?

343
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,784
I don't know why...

344
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,819
But, how strange...

345
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,490
If you stare at someone like that
it's most likely to get scolded...

347
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:14,926
Did you get scolded.

348
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,095
3 Nope... besides, my eyes never met his.

349
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,966
I see... so, that's what it was...

350
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,002
The 202 skeleton shirt...

351
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,837
Left handed.

352
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,642
And a place where you don't get scolded
for staring at somebody for a long time.

354
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,478
Genta, I've figured it out.

355
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,682
The place where you
witnessed the culprit!!

357
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,788
Hey, Genta.

358
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,390
It was at a glasses shop, right?

359
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,124
Huh?

360
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,827
The place where you saw
the purse snatcher!

362
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,365
You said that you didn't get scolded even
when you kept on staring at him, right?

364
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,533
WY. Yeah...

365
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,503
If the culprit had taken off his glasses
to have his glasses cleaned,

367
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,672
he wouldn't be able to tell
If somebody were looking at him

369
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:04,509
because everything would
be blurred, right?

371
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,748
B.But, Conan, I never went to
an eyeglasses shop...

373
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,085
You've gotta be kidding!
Because look over there...

375
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:15,787
Huh?

376
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,930
You're totally wrong!

377
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:28,800
Huh? Really?
I thought I had it all figured out.

379
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,837
I guess that's it for the Holmes
of this century then.

381
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:36,875
Well, well, it's only human
to make mistakes.

383
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,543
Don't get depressed!

384
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,545
I'll see you all, then...

385
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:44,182
Let me know if you recall anything, okay!

386
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,250
Okay!

387
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,691
I wonder where it was that
you saw the culprit, though, Genta.

389
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,893
A place where you don't get
scolded for staring

391
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,628
and some place that makes you sleepy.

392
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,800
Maybe it's at school?
Because Genta's always sleeping!

394
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,138
If such a person came to school,
we would surely have seen him too!!

396
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,339
That's true...

397
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,841
Hey! Will you wait a sec. right here!

398
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:10,842
Huh?

399
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,312
My god...

400
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,648
You sure love to eat, don't you.

401
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,383
You're going to get fat!

402
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,852
Who cares, I can't help eating what I like.

403
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,157
You've got ice cream
on your cheek, Genta!

405
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:25,857
Huh.

406
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,662
What's the matter?

407
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,164
Did you remember something?

408
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,332
NW .No, not really...

409
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,402
Please be careful
on your way home, okay!

411
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,403
Bye!

412
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,341
3 skewers with green'onions.-
and chicken and 4 liver please.

414
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:43,909
Okay!

415
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,045
I think I'm a little hungry.

416
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,147
But, you just ate ice cream a while ago!

417
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,889
It's French food!!

418
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,127
Hey, hold your horses!
It's only a little ways more to home.

420
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:09,134
Red, white and blue...

421
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,270
What about the French flag?

422
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:16,575
Hey, Ayumi, doesn't red, white and blue
Iook familiar?

424
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,210
I wonder...

425
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:23,548
but, Conan is always wearing a red
bow-tie, a white shirt and a blue jacket...

427
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,352
D.Don't tell me that
the purse snatcher you saw was...

429
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,989
Don't be silly. Conan would never
do something like snatch purses.

431
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:37,062
I don't know why but the colors red, white
and blue are spinning inside my head.

433
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,129
Oh...

434
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,368
I'll see you around, Genta!
Go straight home, okay!

436
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,336
Yeah...

437
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,706
If you get any fatter than you are now,
you'll be the laughingstock of the pigs.

439
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,907
Shut up!

440
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:56,915
Darn that Ayumi... All she can ever
say is fatso, fatso...

442
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:00,185
I'm not all that fat...

443
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,186
Hmm /

444
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,721
Agh!!

445
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,656
I got it!! It was over there!!

446
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,362
The 7th floor of the station building...

447
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,298
In front of the elevator...

448
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,735
Agh, that elevator!!

449
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:17,969
Wait a sec!!

450
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:20,839
What floor, s nny?

451
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,842
SS. Seventh floor please

452
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,546
Hey, sonny!

453
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,482
T,The blonde man...

454
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:32,784
I'm sorry aboutilast time...

455
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,052
It seemed to have slippedOmy mind...

456
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:39,391
I remember now! The place where
I saw the purse snatcher with you!!

458
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,394
Don't talk so loud...

459
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,262
He may be looking from somewhere, right?

460
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,499
Don't tell me that he came after you too...

461
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,402
Yeah, I just remembered a while ago too.

462
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:55,006
I thought it'd be better to see
if both our stories match

464
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,541
before we head off to the police.

465
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,780
Right, let's go to the men's room
where nobody will come around...

467
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,149
No doubt about it!

468
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,549
Huh?

469
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,217
1,This guy.

470
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:07,786
What«d

471
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:12,089
I'm sure he wrote the name Someda
on the customer's list...

473
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,358
Huns

474
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,392
Who are you...?

475
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,162
If you get funny,
you're really going to get it...

477
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,968
Left handed, with a 202 skeleton T-shirt...

478
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,270
With thestestimon that Genta ave,

479
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,540
it's no surprise that the police couldn't
make out who the culprit was...

481
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,944
Because Genta was watching
your reflection in the mirror!

483
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,214
Y,You guys are the kids 4
that were around a while ago.

485
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,214
Right...

486
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,118
Genta didn't get scolded
for staring at you

488
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,088
because he was looking at
your reflection through the mirror...

490
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,659
In other words, the 202 that was reflected
in the mirror was actually SOS!

492
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,562
You're not left handed,
but actually right handed!

494
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:57,569
A place that Genta would go, where there
IS a mirror, and moreover, get you sleepy.

496
00:18:58,204 --> 00:18:59,637
Where else would it be
but a barber, right?

498
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,345
And, Genta mistakenly thought
that he saw and the culprit...

500
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,549
IS because you dyed your hair blonde
while he was asleep.

502
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,587
The man with glasses
and black hair turns blonde.

504
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,622
Since your clothes were
covered under the cloth

506
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,791
and you were seated next to Genta.

507
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,894
That's why he thought
you were another person.

509
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:27,866
What is this kid talking about?
And he doesn't even have proof.

511
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,102
A witness is standing right behind you!

512
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,640
The barber who dyed your hair!

513
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:44,549
You were lucky
because he hates to watch TV.

515
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,219
And, there were no posters
with composite'drawings of you

517
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,320
along the road where he used to walk.

519
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,589
You may have thought that
you could easily commit the next crime

522
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,925
by simply dyeing your hair back to black,

523
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,928
and that you'd never get caught but...

524
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,665
Your fingerprints were left on the bag

525
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,034
that you previously attempted
to snatch and failed.

527
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,939
If the fingerprints match your fingerprints,
now you have no way out, do you?

529
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,608
T, Then what?

530
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,678
You mean this kid was going
all over town because...

532
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,614
I wanted to lure you over here!

533
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,983
The ice cream that was
on his mouth was shaving foam

535
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,885
that you use when shaving your face.

536
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,356
The French flag that is red, white and
blue is the spinning pole of the barber!

538
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,793
And the reflection on the glass window
was the mirror!

540
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,697
, Everything ended up
reminding him of a barber!

542
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,901
We had Genta pretend 1
that he recalled the barber...

544
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,506
so that the blonde-haired man you would
follow him and walk into our trap.

546
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,546
You've gotta be kidding!!

547
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,217
What do you think you're doing you?!

548
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:55,086
You're a fool.

549
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,089
Do you really think I'd walk all over town
just to lure you out here?!

551
00:20:59,090 --> 00:20:59,891
What?!

552
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,659
Right...

553
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,798
While Genta was making you
run around town and buying time...

555
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,733
we 'calleduthe cops!

556
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,441
Therefore, the purse snatcher
was arrested

558
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,309
The case was solved just like that

559
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,548
Wow, but Conan, you really
gave it to that guy, didn't you?

561
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,183
Are you really a grade schooler?

562
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,387
LI just copied the police officer
that I saw on a TV drama!

564
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,055
I see.

The Youth Detective 'Squad does it again!

610
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,954
Genta, I think you're sleeping
a bit too much!

612
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:14,459
You were asleep all the time the man
was getting his hair dyed blonde!

614
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,062
The barber told me
that he didn't wake me

616
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,931
because I seem to
be sleeping so soundly.

618
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,900
Well, but they do say,
children who sleep well grow fast.

620
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,537
Aren't you glad that the culprit was
not left handed

622
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,373
and right handed just like you assumed...

623
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:29,339
Huh?

624
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,009
Well,

625
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,545
I guess if it were them, I guess they
would've come after me instead of Genta.

627
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,214
So, I guess it wasn't them...

628
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,850
H,Hey, don't tell me you're talking about.

629
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,820
If you didn't know,
you'd better remember this well.

631
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,790
Gin is left-handed too.

632
00:24:00,571 --> 00:24:01,172
What?!

633
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,044
1, This is...?)!

634
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,552
He probably wanted to
Iook inside the briefcase.

636
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,289
Because see, the key is
still inside the key hole.

638
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:21,492
A curse...
