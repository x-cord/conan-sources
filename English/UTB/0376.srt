The one who succeeds in

00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,400
Well but she wouldn't(bcJalive

If she gets nutrition through

Never mind. I'll get it myself

62
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:59,705
By the way,
why do have to stay in such a cheap tent.

64
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,374
Couldn't you get something hike that!
You sce, hike that!!

66
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,776
There are no such rental tents.

67
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,113
That's why I'm asking you
why our tent is a rentedrsone...?

69
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:09,698
Why didn't go out and buy one?

70
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,682
What?

71
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,686
If you're going to bring me to camp.
Isn't that plain common sense

73
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,289
Go and buy one right this minute!!

00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,425
She's super unreal. that lady...

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,694
You know I can't do that...

76
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,563
Let's go to a pension then!

77
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,232

I finish making the curry.

Well, it is a fact that they were here first.

146
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,027
Okay. so hurry on and get it out of the way

147
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,731
You can leave it as is

Huh, what do you

152
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,872

Darn...

159
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,166
You should cut it into smaller pieces.

160
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,000
Huh?

161
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,471
When you make curry at home, you can
spend a long time boiling the contents.

163
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,373
But. you can't do that hero. right?

164
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,841
You seem used to this

They sure: have everything here...

184
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,547
these recent camping grounds

Yeah

186
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,774
Oh. I wonder! f she 2lready woke up...?

187
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,167
S.Somebody?!

Somebod . come quick!

189
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,623
Hat seems to be the matter?

190
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,024
Ran was kidnapped!

191
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,093
My god!

192
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,863
Ran!

193
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,164
Ran!

194
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:53,731
Ran!

195
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,668
Darn, where the heck did that guy, go?

196
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,303
They're not over here!

197
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,773
Darn! Why'd he take Ran?!

198
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,618
R.Ran!!

00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,755
Conan!

201
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,673
I wonder who the hell he is...?

203
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,879
There Is a smell of a drug inside.

204
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,715
It seems she was put to sleep with a drug.

206
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,551
The car that fled was
reported to be a stolen car,

208
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,321
so I'm sure we'll be
able to find it right away.

210
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,690
I sure hope so.

211
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,242
The point is why the
culprit kidnapped Ran

213
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:58,747
There are so many other people
on this camping ground and yet.

215
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,800
What a thing to say! Mow irresponsible!!

216
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,369
You're the one who said ou wanted
LO Stay over at a pension,

218
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,071
so let's hurry up-and head over.

219
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,872
NA friend of some people
we got to know on the camping

221
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,407
ground was kidnapped! I can't just leave.

222
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,943
Misa. this has nothing to do with us.

223
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,445
Yes, it does.

224
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,752
He's still breathing!!

225
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,260
ISIt-his the sneaker that tine mam

226
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,997
who kidnapped Ran (
was wearing?

229
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,064
No doubt about it.

231
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,300
It's the sama 1s the one
the man was wearing.

233
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,601
Whi€h means that you
caught the kidnapper?

235
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:40,505
A car fell over a cliff near here...

236
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:44,209
Thus is, the shoe that the
driver of the car was wearing

238
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,778
His unconscious and in the hospital now...

239
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,847
Huh, then Ran...

240
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,348
Poe. what about Ran?!

241
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,784
I don't know about Ran

242
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,854
The car was a regular sedan,
and Ran was nowhere in sight.

244
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:56,855
What~~7?!

245
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,990
We found from his driver's license

246
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,292
that he is Masayuki Takada. age 25.

247
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,229
There seems to have been a half written
mail that hasn't been sent out,

249
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,065
hinting that he had committed
the crime left on his cell phone.

251
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,368
The police seem to have concluded
that the accident was caused

253
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,837
probably because he was
eying intmair we « nving.

255
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,406
And. what about that mail?

256
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,909
Osuoms to hava an accomplice

259
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,476
31-7
He seems to have an acedmplice.

262
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,994
-7 r-
I guess Takada was the one who

269
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,913
carried out the crime for somebody else.

This is rubber boots used when fishing.

Why's this thing, here?

281
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:37,928
Why's this thing here?

Ran? No...not so

283
00:11:57,266 --> 00:11:59,183
I see. the tent

284
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,120
It's the tent!

285
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:10,512
If you insist on going home just like that,
I swear I despise you forever

287
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:11,846
Go ahead. and suit,yourself.

288
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:16,484
I don't intend to stick around

I tried calling you many times
Ou Ic nNAappcec Ye wrong woman...

298
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,175
Masayuki Takada is
hospitalized now because

300
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,010
the police called from his cell phone.

302
00:12:43,011 --> 00:12:44,779
Hey! Where's Ran?!

303
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:48,582
I don't know I don'teknow.

304
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,322
I asked Takada to get the weman

305
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:57,375
who was in the tent under that tree.

306
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,661
But. thanks to 1 small mistake.

307
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,130
Thu plum: was takun by somuonu ulso.

308
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,098
I tried to contact you about it

309
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,234
but Takeda had his cell phone turne. off... 4

310
00:13:06,235 --> 00:13:08,736
his picture is pretty blurred

311
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:12,307
Depending on how'you look at: it,
it sort of looks like Ran.

313
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:14,425
What's your connection with Takeda?

314
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,145
One morning at a certain station.

315
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:21,549
I saw-the man ¢1lléd Takeda,
kick aiman onto the railroad.

317
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,719
I ref xively followed Takeda and

318
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,654
made sure that I could contact him.

319
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:32,393
Several days later. when
I asked him to kill Misa,

321
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,963
he didn't refuse because

322
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,816
told him I'd pay him 1.000.000 yen...

323
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,701
Why'd you want to do such a thing to Misa?

324
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,172
She was in the way, of me getting a life...

325
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:48,877
She's selfish, extravagant
and to top it off. a busy-body.

327
00:13:48,878 --> 00:13:52,680
I just couldn't call it off with her.

328
00:13:52,681 --> 00:13:56,484
I wasn't going waste my life just for her.

329
00:13:56,485 --> 00:14:00,955
[That's for Misa to say. You ro the pits.

330
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:03,324
I don't mind you holding
) crudge against me

332
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:06,260
But, I won't ever forgive you
for endanger the life of someone

334
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:07,862
that has nothing to do with us...

335
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,797
Where is she?!!

336
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:12,332
Bets me...She may already be dead.

339
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,640
I know that Ran's alive.

342
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,042
C.Conan...

343
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:23,628
Atleast until 15:00.

344
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:29,717
Written on the mail that wasn't sent out,
it said. the woman dies at 15:00.

346
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,286
Let's go look for her

Let:me know when you find her!

376
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,868
Where on earth are you, Ran...

378
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,690
A dam?

379
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,326
