00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,236
Inspiration flashes
piercing through to the truth.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,704
Once he gets going
nothing can stop him.

5
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:06,839
In today's episode, a car explodes.

6
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,975
The adult
world is a bit complicated

8
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,610
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,612
A child in appearance with the
IQ of an adult

11
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:15,081
no ase is left unsolved when Detective
Conan comes to the scene

13
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:34,887

00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,391
The Car Explosion Case" Part I

¥A AA

16
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:39,692
¥A AA

17
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:46,399
Thanks for waiting...

18
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,969
What're you looking at so intently?

19
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:53,572
I was just remembering the past.

20
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,573
The past?

21
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,009
You may not know,

22
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,478
but in the past, in every bank,

23
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,581
there was a space
open for the general public.

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,385
They had a.bulletin board
with messages such as

27
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,019
Looking for nice home for kitten,"
or whatevers

29
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:09,622
I once put up a

30
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:14,226
please hire tutor message
on the board too...

32
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,662
Oh, were'you tutoring, Pops?

33
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:18,964
Really?

34
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,599
I didn't know at all!

35
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,667
Well,

36
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,037
I didn't have money, but I married
your mother while I was still a student so...

38
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,274
I had no choice &
but to part-time to make a living.

40
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,644
You and Mom
had quite a tough time, I see!

42
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,046
But, the one who really had a tough time

43
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,916
must've been the one
who was taught by Pops.

45
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,685
You can say that again.
Fuh fuh, fuh...

47
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,619
What're you talking about?

48
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,923
I was a pretty good tutor.

49
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,558
As proof of that,

50
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,893
the student I taught for 3 years,

51
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,729
entered the
Iaw department of Jonan University!

53
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,064
That's right!

54
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,034
She used to
Iive in Beikacho!!

56
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:55,701
Huh?

57
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,369
Follow me!

58
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,737
I'll introduce you to her

59
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,672
Megumi!

60
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,574
Oh, Megumi...

61
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:02,908
H-Hey wait, what do you mean?

62
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,176
She's a woman??

63
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,312
Hey hey...

64
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,015
How nostalgic...

65
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:15,287
I've never been in this
part of Beikacho very much,

67
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,623
but it hasn't changed much.

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,626
Are you sure you
haven't seen\that person for a long time?

70
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:21,660
Yeah!!

71
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,729
Her name is Megumi Tanaka,

72
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,731
andiher father is a lawyer.

73
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,100
He used to let me
drink beer after lessons.

75
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,471
That's why
he lasted for:3 years...

77
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:36,876
What's with that car?

78
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,277
Hey! Hey!

79
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:40,346
Watch out, Conan.

80
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,523
What's with that car anyway...

81
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,025
Speeding like that
on such a narrow road...

83
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,896
Her house is right around

84
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,298
that tobacco shop!

85
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,535
Maybe the person called Megumi
has gotten married long ago,

87
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,069
and doesn't
Iive there anymore?

89
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,671
Could be

90
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,939
but there's also a possibility
that shes still single!

92
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,475
Dad!

93
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,177
I hopeyyou're not
thinking of anything, funny...

95
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,144
Come off it. &

96
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,612
What can I do
with you kids along with me...

98
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,246
Hmm?

99
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,651
Oh, it's her!

100
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,486
Megumi!!

101
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,754
Mr. Moun?!

102
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,357
You've really grown to be an adult,
haven't you?!

104
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,225
Wait, Mr. Mount!

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,960
Huh?

106
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,062
All right!

107
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,731
Okay, okay...

108
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,807
Hiromi...

109
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,477
Megumi!

110
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:53,986
My little sister...

111
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,355
Hiromi is inside!

112
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,189
What?!

113
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,424
Hiromi is!

114
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:00,492
There it is!

115
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,694
A fire extinguisher!

116
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,832
Give it to me!

117
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,300
Il handle this

118
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,677
H-Hiromu...

119
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:21,914
Aaaag

120
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,054
Megumi!

121
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,765
Beikacho Hospital
FETE Tbe

123
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,936
I'm sure you are in shock
because it isliight after the accident, but

125
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,740
May I ask. ou a few questions?

126
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,144
Your name is Mrs. Sakihara,
Is that right?

128
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,112
Your name is Mrs. Sakihara,
is that right?
Megumi Sakihara

131
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:53,579
Megumi Sakihara

132
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,481
Yes...that's right...
Megumi Sakihara

134
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,318
The person who died
in the car that exploded is...

136
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,220
Ms. Hiromi Tanaka,
your younger sister.

138
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,821
Ms. Hiromi Tanaka,
your younger sister?
Hiromi Tanaka

141
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:03,122
Hiromi Tanaka

142
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,526
Yes, that's right...

143
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,764
An explosive
was riggedson to the car

145
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,465
Explosives?!

146
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,667
Just as I thought...

147
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,068
Yeah!!

148
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,370
It seems that the explosive was
rigged onto the underside

150
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,906
of the car together with
an ignition device.

152
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:26,345
It was probably rigged so that when the
tires turned, an explosion would occur.

154
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,479
Yes,

155
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:33,185
I also remember that the car exploded
soon after she reversed.

157
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,455
O-Oh...

158
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,856
Ms. Sakihara,

159
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,026
I know how you feel,
but let me ask a few more questions.

161
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,563
That house you came out of,
IS your parentssshouse, isn't it?

163
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,365
Yes...

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,002
My parents died of a car accident
6 months ago

166
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,337
What?!

167
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,671
You mean your father?

168
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,373
Yes, that's right.

169
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,177
My sister's been living
there alone ever since...

171
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,146
Was that car your sister's?

173
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,982
it was mine

174
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,451
Yours?

175
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,418
Whaty!

176
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,889
That's the car that I drove all the way here
from my residence in West Tama today.

178
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,926
My sister's car
was at an auto shop for a safety check,

180
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,628
so I parked my car In the
empty garage.

182
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,864
Since I'm not good at backing up

183
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,400
my sister was getting the car out for me,
so I could head on home.

185
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:22,267
My sister...

186
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,803
she offered to
back it out for me...

188
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,538
Which means

189
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:30,209
that you were the one who was
actually supposed to be driving that car?!

191
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,810
Y-Yes...

192
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,080
Then the killer
mistakenly kille 1 our younger sister?!

194
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,516
I don't know!

195
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,018
I don't know
what on earth is going on...

197
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:40,986
Uuuugh...

198
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,287
Megumi!

199
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:44,957
Megumi,

200
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,560
about what time did you leave
your residence in West Tama?

202
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,365
A little before... 2:00 in the afternoon.

203
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,968
Did you notice anything
abnormal about the car back then?

205
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,472
What time did you
arrive at your parents' house?

207
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,474
I think It was around...2:30.

208
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,978
The explosion occurred at 3:00 sharp!

209
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,346
If so.

210
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,350
Then it is most likely that the
explosive was rigged to the car

212
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,051
during the
30 minutes period...

214
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,121
Do you have any idea
as to who it may be?

216
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:16,989
Huhry.

217
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,525
Do you know if an, one
may have a grudge on you?

219
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,260
No...only...

220
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:22,461
Only?

221
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,930
About a week ago...

222
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:31,537
I was being watched by
a man at a supermarket near my house.

224
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,404
Huh?!

225
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,106
A 'stranger...?

226
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,207
Yes...

227
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,077
I pretended not to notice,

228
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:41,279
but I felt
quite uncomfortable...

230
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,082
Do you remember
that man's face

232
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,186
He had a
very characteristic face...

234
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:52,124
We'll get an officer
who is good at drawing portraits,

236
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,226
so we'd like your cooperation.

237
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,534
Megumi.

238
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,372
It didn't even occur to me that
I'd be meeting you again like this...

240
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:12,311
I knew that you had become
a famous detective Mr. Mour.

242
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:18,116
I boast to my friends that
you used to be my tutor.

244
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,284
I see, I see...

245
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,957
I will surely track down the killer
who did such a terrible thing to Hiromi!

247
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,327
Please do that, Mr. Mourn.

248
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:29,361
Aye!!

249
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,163
Leave it to me!

250
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,936
What a surprise
that she used to be a student of yours.

252
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,306
You also knew her
younger sister too didn't you?

254
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:41,907
Yes...

255
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,510
She was still in
Jr. High School back then

257
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,846
and used to always
serve us cake and tea...

259
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,483
Unlike her older sister Megumi
who was quiet and easy-going,

261
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,851
Hiromi used to joke a lot,
had many friends,

263
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,220
was outgoing

264
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,422
and was very cheerful...

265
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,325
They don't seem to have changed
much to this day.

267
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,362
After Megumi graduated from college,

268
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,464
she went to work
for a securities company.

270
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,133
She stayed there
only for a short while and got married.

272
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:13,539
She has no children, but seems to be living
a peaceful life as a housewife.

274
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,210
Hiromi, on the contrary,
after graduating froma two-year college,

276
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,312
worked as a free part-timer,

277
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,214
and even after
reaching the age of 30,

279
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,217
still seemed to be living
a carefree life...

281
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:29,321
It seems the investigation on Hiromi's
oing to take some time...

283
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,293
Inspector Megure,

284
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,361
The portrait\is done.

285
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,363
Oh, thank you.

286
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,731
Let me see too!

287
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,767
Huh?

290
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:42,568
He's...

293
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,571
Doesn't he look like that man?!

294
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:51,409
Remember the driver who overtook us
on our way to Megumi's house...

296
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,344
Hmm?!

297
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,846
Although ,he was wearing sunglasses

299
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,349
his hair st. le andschin
Iook exactly the same!

301
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,290
Come to think of it...

302
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,025
He looks just like that man!!

303
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,094
About what time did you see him?

304
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,264
About 10 minutes
before we got to Megumi's house.

306
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,334
At the alley about 500
meters before"reaching her house.

308
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:20,372
Which means, he could've been fleeing
after setting up the explosive...

310
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,874
Do you remember the model
and license number of the car?

312
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,276
Uh...

313
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,878
It was a red RV,
with a Shinjuku license number

315
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,080
All right!

316
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,481
Let's search for it immediately.

317
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,549
Excuse me,

318
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:31,316
how is Megumi...

319
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,818
My wife...?

320
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,353
How is she?

321
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,687
Excuse me...

322
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,290
but are you Mr. Kazuo Sakihara?

323
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:38,924
Yes...!

324
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,392
Yes...!
Azuo Sakihara

326
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,193
I got a call from the police
azuo Sakihara

328
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:43,528
Saying that my wife
had a bombing accident...
Azuo Sakihara

331
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,262
Saying that my wife
had a bombing accident .

333
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,864
And how is she?!

334
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,532
Please don't worry,

335
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,101
she's fine.

336
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:50,002
Huh?!

337
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,040
But, your wife's
younger sister passed away.

339
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,742
H-Hiromi?!

340
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,947
Oh, I mean...

341
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,348
Why her?!

342
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,618
An explosive
was rigged to your wife's car

344
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,187
but Hiromi was
driving the car in her place.

346
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,092
Mr. Sakihara,

347
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,662
have you ever seen
anyone like this before?

349
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,531
It seems you have.

350
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,900
N-No, never.

351
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,335
Hmm...

352
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,037
Excuse me!

353
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,909
He sure is acting strange.

354
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:32,878
Inspector Megure!

355
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:33,745
Hmm?

356
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,348
Investigation at the scene of the
explosion has been completed.

358
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,082
Hmm...

359
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,851
How was the portrait?

360
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,287
Hmm, here it is.

361
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,157
Ir Mouri and the others seem {to have
séen'him near the scene of the explosion.

363
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,092
That's reliable evidence!

364
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:49,661
Huh?

365
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:50,928
This man...

366
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,931
- What's-up, Officer; Takagi?

367
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,231
Uh, well,

368
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,570
I thoughtdl saw him among the papers
of the case that Officer Sato is handling

370
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,671
What?!

371
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,907
You mean the one
who was killed in Shinjuku?

373
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,707
Yes,

374
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,510
I only took a glimpse

375
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,747
but he looks a lot
Iike the victimes husband

377
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,715
All right!

378
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,150
Check on that portrait right away

379
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,319
and contact Officer Sato!

380
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:15,053
Yes, sir!

381
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,398
Or BLD
, ToT 1]

384
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,801
Yes...they do look alike.

385
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,771
I've met the man himself,

386
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,873
so I think there us
no mistake about it

388
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:40,645
He's the husband of the woman who was
stabbed to death on her way back after

390
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,314
shopping at a
convenience store at night....!

409
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:48,687
Hiromasa Takahashi

411
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:53,125
And over here is his wife,
theivictimO Mrs. Sachiko Takahashi.

413
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,593
Age 27

414
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,829
We're investigating as
random murder

416
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,966
But, she was covered by a
very expensive insurance policy.

418
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,470
Her husband who is in
debt was also a suspect. However,

420
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,540
he had a perfect alibi.

421
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,909
Hmm, I see...

422
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:16,248
Is Takahashi's car a red RV
with edShinjuku license plate number'?

424
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:17,315
Yes!

425
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,450
Exactly...

426
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,217
What?!

427
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:24,856
Now, it is quite definite that the
man we saw was Takahashi.

429
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,627
And if he works
for a chemicals company,

431
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,362
he could easily get a hold of
explosives too...

433
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,866
A random murder case
and a bombing incident,

435
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,268
Iooks to be two very different cases
but I wonder If there is a any connection?

437
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:41,840
Although there are no names that
correlate in both cases

439
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,110
But, too many things fit in
for this to be a coincidence...

441
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,646
Another deduction could be...

442
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,057
Officer Takagi

443
00:15:59,058 --> 00:15:59,624
Huh?

444
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,626
You've got a cool looking
badge there!

446
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,862
Please exchange it with mine.

447
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,999
Oh no, Conan,
this is not a badge.

449
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,101
Please exchange it
please exchange it.

451
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,236
Conan!

452
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:12,871
Hey!

453
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,073
Don't you understand
that you can't exchange it!

455
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:15,807
Huh!

456
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:17,676
Exchange?!

457
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,147
I've figured it out Inspector!

458
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,850
This is an exchange murder!

459
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,484
Exchange murder?

460
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,319
Huh?

461
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,221
Yes!

462
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,990
If so
both incidents connect!

464
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,659
Do you mean that.

465
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:38,730
An agreement of an
exchange murder was made between

467
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,132
Kazuo Sakihara and
Hiromasa Takahashi.

469
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:45,637
First, Sakihara kills
Takahashi's wife. Sachiko.

471
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,908
Next, Takahashi tried to kill
Sakiharass wife, Megumi

473
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:56,314
When Sakihara saw the sketch of
Takahashi at the hospital,

475
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,850
he looked out rightly shocked.

476
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,221
That's because he knew that
Mr. Takahashi was the killer!

478
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,226
But, why did
Mr. Sakihara want to kill his wife?

480
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:12,197
That can be imagined! from his remark
when he found out that the one who died

482
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,699
was his wife's younger sister.

483
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,534
H-Hiromi?!

484
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,104
He's remark
sounded obviousl more intimate

486
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,740
than just a
brother-in-law relationship with her!

488
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:24,509
All right!

489
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,411
Let's investigate the case with all
what was pointed out just now!

491
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,145
Yes, sir!!

492
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:49,935
Mr Takahashi?

493
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:55,740
You seem to be in a rush,
are you going anywhere...

495
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,810
Rats!!

496
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,345
Freeze!

497
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,214
You're arrested on
charges of assault and battery!

499
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,351
Crud!

500
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,787
There is a bomb in the bag.

501
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,721
What?!

502
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,123
We did it,
Officer Takagi!

504
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:12,958
Indeed

505
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:13,992
A few days later

506
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,428
After Sakihara saw the sketch,
A few days later
HA bd BL

510
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:16,661
A few days later

511
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,731
he informed Takahashi to run for it

512
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,767
But, that"in turn,
was a breakthrough for us.

514
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,338
Sakihara, after hearing that Takahashi had
admitted the crime, also resigned

516
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,941
and confessed that
he had killed Takahashi's wife.

518
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,278
He seems to have talked Takahashi into
committing an exchange murder

520
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,480
when they happened
to see each other at a bar.

522
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:41,720
They never met after that first meeting,
and all arrangements were done by phone.

524
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,623
Tiheyilsed~the pay phone,
so that no proof would be left.

526
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,895
Sakihara had a phone exclusively
for himself in his study upstairs

528
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,665
He seems to have made sure
to take all calls with this phone

530
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,868
That's why Megumi didnat realize
what was going on...

532
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,940
And, what was Sakihara's motive?

533
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,641
Just as you-had deduced,

534
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:06,411
Sakihara had an
Intimate relationship with

536
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,713
with Megumi's
youngerssister, Hiromi

538
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,450
Sakihara seems to have thought up killing
Megumi, in order to come up with cash

540
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:16,154
for opening a boutique that Hiromi
said she wanted to start.

542
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,623
Because if Megumi dies,

543
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,258
allsthe money-that
he inherits from her,

545
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,560
andsthe money for the
insurance that she is covered by...

547
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,195
would become his...

548
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,466
How cruel!
Poor Megumi...

550
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,003
Does Megumi know about this?

551
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:32,771
Yeah...

552
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:33,137
Yeah...

553
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,473
althoughdit seems
she couldn't make herself believe it at first.

555
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:39,978
All she could do
after finding it to be true was cry...

557
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:42,347
It's understandable,

558
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,483
because although she
wasn't involved in the crime at all,

560
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,287
she was back stabbed
by her own younger sister...

562
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,627
I'll go and look in on her
in a few days.

564
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:56,995
That's a good idea.

565
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,832
So, the case has been
solved and is closed.

567
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,073
Help her out
as an old friend will you

569
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,175
Yes, sure thing.

570
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,745
I'll see you later, then, Ran.

571
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,313
Goodbye, Inspector Megure.

572
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,820
I wonder if
evenything has really been solved...

574
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,156
I have a feeling...

575
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,793
a feeling that something is
being overlooked...

577
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,998
few days later

578
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,200
Dad!
Few days later

580
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:37,268
Dad!

581
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,504
You promised to meet Megumi
at 1:00 didn't you! .

583
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:41,539
Look!

584
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,608
We're an hour early!

585
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,710
Let's go have some coffee!

586
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,179
Huh?

587
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:52,750
Isn't this the supermarket where Megumi
mentioned she saw Takahashi...

589
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:53,852
Conan.

591
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,221
Hurry, come.

592
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,255
Okay

593
00:20:59,225 --> 00:20:59,991
Huh?

594
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:01,392
Dad.

595
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,927
Isn't.that Megumir!

596
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:03,862
What?!

597
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:04,996
Megumi?

598
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,970
Hey, Megumi!

599
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:23,948
Hey!

600
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,017
She's gone...

601
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,389
Conan?!

602
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,128
She reversed out of a

603
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,329
parking space so narrow...

604
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,301
Didnt she mentioned

605
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,270
Since I'm not good at backing up

606
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,772
my sister was getting the car out for me,
so I could head on home.

608
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:49,140
My sister

609
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,010
she offered to
back it out for me...

611
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:57,348
But, what I saw, doesn't look like a
person who has trouble backing up the car.

613
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:02,820
Then why did Megumi
asked Hiromi for substitution?

615
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:09,227
Because of that,
the explosion killed Hiromi.

617
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,430
Can this really be
an unlucky coincidence?

619
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,540
If she already knew
the wholevplot...

621
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,278
This case isn't
solved, yet!!

Are you saying that Megumi has
something to do with this case?

665
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:52,329
The Megumi you know is the
Megumi in her high school days,

667
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,634
Megumi could've changed
after becoming an adult.

669
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,003
She hasn't changed!

670
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,872
She's what she
used to be before!!

672
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,574
You want to believe so,
don't you, Pops.

674
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,911
