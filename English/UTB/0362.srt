1
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,686
Due to the off-season ghost
scare at Teitan High school.

3
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:04,089
Ran begs Pops to solve
the mystery of the scare,

5
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,558
but-he refuses, saying.that.it is nonsense.

6
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,361
Therefore, out of my consideration
for Ran whom I know hates ghosts .

8
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,897
decides to participate
in solving the mystery

10
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,766
After school, when we were
checking out the school building,

12
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:19,171
we find a desk that is very
inappropriately on the campus grounds.

14
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,912
My grudge...has not yet vanished...

15
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:35,053
(132 #h )
Teitan High School Ghost Story Part 2

17
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:38,257
I was on campus in the rain...?

18
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,259
I haven't gone, outside at all today.

19
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,393
3» HUN?

20
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:46,131
Besides. I was at a faculty
meeting while it was raining.

22
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,601
We were discussing the ghost scare!

23
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,737
By the Way. Dr. Nude!

24
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,873
Thanks to the health
crxcrrcuso you taught rm.

26
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:57,409
My back pains 'have gotten a lot better...

27
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,211
Oh I see

29
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,213
Hey. what on earth is going on?

30
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,215
Don't tell me that the
upper classman is lying...

32
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,017
No Way!

34
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,886
Somebody probably mistook
someone for him?

37
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,423
Why don't you ask Kazumi's friend

38
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,225
who is resting in the infirmary, then?

39
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:16,228
The ground is visible
from the infirmary because

41
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,697
it's right in front, so he may
have seen somebody. right?

43
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,166
No...beats me...

44
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:25,637
After I left you guys,
I was asleep in this bed here...

46
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,972
Besides...

47
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,224
See, take a 10Ok!

48
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:31,176
Even if you were to look outside...

49
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,379
it's virtually impossible to see anything
on campus from this floor. right?

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,449
What kind of'gardenswas the principal
thinking of making anyway . 7?

53
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,419
So. even if someone suspicious
was to be loitering

55
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,588
on the ground, I don't think
I would've noticed...

58
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,224
By the way Nwhereis:the: nurses

60
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,695
She left for the day saying
she was going to driving school...

62
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,164
She told me to hurry
on home and go to-bed

64
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,967
becausermyghouse
IS really close to school!

66
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:59,238
Afterithe wailingsin the storeroom.
Of the'gym. 1s the grudge filled library.

68
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,908
The cursed stairs, and now
the chair and desk on campus...

70
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,177
Poor Hosaka...

71
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,295
Um...

72
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:09,581
I heard that you were
childhood friends with Hosaka...

74
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,916
Yeah

75
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,718
I was with him from
elementary-to Jr. high

77
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,921
but after we entered high school,
I hardly got to see him...

79
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,523
because I gointo an accident
riding my motorbike as soon as

81
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,926
I entered high school, and was
hospitalized for nearly half a year...

83
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:24,663
Then, you didn't know that
he fell down the stairs and...

85
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:28,100
No, not until I was discharged from
the hospital and came back to school

87
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,350
And? .

88
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:32,537
Was there anybody who was all
worked up over this ghost bit?

90
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,756
Those guys who're making
a big thing of this ghost scare

92
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:37,409
are the very-ones who
probably made this all up and

94
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,511
are having their thrills
Iaughing inside. right?

96
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,296
What? You mean me'?

97
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,248
Ha. ha, ha. hopeless case...

98
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,350
One other person I can think
of that was making a fuss over

100
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,920
it is the guy confined in the art
room all alone drawing pictures.

102
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,188
Don't you think he's suspicious?

103
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,958
Even the guy we just
saw in the infirmary

105
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,760
IS JUSt as SUSPICIOUS.

106
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,897
Because the storeroom where
the.desk was is near the infirmary...

108
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,968
Moreover, if you use
this slated drain board

110
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,337
you can go directly out to the campus...

111
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:08,040
Then, the suspicious
nes are those two .

113
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,776
Not really...there's one more person...

114
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,978
Kazumi is also to be suspected!

115
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,513
Huh?! Why!

116
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,515
Well, if she went to the restroom,

117
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,917
it means she left the library, doesn't it?

118
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,652
Guess so...

119
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,722
Now that you mentioned it,
I wonder why she came when

121
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,058
we were checking the
storeroom of the gym?

123
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,994
It must've been by chance and besides,

124
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,131
If she did play-such a prank,
wouldn't she'have left for home?

126
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,266
Not really...

127
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,936
Before I went out to campus
to go 10 the desk with Dr. Nude,.

129
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:42,124
just a while ago, I went 10 the shoes
box to get my shoes but despite

131
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:46,211
the doorway and the school building
being wet with ran, I saw no footprints.

133
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,014
Which means that the person
making up the ghost scare is...

135
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,350
still within this school building...

136
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,051
Yes.

137
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,288
If the same person Is
making up all four ghost scares

139
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:00,425
it's extremely likely that this person
knows about the student called Hosaka

141
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,112
who accidentally died two
years.ago. as well as know a lot

143
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,264
about.the scene of the accident...

144
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,469
Hardly. ino:one, passes through,
this: corridor: after school-:and moreoverO

146
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,405
if the teachers-were all gatheredtin.the
teacher's room_ having a:conference...

148
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:15,941
whether it be from the
infirmary on the first floor...

150
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,743
the art room on the second-floor...

151
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,811
or from the third floor library...

152
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,014
the person could secretly
without being seen by anyone

154
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:27,085
carry the desk and chair out
to campus. It's not impossible...

156
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:30,322
The problem is, how were the
desk and chair placed there without

158
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,475
Ieaving any footprints behind,
and for what purpose...

160
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,344
There must be something involved...

161
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,963
A reason for causing the ghost scare...

162
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,369
Huh'...

163
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,971
I wonder what this is...

164
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,305
on top of the drain board.

165
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,641
It looks like traces of someone
having splashed water...

167
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,410
I wonder if ther were
water traces like this'

169
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,011
when we passed here a while ago?

170
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,347
D.Don't tell me that!!

171
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,882
Agh!

172
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,550
Conan!

173
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,218
If that's the case,

174
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,088
the traces of#it should be
somewhere.on the campus.

176
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,492
I found it! This is it!!

177
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,560
Gee whiz!

179
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,564
You're not-supposed to
go outside with slippers!!

181
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,934
To think that didn't notice how
such an easy trick was carried out...

183
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,938
But, this trick can be carried
out by any of the three...

185
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,408
In order to get the evidence,
although it's a bit reckless...

188
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,377
Uh, Ran!

189
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,246
Will you all wait for me
in front of the art room?

191
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,783
I've figured out a way to get the culprit.

192
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,185
What?!

193
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,321
Hmm. .H He's llate!!

194
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,190
How long does he
intend to keep us waiting...

196
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,158
Oh. there he is! 7

197
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,761
Where were you?

198
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,262
Yep. well...

199
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,531
I hope we're really
going to be able to figure

201
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,834
things out here, about
the culprit of the ghost scare

204
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,903
Huh? H.HEY! You glasses kid...

206
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:52,471
Agh...!

207
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,872
Huh

208
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,874
Hey l.thought I told
you 'not-to-come inside?!

210
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,844

Yeah, I have everything here
so that I can go home right away...

217
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,117
Hey There! Sorry to intrude on you...

218
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,321
S.Seko?! What brings You here?

219
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,576
This brat told me that
if I come here. I'll get to see

221
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,496
who. the one that's causing

223
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,799
He said that it may
take a while so to prepare

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,001
myself for going home before coming...!

226
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,402
My...

229
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,937
Same here

231
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,272
K:-Kazumi?!

233
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,006
Agh...

234
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,406
Aah. .

235
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,792
Your umbrella's all muddy...

236
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:32,244
Right!

237
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,613
I was watching the weather
forecast this morning and /

240
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,548
in my rush I picked anwold umbrella

241
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,283
that I used to use when I was a child

242
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,683
Cough, cough.

243
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:42,287
Hey. stop dusting mud off here!

244
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,191
And? Did you figure out
who the culprit is?

246
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,393
Nope. it seems the
show's going to start now...

248
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:48,793
) HH...

249
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,494
Hey...

250
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,329
are sure everything's
going to work out.Conan»."?

252
00:08:52,631 --> 00:08:56,401
No doubt about it... after all...

253
00:08:56,402 --> 00:09:02,807
That one's the culprit...

254
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,848
And?

255
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,183
Where's the one who
caused this ghost scare?

257
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,520
You said that we'd all find
out if we came here, right?

259
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,454
@onan...
\ l"!

261
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,592
That ghost scares rumored to be
the doings of the spirit of the person

263
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,327
called Hesaka who fell off
the stairsstwo years ago

265
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,796
and died, right?

266
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,731
Y. Yes...

267
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,669
The, stairs is the one near the art room...

268
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,172
If so, let's just wait forever very quietly!

269
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,274
W . Wait for what?

270
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,142
What else .

272
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:42,547
but for the ghost of Mr Hosaka to
come dripping wet down the stairs...

274
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,348
\...

275
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,733
Hey!
Kyah...!

277
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:46,751
Ow:/owi ouch!

278
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,819
Phooey!

279
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,489
Listen, we're trying to.-find
the bad one who-s trying-to

281
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,826
make everything loo like
the doings of the ghost!

283
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,094
Mourn

284
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,896
sorgyr but I think I'll head for home.

285
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,698
I guess I will too...

286
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,233
I'm leaving too...

287
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,236
I can't possibly concentrate on
drawing with you guys around...

289
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,823
It's only starting to get
interesting now. and then...

291
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:09,541
Thanks to the glasses kid

292
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,209
I can't seem O come up
with any inspiration. besides...

295
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,911
The fun of it all is disappearing,
so I guess I'll start hedding home too...

297
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,880
Sonoko?!

298
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:21,653
Oooh...

300
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,156
Sonoko!

301
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,957
Did the usual come?!!

302
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:27,826
The usual?

303
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,794
Oh, Sonoko.

304
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,831
Like my father, gets this way,
when she figures out a case...

306
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,367
No. the way she fell
jus NOW was Not normal!

308
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:36,968
Let me check her.

309
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,170
Oh no!!

310
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:41,005
A-h...

311
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,574
Don't touch me, okay?!

312
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,975
Huh

313
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,510
Because l... deduction queen Sonoko

314
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,247
IS about to start a deduction show now!

315
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,649
Oh, so it came after all.

316
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,634
Yes, I've figured it out...

317
00:10:52,635 --> 00:10:54,252
the identity of the one who started

318
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,188
all this ghost scareywhile sneaking
and hiding behind the scenes!

320
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,659
As for you- I think you need
to hide a bit of something.

323
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,562
Talk about showing it all!

326
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,548
Sonoko... 4 our panty's; showing...

327
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:06,765
Sonoko... your panty"s showing...

329
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,633
Sonoko...yourpanty's showing...

330
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,169
Oh. my, I'm sorrk

331
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,904
Since I've figured out the
Wtruth. I seem to have

333
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,439
gone weak, and relaxed.a bit too much

334
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,674
Gee, whiz...

335
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,644
LAUSE (UL WU Eu Yun
to such a simple trick...

337
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,945
S.Simple...

338
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,948
Then, you've figured it out?
The mystery-of the desk and

340
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,851
chair put out on campus
without leaving any footprints...

342
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:31,423
The piece of paper on
the desk was not wet at all...

344
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,957
Right...that piece of paper...

345
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,795
I was thrown off by the
paper that wasn't wet

347
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:38,897
at all and had completely
forgotten about something.

349
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:43,301
Even if the desk and chair were
carried out while it was raining,

351
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,570
the footprints would
be erased by the rain!

353
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,573
The footprints may disappear but,

354
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,093
won't the piece of paper
on the desk also get wet?

356
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:55,380
If you don't want to get wet,
what would you do, Ran?

359
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,383
I'll wait somewhere until it stops raining...

360
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,984
Or, wear a raincoat...

361
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:00,418
Or...

362
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,519
Or...

364
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,656
N.No...

365
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:05,790
Right...

366
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,391
Right...

367
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,861
All the culprit did was cover the paper
so that it wouldn't get wet

369
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,731
using an umbrella with a long
string attached tot!

371
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,200
After it stops raining,

372
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,068
the string attached to
the umbrella is pulled and

374
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,269
the umbrella is retrieved
to the school building

376
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,670
thedlumbrella is retrieved
to the school building

378
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,772
-t...
This wey; oO oof 8 eu oR
behind on the wet, muddy campus

381
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,856
This way, no footprints are left
behind on the wet, muddy campus

383
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:24,075
and the piece of paper is still dry!

384
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,878
The traces were clearly
Ieft behind on campus...

386
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:31,182
The traces of the tip of the frame
of the umbrella touching the ground

388
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,784
when the string was
pulled to take the umbrellatinly

390
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:35,787
On the drain board that
is placed from the campus

392
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,555
grounds to the entrance
of the school building

394
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,491
there were traces of
water being splattered.

396
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,626
This serves as yet another evidence...

397
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,162
The water that was splattered
there was from the umbrella

399
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:44,763
that was retrieved and shook
to shake off excess water...

401
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,498
that was retrieved and shook
OO Ete off (FLEES WET.

403
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,733
But, that's not enough to
shake off all the rain water

405
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,737
The more time passes
the more water:sinks in...

407
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,855
Then,

408
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,807
then, the person who
caused the ghost scare was...

410
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:56,808
Could it possibly be...

411
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,543
Yes, that's right...

412
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,211
The culprit is the one
who owns the umbrella

414
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,547
that has rain water flowing out of it...

415
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,082
You... Kunishige Seko!

416
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:09,120
You were; slegpingtiin
the infirmary saying that

418
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,423
you weren't feeling good
just to carry out this trick...

420
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,460
The weather forecast said
that there would be a shower

422
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,495
from around noon to sundown,

423
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,898
but you didn't know exactly
what time it would be...

425
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,234
You carried the desk and chair that
were instheistoreroom of the gym

427
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,571
out to the campus grounds secretly,
covered the desk with an umbrella

429
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,774
with string attached to ittand went
back to the infirmary forlthe time being. «

431
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:33,510
All you had to do now is wait
for it to stop raining pull the string

433
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:35,180
and retrieve the umbrella.

434
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,281
B.But,

435
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:36,781
8.8111.

436
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,851
What if someone saw
the umbrella 6nithe desk .?

438
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,036
The campus ground cannot
be seen from the first floor

440
00:13:42,037 --> 00:13:44,455
because the trees a e in
the way, and if viewed from

442
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,858
the 2nd and 3rd floor, it
would just look as if someone

444
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,993
IS standing in place in
the rain with an umbrella...

446
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:53,097
Then: do you mean that
the principal I saw was...

448
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:56,034
You just made.a: mistake because
the color.of the'umbrella was the same

450
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,370
as«the one the principal -who'used to
go. out into the:grounds everyday had...

452
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,772
Hey: hey:

453
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,908
you're going to call me the culprit
just because my umbrella was wet?

455
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,845
Since my umbrella was
really dirty. I washed it off

457
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,480
at the faucet just a while ago,
that's why it was wet

459
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,281
Besides,

460
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,817
if it's a trick like that,
Monobe and Tsukamoto

462
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,502
could've done it too. right?

463
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:17,038
» NO. you're the one!

464
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,457
It's interesting that if you are the one,

465
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,861
the answers to all the other
ghost scares fall into place!

467
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,897
The library of grudge,
the cursed stairs, and the wailing

469
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:29,500
in the storeroom of the gym, that is. -
the three ghostly phenomenon!

471
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,203
First for the library of grudge,
where the four books that Hosaka

473
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,540
had borrowed, being left out without
being put away for 4 consecutive days .

475
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,909
But, isn't THAT something
that anybody could've done?

477
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,411
If you look at the library card,
you can get the names

479
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,047
of the people who borrowed
the book In the past...

481
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,783
Do you remember
the title of the four books /

483
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,585
Huh? The title?

484
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,188
I think it was electric, something...

485
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,257
Theory of telecommunication.

486
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,325
Report of the Destruction
of Tropical Rainforests.

488
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,194
The History of the University System.

489
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,463
Analysis of Rock Destruction Sound"...

490
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,899
No ordinary person could
search and find these

492
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,868
four books that virtually no one
would bother to touch at all.

494
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,604
But, you, Mr. Seko, was
his childhood friend

496
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,007
and knew his hobbies very well.

497
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,409
Then, what about the cursed stairs?

498
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:16,648
$0 you're saying $eko 1s responsible
for the bottom of the stairs being wet?

500
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,284
It's there at the bott
of the stairs. isn't there?

502
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,619
The dent, in which to
put the fire extinguisher in...

504
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,522
Mr. Seko probably got ice ready and hid it

505
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,824
behind the fire extinguisher after school!

506
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,728
The following morning. he wanted
someone to find the water soaked

508
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,765
floor because of the melted ice,
which he prepared during the night.

510
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,168
That's why you: put'wax on the floor
right:beldw:the-dent. right?

512
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,204
You used the wax as
a water repellent. so that

514
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,174
it'wouldn:t. ook as if water
flowed out from the dent...

516
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,343
Mr. Seko, whose house
IS near the school is the

518
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,312
only one who could've
done.something like this .

520
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,713
I see...

521
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,216
He went home to get
the ice after school...

523
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,918
But. why?

524
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,120
Why would you, who used
to be Hosaka's childhood friend

526
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,588
do something like this...?

527
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,425
Depending on your answer,
you re going to get it...

529
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,260
The whole thing probably started with the

530
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,995
wailing in the storeroom of/the gym...

531
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:04,796
Huh?

532
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,199
The wailing that the
students who came for

534
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,170
early morning practice
heard was Mr. Seko's voice...

536
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,707
If Mr. Seko's ping-pong d Yalso
had early morning practice that day.

538
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,277
It's natural that he wouldsbe
in the storeroom of the gym.

540
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,981
Maybe he noticed Mr. Hosaka's desk
and chair for the first time that day.

542
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:26,951
It's not strange to think that
Mr. Hosaka's death was no accident...

544
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,453
Yeah-=that's right.

545
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,588
It-dawned.on me right away

546
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,559
that Hosaka was bullied and
killed-while I was in theshospital!!

548
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,994
What the 7!

549
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,998
You mentioned just a while ago,
that I knew what kind of books

551
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,301
he would borrow because
I was his childhoed<«friend: right...

553
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,670
Actually:'that's not it...

554
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,740
Those four books were
the books thatiiHosaka

556
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,843
brought with him when
he came to visit me everyday

558
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,345
at the hospital.
In. order to..Cheer me up

560
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,681
he told me about the
funny and interesting stories

562
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,816
he made up after reading those books.

563
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,868
But. he suddenly stopped coming.

564
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:03,538
I thought that maybe he found
a girl he liked or something.

566
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:05,123
I didn't think he had died of an accident...

567
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:05,723
I didn't think he had died of an accident...

568
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,726
After being discharged from the hospital,
I investigated on his accident

570
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,195
but all I found out was
that he fell from the stairs...

572
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,499
That is, until I found his
desk with his signature

574
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,634
on it in the storeroom of the gym!!

575
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:19,237
That's whyal wanted; to find the one

576
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,639
who hid his desk into=the storeroom...

577
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,041
I wanted to find the one

578
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,110
who pushed him off the stairs...

579
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,046
WwW. Wrong...

580
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,948
Hosaka didn't fall off
the stairs. nor was he bullied...

582
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,383
I'm to blame!!!

584
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,684
What 7?

585
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,788
That day, early in the
morning. two stone statues

587
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,624
were scheduled to
be delivered to school...

589
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,827
0th Hésaka and I were
weekly. monitors that day, so...

591
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:47,065
we secretly carried the two statues to the
art room early in the morning .

593
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,435
We were planning to place the statues
by the door to sunprise-the art.teacher...

595
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,806
But because we were rushing to set up

596
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,941
the statues before the teacher arrives

597
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,444
we went past the 2nd floor
art room to the 3rd floor...

599
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,896
Since Hosaka told me this,
I rushed to turn back.

601
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:02,680
And tripped...

602
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,181
and tripped...

603
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,425
Hosaka tried to protect
me from falling and

605
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,828
was crushed by me and the statue...

606
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,762
That's why Hosaka wasn't being bullied.

607
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,531
T That's a lie!

608
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,601
Then, why was his desk
put in a dimly lit place like that

610
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,537
and{ covered with dust?!
No matter how you look at it...

612
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,539
We didn't want to erase the signs...

613
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,076
that Hosaka was coming to
the same school as we were

615
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,846
man EE Val An 6 Lai ANAL aa.
His signature was written in pencil,

617
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,748
so If left as it would've
rubbed off eventually, right?

619
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,151
After the accident, the drawings of the

620
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,553
the faces of all 'his classmates was found

621
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,922
in his notebook..so we got sad...

622
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,492
and asked the teacher afavor... That is.

623
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,128
To put his desk out in
one of the classrooms

625
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,497
on the day of our graduation, so that

626
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,199
he canigraduate together with us...

627
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,068
At first the teacher gave a sour look...

628
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,504
but we asked the teacher
to let us keep the desk

630
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,606
and chair in the storeroom
of the gym after

632
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,658
the class collected enough
money ta buy them.

634
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,210
We should've told you about it too.

635
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,447
But we found out that
you were childhood friends

637
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,316
with Hosaka only after the ghost scare...

638
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,918
I see...

639
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,521
That's why you were
at the storeroom backithen...

641
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,387
Yes,

642
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:19,957
I thought maybe Seko might be

643
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,593
where Hosaka's desk was .

644
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,594
Then...

646
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:29,000
Then, he wasn tullied
or had a grudge on anybody...

648
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,233
NO...

649
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:32,637
If anybody, I'm the only one
he'd have a grudge against...

651
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,506
After all. I'm the one who
thought up that stupid prank too...

653
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,174
No...

654
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,977
I'm sure he holds
no grudge against you...

657
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:44,448
Well. Iawas the first one to be called
to the site of the accident...

659
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,618
Back then. he kept mumbling...

660
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,987
That maybe the teacher will be even more

661
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:51,789
surprised if he fell to the ground as is

662
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:55,059
Phooey...just as expected of him...

Just as expected of you. Sonoko!!

Yawn...

707
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,788
Your deduction was+superb as always!

708
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,055
Y Yeah, I guess so!

709
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,456

I don't remember, though. like always...

Hmm...

713
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,964
But, what a surprise)
it was to hear that Dr Niide

715
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,967
heard the last wordsy
spoken by that student...

717
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,335
Oh, well

718
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,471
The truth is, he was in
no condition to talk at all...

720
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,808
But, I figured at that time,
it was best to say so.

722
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:54,412
To make those seniors feel relieved...
I couldn'tghelp lying.

725
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:56,012
Oh...

726
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:58,916
Dr. Niide, you're really so kind!

HUN og,

728
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:03,320
Well, what a relief
that there were no ghosts.

730
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:06,290
Yep! I won't have 10 worry about
being monitor next week anymore!

732
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,326
Okay. maybe I'll go talk to
the newspaper club about

734
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,127
my deduction and
give them a scoop article.

736
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,729
I think you shouldn't do anything.

737
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,065
There'll be no ghost scares anymore...

738
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,034

A bad erson?

771

Every time I get in touch with
the students or teachers at school,

773
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,012
he just doesn't seem
to be a bad person...

what a fool!!

776
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:37,248
