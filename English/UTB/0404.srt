Remember what Mr. Clock said?

77
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:54,984
Keep in mind,
this Angel's Mansion is like a labyrinth

79
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,385
A labyrinth...

80
00:03:56,386 --> 00:04:00,356

00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,663
So we can't get outta here?

86
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:09,115
Sigh

87
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:11,400
Huh...

88
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,070
Mitsuhiko. it's all your fault.

89
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,539
What? It's not my fault!

90
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,009
Yeah it is Us because you were
trying to be cool in front Yuriko.

92
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,278
You're not that kinda guy
You shouldn't have acted like that.

94
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,946
Ok. but you were doing
exactly the same thing

96
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:27,683
saying "I'm gonna beat Conan,
weren't you!

98
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,519
Al and Ayumi. you girls were too!

99
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,722
I just.
I just wanted to...

101
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:36,759
You too, Conan! Look what happened
after we got into the Angel's Mansion.

103
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,628
You should've been more careful!

105
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,098
You guys:should-ve-been waiting outside.

106
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:44,233
YO. man!

107
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:47,036

110
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,438

Ah. why not!

113
00:04:53,811 --> 00:05:00,917
Oh...gh

114
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,719
Stop it.

115
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,923
Guys. no fighting. please!
We're all friends. right!?

117
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:09,442
Yeah. but they're saying it's all.my fault.

118
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,994
For God's sakes,
who else is gonna get Yuriko back

120
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:15,331
If the Youth Detective Squad split up?

121
00:05:15,332 --> 00:05:18,935
She's alone...rightsnow,, at this moment...

122
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,739
S. sorry. I was wrong.

123
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,341
No. I was wrong!

124
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:28,411
No... was wrong!

126
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,146
Did Conan just apologize?

127
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:31,881
E (IC

129
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:36,552
Welk everything's going be fine!

130
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:39,487
This mazes hike nothing. as long as tho
Youth Detective Squad 1s together. night?

132
00:05:39,488 --> 00:05:40,957
Yeah. that's right!

133
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,391
Sigh...

134
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,826
It's tough to motivate kids: isn't it?

135
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,162
Oh quiet.

136
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:48,030
Hoy. Mitsuhiko

137
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,081
Yes?

138
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,535
You found human bones
in the East Mansion, right?

140
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:54,837
Which direction was the head pointing?

141
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:57,506
Direction. eh .!.Let me think

142
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:02,712
Iere's the South Mansion.
And I went into the East one like this. so...

144
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:04,313
It's that way

145
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:07,383
The-dead. man was lying on
his stomach. facing the fireplace...

147
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:12,321
I guess that's where the thieves ended up
in this maze. like Mr. Clock said...

149
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:16,592
When a man falls down on his stomach,
the head shows where he was heading...

151
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:22,331
Mitsuhiko already saw thatethe fireplace
was"connected to where the bones were.

153
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:26,335
So, this maze shou dglead us I
at least to the East Mansion.

155
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:29,405
Great! You're my man!

157
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:34,844
Yeah, but more important is how we get
there before we become bones. right?

159
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:37,663
The labyrinth of Minotaur...

160
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,748
What?

161
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:44,387
Hey remember? The half man half
bull monster in front of the mansion...

163
00:06:45,022 --> 00:06:49,592
In therancient Greek myths,
Minotaur is a son of a king.

165
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:51,060
Who incurred the God's displeasure

166
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:53,729
And the God made Minotaur
half-human half-bull.

168
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,066
S nce Minotaur became
awfully violent asllhe grew up.

170
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:01,871
The king decided to putedhim In a
huge maze. so.he could never come out...

172
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:04,273
So that monster is somewhere in this maze?

173
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:06,141
Oh, come on. No

174
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,480
What's important is after that

175
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,016
Every year, the king sent
seven Athens kids to the maze as tribute.

177
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:18,154
As Athens here Theseus heard that stor

178
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:22,959
he slayed:the monster,
and came back from the maze

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,030
which people thought impossible to, escape.

181
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:28,564
Hmyymim.

182
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:28,931
Hmmm...

183
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:31,133
By usimg a ball of string

184
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,902
A ball of string

185
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,370
A ball of... string?

186
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,438
Right.

187
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,842
He tied the string to the gate of the maze,
and pulled it while walking inside.

189
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:43,179
On the way back,
all he needed was to follow the string.

191
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,314
I see.

192
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:48,117
Then, we should do the same thing

193
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:49,318
Yeah. we should

194
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,055
Oh, you ladies do not have to do it
Right Conan?

196
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,390
Right.

197
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,553
Hey look,
I think we passed here once already!

200
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:31,093
Ok, then I think we should've turned right
on that corner. not left... ha... Hachoo!

203
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,628
You're alright. Mitsuhiko?

204
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:33,229
You're alright, Mitsuhiko?

205
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,233
Yh, don't you worry In fact,
we should focus on how to get outta...

207
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:39,502
Kerchoo!

208
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:51,113
Don't know if this is enough

209
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,582
Well, I think it's showing
how close we gotsto the exit

211
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,585

00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:55,904
WRY*not?

267
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:58,874
Thewnil becomes thevhead is telling us
to head to the direction of "rat",

269
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,344
which means the North Angel Tower...
And also. rat means midnight.

271
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:07,683
So in order to open the North Angel Tower,
we have to wait until midnight tonight,

273
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:10,885
but our challenge ends at 9 pm tonight.

274
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:11,452
No way!

275
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:12,755
Noway!

276
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:18,360
Mr. Clock, you knew the answer
of the first part of the riddle. didn't you?

280
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:18,894
What?

281
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:19,428
Wht! ?

282
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,598
That's why you just saved Yuriko and
Iet the rest of us fall into the pitfall

284
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:25,801
after finding the black crystal

285
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:28,604
You planned to get in our way. didn't you?

286
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,674
Less than 3 hours left, though
I'm still hoping from my heart that

288
00:11:31,675 --> 00:11:34,743
you to solve the riddle.

292
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:53,262
n=Â¥?

297
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,770
One more hour left

299
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:07,509
There must be a way to open the gate
of the North Angel Tower somehow...

301
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,115
Everyone is trying hard. Think... Think

302
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:17,086
When the bull's horn disappears
and the tail becomes the head...

304
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,654
An angel will come down
and play the flute

306
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,191
The song of the angel is my very treasure.

307
00:12:25,362 --> 00:12:26,327
Is niin pen Â¢

308
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,697
It's scary. the angel...

309
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:34,837
No way... but that's:so. then...

310
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,481
Oh. I see. Now I got it!

311

00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,050
Somebody. get me a ladder!

313
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,389
Yo. man, where's a ladder!?

00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:00,863

320
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,284

of the black crystal to show us the treasures

328
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:31,320
Hey, it's over there.
An angel has come down to the forest!

330
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:33,322

It's the shadow.

The song of the angel 1s
my very treasure, right?

336
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:42,664
It's on the hill where
the: charcoal burncr's lodge is.

338
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:45,067
That's where
HOO Soy ) KF weal Gr GO C

Mr. Clock! ?

344
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,087
It is Yuriko's treasure!

345
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:07,890
You're an adultÂ¥,
Good adults~don't steal things!

347
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,358
Mr Clock .

348
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:09,892
No. it's not that. Yuri...

349
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:11,627
No. it's not that. Yuri...

350
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:12,027
No. it's not that. Yuri...

351
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:17,216
Do not interrupt me. There's no time.

352
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:36,685
Oh no! No more maze. please!

353
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,383
I can't see!

354
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:59,808
This is Mr Goro Iscgawn's Yunko's
great-grandfather's treasures, isn't it?

356
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,678
Inet (8 nel?

357
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:09,201
The game as over!
Mr. Clock. you tell us your story!

359
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:13,489
I knew you were trying to get these
treasures from the beginning.

361
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,692
You were Mr. Isegawa's secretary
You heard and solved the all the riddles

363
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:18,694
before anybody else. right?

364
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:19,895
Solved everything...?

365
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:24,299
Yeah, but ipsthe same way as I did.
In the wrong way.

367
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,369
The fact that he told us the riddles
In the evening shows that.

369
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,272
I'm sorry but it's not time yet

370
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:32,708
If he presents the riddle at 9 pm
the challenger has to wait

372
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,578
until the neon of the next day.
To get into the North Angel Tower

374
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:41,383
Thore. the challenger maybe able to
rcalizethe second question,

376
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,118
in which: 'he has to gotinto
the North Angel lower

378
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,720
Bul the ear iest he can get Into
the North Tower is the midnight off that day

380
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:48,824
SO He HERR Tex OWA FON TY, Aes
NO Way you can break it within 24 hours

382
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:51,193
N. no! It wasn't me...

383
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:56,331
But If he really wanted tho treasure,
he could've tried his deduction and

385
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:59,935
realized the flaw in the riddlcÂ¢,
don't ou think?

388
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:04,473
Sure ho could,
but he didn't! Because it would be a crime

390
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:07,543
if he snatched someone s treasure!

391
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:11,146
He w: ted to have the treasure officially

393
00:17:12,749 --> 00:17:17,685
WER Pin fig O ey - ROB To ano
with the 18th right of inheritance

395
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:23,559
It makes sense that he was watching us,
werfering with us. erasing all the clue

397
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,031
the previous challengers left,
because he was waiting for his turn.

399
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:35,570
No'!.It'wns Master's Mr. Isegawa's
will te sct the riddle time at 9 pm.

402
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,439
Yeah. right. Who would believe that?

403
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,208
I would! Because

404
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,644
Because that knife wasn't to hurt us
but to make us realize the presence

406
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,379
Aha lag voltage current

407
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,915
Tho footstops sounded hko it was an adult

408
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,252
He is the only adult in here!

409
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,654
I don't think he was trying to
monitor or interfere with us.

411
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,991
I think he was trying to
protect Yuriko and us...

413
00:17:55,992 --> 00:18:01,063
Now, please, be careful. Some of the s
ecurity systems are actually quite dangerous

415
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:05,467
I think so too
Mr. Clock isn't a bad person.

418
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,522
hen db was in thal room...

421
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:31,093
Ok. I air gnough.

422
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:33,495
Yuriko's parents gave up on
their grandfather Ã©wnduft the house

424
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:35,764
Hey Al. I don't think that's ah...

425
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,499
Because of his nature of hating people.

426
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,368
There's no way such person would
tell his secret to a stranger

428
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,170
even if he's the secretary

429
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:45,240
So. Mm point is,
Mr Clock is related to Mr. Isegawa .

431
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,776
Hdb related to my qroot-grandfather .!?

432
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:51,380
But at the same time, he was also
someone Mr segawa hated so much

434
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,248
so that he had to lose his name.

435
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:58,320
Execute his master's will, and remain In this
mansion until someone solves the riddle

437
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:01,790
There's only ore person
we can think of here

439
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,759
Probably. you are...

440
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,161
OK, that's enough!

441
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:10,165
It wasnfl the gold blocks Mr Clock weÂ»
trying to reach! It was that.

443
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,021
Yuriko) .

444
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:21,108
No man! It's Mr. Isegawa's
granddaughter. Mr. Clock's wife!

446
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:25,514
What!? So that means,
Clock is Yuriko's father?

448
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:31,253
Right! He's someone Mr. Isegawn hated]
The most but also related to him.

450
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:37,125
Yuriko's father must be thc
one 'cause he ram away with his wife!

452
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:44,182
Mr. Isegawa loved his granddaughter,
uriko's mother so much

454
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:48,185
He said she reminded him of his wife a lot

455
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:53,275
So. he was desperate to get her back
when we ran away from him.

457
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,878
Around that time,
he had a lot of connections

459
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:58,613
with the underground community

460
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,084
didn't know what
he would do if he got mad...

462
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:07,956
$0 I decided to leave my wife and Yuriko
who was just born. to protect them.

464
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,894
I made a deal with Mr Isegawa
I work for him so he leaves my family alone.

466
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:19,267
To ease his anger, it was necessary to
serve him with all my heart and soul.

468
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:23,572
Master. it's getting windy now

469
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:27,826
MM... I know. but ll like doing this...

470
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,649
And one day I realized.

471
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,421
He truly loved his family
from the bottom of his heart.

473
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:42,224
He didn't know the:way:'to;show it well...

474
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:48,063
Raging Bull was a difficult but
kind old man who valued his family

476
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:51,833
And it was last year that
Mr. Isegawa started saying that

478
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,170
he wanted to settle with his granddaughter
or Yuriko's mother all of a sudden.

480
00:20:55,171 --> 00:21:00,642
So I looked for my family
and found out about my wife's death.

482
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:06,098
Mr Isegawn collapsed rapidly with
disappointment and died with the riddle.

484
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:09,718
Presentation of the riddle is 9pm.

485
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:15,589
If the nddle is solved. you are fred
Forgive me. Matsunaka.

487
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:23,865
I'm Yoshihito Matsunaka. Yiuriko's father

488
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:29,471
Your mother made that
riddle when she was a Â¢hild

490
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,939
Mom made it?

491

Great grandad chose that riddle
