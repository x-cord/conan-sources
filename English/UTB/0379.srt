137
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:41,885
a dark side of face. People
call it "Kimono Demon".

139
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:44,021

00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:47,224
It's-an old folkloregtold
In this village...On%e upon a time.

142
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:50,227
There was a young woman,
named Ohana. in this village.

144
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:52,129
She was a kind, hardworking woman.

145
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:57,768
One da , Ohana found a samurai,
who broke hissleg. She helped him

147
00:06:57,769 --> 00:06:59,603
As a token of gratitude for her help.

148
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:02,656
The samurai gave Ohana tons
of beautiful kimonos and sashes.

150
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,408
Being envious of Ghana's' fortune.

151
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:07,644
The village mayor's daughters
made a false charge against her

153
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:11,415
Ohana was arrested and
the daughters took her kimonos.

155
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,084

the lights went out, and

160
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,394
Aghhhhhhh!!

161
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:28,465
Hearing the scream,
the householders came. but...

163
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:30,884
what they found were the dead bodies of

164
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,836
the younger daughter lying on the kimonos

165
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:37,541
and the body of the older one
tangled with many sashes in a pond

167
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:40,143
Realizing the graveness:of Ohanass grudge,

168
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:42,246
The villagers built a small shrine and

169
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:44,348
worshipped her as a
guardian deity of the village.

171
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,517
Ever since then, people in this*area have

172
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,418

Dad!!

300
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:12,415
Discuss I?

301
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,930
It wns five years 1ge
I was in third year in college.

303
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:31,534
There was this illegal drug that
a lot of students on campus were using.

305
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:35,404
Somehow, people started to suspect
a female student as the drug dealer

307
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:38,408
Although she denied the fact that she was

308
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:41,478
the drug dealer, the drugs
were!found in her locker.

310
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,481
Wr ry Tw Yn Pane dB1L-BL
Shekilled herself by jumping:off-the

312
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:47,551
universitygbuilding,
saying.she was innocent...

314
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,121
That person's name is...Sakurako Suzuka I

315
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:54,024
I told you about her
under the Kimono Sakura

317
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:57,027
he was a very kind person
who loved cherry blossoms.

319
00:12:57,028 --> 00:13:02,699
There's no way thatsshe was \
selling the drugs It just:.can't be hen

321
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,803
So. please. Mr Mourn! Could you
re-investigate this case again!? Please!?

323
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:12,475
Hmm, this was five yearns ago though...

324
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:15,545
Actually there was a
rumor that the drug dealers

326
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,447
were some other female students.

327
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:18,515
What?

328
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:23,587
But those students were from,
a family who had a lot of authority

330
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:27,023
So, no one could go against them...

331
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:29,326
Them?

332
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:32,762
The are Asuka Shibasaki and Ema Anzai.

333
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:36,233
Asuka is a-daughter:of
a parliamentary deputy.

335
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:41,071
And Em is a daughter of the major
construction firm. Anzai Global

337
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:45,108
Those two girls didn't get
along with Sakurako too well.

339
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:47,777
Because of her strong sense of justice

340
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:49,512
Hmmm.

341
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:53,783
Alright! I'll see what I can do. ok?.

342
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:56,753
Oh. thank you so much!

343
00:13:56,754 --> 00:14:00,223
You must like her a lot.

344
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:03,159
I lost my parents when I was young.

345
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,462
My uncle and aunt raised me

346
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,966
Sakurako also lost her parents by fire,

347
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,269
and so she was very kind to me.

348
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:28,585
Oh! You guys arc going toe the bath now?

349
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:31,121

Outside, only Ema's footprints
and nothing else was found

469
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,600
In other words, this place was closed
and sealed off by the snow...

524
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:22,572
First of all, around the shrine,
where Ema was murdered.

00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:28,077
There were no footprints found.
Other than hers.

528
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:30,079
So...Ema killed herself!?

529
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:31,281
I don't think so...

530
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:34,884
There were no weapons found in there...

531
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:40,189
And 'secondly in order to go to the
outdoor 'bath. where Asuka was murdered

533
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,077
you have tto go through the recreation hall. *

534
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:50,867
We were there after 10:30,
but didn't see an bod passing through...

536
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,435
What about climbing the cliff and
going to the outdoor bath

538
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:57,440
I already checked it. There were no
suspicious traces found on the cliff.

540
00:20:58,075 --> 00:21:02,111
Then, Asuka was murdered before 10:307

541
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:06,916
We found a dagger and
a stungun in the bathtub.

543
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:11,020
Perhaps, the murderer attacked Asuka
with the stungun first,

545
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,056
then killed her in the outdoor bath.

546
00:21:13,157 --> 00:21:16,793
The«dagger in fact had a nacre
decoration in its hilt

548
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:18,928
I asked the-proprietress about it

549
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,397
and she said it was the votive dagger .
Dedicated to the shrine in the garden .

551
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:23,599
The votive dagger?

552
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:29,038
ANd @gne more thing Emma's bandana was
also found in the outdoor bath.

554
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,607
There was blood on that bandana

555
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:32,909
I don't get it...

556
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,611
Blood... So what?...

557
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:40,149
Assuming thatbot Victims) were murdered
with the same dagger

559
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,820
it's plausible to think that
Ema was killed before Asuka was

561
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:48,591
Furthermore ..Ema waOalive « htil 10:30.

562
00:21:48,592 --> 00:21:51,928
So theoretically,
Asuka was killed after 10:30. db

564
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:54,997
How did the murderer
get into the outdoor bath though?

567
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:59,268
There were no traces whatsoever,
in the shrine of the garden too. right?

569
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:03,389
Give me a break. You gotta be a ghost or
something to do that.

571
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,339
It's the curse...

572
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:07,677
It's the curse of the Kimono Demon.

573
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,679
Oh, please!

574
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:11,814
- 4 pr -
You know what I saw!?

577
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:16,219
I saw a couple of new paper dolls
dedicated to the shrine!

579
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:21,022
The Kimono Demon's curse
killed Asuka and Ema!

581
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,992
No...It can't be...

583
00:22:23,794 --> 00:22:27,029
A curse: did not kill*the girls. It's obvious.

584
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:31,951
But what was the trick that
the murderer used!?
