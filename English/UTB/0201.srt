00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:04,770
Just as flowing water has no form,
and the breeze IS invisible,

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:06,672
deductions take all shapes and styles
in each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,506
Today s episode features
a nostalgic bonnet bus.

7
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,409
It also carries the memory of an incident
that happened many years ago.

9
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,944
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,579
A child in appearance
with the ll.Q. of an adult,

12
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,449
no case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

(BI%R)
THE 10TH PASSENGER
PART

17
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,430
Umm, it feels so good

18
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,333
The air's so fresh

19
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,302
This bus is like the ones in the old days

20
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,537
I like it because it doesn't have a cooler

21
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:20,638
Good grief...

22
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,808
I don't understand why

23
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,244
anyone would actually
WANT to ride in this rundown bus

25
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,780
It's BECAUSE it's old
that gives it charm!

27
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,916
I've never ridden in one before
that's why I'm enjoying it!

30
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,619
What do they call this type of bus again?

31
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,688
It's a bonnet bus!

32
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,525
There were a lot around until
30 years ago

34
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:41,093
See .

35
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,095
The front's narrow, isn't it...

36
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:46,365
that's what makes it fun
when we pass another bus on a curb

38
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,434
You're absolutely right!

39
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,870
You sure know a lot, kid

40
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,672
I read about it in a book

41
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,642
This kid knows a lot of useless information!

42
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:57,843
You're wrong!

43
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,945
It's not considered useless information!

44
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,114
Not to those of us that
Iive in Kagekuwa Village

46
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,618
The bonnet bus is a
valuable tourist attraction!

48
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,186
Oh, uh I didn't mean it like that

49
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:07,953
Oh, uh, I didn't mean it like that...

50
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:08,320
Oh uh, I didn't mean it like that

51
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:08,888
Huh?!

52
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,724

56
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,130

66
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:34,713
Eh...?!

67
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,084
Toko Natsume

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,087

73
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:44,657
I'm sorry

74
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,711
Whoa look at this huge rock,

75
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,947
It must've fallen from up there

76
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,985
Eeeek, look at that!

77
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,320
Can we do it?

78
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,125
That was scary

79
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:19,859
Sure was...

80
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,626
Huh?! 7

81
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,097
A memorial tower?

82
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,403
Kagekuwa Village

83
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:48,621
Ahem!

84
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,824
Oh, yes the seat's open

85
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,159

Your seat. 2?!

95
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,631
Does this bus have reserved seats?

96
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:01,200
Mr. Okumura behave yourself!

97
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,868
Today's Sunday!!

98
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,302
I know that!!

99
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,473
We agreed at the village meeting
that unless it was a weekday,

101
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,641
we would give up
our seats to the tourists!

103
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:10,342
Humph!

104
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:14,513
The village mayor and you and
your group decided that for yourselves!!

106
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,081
How dare you!!

107
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,550
So, what? tie you going to do...

Force me to follow orders?

00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,224
Get out of my seat, scat!

112
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,296
This has been my seat for 40 years!!!

113
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,631
I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.

114
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,833
Please take another seat

115
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,636
What's with this bus anyway...!

116
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,513
Gee,

117
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,948
it gets pretty crowded

118
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,549
That's because to the locals,

119
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,519
this isn't just a tourist attraction,
it's how they get around

121
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,568
Argh!!

122
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,769
En 7!

123
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,271

What happened?!

127
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,348
Wh, what's going on?!

128
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,283
It looks like someone got sick

129
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,418
I, I'm taking this bus to
the hospital right now!

He s dead

139
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,864

No one gets off this bus
until the police arrive!

144
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,704
Aw rats do we have to?

145
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,273
Now wait just a minute!

146
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:48,741
I don't think that's necessary...

147
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,043
I especially mean you, Mr. Yabe!

148
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,177
If this is a case of murder

149
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,881
you'd be our prime suspect since
you and the victim had an argument

151
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,483
and your seat is directly behind his!

152
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,652
MM, murder...

153
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,287
who do you think you are anyway...?

154
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,323
My name is Kogoro Mourn,
I'm a private detective!

156
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:05,391
Eh 7!

157

Mouri, you mean
the famous private detective....!

159
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,095
That means this is a big case!

160
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,563
That's right! It must be!

161
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,599
I wonder who did it?

162
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,439
I'm at your service!

00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:29,748
Ahem...!

170
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:30,616
Yes well!

171
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,320
You seem to be a very promising officer!

172
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,989

Thank you very much.!

174
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,292
By the way...

175
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,795
it seems you claimed this was a murder,

176
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,430
but...are you sure...?

177
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,798
If it is,

178
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,366
then we have a serious situation
on our hands...

180
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:47,766
Eh...?!

181
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,836
Well h, we've got to
investigate it thoroughly first

183
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,870
It's murder alright

184
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,472
You again!

185
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,374
Always sticking your nose in where
it doesn't:b&longTh,

187
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,509
Look at the plastic bottle

188
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,845
Plastic bottle?

189
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,047
You can see it's leaking...

190
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,649
I think it's from that tiny hole,
It looks like a needle hole...

192
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,584
He s right...!

193
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,686
Maybe they used a hypodermic
needle to put the poison in...?!

195
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,154
Alright!

196
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,923
Uw Let's search everyone!

197
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,192
Whoever has a hypodermic needle
IS our murderer!

199
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,026
Wl wouldn't know about that

200
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:14,660
What?!

201
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,228
The windows were open

202
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,564
sq it could ve been)
tossed out at anytime. .!

204
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,368
And besides} the killer could've
gotten off at one of the other stops

206
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,902
Grrr...

207
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,071
Oh, oh, I feel a storm coming

208
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:26,872
Eh...?!

209
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,476
No, it'll be bigger than a storm...

210
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,378
there's going to be a war in the village...!!

211
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,445

00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,080

What'll we do?

215
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,784
A lot of blood's going to flow...

216
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,086
Blood will flow 2?!

217
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,095
Mr. Mourn,

218
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,897
the hypodermic needle has been found!

219
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,932
It was on the side of the road
where the bus passed!

221
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,435
There was some poison in it,
but very little!

223
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,903
What about fingerprints?

224
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,104

249
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:29,735
Huh...?!

250
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,604
While you're sleeping,

251
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,140
I'll bet somebody else is
solving the crime for you!!

253
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,043

254
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,478

256
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,880

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,818

Huh?!

262
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:55,093
I know you can solve the case
without those policemen's help

264
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,362
You can bet on it!

265
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,964
Just watch, Detective Hino!!

266
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,466
I'll show you!!

267
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,034
Mr. Mourn,

268
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,103
I may not be much help
but I d be glad to assist

270
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,239
You won't get away with this .!

271
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,075
Committing a murder

273
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,612
I'M going to find the killer on my own...!!

274
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,048
Excuse me,

275
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,451

get done with the questioning...

277
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,351

280
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,424

283

Neutral. 7?

300
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:49,314
You re been babbling strange things

301
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,750
about storms and wars and what not

302
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,585
Well, uh, you see, it's like this...

303
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,787
You'll find out soon enough...

304

but for now,
please follow me to your rooms

306
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,161
Wow you can see Mt. Fuji from this place

307
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,863
This is great

308
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,432
Why you're Conan, aren't you?

309
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,600
Is that your room?

310
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,135
You're the bus guide!

311
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,070
You live next door

314
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,642
because you get the best view of
Mt. Fuji from around here

316
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,211
Mr. Mourn! Big news'!

317
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,579
What happened?

318
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,014
I have big news!

319
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,017
The investigators are
questioning Mr. Yabe and...

321
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,019
I knew it,

322
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,321
so he's the prime suspect after all!

323
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,390
I'm not sure about that yet,

324
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,459
I'm talking about
WHERE they're questioning him!

326
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,993
What do you mean?

327
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,995
They didn't take him to the district station,

328
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,363
they're doing it at the substation here!

329
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,733
And both the pro and con factions
have stormed their way in and...!!

331
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,403
Pro and con factions...?

332
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,305
Everyone go home!

333
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,807
The police will do
a thorough investigation!!

335
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,875
We don't trust them!

336
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,009
Give us Yabe!

337
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,245
He killed the deputy mayor!

338
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,379
Yeah, that's right!!

339
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,314
That's not true!

340
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,049
Yabe didn't do it!

341
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,317
He's innocent!!

342
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,986
Mayor, you told Yabe to do it, didn't you!

343
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:01,887
You won't get away with it!!

344
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:02,988
Get him!!

345
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:04,255
S, stop4sthat!!

346
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,692
I'll arrest you for
interfering in police business!!

348
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,962
What's going on...

349
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:15,867
Stop that!

350
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,802
Everybody calm down!

351
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,437
Everybody, just calm down!

352
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:18,937
Move it!

353
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:19,471
Whoa!

354
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,907
Heeeeee

355
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:22,674
Uncle Mourn!

356
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,976
Dad!

357
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,811
Mr. Mouri, are you all right?

358
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,113
Please stop...!

359
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:33,418
I said STOP IT!

360
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,698
Yes, the crowd's breaking up
and things are settling down now again!

362
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,635
Thank you very much!

363
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,570
There, that should do it

364
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,504
Mr Mourn,

365
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,239
thegpolice car transporting Mr. Yabe

366
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,741
has arrived safely at the district station!

367
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,743
Never mind that,

368
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,745
what's going on in this village?

369
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,178
Actually,

370
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,682
nothing: like this happened here
$ until a year ago

372
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,619
but ever since it was decided at the
village assembly that the bonnet bus

374
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,388
would be used to promote tourism,

375
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,124
the faction backing the
development of tourism

377
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,793
headed by the mayor and Mr Yabe

378
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,863
and the opposing faction
Ied by the victim, Mr. Okumura,

380
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:19,831
the deputy mayor have been at each
others' throats

382
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,404
That bus had always been used by
the villagers as their mode of transportation.

384
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,840
It's a small village
and everyone knows each other

386
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,009
so naturally,
they all started to have their own seats,

388
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,645
it was just the way things worked out...

389
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,484
But then it wasr'decided that.on weekends,
the seats would be for the tourists...

391
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,955
And Deputy Mayor Okumura and his
opposing faction didn't like the idea

393
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,891
No they didn't .

394
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,326
And things got worse...

395
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,096
but, who would have thought
it'd lead to murder...

397
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,298
Yabe IS innocent!!

398
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:53,932
Eh...?!

399
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,202
I'm sorry about how I acted before,

400
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,704

I can assure you Takuro Yabe
did not kill the deputy mayor!!

I don't like to talk ill about the dead

427

But it could turn out
to be Mr. Yabe after all

We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it!

434
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,235
I just want things in the village to be
back to normal as soon as possible!

436
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:35,640
Everyone was finally beginning to
forget that tragic incident 7 years ago

438
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:36,641
and now this...

439
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,144
What incident 7 years ago?

440
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,080
Oh, uh, nothing you
should be concerned about!

442
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,716
By the way, how does a fee of
1,000,000 yen sound to you?

444
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:46,585
One, one million...?!

445
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,557
1, uh just want this case to be solved
and things back to normal!

447
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,026
Well, I'll be counting on you!!

448
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,533
Alrighty! Let's start asking around!!

449
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,302
Then I'll be your guide...!!

450
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:07,506
Uh, excuse me

451
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:12,511
Did the victim, Mr. Okumura
always take the bus at that time?

453
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,478
Go away!!

454
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:16,581
Huh...?

455
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,084
I'd like to ask you a few questions...

456
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,487
Excuse me, I'd like to...

457
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,193
Of all the!

458
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,429
Hey! What's going on In this village?

459
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,166
Actually, there're :more villagers
against the proposal...!

461
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,402
And I guess
everyone's heard you're working

463
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,272
for the mayor who's on the other side...

464
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,139
that's why

465
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:43,141
Rats!

466
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,810
How can we find anything out!

467
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,344
Hey, Ran,

468
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,313
You and Conan go back to the inn!

469
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,649

I don't know what time I'll be back!!

472
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,523
Uh, officer!

473
00:15:59,125 --> 00:15:59,858
Huh?

474
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,459
What is it, Conan?

475
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,162
What happened
in this village 7 years ago?

477
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:07,566
Oh, you're curious about what
Mayor Funaki said back there...

479
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:08,433
it was an accident...

480
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,568
a bus accident!

481
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:10,869
A bus accident?!

482
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,904
Did it involve that bonnet bus?

484
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,672
IUD...

485
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,274
we had it repaired

486
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,743
What caused the accident?

487
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,646
Did anyone get hurt,
was anyone killed?

489
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,617
It happened 7 years ago,
before I got transferred here,

491
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,252
sol don't know all the details...

492
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,423
but I heard about 2 people died...

493
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,357
Hmmm

494
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:34,826
What does that have to do with anything?

495
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,596
Oh nothing! I was just curious!

496
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,997
Hey Officer Shinkai!

497
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,031
Come on!

498
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,066
Yes sir!

499
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:41,666
Right away!!

500
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,303
The bus accident 7 years ago...

501
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:50,575
Mayor Funaki's suspicious behavior
and that huge fee,

503
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,744
something fishy is going on here...

504
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,981
Wow, everything looks delicious

505
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,582
I hope you like it

506
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,785
It's a meal using edible wild plants

507
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,720
Toko!

508
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:03,688
Miss Natsume!

509
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,391
Conan, what're you doing?

510
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,627
Toko.-are. ou home?

511
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,663
What is it, Conan?

512
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,466
There's something I want to ask you...

513
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:17,235
You shouldn't do that from here it's rude!

514
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,336
I'm sorry

515
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,604
It's all right.

516
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,439
What do you want to know?

517
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,041
It's about the bus accident 7 years ago...

518
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,647
I'm sorry, Conan.

519
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:32,651
I only came here to work 6 months ago...

520
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,819
I heard about the accident

521
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,421
but ll don't know much

522
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,589
I see...

523
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,926
But since we pass the spot
it happened every day,

525
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:41,493
I'm reminded of it...

526
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:41,993
I'm reminded of it...

527
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:42,761
I'm reminded of it...

528
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,164
it's the spot where the memorial tower is!

529
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,531
Oh, that place

530
00:17:47,532 --> 00:17:49,968
That scary part of the cliff

531
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:53,505
I heard that 2 of the passengers were
drinking.and they started fighting,

533
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,174
that caused the bus to lose control
and they went over the cliff...

535
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,183
I'm terribly sorry!

536
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,551
My hands slipped...

537
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,852
I'll bring another right away...

538
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,120
Are you all right?

539
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:10,522
Yes, I'm fine

540
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,129
Toko, is something wrong?

541
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,464
Oh, it's nothing...

542
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,835
well, I've got to go and prepare dinner,

543
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,868
I'll see you later, Conan

544
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,815
Good grief! I don't believe this!

545
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,783
It's not only the con faction.!

546
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:44,122
Even the ones that agree with the mayor
won { cooperate!

548
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,323
Dad, keep your voice down,

549
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,424
other people will hear you

550
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:47,926
Humph!

551
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,027
Who cares!

552
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:51,262
Besides, this is neutral territory!

553
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,897
Why won't they cooperate?

554
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,768
According to Officer Shinkai,

555
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:59,204
although they support
tourism on the one hand,

557
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,473
the tourists leave their trash behind,
they destroy nature and

559
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,241
they stay up late making a racket...!

560
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,910
I They're giving
the villagers a pretty bad time!

562
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,245
Hmm,

563
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,347
gives us something to think about, huh?

564
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,382
Yeah,

565
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,717
but that won't help me do my job!!

566
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,922
It's not going to be easy if we
can't get any information...

568
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,460
Darn it all!

569
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,031
Eh?!

570
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,166
What the, dad...?

571
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,201
Are you in your case solving sleep mode?

572
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,308
What's this...?

573
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,211
He's just drunk and fell asleep...

574
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,147
Oh I knew that!

575
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:43,781
Conan!

576
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,517
Tell them to clear the table!

577
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,652
And tell them to lay out our bedding)too!

578
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:48,887
Hurry!!

579
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,488
Yes, ma'am!

580
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:53,725
Huh...?

581
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,660
It's the innkeeper.

582
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,130
Where's she going at this time
with those flowers?

584
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,682
Conan!

585
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,051
Good grief, where'd he go now...?

586
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:21,286
What's this?

587
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,855
Conan's shoes are gone!

588
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,458
Did he go outside...?

589
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:37,769
Oh...Forgive me...

590
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:39,370
forgive me...

592
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,191
It's Toko...!

593
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,131
What's going on?

594
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,332
I don't get it...

595
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,768
Conan, where are you?

596
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:14,973
Kagekuwa Shrine...

597
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,608
Would he come in here...?

598
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:42,600
Hey you!

599
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,668
What are you doing!!

600
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,537
Is that you!

601
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,372
Conan, is that you?

602
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,440
What are you doing out here?

603
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,410
1, I was just playing hide and seek...

604
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,810
Don't scare me like that

605
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,680
Did something happen around here?

606
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,150
Mr. Yabe was released
for lack of evidence

608
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,052
so I figured I should let Mr. Mouri know

609
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:01,953
Argh!!

610
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,892
That was Mayor Funaki's voice!!

611
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:09,527
Co, Conan!

612
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,665
Wh, what are you doing?

613
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:16,901
Eeek!!

614
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,703
Ran!!

Death was almost instantaneous!

You're under arrest! Give it up!!

660
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,615
What in the world
happened on this bus...

662
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,551
What was that?!

663
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,087
A killer is on the bus?

664
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,355
Th, this can't be happening!

665
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:18,556
