1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:02,835
The heart contains. mysteries,

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,037
Stars and snow sparkle for the two.

3
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:06,806
He mysterious case using a vase.

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,674
Reenacting the scene of the Case.

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,476
He sees through the one and only truth,

6
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,144
1 child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult.

8
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,180
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

10
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,052
We, the members of
the Youth Detective Squad end up

12
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,855
helping Mr. Morita look
for the lost wristwatch in place T Pops.

14
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,625
While we were looking for
the wristwatch at Mr. Mortars condo 48

16
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,763
Ms. Eiko ldezuki, a resident of
the same condo comes over

18
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:12,732
and starts watching a movie
in the audio room.

20
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,301
And starts watching a movie
in the audio room.

22
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:22,408
In the meantime, we found the wristwatch
in the washing machine.

24
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,577
Just then.

26
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:30,281
We heard the flower vase
crack from the audio room!

28
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,286
We rushed over to see what happened

29
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,492
and found Ms. Idezuki hit on
the head with the flower vase and killed!

31
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,496
The killer is most likely Mr. Morita...

32
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,833
However, he has an alibi

33
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,969
and it would've been impossible
for him to commit the crime...

35
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,638
How the hell did he do it?!

36
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,277
And, there's one more thing
that bothers me.

38
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:04,316
It seems that someone is
secretly checking up on Mr Mourn.

41
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,217
but 7

42
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:11,357
A whole bunch of investigation records
that Mr. Mouri handled up to now

44
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,094
disappeared from the police department.

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,732
And. when did the papers disappear?

48
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,406
I think it was the day when you and
the others got messed up in a bus-jack.

51
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,347
The one they're after is not Pops,
but maybe...

53
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:41,387
And, maybe the killers are...

55
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:52,598
FORGOTTEN KEEPSAKE OF A CRIME
Part 2

57
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,403
Hey, Shinichi,
what did Officer Takagi say?

59
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,003
Huh

60
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,440
Oh, it's nothing important.

61
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,274
Just as I thought...

62
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,277
You refuse to tell us anything...

63
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:10,149
Come off it, the same to you.

64
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:11,784
I guess so.

65
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,554
What's this, are you hiding
something after all, Shinichi?

67
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,057
Oh, no that's not it

68
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,794
Although he doesn't think of
what will happen

70
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:25,831
when he is pushed fo ward by justice
and-pursues only the truth at times.

72
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,902
He yet at times. takes on all the pressure
alone, so asunot to hurt anybody...

74
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,475
That character of yours,
boyish and dangerous...

76
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,278
It's extremely interesting.

77
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,847
But I wonder if you're at all aware...

78
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:47,520
that the pure fragrance of yours
IS binding all the girls, including me

80
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:53,792
as well as yourself up in
an isolated and dangerous fragrance.

82
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,862
Shinichi Kudo.

84
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,833
don't you smell something funny?

85
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:01,500
Huh

86
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,637
Now that you mentioned it,
it does smell like something is burning.

88
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,573
Maybe it's the microwave oven
over there ?

90
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,879
There's no mistake about it,
the smell's coming from in here!

92
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,713
But, there's nothing inside.

93
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,923
Conan?

94
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,563
This is dried flower. isn't it.?

95
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,766
Or. it was thrown away)
because it withered.

97
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,504
If so, that should be
somewhere near here.

99
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,074
Darn, where the heck?!

100
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,677
It's impossible to hide anything
SO conspicuous away so easily.

102
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,847
Don't tell me it's in another room.

103
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,585
There are some more sandwiches left!
May I eat this or what?

105
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,256
God, Genta, you're eating too much.

106
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,191
Sandwich

107
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,461
Wait a sec...

108
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,230
Maybe...!

109
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,899
I found it!

110
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,467
Here it is

111
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,237
This was a trick after all!

112
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,772
Which means that inside the audio room...

113
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,511
Hmm? What is it, Conan?

114
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:26,151
I was playing flying a paper plane
in the afternoon and it went on top there...

116
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,253
Where?

117
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,189
Behind the curtain above "he TV!

118
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,757
Will you please get it for me, please!

119
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,627
Okay. okay. I'll get it for Wu now.

120
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:40,699
Really, sometimes he acts intelligent,
but sometimes he acts like any other kid.

122
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,503
There's nothing here, Conan?

123
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,239
There's no sign of 'an airplane anywhere...

124
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,275
Wow. it's. full of machines!

125
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:49,708
Huh?

126
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,143
It's super!

127
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,745
Hey! Just what do you think you're doing?

128
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,746
Put him down quick!

129
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,780
Oh, yes. sir!

130
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:58,817
You sure have a lot of decks. don't you?

131
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:04,490
Yes, I put all the decks that have gotten
old and out of use on the top shelves.

133
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,859
Conan!

134
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,160
A timer?

135
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,129
Come down, Conan!

136
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:19,038
I see... so that's what it was.

137
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,442
Idezuki was watching unaware.
What so ever that...

139
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,578
This would be the last movie
that she would be watching...

141
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:32,351
That she was going to be a part of the
ruthless story Mr Morita had schemed.

143
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,254
She didn't even have the slightest idea
of what was going to befall her.

148
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,737
$ range. nothing was mentioned
about going out or anything

150
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,174
Hey. I told them!

151
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,809
Oh, okay

152
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,211
and what did the Inspector say?

153
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,148
He says it's an interesting
deduction, so he'll cooperate!

155
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,216
Okay!

156
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,485
Next. it's you guys then.

157
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,221
DO exactly as told you. now!

158
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,789
Yay!

159
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,192
S71 44

163
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,998
You sure look worried.

164
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,170
You're worried about &
your precious girl, aren't you?

166
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,272
It's okay .

167
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,975
I don't know what Officer Takagi told you.

168
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,911
But just make sure
that you don't blow.your cool

170
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,048
and reveal your identity or
anything about the organization to her...

172
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,952
Well. I can sew that your feet is off the
ground after receiving chocolate from her,

174
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,920
because afte, all you are a guy, but...

175
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,324
Come off it! My feet's not off the ground.

176
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,262
I haven't told her a thing...

177
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,029
Huh?

178
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,834
B.But Shinichi, you accepted
the chocolate from Ran, didn't you?

180
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,668
Yeah.

181
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,538
Which means that you got something
in return for it, right?

183
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,675
I don't want to have to miss her.

184
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,478
If I say anything now...

185
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,648
she's going to miss me even more.

186
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:16,722
The hateful guy is just one sidedly
telling her to wait for him

188
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,726
and can't even appear before her.

189
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:25,964
Id Wt wan ito see her cry anymore.

190
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,503
Even if it means-blotting
my existence out of her.

192
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,209
I'm so childish, what a laugh.

193
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,782
It hurts, doesn't it?
TRO GOA 3S Ga tang)

Really?

197
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,690
It's true, really true.

198
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,826
A strange thing disappeared.

199
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,329
The killer was actually a thief!

200
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,765
Please come to thelkitchen.

201
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,367
Let's go. Mr. Morita

And? What is it that was stolen?

203
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,088
It's this!

204
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,255

Nofl It isnit the bowl!"that was stolen.

But the bottom of the bowl.

See?

208
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:35,234
The bottom of the bowl with
the sane pattern of that bowl issthere,

210
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,736
but the bottom of this bowl is gone right?

211
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,303
Hmm, true...

212
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:43,108
Oh. the bottom of that bowl
was gone when I bought it.

214
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,010
It seems to have been a detective item.

215
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,346
Inspector!

216
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,147
Everything's ready!

217
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,283
R Read ?

218
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,385
If it's okay with you,
we'd like you to stand witness too.

220
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,722
It's just a simple on-site investigation.

221
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,224
O. Okay...

222
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,760
Shall we go then

223
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,531
to the audio room where Ms. Idesuki was
struck to death with the flower vase.

225
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,807
Please go ahead inside.

226
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,009
O.Okay.

227
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,316
The switch .

228
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,252
The switch of the video deck is on!

230
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:32,658
Isgsomething wrong
with the video deck on the shelf?

232
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,260
N.No. it's not the deck

233
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,863
it's the stack of video tapes in front of it.

234
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,932
0 Sexcuse me. \

235
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,933
I put it there.

236
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,336
I mean, there're so many of ther...

237
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:49,741
Ah =80 the victim Ms. ldezuki
finished watching the video,

239
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,976
rewound it and took it out of the deck...

240
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:56,815
that's when she was
attacked from behind by the killer?

242
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:57,582
Yes.

243
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:02,688
So, shall we use the video like she did
and replay the scene of the crime.

246
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:03,555
Huh

247
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,457
Officer Takagi,
you play the role of the killer,

249
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:10,128
Dr Agasa,
please-play the role of the victim.

251
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,431
Oh. uh. well

252
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,699
Anything

254
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,368
Well, you see,

255
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:16,969
I. I'll do it.

256
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,036
I, I'll do it.

257
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,707
Since Ms: lldezuki used to
watch the video a lot in this room,

259
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,409
I think that a. person who is familiar
with this room is more appropriate.

261
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,380
Oh! It's that right!

262
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,082
Then, please do. by all means.

263
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:35,253
First you insert the video tape
into the video deck on the very bottom.

265
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,691
The victim sits in the chair and-
watches the movie all alone.

267
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,159
Is that right?

268
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,027
Yes.

269
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:48,066
Then the victim who finishes .~
watching the video rewinds the tape.

271
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,570
What's the matter?

272
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,472
Please rewind the tape.

273
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,806
Oh, yes, sir.

274
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,543
While the tape is being rewound,

275
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,880
the killer comes along with flower vase
that is at the front entrance

277
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,315
and sneaks up behind her.

278
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,885
And, as"she is.about to take the tape
that is rewound out of the deck,

280
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,224
The killer flings up the flower vase.

281
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:19,130
Mr Morita, quick,
please take the tape out!

283
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,199
Oh. y.yes!

284
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,769
O. Okay.

285
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,007
Why don't you use the remote controller?

286
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,042
Huh?

287
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:34,446
Look, the remote controller
that you're holding has an eject button!

289
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,249
Oh. that's...

290
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,518
I'll eject it for you then!

293
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,098
Huh?

294
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,036
The video tape won't come falling.

295
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:04,443
We changed the code number for the
remote for the video deck on the shelf.

297
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,750
In other words. Mr. Morita.

298
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,586
This is how you committed the crime!

299
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,724
You rigged it so that the video deck that
you use all the time on the lower shelf

301
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:23,395
and the video deck on the upper shelf
would operate with the same remote.

303
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:27,532
Then you put the tape in the video deck
on the upper shelf

305
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,570
Then you put the vase
with the flower and water in it

307
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,473
in front of the eject slot of that tape deck.

308
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:39,377
Of course you made sure it
would fall by putting a tape under it!

310
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:44,816
After that, all you had to do was close
the curtain to complete the scheme!

312
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:49,387
Then you showed Ms ldezuki the video
that she had been wanting to see,

314
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,857
ind lured her into this room.

315
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:57,195
If you tell her to rewind the tape
and return it to the video shop,

317
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:01,767
you knew that after she finishes watching
the video she would use the remote

319
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:03,235
to eject the tape,
and at the same time,

321
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,505
the tape on the top shelf would be
ejected and push the flower vase forward

323
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,242
and just when she pulls
the tape out of the deck,

325
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,878
the flower vase would
come falling towards her.

327
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,413
In other words.

328
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:20,385
SO long as you were aware of her
actions when she frequented this room,

330
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,989
it wouldn't be difficult to set the timing
right so that the vase would fall on her!

332
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,391
Like this.

335
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,801
And-the-video deck
on*the top shelf had a function

337
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:39,337
CCUZR
that would push the tape back
into the deck if it bumps into something,

340
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,841
so if You pre-record
something into that tape

342
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:44,810
and break off the pin
to prevent further recording.

344
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,279
The tape will automatically start to play.

345
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,117
Therefore,
right after the flower vase falls on her,

347
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:56,688
sound of footsteps of someone running
and the door closing would be heard,

349
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,691
making it look like someone
from outside committed the crime!

351
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:05,564
We heard it very clearly because
she was watching the movie full blast.

353
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,701
You made her use the deck
on thO very bottom

355
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,270
to get the vase to fall
from as high a distance as possible.

357
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:18,210
You rigged it so the video deck on the
top shelf would switch off with a timer,

359
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:23,882
so that when the police opened it.
You wouldn't be suspected. right?

361
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:30,989
I guess you already knew
that we've seen through your scheme.

363
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,791
But. the-flower vase
that you had-at the front entrance...

365
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,825
Was this bowl!

366
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,864
You glued it together like sandwich
and put it on the entrance. right?

368
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,833
You carried it secretly over to the kitchen

369
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,802
when you went to make the sandwiches

370
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,771
disassembled it
and hid it between the bowls!

372
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,075
These are the flowers
that were inside the vase.

374
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,112
You dried it using the microwave oven
and threw them away.

376
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:58,516
Peer thing, after your wife decorated
the flowers there.

378
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,320
My wife didn't arrange those flowers.

379
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,891
Those flowers are out of place flowers

380
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:08,159
that the woman bought and brought
to my wife's funeral...

382
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:12,764
We didn't even have the money
to buy flowers in this house anymore.

384
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,598
Huh?

385
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,767
Stocks...

386
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:21,172
That woman urged my wife
tordo stocks behind my back.

388
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,976
She was eventually buried in debts
and was driven to death.

390
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,146
Which means your wife's car accident...

391
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,581
Yes.

392
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,983
The day after
she told me about the stocks.

394
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:36,054
She ran in front of a car
and got run over.

396
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:39,624
That wristwatch was wrapped in a letter
that she had written to me.

398
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:44,429
It said. I don't want this
to be destroyed, so I'm leaving this behind.

400
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:50,268
So who cares whether the flowers

401
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,405
that woman gave me
are withered or burned...

404
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,577
We'll hear the rest of your story
out at the station

406
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,214
But. I feel sorry for them nevertheless.

407
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,986
They were so beautiful,

408
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,089
and flowers have such short lives.

409
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,959
They were forced to wither
before their time came.

411
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,262
Yes.

412
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,764
I'm going to head on home then.

413
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:22,733
Yes.

414
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,338
Flowers are fragile and short-lived.

415
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,607
No matter how much we try
to protect them from rain and wind,

417
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,210
and build fences arrow nd them

418
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,714
flowers will wither in want of the sun.

419
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:41,586
If a storm comes a fragile fence
cannot act as a shield at all.

421
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,056
Do you understand this, Shinichi?

422
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,260
Darn!

423
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,463
How come
nobody's answering the phone?

425
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:52,764
Darn!

426
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,308
Ran. Pops!

427
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,589
Right, it's dinner time.

428
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,025
They may be at home upstairs.

429
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,130
Ran?

430
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,265
Ran?

431
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,879
Dinner made part way

432
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,415
The TV in the office isdeft on.

433
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,518
D.Don't tell me that...

434
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,256
Somebody seems to be
checking UP on him in secret

436
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,960
Don't tell me that he got them...

A.A big win?

489

Dad was elated and said,

490
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,924
We're having steak tonight!
Go buy the meat and sake!

492
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,695
That's why I left everythinggpart way
and rushed over to go shopping

494
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,098
Because unless I go right away,
they sell out of meat all the time.

496
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,968
Where's Pops?

497
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,306
