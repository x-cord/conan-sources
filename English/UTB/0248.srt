this was taken from our field.

00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:45,991
I hope you like it

78
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:46,625
Phooey!

79
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,160
Are you trying to humor me?

80
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,662
Father,

81
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,330
Shiro's doing no such thing!

82
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,798
You too!!

Despite my strongly going against
him marrying into his wife's famil, ,

85
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,603
he went along and did so!!

86
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:00,473
Listen, Shiro!

87
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,042
I have no intention of lending you money!

88
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,144
Take that and et out of here!

00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,817
I'm sorry you had to see
something so unsightly.

00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,718
I'm very sorry.

92
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,552
Nah...

93
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:16,122
I guess he just happened to be
in a bad mood today.

95
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,223
No...

96
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,891
he's always like that.

97
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,493
On top of being stubborn,

98
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:21,760
his way of thinking is old fashioned.

167
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,535
Mr. Murakami,
did you pick mountain vegetables?

169
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,437
Huh?!
Yes... well sort of.

171
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,806
I remembered
that I had something to do

173
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,908
so I came back early.

174
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,946
Oh, but please rest assured.

175
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,915

I'm back

186
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,242

00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,193
I'd like to see the murder site!

198
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:41,927
Yes, sir!
This way please!!!

200
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,068
F.,Father!

201
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,737
A paper knife...

202
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,305
so this is the murder weapon...

203
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,942
R.M... initials?

204
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,045
It's the belongings of the village head.

205
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,215
Judging from the looks of the corpse,

206
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,050
the killer was in the study

207
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,420
and probably stabbed
the village head from the front!

209
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,390
Since the papers were scattered,

210
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,560
does that mean that the
killer was looking for something?

212
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,427
Hmm...

213
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,929
About the method of entry,

214
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,397
aside from the front entrance,

215
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,666
all the other places
are locked from the inside.

217
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,767
Hmm...

218
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,068
Aiko,

219
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:27,172
please give us the details of
when you found the village head.

221
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:27,773
Yes, sir!

222
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:28,974
If I remembericorrectly,

223
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,409
at about 5 minutes to 4,

224
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,978
I came here to collect payment for milk.

225
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,981
I had him stamp this notebook back then.

226
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,952
And after that?

227
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,489
On my way to Shiro's pension,

228
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,391
I heard someone scream,

229
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,025
so came back here immediately...

230
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,895
and found the village head...

231
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,865
And, what time did you hear the scream?

232
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,899
Four o'clock

233
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,534
I was in the middle of making
my round.ofapatrol...

235
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,939
I arrived at the village head's house
a while after Aiko,

237
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,308
which was about 5 minutes after 4:00.

238
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,110
Which means,

239
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:09,782
he was killed only within a few minutes
after Aiko left his house...!

241
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,082
In other words,

242
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,752
the killer seems to have been here

243
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,821
when Aiko came to collect the money.

244
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:16,722
Huh?!

246
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,294
Um, his money and credit cards
haven't been stolen.

248
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,230
Besides, the things on his desk
just seem to have fallen on the floor,

250
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,365
that it doesn { seem 10 be a robbery case.

251
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,332
Ouch!

252
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,700
I tell you,

253
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,503
don't touch things without permission!!

254
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,106
It seems that
the killer came to see the village head,

256
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:38,577
encountered a problem
and impulsively stabbed him...!

258
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:44,383
By the way,
where were you two at 4:00 sharp?

260
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,452
Oh, I was already back at the pension.

261
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,657
I was probably
walking along the one path road.

263
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,893
Can someone prove that for you?

264
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,028
Well

265
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:00,499
At around 4:10
when Mr. Murakami got a call from Aiko,

267
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,234
he was already here at the pension!

268
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:06,038
And, Mr. Tateshiba came back
while Mr. Murakami was on the phone.

270
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,039
Ri ht!

271
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,640
And, besides...

272
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,510
Why would we want to kill father...

273
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,612
It takes at least an hour to get

274
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,880
from father's house
to this pension here on foot.

276
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,250
If by car it only takes about 5 minutes,

277
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,885
but back then I went out on foot.

278
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,255
The car was parked
at the pension right through.

280
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,158
Any other way of transportation?

281
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,226
There is no other way...

282
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,996
There's only one road to the pension
besides it's a dead end street.

284
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,231
Precipitous mountains
surround the path...!

286
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
That means

287
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:37,135
it would be impossible
to return to the pension

289
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,538
from the village head's house
in 10 minutes!!

291
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,373
Whew...

292
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,808
Which means that the killer is Aiko?!

294
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,745
Judging from the wound,

295
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:50,249
the killer would havebeen splattered
with a large amount of blood.

297
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,117
I see!!!

298
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,585
In other words,

299
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,154
it would've been impossible
for anyone here to commit the crime.

301
00:10:57,624 --> 00:11:00,993
The culprit is most likely a third party,

302
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,895
who broke in to steal something
and ended. up committing a murder.

304
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:03,862
Whew...

305
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,132
Something's not right .

306
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,534
Something...

307
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,138
Will you show me that notebook?

308
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,973
Huh? You mean this?

309
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,408
Sure, sonny.

310
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,791
All the papers are dated today,

311
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,260
and have to do
with the village head's work!!

313
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,029
But...

314
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:38,630
Why...?

315
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:41,967
Mr. Mourn!

316
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:44,836
Is it all right
if we go back to the pension once?

318
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,904
I don't see why not.

319
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:51,909
Huh?

320
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,612
The clay has decreased.

321
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:58,116
The village head whose hand was hurt
couldn't have used the clay

323
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,919
Besides,
the rope that was on top is also gone...

325
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:03,956
I get it!!

326
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,765
What's up, Pops?!

327
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,467
Mr. Mourn!

328
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:16,601
Dad!

329
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:17,803
It's nothing,

330
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:19,705
I just figured out who the killer is!!

331
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,408
The killer is among us!!

332
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:31,917
But...

333
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,853
you just finished saying a while ago that

334
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,855
it would be impossible for anyone here
to commit the crime...

336
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,824
As far as Aiko is concerned,

337
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,360
she was immediately deleted
from the list of suspects.

339
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,562
The killer would've had to
get rid of the clothes

341
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:47,733
that was splattered with blood.

342
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,835
But, she did not change clothes,
nor did she have time

344
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,471
to get rid of the blood
that would've splattered on her

346
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,372
Whew...

347
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,675
Shiro and Kinji have
both changed clothes...

349
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,909
We both changed clothes

350
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,880
because we got dirty
picking mountain vegetables.

352
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,348
Either way,

353
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,251
if one of the two were to be the Killer,

354
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:09,721
how was he able to
get back to the pension in 10 minutes?

356
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,024
He went down the river!!

357
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,162
If go downstream the Tsunakawa

358
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,498
that flows near
the village heads house and the pension

360
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:23,635
well, it'd be possible to come back
to the pension in 2 to 3 minutes.

362
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,836
But,

363
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,872
there is no scaffold in that area

364
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,073
where you can tie a boat to!

365
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:29,775
No there is none

366
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,177
Moreover, since this was
murder committed on impulse,

368
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,713
no boat was prepared beforehand either!

369
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,481
Are you saying

370
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,484
that the killer swam down the river?

371
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:40,719
Then,

372
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,053
I'm counted out because I can't swim!

373
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:42,421
Huh?!

374
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,623
1, Then did Kinj did wt?

375
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,957
DD. Don't be ridiculous!

376
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,327
Well, let me finish

377
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,699
Most probably after the killer killed
the village head on impulse,

379
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,769
he snapped back to himself

380
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,673
and realized that
a lot of blood had splattered on him.

382
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,643
Therefore, he figured

383
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:09,014
he had to get out of the village head's
residence as soon as possible

385
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,883
and wash off the blood from himself

386
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:12,884
The method he thought of,

387
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,821
was to use the clay and rope
that was left on the dirt floor!

389
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,124
The clay and rope...

390
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,358
but: how?

391
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,194
First the killer takes off his slacks

392
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,663
that was splattered with blood.

393
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,101
He then washed his slacks lightly
at the water basin of the dirt floor,

395
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,603
taking the clay and rope with him.

396
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:35,540
He then,
turned his wet slacks inside out,

398
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,709
smearing clay
on the inside of his slacks.

400
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,312
He turns his slacks right side out again,

401
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:44,049
then tied the hem of each side
of his slacks with the rope.

403
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,750
Next,

404
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:48,653
he holds the waist part of the slacks,
filling it with air...

406
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,689
Then,
he jumps off the bridge into the river.

408
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:57,896
The slacks that inflated served as a float,

409
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,966
and the killer headed downstream...

410
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,437
Like a child usual plays
when taking a bath

412
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,072
by filling the towel up with air.

413
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,307
It's the same principle

414
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:14,679
Clay keeps water from entering
the slacks through the seams!

416
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,283
All the killer had to do was
Ieave the rest up to the flow...

418
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:21,319
Then he would reach the bank of the river
beside the pension!

420
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,923
Almost all the blood that's splattered
on his slacks would wash off too!

422
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,391
After arriving,

423
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,393
the killer quickly changes clothes

424
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:32,297
and appears before us
as if nothing had happened.

427
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,268
which one of them is the killer?

428
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,403
Before that, Aiko!

429
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:39,571
Yes?

430
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,643
We will be taking
that notebook as evidence,

432
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,779
so please collect
what you have to from Mr. Murakami.

434
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,684
Why,
at a time like this...

436
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,486
Could you stamp it then...

437
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,064
It seems that youyve realized
what I'm trying to get at.

439
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,733
That notebook,

440
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,368
Mr Murakami is the very thing

441
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,672
that is evidence of you being the killer!!

442
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:30,121
Please closely compare the stamps
of Ryuzo and Shiro.

444
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,927
Their stamps are interchanged!

445
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,162
What!!

446
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,163
Look!

447
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,900
\ UZO's seat up to last month is
stamped nicely but,

449
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,004
this month
a part of the outer circle is chipped off.

451
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,772
Youire right!

452
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,008
Shiro's is,

453
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,676
until last month,

454
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,511
the outer circle of the stamp
Is chipped off, but

456
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,881
the stamp for this month is
perfectly rounded with no chips.

458
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,782
I see!

459
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,117
Taking a good look,

460
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,953
it's obvious that
the two stamps are interchanged!

462
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,054
Right!

463
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,290
In other words, Shiro,

464
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:07,791
that serves as infallible evidence

465
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:10,428
that you were at the village head's house
when the murder took place!

467
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,670
Shiro visited the village head's house

468
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,306
bringing his own seal with him,

469
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:23,842
but got into an argument
with the village head.

471
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,312
Since the stamps
of both men are involved,

473
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,916
they must've argued on money matters.

474
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:36,288
Then, one of them threw the papers
that were on the desk onto the floor,

476
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,424
and this was
when their stamps interchanged.

478
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,961
It did not interchange today!

479
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,095
I'm sure it was the other day...

480
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,897
That's highly unlikely!

481
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,366
The stamps were interchanged today

482
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,502
just before Aiko came here.

483
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,039
The papers
that are scattered on the floor

485
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,808
are all stamped
with today's date on them.

487
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,911
Moreover,
that stamp is exactly the same

489
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,214
as the one the village had been
using up to last month.

491
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,950
In other words,

492
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,953
out of all the things he stamped
his seal on today,

494
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:12,857
the only time hexstamped a different seal
IS when Aiko came to collect payment.

496
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,861
He He probably stamped
a different seal just today...

498
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,264
Being that he holds
an important position as the village head,

500
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:24,035
he would never suddenly change his seal.

501
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,339
Besides, whether the seal is real or fake,

502
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,908
as well as the fingerprints on the seal
can easily be verified.

504
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,612
T, This could never serve as evidence...

505
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,880
Mr. Murakami...

506
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,682
Conan told me

507
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,719
that before you went
mountain vegetable picking,

509
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,887
you stamped your seal for the liquor man
who came to make delivery.

511
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:49,694
If we check which seal that was, then...

512
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,035
It s not true, is it, Shiro?

513
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,470
Why!

514
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,007
Why would you have to kill father!

515
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,776
Say something, Shiro!

516
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,878
Tell me that it's not true!

517
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,448
Father... hated me...

518
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,054
I was always being compared with
my brother who excelled in everything...

520
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,355
Shiro...

521
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:23,762
Financial woes
because of sluggish economy...

523
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,365
I needed money badly

524
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,701
so I went to ask him for financial aid .

525
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,472
Please father!!

526
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,075
At least...at least...be my warranter...

527
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,209
Enough!

528
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,677
When I say I can't, I can't!

529
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,897
Hello, village head,

530
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,933
it's sure hot today too, isn't it?

531
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,507
You're still there brooding!

532
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,576
You're nothing but trouble!!

533
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:15,579
You should have left this house
instead of Kinji!

535
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,084
That one phrase...

536
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,087
triggered all the anger
I felt towards father and I exploded...

538
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,608
And,

539
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,644
I quickly wiped
my fingerprints off the knife,

541
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,512
picked up the IOU and the seal

542
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,714
and left the room...

543
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:56,421
The rest is
just as Mr Mouri had explained...

545
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,923
SS. Shiro...

546
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:04,762
Shiro,

547
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,900
Though it was a trick,

548
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:13,238
you thought out a way to go downstream,
despite not being,ableitoiswim.

550
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,808
Therefore, don't you think
that there may have been

552
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:21,613
there was another way around the
ill feelings you had against your father?

554
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:29,154
Whether you make an effort to find a way
or not, is what divides fate
