00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,658
who are leaving the field during half time.

122
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:37,063
Idiot, he's looking towards

00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,285
Music?

What a funny looking earphone.

139
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:10,496
) see, he had an earphone
microphone attached to his cellular.

141
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,598

Right!

153
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,334

154
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,869
You're under arrest!

155
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,070
H,Hey, you guys!

156
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,738

00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,981
@ Officer Takag:!

160
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:06,552
Ghads, if you 'retan officer,
dress like an officer, will you!

162
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,954
Thatss right!

163
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,657
I can't help it. because
my wireless broke on me...

165
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,492
What?! Your wireless broke?!

166
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,796
Only mine wasn't-deing too

167
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:19,332
thinking that using a cellular
phone might confuse, .everybody

169
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,335
I was keeping contaet-with the
Inspector with an earphonexmicrophene.

171
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,404
And, where's the partner of the criminal?

172
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,808
He seems to have left the stadium from
the main gate with the cash because...

174
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,576
the criminal threatened us saying,

175
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:34,146
I'll kill someone from he audience
if yourgo after him

177
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,849
Is he the only-one who left the stadium?

178
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,553
Yeah, he's the only one: Nobody else left.

179
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:44,657
Which means that the bad guys?
Are still here in this stadium!

181
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:47,260
We've still. get a chance of capturing him!

182
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:53,799
But, what-a greedy criminal to~
demand deuble the first amount

184
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,538
I don't think h
after money this time?

186
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,575
Because it's impossible to get
10 billion yen ready in 45 minutes...

188
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:04,343
Hen. why... . ?

189
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:08,281
The criminal'is*planning to sheot
somebedy to-begin with

191
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:11,551
He'll do so at the time the end
f the game whistle IS blown...!

193
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,796
Officer Takagi, howaifar has
the game be played, already?

195
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,300
It's exactly 15 minutes after
the 2nd half of the game has started.

197
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:32,004
Which means there is only 30
minutes to go till the end of the game...

199
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:38,978
Put 10 billion yen in the bag and
put it at the number 18 gate!

201
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:44,584
If you can't get it ready in time,
I'm killing one of the audience.

203
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:49,989
I'm sure you're aware that I'm
olding 56.000 people hostage...

205
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,862
Inspector! Inspector Megure,

206
00:09:55,863 --> 00:09:59,231
we've lost track of the car of
the criminal whe fled with the cash!

208
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,199
What?

209
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,202
I'm serry. we were threatened
not to pursue the car,

211
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:05,904
so were trying to be inconspicuous...

212
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,741
We got the license plate
mber, though...

214
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,576
ut, it turned out to be a stolen car...

215
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:17,817
We've get no choice but to nab the one
what's still within this stadium, then...

217
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:21,654
You mean there are-no 0t

218
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:26,592
The criminal said things like "my partner
and "my share, in his conversation...

220
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:31,397
Which means that it is highly probable
at there are only two of them...

222
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:36,969
Furthermore, he remarked on the position
of all the officers throughout the stadium...

224
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,508
I'm sure that is he still hiding
omewhere in this stadium...

226
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,010
But. how should we find him?

227
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:50,683
After alb, e fiucers have all withdrawn
from the stands by demand of the criminal.

229
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,219
That's what I'm trying to figure out now...

230
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,987
Why don't you cheek through the video?

231
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:58,858
When you got the phone call,
a video that was not in use

233
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,860
was scanning he audience, right?

234
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,362
If so, a shot of the criminal
ay be on the video...

236
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:06,332
A strange man looking
through the stadium with binoculars

238
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,933
while talking on the phene...

239
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:12,038
see Can we see
that video night away

241
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:12,638
Yes...

242
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,918
Inspector! »

243
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,221
There seems to be
+3 NO such suspicious person

245
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:30,356
in the stands up front.-or the'back stand!

246
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,191
It can't be?!

247
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,961
Id you check the press tha
came intofthe stadium?

249
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:39,465
If the cameras are equipped with zoom
Ienses, they can see quite a distance!

251
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,101
I was watching over the stands
where the camera men were %

253
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,270
b t there were no
suspicious looking persons!

255
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:47,406
Besides, if there was somebody on the
phehe looking through the view finder

257
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,909
of a camera and talking on the
phene as well, he would attract attention.

259
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,013
Right . Hmm .

260
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,616
Idiculeus

261
00:11:56,617 --> 00:12:02,722
as well as leek areund
the stadium at the same) time

263
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:07,593
How could) he do 'it« with ut
anyone noticing him

265
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:19,305
1. Inspector

266
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,876
1 got together a little over
billiengyen fer new...

268
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,979
It's impessible to get together
ameunt like 10 billion

270
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,883
ve got no choice... We'll ju
use newspaper or something

272
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,319
to fill up whatever is missing and wait
0 see what the;cnminal will do...

274
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,821
h, Inspector...

275
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,924
Hmm. What is it Officer Takagi?

276
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:42,228
Maybe the criminal's .not after
money this time

278
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,196
What?

279
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:46,032
It's obvious to anybody that no matter
how you run around the banks,

281
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:50,603
it would be impossible to gather 10
billion yen in a matter of 45 minutes

283
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:56,676
Therefore, all the criminal wants is the
50,000,000 yen that.he first demanded...

285
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,178
Y don't-tell me

286
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,848
That the criminal was
planning to shoot semebody

288
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:04,984
as soon as the game
ded to begin with

290
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,385
N No. why?!

291
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:10,723
Ma. be something happened
at Niehiuri TV recently, that

293
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,125
meone held a grudge against...

294
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,094
No, No, I can't recall any such thing...

295
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:21,033
Hey. mister... Was; the voice of the criminal
« that led you all of the same person?

297
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:25,037
Y.,Yeah#the voices of all three
calls were muffled,

299
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:27,673
but I think they were of the same man...

300
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,644
Which means that the person:who called
and the persen who shot the ball

302
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,379
are two different people,

303
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,116
so the man who came to get the money
is the one who shot the ball. right?

305
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:40,219
Yeah . .The other guy's voice
was heard from the phone

307
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,955
that the guy whoscame to get
e cash was holding. so...

309
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:47,293
But, the guy who came to get the cash
- -g - I - - . - - - Pru p- - Jp- - Ty ~~ 3 So -
IQ tL Inave a gull OI 1iirny. 11a jic.

312
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,594
I wonder why?

313
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:53,065
- He gave his gun to his partner

314
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,104
Okay, check all the videos between the
35 minutes * 10 minutes past the first half

316
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:02,375
of the game when the ball was shot, to loss
time when he came to-get the cash again!

318
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:06,312
Find the guy in the audience that the man
who came to get the cash had contact with!

320
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,281
He's the criminal that's left in the stadium!!!

321
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,348
Yes, sir!

322
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:18,791
37 minutes past the 2nd half of the game,
Ramos's volley shot makes goal!!

324
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,327
The score is"a turn over of 2.1%
with the Big's in the lead!!

326
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,264
There he is, Inspector!

327
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,433
That guy is on the video!

328
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,203
And, did he give something to someone?

329
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:33,372
0... He was just walking along the aisle.

330
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,475
Ah. he s-out of vision:of:the monitor...

331
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,345
Don't give up!! We still have time.

332
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,315
As long as there's a.
Possibility keep searching!!

334
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:45,351
It is very unlikely that he is on the video...

335
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:49,088
- Mereover, it's not definite whether
he actually gave the gun to anyone...

337
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:53,626
ut, this is the only way we have left
to look for the criminal

339
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:58,264
This is the only method we: have left!

340
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,076
It's almost loss time...

341
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,845
shut up, I know.

342
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,947
There's not much time left!!

343
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,016
Where IS he'?! Where, where'?!

344
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,217
Where is he?!

345
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,566
Please... ~Please, the time...

346
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,002
Iease step

347
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,703
Cool it...

348
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:43,009
e can trcontrol time, can we

349
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,814
If we tryasto.centrol it by force.
E'll have to pay the toll...

351
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,718
What're you talking about...

352
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,590
Oh, that was clese!

353
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,059
It's already the 3rd time!

354
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,196
This is no time to be getting
excited watching the game!

356
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:04,463
No, that's not it

357
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:08,701
We were else leeking fer the suspicieus
person that you were also leaking far!

359
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:12,705
That suspicieus man always
disappears from scene!

361
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,273
Disappears?

362
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,176
See, the minute he ts seen
to the edge at left

364
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,745
the camera moves and
goes off scene

366
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,648
This is camera 13, isn't it?

367
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:23,549
Hew unlucky...

368
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:25,651
al 4 «4A

370
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,754
Come to think of it, even a while ago...

371
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,592
1 get tt...

372
00:16:32,593 --> 00:16:36,295
So, that's what it was!!

373
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:39,198
Inspector, it's loss time.

374
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:45,004
It can't be helped. Put a camouflage bag
at gate number 18, and watch it...

376
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,372
The rest:of you,

377
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,909
charge into the stands as soon as
he game ends' Hurry!

379
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:57,283
Here's Conan?

380
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:21,574
I've finally figured it out, mister.

381
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:28,079
You're the one who threatened
Nichiun TV. night...

383
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,452
It weuldn't look strange even
if you were to be looking

385
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,688
hrough the audience with the camera

386
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,858
And you wouldn't look suspicieus
even if you were to be

388
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,794
talking into the microphone that
Is attached to your earphene...

390
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,331
Besides, nobody would imagine
that a camera man

392
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:49,368
from the same TV station is
threatening his colleague

394
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,306
Good'werk, kid...

395
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,576
I saw the video that you shot, mister

396
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,046
The partner of the criminal entered
the scene 4 times

398
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:04,050
but all four times...
he framed out right away...

400
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,785
And that's when I figured it out.

401
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,854
Tha dittwasnst that he was
coineidentally not in the video,

403
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:12,325
buy that: his,partner 'had deliberately set
t up to be so, in order to protect him

405
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:16,495
And, he position of the oflicers
that the criminal had pointed out

407
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:19,065
ere all in the center stand...

408
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,900
Tihe only camera that can take these shots

409
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:25,338
IS the one that is situated
y thetbackstand!

411
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:30,877
You're the only one who meets
Il the requirements »to do so...

413
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,579
What are you going to do

414
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:39,118
Will you turn:yourself in? Well, mister...

415
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,723
1 have no choice, I'll do that

416
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:47,793
Shoots!!

417
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:53,332
Is what lad actually like to say,
t, I can't do that...

419
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:57,503
I've got my reasons, you see

420
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,806
Beretta... That's not a Tocaref»...

421
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:05,444
Yeah, my partner's gun is.in one of
the trash cans inside the stadium...

423
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,548
The Baretta and Tocaref are all guns

424
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,051
we get together for the bank
robbery a year ago .

426
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,354
The plan that we schemed and
invested all the money

428
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:18,156
we saved up fer 3 years for,
s perfect .

430
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:23,996
On the day we were to carry out the
robbery, a stupid event of some

432
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,598
show biz talent serving as one day

money, drowned herself in alcohel

d committed suicide...

438
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:39,612
