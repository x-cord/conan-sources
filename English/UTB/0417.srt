Ah, well actually it was Watabiki
who got hurt.

177
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,751
A year or two ago, I had completely
forgotten until I saw the scar on his hand...

179
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,787
he's obsessed with ¢leanliness and always
wea s gloves...

181
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:35,427
I always thought it was his younger brother
that saved me

183
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:36,561
Really...

184
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,564

185
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,734
Of course! Chefs are suppdscd to be «7

187
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,935

Hey! don't come into the ladies room
without permission!

191
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,039
Oops. excuse me!

192
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,076
This is the scar from back then

193
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,745
So. what's the problem...?

194
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,715
Ou wear gloves inside your room too...

195
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,653
Yes. . always except during bath time and
when I had my fingerprints taken.

197
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:05,757
and I also take them off when I drive and
write...

199
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:09,795
Ah, these are the gloves your younger
brother used!

201

I don't see the older brother's gloves...

204
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,938
Unlike my younger brother,
I am not a sportsman...

206

Oh, I don't know!!

254
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,947
Well, we went around the 4 rooms .

255
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,316
We didn't find anything suspicious. did we?

That is the truth. . the factitive method of
Sekiguchi's murder...

275
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,456
the way that the culprit must have made it

the fingerprint identification machine...

278
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:24,930

295
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,091
Up. of course...

296
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,491
Yup. of cou se

298
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:58,396
If Inspector Yokomizo listens and does
what ie says!
Q=,

301
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,100
Y. yes. certainly...

302
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:11,009
PERL SIR 0 Orly Nn 806) Geog

303
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,481
So now, let me explain... the truth of the 2
murders that took place on this premises...

305
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,819
And that the culprit is...among you...

306
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:24,856
First of all, is the murder of Mr. Sekiguchi...
The first case...

308
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,361
Butedidn't you say, that it was an outsiders
doing?

310
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,595
Yes. that's right!

311
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:31,630
That's true...

312
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,133
Namika who is afraid of heights couldn't
have hung any body.

314
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,469
On tho 3rd floor vorandn...

315
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,038
Shigoko who has bolonophobia

316
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,841
would have avoidoecdeplaces where sharp
points such as that of the iron fencing are...

318
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,911
The words that were written on the card
that the culprit is thought to have slipped

320
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,279
Wo Sekiguihn's pocket
The lettering was slanted...

322
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,385
a tidy and pcrfectionist Akatsuka
would not have done that...

324
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,322
At the time of the crime,
Watabiki and the master's wife

326
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,058
who went to the hospital withithe master
could not have committed the crime.

328
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,394
I Then who did it?

329
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:07,766
You're not really saying that
someone among us is faking it. are you?

331
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:14,239
No, Namika's room is clean/but the area
around the window was not...

333
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,675
Thus proves that you are afrad of heights
because you canno come

335
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,209
close to the window...

336
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:22,447
Shigeko who has helonephobia
uses tapestoihang hericalendar...

338
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,283
even when we intruded Akatsuka's room
unexpectedly.

340
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,452
The things in the room were tidy.

341
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,090
I think it is safe to say that no one isilying. #

342
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,527
Let's investigate the 2nd crime

343
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,896
A person enters this bedroom on the 3rd
floor

345
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,298
by opening the door of the
fingerprint identification machine

347
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,332
and slips through.

348
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,302
This person sets things up to cause the
master to have a heart attack

350
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,470
that results in death...

351
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,440
Nd disappears without leaving any
traces of having run away

353
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:50,942
The plausible explanation here is.

354
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,111
The getaway rope tied to the veranda

355
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,814
The culprit notices Conan climbing up

356
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,981
and returns to the premises.

357
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:03,822
Opens the fingerprint identifiention machine
door. comes inside and blends in with us

359
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,190
has as possible

360
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,662
But:wasn't that proven innocent by the
fingerprints on the medicine bottle

362
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,730
and rope?

363
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,365
That is probably the fingerprints of the
accomplice...

365
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,967
Ac. accomplice!

366
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,637
Yes... there are 2 culprits!

367
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:25,577
Does that mean.that someone amongstius
brought someone. suspicious with us?

369
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:31,483
But the master said that he wasn't planning
on meeting anyone toda...

371
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:37,088
After all, we all looked in every room on
the 3rd floor and we didn't find anyene!!

373
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,025
Umm...no one suspicious turned up.

374
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,863
And there was no trace of escape from the
veranda. nor the window

376
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,365
hen where's the accomplice!?

377
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:48,266
Yeah. soO...

378
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:48,767
Yeah. so...

379
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:53,104
I wanted to reenact this with everyone and
that is why" asked you all to come here...

381
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,374
I might have overlooked something...

382
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,912
OK, everyone! We are going to search the
rooms one b one...

384
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,183
Unlike then. I wil enter thejroom last!!!

385
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:08,887
In order to watch if anyone makes 1
SUSPICIOUS Move

387
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,758
So. would Watabiki play myprole
by entering first

389
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,228
and inspecting the window and veranda!!

390
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,897
OKI?

391
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,998
Ah sure!

392
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,002
So. let's start with the library next to the
bedroom!

394
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:30,408
And of course, if you see something org
notice something please let me know!!

396
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:34,045
You don't have:to shout, I can hear you!

397
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:38,016
Ah, excuse me! I shout:when I get
excited. .!

399
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,784
Mr. Watabiki. please go in...

400
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:41,820
Y.yes...

403
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,928
May we also go in?

405
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,297
Yes, of course!

406
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,567
Do you think we'll find something out
this way?

409
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,736

Thank you, Conan!

416
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,447

417
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:09,747

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,605
Stop babbling and answer'myapquestions.

422
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,425
Arc you really sure there was no onc
suspicious?

424
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,492
Huh?

425
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,728
Was anyonc there or not?

426
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,096
YVAN [Rd

427
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,264
No"no one there...

428
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,835
No. there was someone there... in the room
that ou just searched...

430
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:34,138
I just told you. No one was there!

431
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,543
Yes there is ..behind Inspector Yokomizo
theres one: more person...

433
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,381
Twins!?

434
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,052
Uh...hgjs my brother who works, for the
Kanagawa Prefectural Police...

436
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,855
I'll be off then...

437
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,592
don't tell my boss that I was
In on this investigation...

439
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,561
Right... Thanks...

440
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,163
But why 1s twin the answer?

441
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,466
In other words. it's.like this...

442
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,536
when searching the room, the culprit
stayed in the back.

444
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,374
Making sure to do so when entering and
Ieaving the room...

446
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,911
He acted as though he was leaving the
room right before the one the accomplice

448
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,013
was in. but actually stayed there.

449
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,415
When Inspector Yokomizo finished
searching the window,

451
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,718
and was waiting for the right time

452
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:25,123
the accomplice that was hiding behind the
door joined everyone.

454
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,726
If the accomplice is a twin wearing the
sane clothes...

456
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,262
switching places like Inspector Yokomiso

458
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,730
no one would have noticed.

459
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,567
Nor would it have been suspicious that
somebody else was hiding.

461
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,203
Where are they!?

462
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,371
Tihere are no twins here....!

463
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,676
Right. whon Shigeko montionod

464
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,445
the story "bout the birthdays.
Something bothered me...

466
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,982
20 years ago, there were Watabiki and his
parents and a ounger brother,

468
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,053
Shigekoiind husband and Namika.
AkatsUka and his wife.

470
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,355
There were supposed to be a
total*of 9 birthdays

472
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,190
but she said there were only eight.

473
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:02,226
Which means someone had the same
birthday...

475
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:06,998
And when! heard 'about the time when she
fell off. a tree when she was In 4th. grade

477
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,299
I was convinced

478
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:13,104
She could just vaguely remember who
saved her at that age

480
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,708
IS because there were 2 people that were
alike...

482
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,276
In other words...

483
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,781
Watabiki, you conspired with your twin
brother and committed this crime...

485
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,350
Wh what are you talking about!

486
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,103
His brother died in that accident
13 years ago!?

488
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:31,622
What If he didn't die in that accident?

489
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,724
What?

490
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,527
What if he swam to shore and survived?

491
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:40,448
X X, WOO I 3 Xxx «xn Wo I
of his left hand.

493
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,068
Which he got:when he saved Namika
from: her fall...

495
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,104
When he drove us here

496
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,008
there was no scar on his left hand...

497
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,612
The calendar in his room,
the mark at the head of the words were

499
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,881
dnffuront UQpUHUiHQ on tho unto...

500
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,518
They probably switched places
once in awhile...

502
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:07,158
noting everything down and
by using the same organizer,

504
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,761
they could become one
and the same\person...

506
00:17:10,012 --> 00:17:11,429
They did it in preparation for toda

507
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,432
In order to murder
Mr. Sekiguchi and the master!

509
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:19,604
The younger brother took the two
to the hospital to establish an alibi...

511
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,589
Aftor that, tho older brother
who was hiding in the mansion

513
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,743
enters the 3rd floor
by making Sekiguchi open the door.

515
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:30,248
Chokes Sekiguchi and
hangs him from the veranda railing...

517
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:34,635
And after a few hours,
he goes loathe 3rd floor again

519
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,522
andimurders the master.

520
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:41,392
But master said
he wasn't going to meet anyone...

522
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,028
The master will meet with him

523
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,565
especially If he was with him
when Sekiguchi was killed...

525
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,902
since he would be
the most unsuspicious person...

527
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,072
the master must have been surprised...

528
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,642
A man wearing the same clothes
with the samc face appears.

530
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:58,676
Furthermore. that

531
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,646
Is the s1mo parson who supposadlh
was said to have died 13 years 1go...

533
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,949
You deliberately left
your younger brother's fingerprints

535
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,051
on the medicine bottle and rope.

536
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,121
To make us believe
it was of an unknown person,

538
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:14,725
in order to exclude the people
inside the premises from the suspect list...

540
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,993
B.but where is the other one?

541
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,297
He didn't turn up in the search. right?

542
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,568
That is why hasked Mr. Watabik
to search the window

544
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,504
and gave you. instructions in a oud voice

545
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:31,008
so that the accomplice
who is hiding on the 3rd floor can hear...

547
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,278
I dropped him hints telling him
that 'hell be safe on the veranda!

549
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:39,450
Tithe police has surrounded the premises!

550
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,085
Please bring him in!

551
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,788
That won't be necessary...

552
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,889
Brother...

553
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,791
Then you will admit to the crimes?

554
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:48,826
Yes...

555
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,629
Wait a minute! If you're alive...

556
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,131
What about my father!?

557
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,165
What about my wife!?

558
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,233
They probably died

559
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,569
because they were abandoned
by\ ou know who...

561
00:18:58,936 --> 00:18:59,203
Ah...ah .

562
00:18:59,304 --> 00:18:59,971
Ah...ah .

565
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,339
What is it?

568
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,075
What happened 13 years ago!?

569
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:08,279
Something suddenly went wrong
with the ship while cruising.

571
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,082
SO I dived to check it out...

572
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,486
someone's bag was tangled
in the screw and helm.

574
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,755
And Inside it was somebody's hand...

575
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,140
A human hand.

576
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:22,627
It was most probably the hand
of the missing former president

578
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,163
of Sekiguchi's company
who disappeared 13 years ago.

580
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,867
You suddenly participated in the cruise
to dump his bod into the sea...

582
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:34,505
In other words,
the "5th soul written on the first card

584
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:35,873
referred to him...

585
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:36,507
referred to him...

586
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,578
Did you know thnt
he was going to dump the dead body?

588
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,313
No. no I didn't know!

589
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,116
When I told everyone on the ship.

590
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,320
Sekiguchi suddenly shoved Father away
and speed the ship up .

592
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,124
Speeding without
having control of the helm...

594
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,727
the ship turned over
and everyone was ossed I 10 the sea

596
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,097
only the master and his wil¢ escaped

597
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,600
with the only rubber raft that had air in it...

598
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,901
N.No!

599
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:06,771
I was going to return to call for help!

600
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,139
But Sekiguchi...

601
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,641
They won { survive anyway!

602
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,376
Just keep quiet about this,

603
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,912
you are so an accorip ice
and abandoned them!

605
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,214
Is what he told me...

606
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:19,600
We were all holdin onto a small float

607
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,486
but thought that woe would all dio hko this...

608
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,922
So the person with
the most physical strength. me.

610
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,390
Went to call for help...

611
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,393
But I felt consciousness shippimg away

612
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:32,762
When I woke up. I was in a hospital bed

613
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,599
and I lost my memory

614
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,368
I sneaked out of the hospital
and wandered around...

616
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,053
Then. in summer 2 ears ago

617
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,805
I coincidently met my brother

618
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,040
md at the some bind
my memory came back to me...

620
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,843
I mot my brothor on tho day aftor

621
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:50,047
I Almost had a car accidont
with the master's car...

623
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,850
The ncadant was my fault
but the master was the one

625
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:57,555
who kept on apologizing
so I thought it a little weird...

627
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,793
That night, when I'heard my brother's tale,
I understood why...

629
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,962
Then. the master's nightmare and

630
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,199
the car accident on the 4th of

632
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,903
That's where we got the idea
of taking revenge...

634
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:17,208
There was no evidence left
for the police anyway...

636
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,727
But if we can find the sunken ship.

637
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:20,761
That's impossible!

638
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,948
It actually sank within the Suruga Bay
but he told the police

640
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,916
it sank way out at sea...

641
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,953
34 degrees north latitude 45 minutes.

642
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,255
138 degrees east longitude 30 mi utes...

643
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,290
What?

644
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:36,193
Remember, the N and E engraved
on Mr. Sekiguchi's watch!

646
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,695
N is north latitude: 45 minutes,

647
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,564
E's east longitude 30 minutes!

648
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,868
If it's within Suruga Bay, then
it's approximately 34 degrees north latitude

650
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,803
and 138 degrees east longitude

651
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,573
That's probably where the ship sdnk!

652
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,642
Oh. so that's what it means...

653
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,178
But- why on the 4th , the unlucky.day?.

654
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,815
The ship accident:was
on September 29. a luc \ day 7

656
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,050
That's becausc...

657
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,688
13 ears aco this da
October 4th was Butsumetsu...

659
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:08,159
when the master went to the police
to ask them to stop the investigation...

710

The ship was somehow found...

still tangled in the screw...
