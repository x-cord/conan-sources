1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,135
Even destiny serves
as a clue to deduction

3
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:05,037
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,006
Twice around a unique house in a day.

6
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,242
An unexpected solution
to an unexpected trick.

8
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,344
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,079
A child in appearance
with the l.Q of an adult,

11
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,281
No case is left
unsolved with Detective Conan.

13
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,951
Nishiizu
Ce. Lo
- me am

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,962
Well, the Inspector insisted that
I ride this, so I borrowed it from him.

19
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,065
I was luc +!

20
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:16,635
I figure what actually happened
was something like this...

22
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:21,607
So... I implore you, Inspector Megure!!

23
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,677
Will you please. ?

24
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,379
I guess not, after all...

25
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:31,784
What ?

26
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,120
In, Inspector Megure?!

27
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,723
Thank you so very much,
Inspector Megure!!

29
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:44,196
I'm pretty sure you forced your way
through borrowing:this;car...

31
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:48,034
and+you call this luc « ?

32
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,069
It's raining cats and dogs

33
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:56,775
I can't even get a view of Mt. Fuji...

34
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,644
Y.You think so...?

35
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,815
By the way, how much longer
do we have to go, dad?

37
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:05,985
It's about time we get there, but...

38
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,087
Oh, isn't that it?

43
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:16,929
The Gunshot at Sunflower Manor

44
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:21,900
It took quite a while to get here after
the building came into view, didn't it!

46
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,571
Yeah, the rain stopped.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,873
Mr. Mourn...

48
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,542
O Oh... Yes!

49

I'm very familiar with
all your great deductions

60
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,782
through the articles in the papers

61
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,919
I've read about you in the papers too,

62
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,655
famous architect,
Mr. RyuichirmKanazawa.

64
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,558
I hear you've received
another award just recently too.

66
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,627
Un, let me see... what was it called?

67
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,397
The International Competition at
the Shanghai Modern Art Museum.

69
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,767
Sensei... Your guests?

70
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,902
They are Hayashida and Amamor.

79
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,811
Keep your cool now, this person here is
none other than Mr. Kogoro Mouri.

81
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,880
Mr. Kogoro Mourn...

82
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:08,781
You mean that famous...?

83
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,452
I am the renowned
detective Kogoro Mourn.

85
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,723
I wish you'd stop addressing yourself
as renowned detective.

87
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,893
A stalker?

88
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,361
Yes,

89
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,365
pictures like these have been sent
to me since 3 months ago.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,935
H... You're in every picture

92
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,070
Hmm?

93
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,542
The first thing we have to do is
find out who is doing this.

95
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,475
Do you have any idea?

96
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,045
Not at all...

97
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,248
Please think carefully.

98
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:46,485
What I presume from years of
my experience is that the stalker is...

100
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,855
very likely someone you know.

101
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:50,756
What?!

102
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,591
For example...

103
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,927
7:00 pm

104
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,930
Is the award ceremony
day after tomorrow?

106
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:00,399
It's going to be at a hotel in Shanghai

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,134
Shanghai?!

108
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,869
Are you all going too?

109
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,905
No, we're going to stay behind
and watch the house.

111
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,540
Right? Amamor.

112
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,208
Yeah, I guess...

113
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,312
By the way, Ran
what do you think of this building?

115
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,448
It sure is a different looking building.

116
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,450
You think so too, don't you?

117
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,020
Sensei designed
this building personally too,

119
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,321
but it's of good taste, don't you think?

120
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,559
Huh?! I had a feeling
he building moved just now...

122
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,627
It's really moving

123
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,431
The 2nd floor moves once
around every 12 hours.

125
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,434
We call it the Sunflower Manor.

126
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,503
Oh... how interesting!

127
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,739
But, why was it made to rotate?

128
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,609
Beats me... I wonder why...?

129
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,677
I guess I'll ask Sensei one of these days.

130
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:48,047
There's no reason.

131
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,048
Mitsuko Kanazawa

133
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:52,885

crowd pleasing bluff!

142
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,422
7:10 pm

143
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,326
By the time you return,
I'm sure everything will be solved.

145
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,361
I hope so.

146
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,296
Mr. Mouri, was it?

147
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,831
Oh... Yes!

148
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,433
Mr Mouri...

149
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,436
Could I also ask you a favor?

150
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,641
Would you... would you please
Investigate his background?

152
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,812
As for my payment to you,
if I I get to divorce him successfully,

154
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,715
Iet's divide the consolation money
between you and me.

156
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,917
Mitsuko, that's enough!

157
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,020
Wasted and boozed out like that, can
you get on the plane tomorrow or what!

159
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,557
Why don't you go to
the awards ceremony alone?

161
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,627
Or, do you intend to go with the stalker?

162
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:36,395
Now, that's enough!

163
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,632
You're the one
that's already done enough.

165
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,668
You seem to be concerned
over a stalker or what not,

167
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,371
but aren't you the one
who brought it upon yourself?

169
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,939
Like your ex-girlfriends and such.

170
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:48,707
Hayashida!!

171
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,075
Y Yes, sir?!

172
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,879
All you've been eating so far is meat.

174
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,648
1 CO...

175
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,085
You can never come up with designs
with a taste of originality to them

177
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,987
because of your unbalanced
eating habits.

179
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,689
7:20 pm

180
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,659
Where do you think you're going?
I'm still talking to you.
7:20 pm

183
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,695
I'm just going to get some beer
from the refrigerator!

185
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:15,267
Why don't stop picking on
people weaker than you?

187
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,103
If you keep it up, you'll be bitten by
your supposedly faithful dog one; day.

189
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:19,905
Right, Mr Amamori?

190
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,446
I'll go get some charcoal.
7:25 pm

192
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,515
7:25 pm

193
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,517
Will you watch the meat
so that it won t get over cooked?
7:25 pm

196
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:31,750
Will you watch the meat
so that it won't get over cooked?

198
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,118
Okay.

199
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,423
Mr. Mourn!

200
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,159
This dressing goes good with that salad.

201
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,829
But it saysyolive oil o

202
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,898
Oh, I'm sorry.

203
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,666
I used what bottle I had available,

204
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,070
but the dressing is what I just made
a while ago. It's my own original dressing.

206
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,605
You don't have to use
any of the dressing.

208
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,275
Besides, her taste is not
what you can call normal.

210
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,712
My... that's just what YOU think.

211
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,081
Sensei!

212
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,484
It's 7:29. There's only 1 minuterto:go.

213
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,754
Oh, that's right. Take care of things
for me here, will you then.

215
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,197
Uh, Mr. Amamori, where did
Mr. Kanazawa leave for?

217
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,299
To watch the Chinese Language
Course on TV.

219
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:25,237
He's all excited about giving his, speech
in Chinese at the awards ceremony.

221
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,575
No matter how busy he is recently,
he checks the program out real time.

223
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,244
It's just a snobbish hobby.

224
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:41,286
7:35 pm

225
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,361
Let me see,

226
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,797
where's my beer...

227
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,265
Have a cold one...

229
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,768
Thank you.

230
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,302
Come on, dad!

231
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,037
Haven't you already had enough?

232
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,674
Come off it,
I'm not the least bit drunk yet...

234
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,480
WwW, What was that?

235
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,124
Sensei!!

236
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,365
The door's locked from the inside!

237
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,866
Is there a spare key?

238
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,834
Most likely not.

239
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,503
I guess we have no choice
but to break the door down, then.

241
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,138
I'll go get an axe!

242
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,340
7:40 pm

243
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,814
Sensei...?

244
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,149
Sensei?

245
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,618
What seems to be the matter, Sensei?

246
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,020
Is something wrong?

247
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,922
Ran, turn on the lights!!

248
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,356
Sensei...?

249
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,662
S,Sensei!!

250
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,044
The victim is architect,
Ryuichiro Kanazawa.

252
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:17,549
It seems that Mr. Kanazawa always
sits here whenever he watches TV.

254
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,751
He died on the spot
after being shot in the head.

00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,734
There is a mark of a bullet having pierced
through the window here.

281
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,272
Which means
the sniper shot the gun from...

283
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,074
Shot the gun from?!

284
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,343
Shot the gun from...

285
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,311
uh, I wonder where?

286
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,047
Mr. Mount!

287
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,582
This is no time to be joking!

288
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,552
Hey, hey! This room is
really something, you know!

290
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,289
I was told that it rotates
once around every 12 hours!

292
00:10:57,756 --> 00:10:59,291
RR. Rotates?

293
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,692
I see!

294
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,963
It s 8:35 now, so
the gunshot wawheénd an hour ago.

296
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:09,334
If we move back the line
that ties the position of the victim

298
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,736
and the hole on the window an hour,

299
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,338
in other words,
move back an an le of 30 de rees.

301
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,311
That's it!!!

302
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,017
I wonder what that is?

303
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,719
That thing that is on
the decoration of that building.

305
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,456
Could it be o

306
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,659
There're none, after all...

307
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,427
What's up?

308
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:41,099
Well, there are no footprints around
the pine where the rifle was fixed on.

310
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,836
There were quite a few between the shed
and the party hall, though.

312
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:50,909
Between 6:00 to 6:30 this evening,
it was heavy raining.

314
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:52,510
Which means,

315
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:57,816
nobody went near the tree
where the gun was fixed onto after 6:30.

317
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,919
If so, just how did the sniper fire?

318
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,625
At any rate, go find the owner of
the rifle on the double!

320
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,326
Yes, sir!

321
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,094
MM. Mr. Moun!

322
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,462
MM. Mr. Moun!

323
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:10,829
The rifle is wet,

324
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:11,363
The rifle is wet,

325
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:11,763
The rifle is wet,

326
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,901
So, it must've been placed there
before the sudden shower, after all.

328
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,170
Bingo.

329
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,273
I'm sure this is the murder weapon.

330
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:25,577
The problem is after the gun was fired,
where did the sniper go.

332
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,214
Don't tell me the sniper took
a dive into the sea.

334
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,251
But, the beach is right below, so it'd
be impossible to jump right into the sea.

336
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,721
Hmm? Mr Mourn!

337
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,591
This is a fishing line...!

338
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,760
The tip of the string...

339
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,797
What's with this line?

340
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,466
It's covered with mud...

341
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,835
There's mud on the trigger too!

342
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,838
A weight!

343
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,505
I see!!! I got it.

344
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,343
The fact is this...

345
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:02,147
This sniper knew that the victim would
be watching TV in the study,

347
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:05,584
calculated the time when
the bullet would strike its target.

349
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:10,422
Then, at the time of the crime, pulled the
weight at the tip of the fish line from here.

351
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:14,726
If so, the sniper would not have to go into
the villa, and fleeing would not be difficult.

353
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,663
Do you think that the sniper is
someone from outside?

355
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,800
But, if the sniper knew
what the victim was going to do...

357
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,268
Officer Yokomizo.

358
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:29,141
The victim was being hassled
by a heinous stalker lately.

360
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,577
Which means that
the stalker is the sniper?

362
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,746
I guess it would be most reasonable
to come to that conclusion.

364
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,018
It's true that unlike the usual Pops,
his deductions have been correct so far.

366
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:44,122
It's impossible for the people who were
at the party hall at the time of the gunshot,

368
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,124
to have fired the gun.

369
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,295
But, why is this so intricately designed?

370
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:55,000
Wait a sec.?! There was mud on
both the fishing line and the rifle.

372
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,538
The sudden shower would've
washed the mud of clean.

374
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,139
What on earth is going on?

375
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,711
Was it rigged to hide something else?

376
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,412
If so, what could it be...?

377
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,648
Officer Yokomizo!

378
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,050
The rifle seems to have been
the personal possession of the victim.

380
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:16,188
The owner of the rifle had filed
a robbery report for the rifle last week.

382
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,255
I see.

383
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:22,027
The substance that was on the decoration
of the outer wall of the 2nd floor was...

385
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,595
oil after all.

386
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:33,205
Okay, .l would like you all to tell me
what, ou were doing today!

388
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,908
Uh-6:40,

389
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,713
Right after arriving here, Mr. Mouri went
up to the 2nd floor with Mr. Kanazawa.

391
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:46,184
Conan, Ran, Mr. Hayashida
and Mr. Amamori...

393
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,986
were all in the backyard, right?

394
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,589
And, Mrs. Kanazawa, you were...

395
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:55,994
I was drinking brandy in the kitchen.
I went outside after 7:00.

397
00:14:56,763 --> 00:15:02,868
The»party began at 7:10, and
Mr. Mouri and Mr. Kanazawa join in.

399
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:08,273
At 7:20, Mr. Hayashida, you went to
the kitchen to get some beer.

401
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,076
You were gone for about 5 minutes.

402
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,244
Yes sir.

403
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,580
Mr. Amamori, you left to go
get some charcoal

405
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,716
just as Mr. Hayashida was
coming back from the kitchen.

407
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,951
You were gone for about 4 minutes.

408
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:27,025
At 7:29, Mr. Kanazawa
goes upstairs alone in order to watch TV.

410
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,131
After that I left to go to the bathroom at
7:30 and was gone for about 5 minutes.

412
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,500
I heard the gunshot as soon as I got back.

413
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,836
Let me verify things once more.

414
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:42,574
At the time the gunshot was heard
everyone that was at the party was here?

416
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:48,280
Yeah, that's why none of us here
could ve shot the gun.

418
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,654
I've more or less fi ured out the trick...

419
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,656
But, the problem is who did it...

420
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,759
This is...!

421
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,461
Uh, officer,
there's something on the ground

423
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,130
Oh, Thank you!

424
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,835
And, Mr. Mouri says he wants you
to check on something.

426
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:15,740
The diameter of the build
IS 20 meters,

428
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,310
the distance from the building to the tree
where the rifle was set up is 10 meters.

430
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,114
And the length of the fishing line
that is left on therrifle is...

432
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,683
precisely 10 meters and 2 centimeters.

433
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,418
Thank you!

434
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,289
I've figured it out!!
That person's the sniper!!

436
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,291
Conan

437
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,492
Conan

438
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,761
That kid, where is he hiding anyway?

439
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,503
Hey, Dad!

440
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,006
This is no time to be resting.
Help me look for Conan!

442
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,574
I've found him!

443
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,776
I'm over here!

444
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,179
Conan!!

445
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,884
And I've also figured out the who did it.

446
00:16:59,285 --> 00:16:59,951
Huh?

447
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,888
Ran, will you please
gather everyone here?

449
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,589
Mr. Mouri!

450
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,092
You've figured out who did it?

451
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:09,194
I thought you said just a while ago that
the sniper was someone from outside.

453
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,063
Please forget what I said back then.

454
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,933
But, it's true that the trigger
could be pulled

456
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,935
if the fishing line is pulled
from below the cliff.

458
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,070
Because the sniper wanted to
confuse everyone

460
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,007
by making it look like someone from
the outside committed the crime.

462
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:30,815
But, the sniper didn't realize that mud
would adhere to the trigger.

464
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,886
If it rains, mud was
supposed to wash off clean.

466
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,525
That is, the rifle was fired in another way.

467
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,428
And the one who was
capable carrying it out...

469
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,597
In other words, the sniper is here.

470
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,399
What?!

471
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:54,306
I shall show youright now how, the rifle
was fired without anyone attending to it.

473
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,842
May I ask you to help me,
Officer Yokomizo?

475
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,044
Y...Yes, Sir...

476
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,814
Please roll the paper up tight.

477
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:07,585
Then connect the cylinders
with double-stick tape and make a rod.

479
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,889
After that, stick the double-stick tape
on the tip of the rod.

481
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,658
What is this double-stick for?

482
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,928
Oh! That reminds me,
I found this on the ground!

484
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,299
It,It's the same!

485
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,934
You mean this is the sniper's...?

486
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,670
When everything is ready,
will you please look at the ground?

488
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,141
This was found by the trigger...

489
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,345
Please hook that on to the tip of the rod.

490
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,948
Then lift the rod towards the building.

491
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,052
The fishing line that is attached to
the pine tree lifts up.

493
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,790
When it is pulled taut, the weight that
is attached to the other end of the line...

495
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,827
I see, that's why there was mud
on the fishing line...

497
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,630
Now, please look at
the top of the building.

499
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,166
The top? Did you say the top?

500
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,470
The decoration on the 2nd floor?

501
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,674
Yes. The sniper hooked
the fishing line on it.

503
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,709
The weight is gradually pulled up...

504
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,712
And eventually puts pressure
on the trigger...

506
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,718
Of course,
the sniper was extremely careful

508
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:17,756
and applied oil to the decoration so that
the fishing line would slide smoothly.

510
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:21,192
The sniper probably placed
tissue paper or something

512
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,928
that was soaked in oil
at the tip of the newspaper.

514
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,698
The oil was most likely applied just
before the fishing line was hooked up.

516
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:33,538
It probably took at most
one to two minutes.

518
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,775
And, Mr. Mourn!
Just who is it? The sniper...

520
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:41,512
The sniper is you, Mr. Amamori!

521
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,485
At 7:25,

522
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,022
you went out to the backyard saying that
you were going to get some charcoal

524
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:06,204
You pulled up the fishing line that you
had hidden under the soil beforehand,

526
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,672
and got it ready...

527
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,776
Then, you came back to the party site
as if nothing had happened

529
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,145
With the rod made of
newspaper taken apart

and charcoal wrapped in it.

532
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,350
Because of the length of the fishing line,

533
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,620
the time the fishing line could be hooked
onto the building was only 10 minutes.

535
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,422
In other words,

536
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,158
the only one who could've done this was
the person who left the site of the party

538
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:31,729
from the time the gunshot was heard
at 7:35 to just before that at 7:25.

540
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,034
And you're the only one I can think of.

541
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:42,874
You all do not know the real...
the real . uichiro Kanazawa.

543
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,846
I'm the one who designed
the Shanghai Modern Museum!

545
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,217
I stole your design?

546
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,986
Don't be ridiculous!

547
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,688
Do you have proof?

548
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,124
I've always respected you Sensei!

549
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,595
I'll just warn you about one thing.

550
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,964
You don't seem to
be aware of where you stand.

552
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,069
That design gained public attention

553
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,871
because it was announced
under my name.

555
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:17,175
If you want to stay here
watch your mouth.

557
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,047
At that time, I swore to myself...

558
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,618
That I would never let him go to
the awards ceremony.

560
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,591
Then, were you the one
that was stalking him?

562
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,896
Es... I made up an imaginary stalker

563
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,934
Everything went as planned... Mr. Mour.

564
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,838
Other than the fact
that you showed up today.

What's up, Ran?

612
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,477
After this case,

613
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,113
I don't know if I can trust those
who people call geniuses anymore.

615
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:38,416
Which means you can't trust me either?

616
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:39,584
Huh?

617
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,155
The other genius, Kogoro Mouri is in fact,
a totally different person...

619
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,724
How do you like that?

620
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,201
You know yourself more than you realize!

621
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,005
What are you doing here?

622
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,272
R,Ran. ?

623
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,944
I see! The beach that
Doc was talking about was here!

625
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:07,645
Y,Yep.

626
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,687
Um, don't you think it's strange,
Officer Yokomizo™!

628
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:19,223
He drowned and yet his clothes
and body are full of scratches.

630
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,659
And besides,
why is he wrapped in the net?
