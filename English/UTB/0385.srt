What they both have in common is
hat their area code is "0858".

Which means...?

24

the mail address that connects to
the boss that controls all of them

Well

230
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:29,234
This violin Is what Danjiro Shitara

231
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:31,302
Uncle Kyosuko Hag1's father

232
00:10:31,303 --> 00:10:35,206
had given as a gift to Grandfather
Choichire. his older brother...

234
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:38,142
Um, despite being the son
of blood-related brothers.

236
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:40,077
Why is his last name Haga'?

237
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,014
The thing 1s unfortunately,
on the day of his birthday

239
00:10:43,015 --> 00:10:45,183
Danjiro was attacked By a robber

240
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,284
Robber?!

241
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:51,189
Grandfather Choichiro and
the others gave in quietly and was tied up

243
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,625
so they were fine. but Danjiro resisted so

244
00:10:53,626 --> 00:10:58,363
he passed away a few days later because
of the blow he incurred during the robbery

246
00:10:59,265 --> 00:11:01,366
Uncle Kyosuke who was left behind.

247
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,234
Was adopted by the family
on his mother's side

249
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:05,937
and took after the:surname Haga

250
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:07,238
I 888...

251
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:07,705
But. it's a amazing that this wasn't stolen

252
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,909
But, it's a amazing that this wasn't stolon.

253
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,046
Ry \J
I mean the robber was probably
after the Stradivarius

256
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,481
The robber seems to have taken
the wrong violin

258
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:20,118
Since the Shitara Family has been
musicians for generations

260
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,520
There were many violins

261
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:25,523
It all happened 30 years ago though

264
00:11:26,859 --> 00:11:28,259
Don't tell me that you want me to find out

265
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,428

00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:37,702
to solve the shuddering incidents, that
have happened within the last two years

270
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:45,343
The first one is
the incident that happened the year

272
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:48,680
before last Uncle Genzaburo's wife
who had been very athletic. tripped

274
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:51,015
on the stairs andspassedsaway...

275
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:53,718
The other one 1s an incident
that happened last year

277
00:11:53,719 --> 00:11:57,388
My father Furuto leaned
against a corroded:fence of the veranda...

279
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:00,191
It's unlikely that my father
who was a very careful person

281
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:01,926
would fall to his death like that.

282
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:04,529
I just can't make myself think
that something like that could happen.

284
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,332
I would like you to solve
these hideous cases Detective Mouri.

286
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,366
UIUh...

287
00:12:09,335 --> 00:12:12,135
Maybe those two incidents
were accidents...?

289
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:16,341
No! Both of them passed away
on Grandfather's birthday!

291
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:19,444
Moreover, at this time,
the two played this Stradivarius...

293
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:23,815
It is as if they were cursed
by the incident that occurred 30 years ago...

295
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:26,284
And. this'year. I'm going torbo playing it...

296
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:29,487
MESH GRAY
something bad will happen to me too.

298
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:32,290
Then, don't play it

299
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:34,425
I want to play it!

301
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:38,229
But, if you can take it out freely
M20 Gos amy Ann),

303
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,665
you can play it any time you like,
canst you 2

305
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:45,202
I borrowed it from Grandfather
just for today for this special occasion

307
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:49,941
sO I can practice. That's why...

308
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,949
See. I'm sure he's watching me

309
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,586
Then, you mean the violin that I played
a little a while ago wasn't supposed to be...

311
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:03,755
Of course it's a secret.

312
00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:06,674
And. what would you like me to doe?

313
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,862
Want you to undo the curse of
this Stradivarius before I begin playing it.

315
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,201
Oh ..A course is not something that
a detective like me can solve. you see...

317
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:21,356
Wht? I thought that
detectives solve anything.

319
00:13:21,473 --> 00:13:22,606
Huh?

320
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,742
It somehow seems to be bright outside.

321
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:27,412
Are youÂ» going to have some k
birthday fireworks or something?

323
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:29,814
No. there are no such plans...

324
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:31,949
Hmm!

325
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,004
T.The annex!

326
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:38,890
It.It's on fire!

327
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,904
Mr. Genzaburo (8 over there!

328
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,376
Fire! Open the curtains and look!

329
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,777
WwW. What?!

330
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,314
Where's your uncle's room?

331
00:14:03,315 --> 00:14:05,850
Uh, it's on the 2nd floor right up the stairs...

332
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:11,055
Hey. uncle, can you hear me?

333
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:13,758
Dran! The door Is locked...?

334
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,960
We've got no other choice.

335
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,529
Whaaal

336
00:14:24,703 --> 00:14:26,537
A.Agh~Great Uncle!

337
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,873
Don't go inside!
There is no seaving him!

339
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:32,743
A ane~A ane...

340
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:33,945
Grandfather!

341
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:40,084
A.Ayane is still upstairs.

342
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:41,819
What, Grandmother is upstairs

343
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,821
Where is the room upstairs?

344
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:46,557
The room at the very end of the 3rd floor...

345
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,563
This is impossible unless we have
a fire-proof suit or something!

348
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:53,898
Oh no...

349
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:05,610
H.He .

350
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:08,513
I can't help myself for being the way I am.

351
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:10,148
Take care of everyone else. will you.

352
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:11,282
H.He...

353
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,283
Uncle!

354
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:16,087
Pops. please park your car
below that window. quick!

356
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:16,754
Huh?

357
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,022
Do that. okay?!

358
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,291
Oh. hey you! Wait!

359
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:31,235
Are you all right?

360
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:34,021
Grandfather. please get a hold of yourself.

361
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:41,946
Hey Dad. wait,
just what do you think you're doing?

363
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:43,381
Beats me

364
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:53,391
Hint kKidintold me to park my car here,
Huh? How come I'm listening to that kid ?

366
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:26,724
What?!

367
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:30,795
Aaagh

368
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,765
Hey. get a hold of yourself. Aunty!

369
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,234
Mrs. Where!

370
00:16:39,204 --> 00:16:43,007
I sce he wanted to reduce
the distance of the fall with the car

372
00:16:43,008 --> 00:16:46,143
and used the roof as cushion...
Just what a kid would think of

374
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:50,181
We were lucky that we got a wagon
because they had nothing else.

376
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:51,882
It's a rental car, you know!

377
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:55,786
Who knows how much we're going to
have to pay for repair

379
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:58,789
The fire engines soon arrived at the scene

380
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:02,660
but the annex of the Shitara family
kept on burning for a while...

382
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:09,066
As If it were grieving the postiude
of the conductor Genzaburo Shitara

384
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:16,173
N. No!

385
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:17,308
N. No!

386
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:17,675
N. No!

387
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:21,145
But, we've got to treat you
at the hospital either way...

389
00:17:21,146 --> 00:17:22,280
No. no~I

390
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:26,284
I'm sorry, but
could you let her have her way. please.

392
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:31,622
A year ago, our son was taken atway
on the ambulance and never came back...

394
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:35,893
I guess she doesn't want to
ride the same vehicle.

396
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:40,865
Could you please treat her
at home just for today?

398
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:46,337
Thank you, sonny.

399
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:50,191
I'm sorry for what you had to
go through too Kyosuke. Thank you.

401
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:51,608
No problem .

402
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:55,279
Little Kyosuke, are you all right?

403
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,083
I'm fine. Will you please cut out
that Little when calling me.

405
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:02,286
30 years have gone by all ready

406
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:11,028
4 The steward Ms. Tsumagari was originally
working at Uncle Kyosuke's house.

408
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,000
# But, 30 years ago after that robbery
when Danjiro and his wife passed away.

410
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,670
AndrUncle Kyosuke who was left behind
took after the Haga family name.

412
00:18:19,671 --> 00:18:23,474
We had Ms. Tsumagari come to work for us,
{and she's been with us since...

414
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:27,678
What?! Kyosuke's father was
not the only one who passed away?

417
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,416
His mother @hiha, was not
a very healthy person toe begin with.

419
00:18:32,417 --> 00:18:35,252
But she watched ever her husband Danjire
without sleeping...

421
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:35,886
but she watched over her husband Danjiro
without sleeping...

423
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:39,557
As a result she-felliilltof
extreme fatigue and...

425
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:42,893
And. what about your mother, Hasuki?

426
00:18:42,894 --> 00:18:45,629
She got a divorce and went back to
her parental home.

428
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,232
Just before Grandfather's birthday
2 ears ago.

430
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:52,118
That's why Great Aunty Eimi ended up
playing for his birthday.

432
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:58,242
Since it was Grandfather's 70th birthday
as well as to encourage Father.

434
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,113
She was to play that Stradivarius
that had been sealed for 30 years...

436
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,315
That famed musical instrument
was sealed...?

438
00:19:04,316 --> 00:19:09,787
Yes. When Grandfather received it
from Danjiro. he was very happy but...

440
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:14,475
My: father:who borrowed; it
when"he:was 18 years-old

442
00:19:14,476 --> 00:19:17,962
and performed/in. a contestiexperienced
the strings snapping apart twice on stage

444
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:19,764
and was disqualified

445
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:21,531
Yet. on another occasion,

446
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:24,902
my aunt who was scheduled to
perform on a certain TV program...

448
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:28,372
came down with a high fever
right before show time...

450
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:31,108
And, Great Uncle GeÃ©nzaburo, who was,
on his wayito a concert abroad. (Â» I

452
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:34,245
came down. with a serious case of
tenosynovitis\during practice...

454
00:19:34,246 --> 00:19:38,082
I see~I can see why you'd want to seal it.

455
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:44,288
Uh, you think the violin's okay. It was left
on the desk in the room as Is.

458
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:49,026
H.Hey, if this fire was a case of arson,
it could've been taken

460
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,161
during all this commotion...

461
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:53,964
No, it wasn't. I put it back
in the storage room right away.

463
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,468
Or. do I look like an
incompetent steward who would leave

465
00:19:57,469 --> 00:20:00,004
such a famed
musical instrument unattended

467
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:03,107
in a household where
outsiders are walking around?

469
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,276
O.Oh. is that right.

470
00:20:05,277 --> 00:20:08,646
Besides, the fire was not caused by arson,
but rather. smoking while sleeping.

472
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:09,613
Huh?

473
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:12,950
It seems that the area around the ashtray
that was in that room

475
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:16,454
is where the fire started, and the door
was torn off with the key locked.

477
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:19,123
You're the one who broke it down, right?

478
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:21,992
If so, the room was locked...
And arson would be impossible...

480
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,727
O.Oh. is that right

481
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:27,298
Well, please be extremely careful
when smoking

483
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,633
It's best not to smoke though.

484
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:37,074
But, even if everything were
to be a coincidence. it sure is frightening

486
00:20:37,075 --> 00:20:37,675
To think that something would happen on
the same day for three consecutive years.

489
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:40,411
To think that somaothing would happon on
the same day for threc consecutive years

492
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,717
Including Â« osuke's father
) who died in the robbery 30 years ago.

494
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:51,255
It comes up to a total of four all together...
Taking this into consideration,

496
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:56,160
I think you shouldn't stop celebrating
Choichiro's birthday from next year...

498
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:59,430
Aha. ha...ll tell you. he's already smoking

499
00:20:59,763 --> 00:21:03,601
Well, it'll turn out that way anyway,
because Uncle has bad lungs

501
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:06,537
and has only a h: If a year to live.

502
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,806
R.Really?

503
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,077
Yes. I wanted to at least
celebrate today with him

505
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:17,248
We can't anymore,
because he's already gone to bed.

507
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:21,085
The Mrs. has already been treated
and has also gone to bed.

509
00:21:21,219 --> 00:21:27,024
So. since this doesn't:seeÃ©m to be a case
or anything. we'll start off home too...

511
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:38,935
Uh, who's cigare te butt is this?
It doesn't seem to be yours, Pops.

513
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:43,574
That brand is-the one that
Great Uncle Genzaburo used to smoke.

515
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:47,678
Come to think of it,_he stopped by here
before going to the annex...

517
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,612
If so then. .this is.

518
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,048
Iff so then. .this is...

519
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,120
Conan?!

520
00:21:59,157 --> 00:22:01,058
Hey, kid,
where do you think you're going... 7?!

523
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:18,909
Just as I thought.

524
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:26,650
This Is not an accident, but murder

525
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:31,989
Moreover, if my deduction is correct,
the next target is...
