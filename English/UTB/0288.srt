1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,704
Suspense and deduction closes the gap between
the love and hatred between two people.

3
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,974
Spending time with Ran in New York,
turning rain and mystery into memory. B

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:09,609
He sees through the one and only truth.

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,410
13/)
a child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

9
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,412
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

11
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:53,512
Mom takes Ran and I
to see a musical in New York.

13
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,786
While we were being
given the backstage tour,

15
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,790
we met an actor Heath Flockhart
who ends up getting shot to death!

17
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:08,894
Feathers?

18
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,099
How'd they get stuck here?

19
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,470
I get it now...

20
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:26,746
SHINICHI IN NEW YORK-PART Ill

21
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,649
Let's see, from this position...

22
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,854
It doesn't leek like any of you
four could. have shot him from.above.

24
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,357
Then would you mind if
we changed our clothes?

26
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,094
Go ahead, since you all tested
negative for gunpowder residue too.

28
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:45,898
Which means the killer was
probably someone rom the outside...

30
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,868
Yeah. that's the only explanation...

31
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,870
What. Happend?

32
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,506
Who did that?
Who turned the lights off!

34
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,574
Me, I did it!

35
00:02:56,977 --> 00:03:00,412
Some people know me as the
most beautiful actress in Japan

37
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:05,150
others know me as the
globe trotting mystery writer's wife

39
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,620
But in reality. I am...

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,990
a highly intelligent female detective.

41
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:13,826
I am Night Baroness!

42
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,164
Xcusefme. light man!
I'm over here!

44
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,033
Ukiko...

45
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,400
That's right!

46
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,204
Captain, the fog has been lifted!

47
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,575
I'm talking about the fog that hid the
truth behind the murder of course!

49
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:30,810
What?

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,780
Hey mom, don't get carried
away and mess up the ending.

52
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:39,351
Don't worry
I'll tell it exactly like you told me to.

54
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,352
Gosh...

55
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,923
Hey. are you sure you're right?

56
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,059
If you're wrong, your mom's
going to look like a fool!

58
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,830
Don't you think it's strange?

59
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:55,101
Heath's 63" tall, that's
about 190 centimeters

61
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:59,004
That's just about the height of you
with the pamphlet on your head

63
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,375
when I measured it just now, the
pamphlet stuck out over the mirror.

65
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,480
And on top of that, Heath had
those wings on his back

67
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,483
so he couldn't bend over,
even if he were behind the mirror.

69
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,951
You'd be able to see the top of his head.

70
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:16,322
That's why the killer used that certain
thing so his head wouldn't stick out

72
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:22,995
performers use it to appear
and disappear suddenly on stage

74
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,030
it's called a trap door!

75
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,704
But there wasn't anything
Iike that behind the mirror!

77
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,242
There was only a strange metal
cover on the floor beside it

79
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:41,480
Think, if you see a cover, you
should know there's a hole under it!

81
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:46,585
Feathers from Heath's wings
were caught under the cover,

83
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:51,123
and the blood on the floor
under the lid was arc shaped

85
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,760
and the stage has
a doughnut shaped ditch,

87
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:59,564
now add the crooked curtain near the
ditch and you should get the picture

89
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:05,004
By moving'thg,doughnut
shapedyfioor like that

91
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,573
the unseen trap door.

92
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,009
Opens right up!

94
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,849
I think if you check it,
you're going to find...

97
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,352
more feathers, the gunshot
probably knocked more off

99
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:23,322
and you should find
Heath's blood too

101
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,660
And you'll probably find the
bullet casing from the gun too!

103
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:28,761
But...

104
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,932
If the bullet casing's there,
that means he was shot at close range?

106
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,335
That's right... Heath was standing
by under the trap door

108
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,771
the metal lid was
resting against the mirror,

110
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,539
the killer shot him from above
but sticking her right hand

112
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:47,446
which held the gun,
between the mirror and the lid!

114
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,949
Are you saying the Killer...

115
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,419
Yes...
The only one capable of doing it...

117
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,855
under those circumstances,
was the once lying beside the mirror...

119
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,158
Ose...it was you, wasn't it

120
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,429
Rose?

121
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,998
I don't believe it...it can't be...

122
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,935
I mean, no one, not even the staff
mentioned the trap door would be used!

124
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,706
I'm sure that's true, because...

125
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:18,177
It's not that the staff DIDN'T tell you...
they COULDN'T...

127
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,479
All of you believe the mirror's
your guardian spirit,

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,716
they couldn't tell you
at it's been damaged...

131
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,686
I'm pretty sure Rose did it
when no one was looking

133
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:32,825
when the stagehands saw the crack,
they removed the damaged portion

135
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:36,028
Then adjusted the frame to cover it up.

136
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:41,133
SO everyone wouldn't be upset
and worry about having bad luck.

138
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,405
But since the frame was made shorter,
Heath's head would show

140
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,208
they knew that if they put
the mirror on a stand,

142
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,511
everyone would be suspicious
and notice it'd been damaged

144
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:56,314
that's why they decided,
on the spur of the moment,

146
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,485
to use the trap door so that
Heath would be out of sight!

148
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,956
They only told Heath and Rose about. it!

149
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,660
But why did the? tell Rose?

150
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,662
Isn't it obvious?

151
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:15,334
By moving the doughnut shaped floor,
they 'd be able to hide the opening but,

153
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,906
Unless Rose reached under
the mirror to lower the lid,

155
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,042
the audience would see it!

156
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,210
Then what about the gun?

157
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,614
It fell from way up high!

158
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:32,151
She was lying on the floor,
she couldn't have thrown it up that high

160
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,353
Of course she can!

161
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,455
Heath the angel was going to be
suspended ih mid air,

163
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,257
all she had to do was use him!

164
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:42,227
Remember, Heath had
a burn mark on his neck

166
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,598
I'm sure he got it
when she put the gun there,

168
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,600
it'd just been fired so it was hot...

169
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,670
if she put the gun there
in the folds of his costume and

171
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,106
when he stopped being lifted,
the vibration would cause it to fall,

173
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,507
that was the idea!

174
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,744
But I don't think
she even imagined for a second

176
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,246
he'd grab her with his bloodied hand

177
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:07,219
The reason the blood in his palm was
smeared proves that he grabbed her hand

179
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,723
And the proof should still be there

180
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,992
on her right hand and
on the inside of her glove...

183
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,863
Heath's hate filled handprint!

184
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:26,138
I'm pretty sure she performed
with her gloves inside out

186
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,874
And after firing the gun

187
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,477
she quickly turned them back correctly.

188
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,948
So that she wouldn't test positive
for gun powder residue

190
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,416
after the investigation started!

191
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:42,521
But Shinichi... when'd you
realize there Was blood on her glove

193
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:49,561
I realized it when I saw her struggle to
open the can of juice in the dressing room!

195
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:53,465
All she had to do was
take her gloves off but she didn't,

197
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,336
sO <figured.she was hiding
something under them!

199
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:02,941
But then I also got an epiphany right there
and then as to her motive for killing Heath

201
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,710
Her motive?

203
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,447
Remember, both Lila and" Akane had
photos on their mirrors,

205
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:12,683
taken with Heath
but not Rose, her photo

207
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:19,057
The angel Her photo
was of him in his angel costume

209
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:25,497
You weren't in love with him,
you were in love with his role as the angel

211
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,570
That's right... that's why
I killed him as the angel Michael

214
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:37,543
Because I just found it unbearable...

215
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:43,749
But he was quitting because
he was going to star in a movie

217
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,854
It was his own decision though...
he was responsible for Michael's death!

219
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:54,626
He knew how much I leved him
as Michael and he still did it

221
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,099
But it seems that
God was watching over me

223
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,370
When the suit armor fell,
I couldn't run away

225
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,574
because my clothes were caught
on a nail and God saved me

228
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,077
Thankyyou. sweet angel...

229
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:12,577
TA UL
DLILWVKEEE A

231
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,614
You helped-me.do it...

232
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,295
Alright then Shin!

233
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:35,067
I have to go to the police station and
stand in{when they questiontherifi/

235
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,970
so you'll have to go back
tofthe hotel by taxi

237
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:43,375
Oh and by the way, be careful,
there's a slasher on the loose!

239
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,978
He's Japanese and has long hair

240
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,847
See yourlater "Shin!

241
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,351
Good grief, she still treats me like a kid

242
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,320
doesn't she realize
I'm in high school already!

244
00:10:56,054 --> 00:11:00,959
And then! This is what Holmes said...

245
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,329
Even if the world does revolve
around the moon, it will never

247
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,066
affect my work in any way
how'd you like that!

249
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,069
What's the matter. Ran?

250
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,040
You're not letting what Rose said to you
back there bother you, are you

252
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,476
Did she say something?

253
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:21,079
Her English was so fast,
I didn't understand a word

255
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,614
Forget. it.then!

256
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,950
It wasn't important anyway

257
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,920
Would you mind closing the window,
you're going,to.catch a cold!

259
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,423
Didn't you say you were feeling like of hot
since this morning?

261
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,992
Oh I'm fine already!

262
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:38,597
Besides. if I close the window.l won't be
able to see the city lights very well!

264
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:43,235
But..if the rain comes in and the seat gets
wet, the driver's not going to be happy

266
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,839
Don't worry! I have a handkerchief.
I'll wipe the wet areas before I get out!

268
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,874
Good grief

269
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,713
Oh, excuse me! Stop the car!
Please, stop!

271
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,521
That's strange. it should be around here...

272
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,157
I wonder if it got blown
away by the wind...

274
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,760
Just forget it! It's just a handkerchief...

275
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,928
It's not just an ordinary handkerchief!

that Rose will commit the crime
and I saved the murderes life...

00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:50,949
Shinichi came in here because
you let your handkerchief go!

369
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,405
Ran, get away from there!
That's the serial killer!

371
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,145
he's right girlie... was hiding out in here

372
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,647
But that kid found me...

373
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,519
If you're going to blame somebody,
you should blame God

375
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,321
for putting you in this situation...

376
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,202
Wh, what're you doing!

377
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:49,674
Hurry! Grab my arm! Hurry, my
hand's slippery because of the rain!

379
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,479
Sh, Shinichi...

380
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,349
Good grief...you're so much trouble

381
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:11,829
Why'd you do it? Why'd you save me?
I don't understand!

383
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,201
Do we need a reason?

384
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,405
I don't know what makes
a person kill another personbut

386
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,741
I do know why people save each other...

387
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,078
Logical thinking doésn:texist, does it?

388
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,348
Oh I get it...
yes, he's right...

390
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:36,820
I should have realized
it earlier... .how foolish of me...

392
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,824
Ran, you okay?

393
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,428
Don't do it...

394
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,934
I notice you're wounded, that mean
the police must be close by

396
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:53,137
You don't have a silencer, if you shoot,
the police"ll be all over the place

398
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:58,108
Not only that, you'll be giving
me the opportunity to capture you too...

400
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:04,883
I'll let you go today, but if we ever
meet again, I won't be so lenient!

402
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,790
I'll be like the Devil and list all your sins
and look at all the evidence

404
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:15,393
then I'll send you straight
to hell, so don't you forget it!

406
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:23,668
That's right...
didn't you see it on the news?

408
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:28,906
They found that serial killer...
Shin, turned him in!

410
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,843
But when the police got there,
he'd already been shot

412
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,879
they say it was a suicide...

413
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,216
Yes. .Ran's fine!

414
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,020
She had a fever last night but
after a good night's Fest

416
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:48,193
she's back to normal .
But so many things happened yesterday

418
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,098
You knew something was
going to happen, didn't you?

420
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,034
You knew [Rose was
UP to something didn't you?

422
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:59,437
Yes... I've always had a sixth
sense about things like that

424
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,274
But I never imagined that
she'd commit murder...

426
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,444
By the way. will you give
Ran this message"?

428
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:12,450
Tell her she was right, there does
seem to be an angel looking out for me

430
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,020
Oh really, has something
good happened?

433
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,954
I guess you could say that...

434
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,991
Hey...maybe you're not
over your cold yet...

436
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,459
I'm fine. really!

437
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,863
I'm going to check if you
have a fever, don't move

439
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm fine!

440
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:30,568
What?

442
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,875
He was right! The doctor said her
fever would go down and it did!

445
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,079
Yo! So you're awake!

446
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,581
They said your fever was
caused. by exhaustion

448
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,985
I guess you'll have texgo easy on the
studying and club activities now!

450
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:52,223
The fever madeX ou delirious
and you were mumbling something

452
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,024
I did?

453
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,996
Something about saving somebody and
about logical thinking and stuff...

455
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:58,695
Uh oh!

458
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,533
No, stop! Those are my private thoughts...

459
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:02,100
What?

460
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,704
That's night! They're private
thoughts and very personal!

462
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,406
I don't want you say them
in your raspy voice!

464
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,809
What do you mean by that?

465
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,414
Alright then, I'll come pick
you up tomorrow.

467
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,450
Stay here tonight and rest up!

468
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:20,185
Good night Ran!

470
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,589
So that's what it was
I'd forgotten all about it

473
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:33,264
That's when it started, that's the
moment I fell in love with Shinichi...

476
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,534
Something's the matter with me...

477
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,037
how could I have forgotten
such an important event...

479
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,241
I guess the bad memories
suppressed the good ones...

481
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:47,045
I met so many people and so
many things happened, that's why...

483
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,951
That man in the black knit cap...
I wonder who he was?

485
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,889

I remembered some good things teo

557
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,878
by the way, what ever happened to
Sharon's handkerchief?

559
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:06,284
Remember, you went into the abandoned
building to get it for me?

561
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,988
Oh that. I have it!

562
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,357
Oops...l wonder where I put it...

564
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,493
2 murders took place that day and...

566
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,929
I didn't:-want it to bring back
those memories so I put it away

568
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,633
2 murders? The serial
Killer committed suicide, didn't he?

570
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,637
Yes...that's what the police report said

571
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:29,240
The blood stains and finger prints

572
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,908
that should've been
there had been wiped clean...

574
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:33,578
If you were going to commit suicide,

575
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,713
would you go through all the trouble
of covering up your tracks?

577
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,315
I'm pretty sure...

578
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:41,419
somebody shot him just before he
was going to make his get away

580
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,489
Somebody got to him
before the police arrived...

582
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,193
: PE A

585
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,333
He took non-perishable food and
his wallet with him. that means...

587
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,303

be all right

589
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,441
