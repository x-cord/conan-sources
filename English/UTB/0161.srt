1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,603
Inspiration flashes,
piercing through to the truth.

3
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,204
Once he gets going,
nothing can stop him.

5
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,806
Today's setting is an unusual restaurant,

6
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,608
the crime arrives by water.

7
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,343
The one and only truth is brought
into light.

9
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,144
He looks like a child but he's got
the Brains of an adult. I

11
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,279
His name is...

12
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,947
Detective Conan

13
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:56,215
Murder at Ryusuitel

15
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,652
RYusuitel

16
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:09,362
Oh boy, We are 30 minutes early
for our reservation!

18
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,731
Sorry,sbut this is a very popular place

19
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,033
If we are late, they will
cancel our reservation.

21
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,536
I'm tired of waiting
and I'm getting hungry.

23
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,549
Alright #4. sake is ready!

24
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:31,283
Got it!

25
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:34,887
== RB

27
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,838
I see a restaurant where
the food is served by boat.

29
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,206
No wonder it's popular

30
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,574
Do you like it?

31
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,078
There are bigger boats too

32
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,614
What happens to the boat
once it gets to the room?

34
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,049
The customer takes
the dishes off the boat

38
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,351
then pushes a button in the room

Wow, that's neat!

46
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,689
Excuse me

48
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,093
We have reservations.

49
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,962
Mr. Kaneda, you reserved
the Hachi-no-ma, didn't you?

51
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:17,662
Eh... 1?

52
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,698
Hey, Kaneda...

53
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,101
Not me...there must be a mistake!

54
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,837
Hey, Kaneda, Aral!

55
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,973
You're late,
I was getting tired of waiting.

57
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,876
Sorry... Kaneda was late...

58
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,411
Go on, apologize.

59
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,247
Humph... this wasnst; my-idea! t*

60
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,051
Come on! This is to celebrate your
promotion to assistant professor,

62
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,319
the Professor's treat!

63
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,722
Just because we were hired the
same time doesn't mean we're friends!

65
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,258
Starting today, address me as
Assistant Professor Kaneda...

67
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,193
understand?!

68
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,596
And you're my assistant,
Aral...!

70
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,597
Er...

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,600
Out of my way...

73
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,770
You what's the most expensive
dish you have?

75
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,372
SS... blowfish milt

76
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,508
Then bring us 3 of those...

77
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,643
you don't mind,
do you Professor?

79
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,778
Uh. no... it's fine with me!

80
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,213
It's fine wi

Iwama Nobuo

Jomon. University

91
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:13,085
We'll have 3 orders of blowfish milt

92
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,553
Yes, right away

93
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,588
Let's go inside.

94
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,498
Did¢ ou see that?
That Kaneda's a real stinker!

96
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:31,203
I wonder why Professor Iwama
always orders so much food?

98
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,873
Maybe he likes a full table!

99
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,909
But he usually leaves
without eating much.

101
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,482
I'm dying of hunger!

103
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,388
Those men are next door...

104
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,093
Wow... here it comes...

105
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,462
What-a huge boat!!

106
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,231
Look at all the food! Gee.
I won't be able to...

108
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,064
hey 1 Om

109
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,468
Rats, it wasn't ours...

110
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,037
Professor. all this food

111
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:06,939
It's a celebration.

112
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,141
By the way, I wonder
what's keeping that Kaneda

114
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:13,312
He probably went to the toilet.
He'll be back soon...

116
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,720
Ah~! Delicious!

117
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,125
'Conan. how's the sashimf?

118
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,395
Hey. where'd it go?

119
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,631
I dropped my contact lens!

120
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,534
Oh no, now I've done it!!

121
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,539
Here. I found it! What a relief!

122
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:41,340
For a professor.
He's quite a scatterbrain...

124
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,641
For a professor.
He's quite a scatterbrain...
7:50 pm

129
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:44,443
For a professor.
He's quite a scatterbrain...

Da~d!

141
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,254
There's a child present!

142
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,024
I was kidding. it's a joke...

143
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:00,492
ah?!

145
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,606
Hey Ran. we're out of sake!

146
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,374
Order me another!

147
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,610
1 is enough!

148
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,278
We're going to have
a delicious dinner now!

150
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,213
Rats...!

151
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,148
It's not just her personality.

152
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,618
Now she's even beginning to
sound like her mother Eri.

154
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,287
Eeeek!!

155
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:28,854
What!

156
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,427
somebody come quick!!

157
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,097
What's going on!?

158
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,239
What happened?

159
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,275
Th, the customer is...

160
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,141
Eh!?

162
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,011
What the!?

163
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,148
Th. that' s...

164
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,651
Ka. Kaneda!!

165
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,992
He's dead.

166
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,030
This is a murder...!

167
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,032
Notify the police immediately!!

168
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,471
Professor lwama...
what ha: ened?

170
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,941
K. Kaneda is dead in this room.

171
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,209
Wh-at!?

172
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:27,913
A murder has just taken place...

173
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,617
until the police arrive.

174
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:35,454
The police will probably want to
question everyone

176
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,423
your cooperation will be appreciated!

177
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,363
Since he fell at this angle,

178
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,734
I guess Mr Kaneda, who was sitting
at the far end of the table,

180
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,437
greeted the killer and was stabbed
in the chest while facing him

182
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,139
Then he fell onto the table.

183
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,450
If the killer came here
by the waterway,

185
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,686
this room should be sopping wet

186
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,321
but it's not!

187
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,058
Huh!?

188
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:16,495
What is this black thing on his thumb?

189
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,532
This smell is

190
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:25,971
How many times do I have to tell you
not to wander around the crime scene!!

192
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,146
The victim .issKeizo laneda,...
assistant professor of science

194
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,048
at Jomon University

195
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,251
He was stabbed in the heart with
a dagger and died instantly

197
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,021
Time of death is estimated«to be
at.about 19:50.

199
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:47,493
Also, we have confirmed the alibis of
+ all:the restaurant employees.

201
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:50,763
This is Professor lwama and
Mr. Aral is an instructor,

203
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,899
both men work with the
victim at the university.

205
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,104
We were celebrating Kaneda's promotion
to assistant professor tonight...

207
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,641
I thought he was In the toilet.

208
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,909
Who would've thought something like
this was possible...

210
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,180
And a certain party just happened to
be on the scene...

212
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,683
Yes! The famous private detective
Kogoro Mouri here!

214
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,951
Inspector Megure!

215
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,056
And + oko Anzai you were the first
to discover the body!

217
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,960
Yes... the customer went into the room
but never placed an order

219
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,997
sol went in to check on him,
that's how I found him...

221
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,634
But why was he in the Hachi-no-ma?

222
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,237
Didnt he say he didn't make that
reservation?

224
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,942
That's why I called out to him
when he started to headsfor that«room.

226
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:40,178
But he said he was meeting someone
there...

228
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:45,717
Hmm... so he was meeting someone
secretly.

230
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,620
That person must have killed"him...!

231
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,258
Did you see anyone besides the victim
enter the room?

233
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,860
No no one...

234
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,094
You're positive?

235
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,699
Yes. I was standing at the register and
Iooking out at the garden...

237
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,468
The front door is the only way to get
explains in

239
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,870
and everyone has to cross the bridge
to get to their rooms.

241
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,007
Then how did the killer get into
the room?

243
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,976
Inspector, from the waterway...!

244
00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:15,347
It was designed to go past each room,

246
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,484
SO you can get to the room
by using it!!

248
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:22,421
I see... so you're saying
this is an inside job

250
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,456
Alright, Takagi.

251
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,428
Ask all the customers if they saw someone
using the waterway!!!

253
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,329
Yes sir!

254
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,331
Hong

255
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,100
We were looking?at the waterway a lot

256
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,302
but we didn't see anyone on it.

257
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,170
ADM 5D. QM

258
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:38,737
oi Io Hom

259
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,173
No, no one like that.

260
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,741
I didn't see anyone either.

261
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,978
No idea

262
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,646
No one went by

263
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,651
If someone was walking in the water,
we'd notice.

265
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,853
Only boats went by!

266
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,489
No one saw anything...!?

267
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,894
No! All the other rooms were
parties of Yor-more

269
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,962
butsno one saw anything other than
boats go past!

271
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,931
Maybe the killer went underwater?

272
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,201
No! The water's only about 50
centimeters deep,

274
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,402
it's not possible
to swill underwater.

276
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:15,340
Besides, if the killer went underwater
the room would be sopping wet!

278
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,576
Did you say something!

279
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,577
No, I was talking to myself...

280
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,615
Either way, since coming in
from the outside is impossible,

282
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,617
it must be an inside job!

283
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,053
We've got to confirm
everyone's alibi...

285
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,024
Mr. Iwama, where were you at about
7:507

287
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,993
I never left our room, the San-no-ma

288
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,932
Isn't that about the time you were
shouting?

290
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,100
Yes, that's right....!

291
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:45,904
While I was looking for my contact lens,
I knocked some dishes over...

293
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,108
After that. I saw the screen close
In your room

295
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,344
so your alibi's OK.

296
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,516
Mr. Arai, you came back to
the restaurant after the murder

298
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,685
After kaneda left,

299
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,387
the professor asked me to buy
him a pack of cigarettes

301
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,723
so I went to the convenience store

303
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,759
I told him where to go...

304
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,730
we didn't have the brand
he wanted at our register...

306
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,067
I took me about 10 minutes
to walk there...

308
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,534
I have a receipt.

309
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,170
Hmm...

310
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:22,574
the time on the receipt is 19:52

311
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,445
Which means these 2 men have
perfect alibis!!

313
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:30,315
The killer must be
one of the other customers!

315
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:33,452
No...

316
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:35,954
with the other parties of 4 or more,

317
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,924
the killer would have to foolsthe others
as well as Mr. Anzai togget to that room,

319
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:39,957
so it's impossible

320
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:44,162
These 2 are the only ones who
were able to be alone

322
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,798
and commit the crime...

323
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,633
Takagi!

324
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,534
Let's split up and verify
the other customers' alibis

326
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:51,637
Yes sir!

327
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:54,673
Uh-ma'am, I want to see the\boats.

328
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,642
Not now Conan, it's a bad time.

329
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,178
It's alright.
I have nothing to do now.

331
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,413
Thank you so much.

332
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,726
See, this is it.

333
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,095
Is the door always locked?

334
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,597
Yes, that's right.

335
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,033
We don't want just anyone
going in and out of here.

337
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:24,469
I'm the only employee with a key!

338
00:13:25,203 --> 00:13:26,571
Here we are, go on...

339
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:31,276
5 boats altogethe

340
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,577
and one of them is huge...

341
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:34,246
huh?!

342
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,555
This is the same stuff that was on
Mr. Kaneda's finger...

344
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,127
But he wasn't there when the
food got to their room...

346
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:54,231
Was the whiskey and ice on this boat
just now?

348
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:58,637
Yes, the reservation specifically stated
this boat was to be used,

350
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:03,642
the food was to be served at
7:30 and the drinks at 8:00.

352
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,310
Hmm.

353
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,249
A small motor and sensor...

354
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,218
there's a lot of space Inside...

355
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,388
so all that's left is the alibi...

356
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,392
Thank you very much.

357
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,271
Or & - 28

359
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,515
Hmm?

360
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,918
There's one wrapper missing...

361
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,454
This is...

363
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,190
IDUU.

364
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,793
So that's why that person did that...

365
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,765
I found it...

366
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,967
a tiny hole and a wet spot It

367
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,137
That person's alibi
has just been cracked!!

369
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:09,508
On top of that,
I've got undeniable evidence!!

371
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,814
Sir. may I talk to you!

372
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,083
Go away, you're bothering me!

373
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:21,720
I found something really weird.

374
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,188
Something weird?

375
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,925
What? I can't hear you!

376
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:28,627
Ack!

377
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,365
All the customers in Nana-no=ma
have alibis

379
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,101
how much longe
do we have to stay?

381
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,969
Yes, you're right.

382
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,505
I suppose you two can go.

383
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,674
Not yet! It's too early!!

384
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,542
Eh!?

385
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,513
The truth is, I know how
the killer got to the room!

387
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,115
You do!?

388
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,083
Why don't you explain?

389
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,555
We were right
the killer did use the waterway

391
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,123
Come on now...

392
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,691
Mr Mourn,

393
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,361
Iisten... all the witnesses agree
there were only boats on the waterway.

395
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:07,032
That's right .
The killer used a boat!

397
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,166
A boat...?

398
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:13,505
A small person could hide
in the big boat,

400
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:15,440
there's enough room!

401
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,309
Nay,
First, p

403
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,547
the killer requests that the larger boat
be used to serve their complete meal.

405
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,650
he takes the food off and
removes the clapboard.

407
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,485
Then he gets in!

408
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:30,755
The boat returns to it's berth by
sensor

410
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,591
before it gets there,

411
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,861
he turns the sensor off using his foot!

412
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,529
The boat's motor goes off

413
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,564
and it reaches the Hachi-no-ma room

414
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,435
Kaneda must have been
really surprised at first!

416
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,737
But he wasn't worried

417
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,272
after all,

418
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:52,310
he would never suspect
a friend would come to kill him...

420
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,013
The killer used this element of surprise

421
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,350
and killed him!!

422
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:03,388
Then, so no one would think he came In
through the waterway,

424
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,391
the killer made Mr Kaneda
face the doorway!!

426
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,426
Oh, I see...

427
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:12,329
but then, how did*the killer
get back into his own room?

429
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,099
It's simple...

430
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,468
he got back into theboat

431
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,603
and turned the sensor back on

432
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,806
thesbdat will automatically
go back to the dock...

434
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,410
all he needs to do now is wait...

435
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:31,116
As directed. the boat would carry
their drinksto the room at 8!

437
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:36,054
But unfortunately for the killer,

438
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,357
I noticed something!!

439
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,358
Wh, what was that?

440
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,662
The waterline....!

441
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,499
There was only that whiskey set
on the boat,

443
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,302
yet the waterline was extremely high.

444
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,637
What it proves is that

445
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:57,943
the killer had been in the boat!

446
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,412
W. wait a minute...

447
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,681
the only one who could have remained
in thesroom alone

449
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:05,850
and who was a friend is

450
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,818
Yes...

451
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,586
the murderer is Professor lwama!

452
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,423
It could only have been you!

453
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,493
P, Professor...1?

454
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,396
You probably told him

455
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,500
you wanted to speak to him
in private in another room

457
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,103
and had himjreserve the
Hachi-no-ma!

459
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:30,775
And when the food arrived, you sent
Mr. Arai out to buy your cigarettes!

461
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:34,245
Deliberately asking for a brand they
don't sell at the register

463
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,247
>> 1.
So he'd have to go to
a convenience store...

466
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,149
Hold it right there, Mr. Mourn!

467
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,355
You yourself testified that I was In
my room at the time of the crime!

469
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:48,293
With that alibi, how could I have
killed Kaneda

471
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:52,130
You have a tape recorder don't you?

472
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:54,632
Of course I do.

473
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:59,237
It's a small one I carry around
in my bag for meetings...

475
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,573
Even if I could use it to
tape voices and sounds,

477
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,708
how would I close the sliding door?

478
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:09,414
How about by using a rubber band,
a pin, a chopstick wrapper and ice?

481
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,252
First you use the pin to hold the
rubber band in place

483
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,521
to the sliding door and it's frame...

484
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,625
then you stuff the chopstick wrapper into
the sliding door on the other side

486
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,128
and tack one end down

487
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,864
Then you pull the door
with the rubber band

489
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,099
attached to the chopstick wrapper

490
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,636
and pin it through the chopstick wrapper

491
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,639
the finishing touch you took ice
from the food

493
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,876
and put it on the
wrapper circle

495
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,812
the ice will melt
making the paper wrapper soft

497
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:41,846
and when it breaks

498
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,817
the rubber band will snap back
closing the door!

500
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,752
Yes, I see!

501
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,454
When you returned to the room,
Mr. lwama,

503
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:54,192
you got rid of the rubber
band and tacks and erased the tape...

505
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,495
And if you threw the wrapper
into the waterway,

507
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,198
there'd be no evidence left!

508
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,200
That's right...

509
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,601
there's no evidence...

510
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,570
If you're accusing me of
killing Kaneda

512
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,606
show me the proof
show me!!

514
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,241
Mr. Aral...

515
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,177
when you took the food off the boat

516
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:15,313
did you spill the sauce
for the blowfish milt?

518
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,916
Y, yes, I did...

519
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,151
on the clapboard...

520
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,287
Mr Iwama,

521
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,857
when Miss Anzai screamed
and you came out of the room,

523
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:28,293
you had your jacket on, didn't you!

524
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:32,597
No one would bother to put their
jacket on in an emergency...

526
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,067
But you did because the sauce
got on your shirt

528
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,971
when you got into the boat,
isn't that right?

530
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,473
Mr. lwama...

531
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,742
will you remove your jacket?

532
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,712
I do have a sauce stain on it

533
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:53,318
but I got it when I spilled the sauce
while I was looking for my contact lens!

535
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,185
I wonder...

536
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:58,522
Mr. Kaneda left the room
before the food arrived but

538
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,826
he had some sauce on his thumb...

539
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,194
Eh. 17?

540
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:06,564
I wonder when he got it... 7?

541
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,335
Uh... uh... it can't be...

542
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:11,503
That's right...

543
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:15,540
When you stabbed him,
he grabbed you there!!

545
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,476
Right on that stain on your shirt!

546
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:24,949
Consequently, Mr. Kaneda's fingerprint
IS on your shirt!

548
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:31,623
Kaneda heard that in the past,

549
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,927
I had put my name on a student's thesis
paper and passed it off as my own.

551
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,529
He threatened to make it public

552
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,631
if I didn't recommend him

553
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,833
for the assistant professor's position
to the selection committee...

555
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:43,835
On top of that,

556
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,504
he wanted me to
give him 5 million yen

558
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,440
I couldn't put up with it any more...

559
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:55,280
The blowfish milt was
an unexpected order...

561
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,716
If he hadn't ordered it,
I would have gotten away...

Since the murder,
they've gotten popular again.

607
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,685
Hey dad take us somewhere again.

608
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,121
Sure...

609
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,555
as long as there are geishas there...

611
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,229
How about if I serve you then?

612
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,831
No, no thank you...

613
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,435
Ooh scary

614
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:14,085
I don't understand this at all but

615
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,621
This is so exciting!

616
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:19,357
The more I don't understand,
the more excited I get!

618
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:22,293
The curiosity inside me that
I Ynever satisfied!
