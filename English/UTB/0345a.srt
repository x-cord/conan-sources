Halloween is October 31st?!

Huh, what's written on the invitation card?

Who on earth:could"ve sent

00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,872
Maybe a foreigner.

94
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,308
Because the name of the sender is

95
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,078
VERMOUTH...

98
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,229

107
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,125
Vermouth?

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,497
I wonder ..I'm sorry Ran,
but I've never heard that name before...

110
00:04:58,698 --> 00:04:59,898
I see...

111
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,100
I wonder who sent us
this invitation card...?

113
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,302
And...

114
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,573
Is Kogoro going to the evening party...
It's tomorrow. isn't it?.

116
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,374
Yup.

117
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,978
He's says Edoites always take
on fights they are challenged to.

119
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,746
Father's making preparations for it

120
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,314
and having Sonoko
put on all kinds of make up on him,

122
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,817
although he's still undecided
which make-up he wants to go with.

124
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:19,850
Make-up?

126
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,155
It says on the invitation card...

127
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,457
that since it's a Halloween party

128
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,859
all participants must disguise
themselves as monsters

130
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,897
and come dressed in formal
black suits and dresses...

132
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,564
Of course, anyone who comes as
company must do likewise.

134
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,599
Huh? Company?

135
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,869
You mean. you're going with him too?

136
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,973
Of course I'm not going to
such a monster-filled party!!

139
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,378
Ma. ha ..Oh, I guess so...

140
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,346
Oh, and...

141
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,979
Huh?

142
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,383
I have a favor to ask you. Doctor...

143
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,451
What is it?

144
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,321
If this invitation came: to. dad...

145
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,590
it could be that...

146
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,829
he got one to. so

147
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,099
h, yeah...
Shinichi too, you mean...

149
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,535
Yes...so could you check the mail box?

150
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,971
Unless you tell him about mail like these,

151
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,240
I'm sure he'll complain up later...

154
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,709
Oh, okay...

155
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,278
if it's here, I'll call you back...

156
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,849
Well, I don't think he got one, though...

158
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:28,720
Oh; and please keep
this a secret from Conan.

160
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,354
Huh?

161
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,590
Because every time
he goes to places like these,

163
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,159
he tends to stick his nose
into dangerous things...

165
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,129
Besides...

166
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,168
Besides. what?

168
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,504
Oh, yup...

169
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:50,442
and tell him that school will start soon
SO OO Ma € sure 0 comes ome...

171
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,378
Oh, and that he shouldn't go here
and there till then...

173
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,348
Yeah, okay...
I'll give him your message...

176
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:57,915
Yeah...

181
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:09,828
How's about it?!

182
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,531
This is a masterpiece
bearing marks of labor

184
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:13,799
and effort produced by Sonoko Suzuki!

185
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:19,004
I have this feeling that I don't look
much different from how I usually look...

187
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,572
What're you talking about

188
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,275
you don't want it to look too drastic,
do ou?.

190
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,845
Cover you wi eavy ma e-up
and goof. there'd be no way out!

192
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,113
Hmm -well.

193
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,815
That's true, but...

194
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,049
Fantastic!

195
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,352
You look really good. dad!

196
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,857
That amount of make-up is just enough
to bring out the good in you, Dad!

199
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,126
you think so?!

200
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,600
Oh, and Sonoko.

201
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,503
Did you decide what to go disguised as?

202
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,571
Of course

203
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,139
Of course

204
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,610
I'm going to go in a super cute mini skirt,
and knock the monsters out

206
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,646
Knock out monsters. my gosh

207
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,981
Well, who knows.

208
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,152
Maybe there'll be
super good-looking monsters?!

210
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,121
No way. no-chance...

211
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,356
So what!

212
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:16,628
I'll bet you're after some super
whopper body vampire

214
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,672
Whew

215
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,040
And?

216
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,277
Are you planning to board
the ghost ship too...

218
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:32,811
Yeah...

219
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,947
The sender's name
kind of bothers me so...

221
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,451
D.Do you have an idea of
who the sender us or something'?

223
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,351
No...

224
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,255
Aren't you the one who has an idea,

226
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,659
Because Vermouth, like Gin
and Vodka-arernames of liquor...

228
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,861
Beats me...

229
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,997
Never heard of it...

230
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,599
Besides: don't know much about liquor...

231
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,735
It's liquor from Italy...

232
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,505
Vermouth
is the English spelling...

235
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,408
In Japan it's called...

236
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,545
Belimot

237
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,926
Just as I thought...

238
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,362
It's written on your face
that the name sounds familiar...

240
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,029
Vanwauh.

241
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,832
prod
I guess it's the code name of
one of the men in Black...

244
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,769
T Then ou mean
that invitation card is from?!

246
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,469
Yeah...

247
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:36,308
an invitation from Bellmot
who is one of them.

249
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,678
I don't know if they're ready to take us on ,.-»-

250
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,947
or if they just got tired of waiting. but...

251
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,249
I can't pass up this opportunity...

252
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,216
Don't go...

253
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,053
Don't go!! Stop. I tell you!!

254
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,522
It's a trap and if you go you'll'be killed...

255
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:53,792
Cough, cough...

256
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,695
Yeah... it could be...

257
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,567
Then...
Then, why go?

259
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:05,704
- X SS

261
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,472
H. Hey.
Shinichi?!

264
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,507
You didn't have to do that...

265
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,846
Sorry. Al...

266
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,985
With things as they are...

267
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,788
I'm stuck
and can't move on...

269
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,364
B But

270
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,165
I wonder if it's okay for you
to leave Ail here

272
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,734
Iike this and leave just like that

273
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,904
Look. Doc...at the address

274
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,873
written on the envelope of the invitation
card that was delivered to my house...

277
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,611
The name Shinichi Kudo is written on
the envelope and invitation card but...

279
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,880
But the name on the letter
that was inside together

283
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,553
D.Dear Mr. Conan Edogawa?!
- 1. Sy

285
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,690
Hey. Shinichi! TT. Thus...

286
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,257
Hey. Shinichi! T. This...

287
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,159
Yeah...everything's out in the open...

288
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,229
My true identity.

289
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,699
The fact that my body shrunk
because of Apotoxin4869

291
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,367
as well as the fact that I'm Shinichi Kudo.

293
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,571
And they most probably...

294
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,993
also know that Al is the Sherry
who used to be one of them...

296
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,581
B.But. isn't it strange!

297
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:28,385
If they have that much information already
why aren't they here raiding us!

299
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,223
I don't know why...

301
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,861
but I have a hunch
about one of the causes...

304
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,112
but I have a hunch...
About one of the causes...

307
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:37,327
but I have a hunch...
About one of the causes...

309
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:38,997
- Wn,

310
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,532
Cough. cough, cough, cough!

311
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,269
H.Hey. .don't tell me that you caught
ARSECOIS

313
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,404
I.I'm fine Cough...

314
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,908
Hmm? What the .7?

315
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,711
The telephone?

316
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,612
Shh...

317
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,380
Huh?

318
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,717
Mail?...

319
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:07,292
Problem left is...

320
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,775
A Halloween... Party?

321
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,743
Yeah...

322
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:28,863
It's going to start
tomorrow night at 19:00...

324
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,615
B.But boss

325
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,034
why do I have to go to
a crazy place like that...?

327
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,653
Bellmott is in this.

328
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:36,321
Huh?

329
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,090
We've got orders to go check out
the internal affairs...

331
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:44,496
I was just about getting fed up with
that lady's secretiveness too...

333
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,231
I didn't get the go-sign. but who cares...

334
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,670
If she acts up. show no mercy...

335
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,677
Even if that broad's that man's favorite...

336
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,626
Strange...

337
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,597
It's strange after all...

338
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,134
Compared to when I came here
to check the mailbox,

340
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,038
although it's really slight, the water meter
s well as the gas meter has moved...

342
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,748
Somebody's...
inside...

344
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:47,125
I guess this is the best place
to watch Al and me from...

346
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,899
I know I can handle two men.

347
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,269
But what if there are more than three?

348
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,776
Cool head...

349
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,645
Judging from the meter...

350
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,515
the most that would be in here is
ne or two of them...

352
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:27,699
Besides...

353
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,334
Wow~~~what a full moon

354
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:07,672
Really, it's so appropriate for
A blood smeared party on board!

356
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,773
Il right

357
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,109
mm getting excited

358
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,311
Hmm--I'm feeling
aipositive turbulent rush of blood...

360
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,313
He . Pop's

361
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,848
isn't the Wolf Man the one
who feels a positive

363
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,416
turbulent rush of blood
when the full moon is out?

365
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,818
You're Dracula, you know, Pops

366
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,086
Quiet.

367
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,757
I'm saying that I'm getting a positive
turbulent rush of blood as a detective!

369
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:26,758
Uh, excuse me?

370
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,228
Are you two also going
to be attending the

372
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,398
Off season Halloween party too?

373
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,566
Right

374
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:39,337
I thought it was ridiculous
because it's a masquerade party. but...

376
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,339
Well, the thing is...

377
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,042
I'm going there too!

378
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,480
Ugyaaah "

379
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,366
I wonder if it's going to be okay...
Ieaving Ai like that by herself...

381
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,835
wonder if it's going to be okay...
Ieaving Ail like that by herself.

383
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,740
Yeah...

384
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,142
I left the room warm

385
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,546
I left food and water behind with her too,
so I don't think there'll be any problems...

387
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:29,053
I can't wait to play that new game
you were saying you invented. Doc!

389
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,855
Oh. do you want to try it?

390
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,396
Cough..cough...

391
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,843
The position-of-the-things-in the drawer
IS also slightly out of place...

393
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,414
Cough: cough, cough...

394
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,334
You looked for it...

395
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,055
all by yourself...

396
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,507
In order to confront them...

397
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,099
Wow , look at them!!!

398
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,268
Wolf Man

399
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,604
Franken and

400
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,539
the Mummy...

401
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,574
Wow!

402
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,910
Even Kyonshi
IS here!

404
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,379
It's full of monsters!

405
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,348
Really, how exciting

406
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,085
Are you sure it's okay for the daughter
of the Suzuki Financial Group

408
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,187
to be mixed up among guys like this...?

409
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,122
No big deal. no big thing!

410
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,059
Unlike Ran,
I kind of like stuff like this!

412
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,127
By the way. Sonoko?

413
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,262
Just what are you disguised as?

414
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:48,599
How rude! I'm a witch, a witch!!

415
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,035
Don't you see that I've got a broom?

416
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:51,702
Ay May Sue

417
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,740
Ugah, ugah, ugah...

418
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,406
What?

419
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:58,543
Ugah, ugah...

420
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,144
Ugah. ugah. ugah...

421
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,945
W. What's with him...

422
00:18:02,013 --> 00:18:02,613
Huh?

423
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,115
Hey. Pops?

424
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:04,549
Huh?

425
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,785
Maybe he's saying move over
because the front seats are open?

427
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,654
Ugahugah.

428
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:10,588
Darn.

429
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,991
Then why don't you say
so in a way I understand.

431
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,528
He's just really trying to be
the character that he's disguised as...

433
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:18,463
Huh?

435
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,867
My. my. what a beautiful witch you are...

436
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,435
Thank you...

437
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:26,704
Huh?

438
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,041
Not a witch...

439
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,143
MM Medusa?!

440
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,845
I'll turn you into stone. you know.

441
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,680
Aha, ha...

442
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,316
Will the next person show us
your invi a ion car

446
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,285
sure, sure...

448
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,757
You're the famous Detective
Kogoro Mouri, aren't you?

450
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,726
Oh? So. you saw through my disguise?

451
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,264
Your name's written
on the invitation card, see?

453
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,967
Then, please fill in your name...

454
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,168
uh? Yeah...

455
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:02,540
Mo ~~~uri.

456
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,941
By the way...

457
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:08,379
I hope you're not planning to
really commit a murder here, are you?

459
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,347
Huh 72

460
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,850
Well, together with this invitation card
there was a letter hinting

462
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,986
that a crime may be committed here!

463
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:15,920
See.

464
00:19:17,388 --> 00:19:20,758
It's true that this invitation card is
what we made,

466
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,228
but I know nothing of this letter
or the envelope...

468
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:25,730
Huh? Really?

469
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:30,201
There will be a "guess who the criminal is
game played during the party though...

471
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,070
Maybe the producer decided
to play a prank thinking

473
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:36,374
that a mere invitation card would not be
enough to get you to come here...

475
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,909
Producer?

476
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:40,645
Oh, no. it's nothing...

477
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,848
But, we're sure that you'll enjoy
the cursed banquet.

479
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,249
Come on, Pops!

480
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,551
Let's hurry and go!

481
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,220
Oh. Hey. you!

482
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,524
Next guest please!

483
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,396
Your invitation card. please...

484
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:01,966
Huh?

485
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:06,704
\ Oh...

486
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,995
A. Aren't you, by chance
the high school detective...

489
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,007
Thank you.

490
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,078
But, they sure got a lot of them
gathered here...

492
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,045
You can say that again...

494
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:48,646
Huh

495
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,654
It's finally going to start.

496
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,320
Yeah...

497
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,258
Ooooh

498
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,695
You devilish diabolic monsters
who wander through the nether world

500
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:10,184
thank you all for coming...

502
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:15,940
I am Captain Goldy/
and I will be navigatig this ght ship...

505
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,010
It's only an hour more to go
before the party...

507
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,947
First of all, please pick your comrades
who will be sharing fate with you.

509
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:28,152
7 comrades who have received
the same seal as yourself...

511
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,887
The same seal?

512
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,389
The tarot card!

513
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,058
You got one too, didn't you when you,
came on board?

515
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,395
I think we're going to team up
with people who got the same card

517
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,597
and play a game or something.

519
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:42,366
NS S 1 >
ou mean us 1a SS Wii en ere,

521
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,135
You mean this XV that's written here.

522
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,502
You mean this XVathat's written here.

523
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,504
Jeph!

524
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,174
Which means we're on the goat team...

525
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,776
That's not a goat!

526
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:55,079
In Roman Numerals XV is the figure 15...

527
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,781
The name of the card is DEVIL...

528
00:21:58,215 --> 00:21:59,784
The card of the devil...

529
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,585
Oh. is that right...

530
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,057
Besides, we weren't divided
In groups just to play a game...

532
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:06,557
Huh?

533
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,594
This party is also an audition
for a role in a movie too...

535
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,396
An audition?

536
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,931
You know, don't you?

537
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,649
The movie that's played
every summer called

539
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,769
of «VV e\re
The Diary of the Voyage
of a Phantom Ship Captain.

542
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,537
Yeah...

543
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,540
the one about a load of monsters
riding a ghost ship

545
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,077
and coming to get people
who performed evil deeds...

547
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,714
Which means if things work out,
I may appear in the movie too?

549
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:30,448
Yes...

550
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,118
This seems to be the fourth time
this party's been held,

552
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:38,122
and each year the movie staff seem
to be mixed among everyone here.

554
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,857
To judge carefully for the cast...

555
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,058
May May May

556
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,527
I see...

557
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,197
Everyone wants to play,
the part of popular monster roles,

559
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,467
so they divide people into teams
to make choosing easier ¥

561
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,903
That's why everyone's trying
to put out their best. right #

563
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,474
The Wolf Man who roars
towards the moon...

565
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,312
The Franken monster that moves
Iike a robot and does pantomime...

567
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,583
The Mummy who keeps to saying
nothing no matter who talks to him...

569
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:08,452
Well, although they're 'going
to appear in the:movie,

571
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:10,087
they're no more than supporting.actors

572
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,839
who will appear behind
the starring monsters...

574
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,725
Since it'll cost an enormous
amount of money

576
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,527
if the film company has to
cover make-up fees

578
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,562
and everything for
all the supporting actors,

580
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:23,634
they let horror fans appear in their
best outfits and put on their best act...

582
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:29,140
Besides holding an event on the this:ship
that is also used in the movie

584
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,575
will-serve as advertisement of
the movie too...

587
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,355
All right all-ofiyou!
The time to set sail has come!

589
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:46,490
We shall cross the 7 cursed seas

590
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:52,863
and show the conceited humans our
power as well as teach them aidlesson!!

592
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:53,981
Qooooh

594
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,150
WINS)

595
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,368
Oooooh "

596
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,269
Huh?

597
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,939
Don't tell me this ship's really
going to move?

599
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,981
Is there anyone who has
the card of Death?

601
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,752
Hermit! Anybody around
who has the card of the Hermit?

603
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,694
What? Shinichi Kudo?!

604
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,831
You mean that high school
detective is on this ship?

606
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,499
Right. right!

607
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,103
But, I heard that he got mixed up
in some kind of incident and was killed...

609
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,272
No way! That's nothing but baloney!

610
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:39,143
And? And?
What kind of disguise was he in?

612
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,146
He was bandaged up,
so maybe a mummy?

614
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,514
A mummy detective...

615
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,387
Okay!

616
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,191
All seven of us are here!

617
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:57,027
Wow! They're the people
we saw just'a while ago...

619
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,964
So. this is Medusa...

620
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,735
Wolf Man. Franken. and Mummy.

621
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:09,906
And. uh...and can we call you Mummy 27

622
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,046
What?. #
Do you want to shake hands?

624
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,853
Whaa!

625
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,957
See~~~You're Invisible Man...

626
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,526
So...l wonder what seven
of us are going to do?

628
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,000
They:did say that this was
a~catch the culprit sort of game...

631
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,977
How do you like the
game I made this time?

633
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,579
It's. pretty cool. don't you think?

634
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,781
Yeah...It's a masterpiece

636
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,616
Right! Right!

637
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,419
Yes, Agasa residence...
I'm sure this'll satisfy them.don*ttyou?

639
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,921
I'm sorry for calling so late.
Oh... I call them first thingtomorrow

641
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:57,688
This 1s Nude...

642
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,757
Uh...is Dr. Agasarthere?
And have them monitor it!

644
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:00,958
He's not in.

645
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:04,361
I think he went out somewhere with Conan.
They were looking forward to it after all!

648
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,164
uh?2?But I hear their voice
Dont!

650
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,267
Oh, this? It's their taped voices.
Ail still has a cold!

652
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,570
I don't know what prank they're up to but...
You don't want them to catch it, do you?

654
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,474
It's been playing for some time now...

655
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:18,242
So. what's up?

656
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,843
So. what's up?

657
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,411
Oh eah...

659
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,345
Oh eah...

660
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:28,786
Well, your coldes taking
a while to get better, right?

662
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:33,607
Sol figured you should be checked
at a hospital with good facilities.

664
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,858
And asked a friend doctor of mine

665
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,096
but was told that he has to
go on a business trip.

667
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,197
Soghe's
only available tonight...

671
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:45,636
I know this is really sudden,
but can I go pick you up-now?

673
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,473
I'll notify Dr. Agasa later for you...

674
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,910
Well. I don't want to force you though.

675
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,713
It doesn't bother me...

676
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,682
I was kind of angry anyway
because they re doing their own thing.

678
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,452
It's boring staying home alone, besides...

679
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,254
Great...

680
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,640
Then. okay...

681
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,159
I'll be there in about an hour

682
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,329
so will you get ready to leave
as soon as I get there?

684
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,130
Okay...

685
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,765
