00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,850
Kaiho High School team captain,

29
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:31,450

00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,521
Eh.2?! That's not Heiji!

33
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:37,857
Isn't that him over there?

34
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,862
Over there... surrounded by all those girls
and talking up a storm...

36
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:44,730
Hey, Haijil!

37
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,799
What the heck are you doing,
goofing off over here for!!

40
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,534
The match has already started!

41
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,368
You've\got to hurry!

42
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,103
You're pale...

43
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:52,638
Huh?

44
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,774
Uh. hello...

45
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,576
I know you, you're a sophomore,
aren't you?!

47
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,979
Heiji asked to cover for him.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,582
He said that we probably wouldn't need him
until the semi-finals

50
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,652
so he told me to put his gear-on
and just intimidate the other team

52
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,089
But Heiji's so popular
so all the girls flock around me

54
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,391
when they see his name on the uniform

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,327
So where did Hey go?

56
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,463
I think he-went to the toilet

00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,999

65
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,037
To get to the
Naniwa Chuo Gymnasium,

67
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,841
take the bus headed for Tojir
and get off at the 7th stop.

69
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:31,911
If you don't know which bus, ask the dr -r.

70
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,980
Ask them which gymnasium is holding
the Kinki Kendo Competition that

72
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,451
Heiji Hattori's competing in. they'll know!

73
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,653
Yeah okay. I. got it.

74
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,390
I'm not a little kid,
you don't have to keep reminding me!

76
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,791
Oh, sorry

77
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,327
You look like a little kid so I forget...

78
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,397
Just don't call me anymore!

79
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm havingta hard time getting away
from-Ranyand the old man!

81
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,969
And another thing. we're going to Osaka

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,573
cause you invited us to a tetchiri dinner
since we didn't get to eat it the last time

84
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,441
or the time before that at your place....!

85
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,311
The only reason we're going to
watch you compete'is. it's on the same day!

87
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,847
You always give me the cold treatment.

91
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,183
By the way,
this bullet train just left the station

94
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,786
sO it'll be past 2-00 when we get there...!

95
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,588
Won't your match.be over by then?

96
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,389
Don't worry about it!

97
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,325
The semi-finals don't start until 2:00pm.!

98
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,193
You'll make it in time for the finals!

99
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:22,661
Oh. 4 okay...

100
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,463
So I'll be waiting to see you!

101
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,233
Kazuha?!

102
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,968
What are you doing in there?

103
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,036
That's what I'd like to ask you!

104
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,371
This"is the men's toilet. you know!

105
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,307
Oh really. I didn't notice that!

106
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:39,712
I thought it was a hiding place for cowards
who didn't want to compete.

108
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,914
I'm planning my moves!

109
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,250
So-that I can beat that guy in the finals!

110
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,720
B that-guy. are you talking about
that-guy that looks just like Kudo...?

113
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,123
That's right! Okita
from Senshin High School in Kyoto.

115
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,725
Last year, he got me with jabs to the neck,

116
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,795
I'm going to pay him back
for this scar behind my ear!

118
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,600
Just because he beat you before,
don't you think you're being kind of snea ?

120
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,569
Don't be stupid! He didn't beat me!

121
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,438
I got cut on the neck
when I dod - ed the 'ab,

123
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,842
and when it wouldn't stop bleeding,
t @ doctor stopped the match.

125
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,245
Besides, the guy skipped
the first and second match,

127
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,248
he was sleeping behind the gym
and then he took me on!

129
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,850
You-don't have to worry about him,
you can: beat him!

131
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,319
You brought your luc « charm. didn't you?

132
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:24,056
That's not the only reason I skipped
the first and second matches though...

134
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:31,397
Truth is...it's my right hand...
remember what happened on Bikuni Island...

136
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,703
It's so itchy, it's driving me crazy!
I can't concentrate on the match!

138
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,773
Oh. 1s that so? Fine!

139
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,376
I'm going to have a talk with your mother.

140
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,312
And have herbeat
some heart and soul into you!

142
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:47,846
Mom's here?

143
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:48,781
Hey, Kazuha. wait!

144
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,915
What's the matter with you?!
You idiot!!

146
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,653
O.--that wasn't me...

147
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,523
Did you say you can't compete because
yourhave-azhangover?!

149
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,790
I couldn't help it.

I'll tell everybody about you know what...

179
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,515
What did you say?!

180
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,850
Unlike the rest of you
who allthave jobs waiting,

182
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,920
Irve got nothing to lose!

183
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,256
I don't know what you're talking about,
but...

185
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:33,891
if you don't want to compete, then
we'll just have to send in one of the seniors

187
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:36,061
although they aren't as good as you.

188
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:36,562
We can't have the whole team
be embarrassed just because of you

For a guy who stole another guy's girlfriend,
you sure talk big!!

197
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,037
You're a fool...

198
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,708
she made up her own mind to leave you.
I didn't steal her away.

200
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,312
Listen you, I think you'd better sober up
and start thinking about

202
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,348
how to get rid of that chip on your shoulder,

203
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,451
and what you're going to do
with the rest of your life

Yeah, okay...

208
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,606
Chest jab, point!!

209
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,474
Yes!! Good move!!

210
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,611
Hey. I can't find Tarumi anywhere!

211
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,980
Maybe he went home?

212
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,684
You guys go look around there.

213
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,085
Okay

214
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,358
Hey! Why aren't you paying attention
to the match!!!

216
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:40,826

How horrible!!

235
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,752
Somebody, get an ambulance!

236
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,555
@kay., I'll go call for the ambulance!

237
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,424
@Omotani, you go to the police box
and get the police!!

239
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,929
Then I'll go back to the gym
and tell Hakamata about this...

241
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,331
Okay! Go quick and bring him back here!!

242
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,466
Okay!

243
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,003
Yahoo! We're in the best 41!

244
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,072
I think wescan win the championship!

245
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,675
Ta, Tarumi's deads...?! Are you sure!

246
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:33,678
Pretty sure... couldn't tell if he was
breathing but 'he was covered with blood!

248
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,413
Where is he?

249
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,615
Who the heck are you?

250
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,284
I asked you where he is!!

251
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,063
What is this? There's nothingOin here...

252
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:58,270
That's strange...we found him-here,
Ieaning against this vaulting horse...

254
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,740
What kind of doll is this?

255
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,010
I think it's a doll you use to practice
Iife saving techniques on.

257
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:08,614
Yes...you know,
Iike mouth to mouth resuscitation...

259
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,351
Are you sure
you didn't mistake this doll for your friend?

261
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,819
That's ridiculous... .!

262
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,555

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,626
The ambulance will-be here
inf about 10-minutes.

265
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,928
FWe. can't find Tarumi!

266
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,529
Hat did you say...?!

267
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,003
You don't think
Tarumi pulled a:fast one on us, do you?

269
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:31,870
What?!

270
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,940
Let's split up and look for Tarumi!

271
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,076
If this is some kind of joke,
I'm going tot ach him a lesson!!!

273
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,545
Excuse me...

274
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,880
Are you from Shinnai THiversity?

275
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,283
Yeah, that's right, what is it...?

276
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:49,555
A call-just camesin to the recept on desk
from a strange man

278
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,560
he said to tell the guys from Shinnai
University who are in the storage room now,

280
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,463
to go to the locker room beside the pool

281
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,064
It's got to be Tarumi...!

282
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,266
That sneak!

283
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,202
Let's go check it out.

284
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,738
Shower room

285
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,418
Ta. Trarumi...

286
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,885
Is this for real?!

287
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,956
He's really dead...

288
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,594
I don't believe it...

289
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,707
The body in the storage room

290
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,110
IS moved to the locker room beside
the pool while no one is watching...

292
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,513
Dees that mean someone moved it?

293
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,551
But if you were: carrying
a body as bloody as that,

295
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,819
someones, bound to notice...

296
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,789
there's -a team from some school
sitting around the doorway

298
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,758
in the annex having their lunch...

299
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,426
So how in the world...??

300
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,763
Hey. Heij!

301
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,299
What're you doing?
You haven-t even eaten your lunch!

303
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,835
There's less than an hour left
before-the semi-finals?

305
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,303
Shut up!

306
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:15,307
I'm on a case! There's been a murder
in the locker room over there!!

308
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,175
Are you serious.e

309
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,646
But I don't understand something
sO ll can't concentrate on the match!

311
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,615
Then maybe you should ask Kudo for advice

312
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,284
Are they coming here, aren't they?

313
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,754
That's right, Kudo\. .!
I'll just give him a call...

315
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,990
Kudo would be able to solve the case
\in-no-time.

317
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,759
You don't have to-lose any sleep over it!

318
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:39,565
Let Kudo handle the investigation,
you get back to the match. come on!

320
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,633
Listen. Kazuhar!

321
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,435
Don't you dare tell Kudo abéut the murder!

322
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,370
Don't forget what I said!

323
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,672
Heiji?!

324
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,109
Kudo won't get here for
another hour and a half .!

326
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,711
I've got to solve this case by then!!

327
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,153
You've got rice on yourself again...

328
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,156
Murder case?!

329
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,825
Then you mean, Hattori's...

330
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,829
That's right!
He said he doesn't have time to compete,

332
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,698
he's running around looking for clues!

333
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,299
What're we going to do?!

334
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,368
The semi-finals are going to start already!!

335
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,836
We don't-have a choice

336
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,772
we've got tq take the championship
without-that Heiji.

338
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,044
Then we'll break that darn
mystery fool's nose in half!

340
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,649
Excuse fine. . .we1'relthe ones 14
who're going to be in the match...

342
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,957
You're positive he's one of your team mates?

343
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,427
Yes, thatgs right... his name's Tarumi.)
we re classmates at the same university.

345
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,297
The killer must have put him
under the hot shower

347
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,166
to mask the time, of death...

348
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:53,305
oh well, it's plain to see that
the murder Weapon is this sword.

350
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,642
As soon as we find. out who it belongs to,
we.ll have the killer...

352
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,044
You're wrong-about that, Inspector Otaki.

353
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,015
The fast draw instructor
brought it to the competition

355
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:05,683
because he was going to put
on a demonstration using areal sword...

357
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,654
somebody probably saw it left
in the dressing room,

359
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,957
stole it and used it to commit the murder.

360
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,092
Heiji, what're you doing here?

361
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,962
Can't you tell by looking at me?
I'm competing!

363
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,431
Oh, today's the day of the big competition

364
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,167
between Kinki's high school
and college teams...

366
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,303
so do you have any idea
who stole this sword?

368
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,371
Sort of.

369
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,106
The killer's somebody who comes
to this competition a lot

371
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,376
and knows about
the fast draw demonstration,

373
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,046
that person alse knows
the layout of the place,

375
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,515
the gym. the annex and the locker room

376
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,686
Which means,
the killer is somebody just like you guys!

378
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,955
I understand the part about having to know

379
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,291
about the demonstration
and stealing the Sword

381
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,560
but what does knowing about the gym
and annex and locker room

383
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,095
have to do with-anything?

384
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,698
Because if the killer didn't know
the locations of these places,

386
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,832
it wouldn't be possible to move Mr. Tarumi
from the annex to this locker room

388
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,901
without being seen.

389
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,303
What bothers me is,
not why he was moved but how...

391
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,641
Because when it happened,
there was a group of people

393
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,976
sitting in front of the annex
eating their lunch,

395
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,713
it would've been impossible for them
not to notice

397
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,449
a man covered with blood
being carried out...

399
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,954
unless of course, after you guys
found Mr. Tarumi in the storage room

401
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:21,827
the last one to leave the place
very cleverly managed to carry him out...

403
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,096
Doryou guys rememben what:happened?

404
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,566
The first one to leave was Kotegawa here...

405
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,703
He:;said "he was going to call an ambulance

406
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,371
Then I left!

407
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,241
Kotegawa told me to go to
the police box-and get the police...

409
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:41,747
So than means. Mr. Doguchu.
You were the last to leave, weren't you!

411
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:47,285
But I left right away to get Hakamata
who was in the gym.

413
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,087
How do I know you'rexnot lying?

415
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,089
I said Irwas going. didn't. 1?

416
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,757
Tow Ye
Yeah...

418
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,361
Besides, Doguchi wasn't the last one
to leave, it was me!

420
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,229
What?! »

421
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,432
I knew we needed the ambulance
as soon as possible

423
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,502
so when I saw a group of high school
students hanging around the entrance,

425
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,703
I borrowed their cell phone.

426
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:09,975
But the person I was talking to asked me to
describe the injured person's condition

428
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:13,245
so I went back and described
Tarumi's condition

430
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,781
of course, there was nobody else around.

431
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,617
As soon as I was finished,

432
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:22,687
I went back to return the cell jphone
then I headed for the police box.

434
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,823
Is that the truth?

435
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,425
Yes it is, he came to the police box!

436
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:30,695
I'm not good at explaining things
so I was relieved he came.

438
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,832
And how long did it take to go from the annex

439
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,567
to the police box then back again ;,

440
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,570
There's a big intersection
in front of the police box

442
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,039
and we:got stuck at the light...

443
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,708
I think it took about 14 to 15 minutes.

444
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,710
Didryou say 14 to 15-minutes?

445
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,512
Don't you think that's strange. Mr. Doguchi?

446
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:53,151
Mr..Omotani and Mr. Kotegawa came back
with the police right after we arrived

448
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,021
The gym is-right by the annex,

449
00:15:56,022 --> 00:16:01,359
don't you think it took an unusually long time
to get Mr. Hakamata

451
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,229
He probably had a hard time finding me.

452
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,967
The place was filled with guys
wearing the-saméikind of outfits.

454
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:14,573
This means,
you also had some unaccounted time!

456
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:19,778
I don:t"Care if youssuspect us
but can you tell me-one-thing first?

458
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,582
Explain how you can get Tarumi,
who was in that condition,

460
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:27,085
out of the storage room in the annex
into the locker room without being seen?

462
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,687
Yeah. that's right!

463
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,490
If you can't explain that,
then you can't prove we're guilty!

465
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,759
Don't make up stories.

466
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,797
Well Detective, we're going to see
Tarumi's mother

468
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,432
and téll 'her what happened today...

469
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,636
Hey Hakamata, you're the only one
without a sash, why's that...?

471
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,441
"Thought I brought it with me
but I guess I lost it.

473
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,077
Oh well; it looks like we're going to
forfeit the match

475
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,845
so I guess I won't be needing it anyway...

476
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,085
Speaking of match, Heij,
how did you do today?

478
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,953
Didryou win? Or did you lose...?

479
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:05,490
Heiji...?

480
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,427
Hit on the forearm, 1 point!!

481
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,963
Way. to go! We scored!!!

482
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,166
All we"vefgot to do is hang in there
until it's time and then we're in the finals!'!

484
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,903
Hat's right We don't need Hey
to win the championship!

486
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,442
Tihrnustito. the neck, 1 point!

487
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,779
4 to 1, the match goes to
Kyoto Senshin High School!!

489
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,348
Kyoto Senshin High School...?!

490
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:32,617
It's Okita. just like Heiji said...!

491
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,352
This is not good!

492
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,022
Without Heiji. we don't stand a chance....!!

493
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,732
The windows behind the annex don't open

494
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,035
and the ones in the front are too noticeable...

495
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,171
The front door is only,way...

496
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,143
But te carry him to the locker room
beside the pool

498
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:03,014
I'd have to pass the-front of the gym
where there were a'lot of people....!

500
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:04,883
It's impossible...!

501
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:10,021
Somebody's bound to notice a man
covered with blood being carried past them!

503
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,493
Kudo's going to be here
in less than 10 minutes...!

505
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,630
Hey you! Wait up!

506
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:24,102
You just came out of the annex, didn't you!
What were you doing?

508
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,237
I only went to the toilet.

509
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,642
Sorry but there's something
I want to ask you!

511
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,977
What is it?.

512
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,613
Before Mr. Tarumi was killed,
I heard him say

514
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,149
I'll tell everybody about you know what

515
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,085
what was that about?

516
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,688
How would I know...! I don't know anything!!

517
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,357
All ri htth n

518
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:49,560
is the girl Mr. Tarumi and Mr. Hakamata
were fightihg about here today?

520
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,896
Of course not!

521
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:56,233
After that incident,
Haori quit managing the kendo team!

523
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,037
That incident? What do you mean?

524
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,339
Did you see Okita's thrust?

526
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,641
Yeah. you can kill somebody with that one.

527
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,845
Hey. come back!

528
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,882
Hey? That's the guy...

529
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,352
He's running again like he was
when we were eating lunch.

531
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:14,886
What?

532
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:19,891
Where you guys eating lunch
around the door to the annex?

534
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,693
Yeah, that was us.

535
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:25,697
There were 3 weird college students,
they asked to borrow a cell phone,

537
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:29,300
and then they brought the police
and other people, it was a circus.

539
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,237
All right then,
after those 3 left the annex.

541
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,372
Did any suspicious person go in there?

542
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,707
Yeah, there was one guy!

543
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:36,841
You!

544
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,110
Dummy! Before me!

545
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,012
There was one suspicious guy
that came out of the annex.

547
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:42,547
What?!

548
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,550
He was cagrying somebody else's
gear in a bag.

550
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,752
How could you tell it wasn't his?

551
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,154
That was easy!

552
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,891
He was carrying the bag while he was
wearing his mask and protective gear.

554
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,960
So that's how he did it, a gear bag...!

555
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,497
If you put the body in there and carried it out,
nobody would get suspicious...!

557
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,367
Mr Hakamata's the only one
would could've done it...!

559
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,504
He killed Mr. Tammi beforehand and
hid the body in the storage room,

561
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,442
and while he has the others
Iooking for Mr. Tarumi,

563
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:15,113
he goes back to the storage room and after
the other three find the body and go for help,

565
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:19,751
he puts Mr. Tarumi in the gear bag and
sneaks toward the locker room...

567
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,220
No, that's not possible...!

568
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,622
Even if you were hiding in that storage room

569
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,558
there's no guarantee
somebody would look in there

571
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,360
besides, it was just coincidence that
all three of them left the storage room

573
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,031
If someone decided to remain,
then he wouldn't be able to come out...

575
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:33,765
Hey!

576
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:38,303
You better watch yourself kid or
you're going to be in a whole lot of trouble.

578
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,239
I hear you've been asking about Haori too.

579
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,974
You «already told him?

580
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,977
Of course-he-did!
Doguchi and me go way back...

582
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:49,214
whenever"-he.:s-in-trouble.
He always comes to tell.me,

584
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,815
we made a pact when we wereilittle kids.

585
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,219
You're way off course
suspecting him though...

587
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,489
he's a coward,
he can't stand the sight of blood.

589
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,356
What?

590
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,893
Listen carefully!
Don't be a pest!

592
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:08,633
Hello?

593
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,301
Hattori, it's me!

594
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:14,038
Kudo it's you...where are you? On the bus?

595
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,643
No. old man Kogoro didn't want to
wait for the bus so we got on a cab.

597
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,812
Oh, all right, take your time!

598
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,014
In fact, why don't you get off and
have a bowl! of noodles or something,

600
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,017
maybe even walk around
and do some sightseeing!

602
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:26,951
Don't be stupid

603
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:30,622
we already told the driver where to go,
we're on our way there.

605
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,759
By the way, you're in the finals, aren't you?

606
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,496
Hey Hattori... you there?

607
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:44,903
Hey guys! Do you know about the life
saving dolls in the storage room?

609
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,540
Sure, because we came here
a lot to practice...

611
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,575
How many dolls do they have in there?

612
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,977
Two...one skinny one and one big one

613
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,045
That's it!!

614
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,885
Isn't he Hattori from Kaiho High?

615
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,155
What's he doing here?
The finals are starting already...

617
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,029
If my theory's right,
it should be here...!

619
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,832
It should still be here
in this storage room...

621
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,241
I knew it...! This is what the killer
used to move the body...!

623
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,780
Heiji! Heiji, where are you!

624
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,983
That fool! Where the heck is he?

625
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,285
Kazuhal

626
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,987
We're here to root for Heiji!

627
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,188
Ran!

628
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,158
Is HattorPs-team in the finals'?

629
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:45,096
Yes! And it's starting soon
but Heiji*s gone,off somewhere

632
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:50,568
I just: knowshe's running,around trying
to solve the murder that just happened

634
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,105
MM. murder. 2?
