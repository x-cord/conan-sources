1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:02,468
Suspense and deduction closes the gap

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,170
between the love and hatred
between two people

4
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:04,871
A surprising island secret

7
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:05,104
A surprising island secret

9
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:05,972
A surprising island secret

10
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,907
The battle of deduction ends in a twist

11
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,308
He sees through the one and only truth

12
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,277
a child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

14
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,279
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

16
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:50,109
A television program pitting ithe best

17
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,144
detectives from the
East and Westibring:us

19
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,614
along with Heiji Hattor:,
here to Okinawan

21
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,250
We accompany the filming crew to
an uninhabited island

23
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:02,888
where an unidentified body and
a mysterious message found,

25
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,491
the) a famaliO member of the film crew.

26
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,126
Le Taira. is murdered and

27
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,996
a mysterious message Is
found near her body

29
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:10,930
I'm the Gusds messenger
a mysterious message Is
found near her body

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:16,668
then the boat we came on
and the captain disappears!

34
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,739
Having no other choice,
we wait for someone to come rescue us

36
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,406
at the village head's villa
that is on the island...

38
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,412
What was that sound of the?

39
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,281
M.Maybe it's

40
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:29,882
M.Maybe it's...

41
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,619
Wow, it's the rescue ship after all!

42
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,554
Saved!

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,624
Something's wrong with that ship!

44
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,426
Yeah, there are no lights on either...

45
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,695
And the way the ship is a
nchored is messed up...

47
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,337
I'm the Guso's messenger

48
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:01,280
PRINCESS OF THE ISLAND AND THE
OF OF THE DRAGON KING PART IN

50
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,617
Hey. hey. it's already 5 in the morning

51
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,386
No wonder I'm starved

52
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,289
I haven't eaten a thing for half a day

53
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,426
Yeah. I'm thirsty too

54
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,896
Shall we go get something
for you from the kitchen?

56
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,566
There may be non-perishable food
or canned juice

58
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,400
I guess so.

59
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,474
Are they going to be okay,
just those two girls?

61
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,609
They'll be fine

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,212
I hear they re pretty strong. those two

64
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,550
there we go!

65
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,418
Rice crackers and fried dough cookies!

66
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,822
But won't eating things like that
make you even more thirsty?

68
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,890
But, it's better than
not having anything to eat, isn't it?

70
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,627
What was that sound.

71
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,129
I wonder .

72
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,164
It sounded like water dripping though

73
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,535
Oh no!

74
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,138
It's coming this way!

75
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,008
D.Don't tell me that .

76
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,480
It. It's the Guso's messenger

77
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,951
What're you two doing?

78
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,822
What're you two holding knives
with your mouth like that?

80
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,491
H.Hew.

81
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,562
We thought you were the Guso's messenger

82
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,332
You know, the one that
Mr. Daito was telling US about?

84
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,869
If you don't want it to suck your soul out
hold a knife in your mouth

86
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:31,937
But. what's with you Heiji?

87
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,672
How come you're all wet?

88
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,074
Oh, you mean this?

89
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,744
Heiji dove into the ocean after that,

91
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:42,681
Because he thought that if the killer
threw our things away at the wharf,

93
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,218
his bag with his cell phone
inside it would be stuck

95
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,088
on some coral around the area!

96
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,223
And. did you find your bag?

97
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,426
It seems to have drifted
into the lake...

99
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:55,861
Kachan" it says...

100
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:56,896
Kachan
Kachan" it says...

102
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:57,663
Kachan

103
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,364
Kachan
What?

105
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:58,764
What?

106
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,834
On the chair over here
the word "choinii is written!

108
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:09,641
Hey, maybe kachan refers to
the maid, Kako Matsumoto?

110
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:10,843
I see.

111
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:13,712
KA" is taken from her first name

112
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,116
If she's a maid, it's only natural that she'd
spend most of her time in the kitchen

114
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,254
Then, what about this choinii?

115
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,523
Huh, there's a faded writing over here.

116
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:29,328
It seems "Choinii was written
over what was originally written here.

118
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,197
It's faded and hard to read.

119
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,132
But I think it's weatherfish

120
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,469
Which mean that
the picture that was drawn

122
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,705
on the door below
chiyonii was weatherfish.

124
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,042
But, Chiyonii and weatherfish
have no connection whatsoever!

126
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,578
If the drawingOunder the word "kachan
IS a Crow means karasu in Japanese,

128
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,246
then they are more or less connected

129
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,316
Because when they crow it sounds like
they're saying "ka-ka."

131
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,250
Karasu...

132
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:55,287
But, Maybe that picture is
ust something that the girldrew By

134
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,623
Iooking at the picture on
the folding screen

136
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,891
Then, that's a white heron?

137
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,927
White heron?

138
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,232
The directo was saying a while ago

139
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,168
that a white heron was drawnscreen

140
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,503
that was stolen from the mayor
4 years ago.

142
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,439
It seems to be of'Nationa) Treasure
class and is said to be worth 2 billion

144
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,510
Bird... white hero..weatherfish...

145
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,247
With all these clues
out in the open, no King.

147
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,048
Â¢ Tiger symboli-res Osaka...

148
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,717
Eagle. FM "fika.

149
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,252
And Carp Hir shi 7a .

150
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,788
Sea bream and flatfish would be
the Dragon King's Castle

152
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,857
The Dragon King's Castle?

153
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,192
That's it!

154
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,566
I think something's strange
about Conan after all.

156
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,569
Are you sure he's not
Iying about his age?

158
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,571
I don't think he Is...

159
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,907
Kazuha. what did you just say?

160
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,975
Huh?

161
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,044
I asked you what did you just say?

162
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,446
M.Maybe...he's...lying?

163
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,284
H.Heiji?

164
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,285
Conan?

165
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,691
The time now is 10 to 6 I the morning.

166
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:09,762
More than 12 hours have past
since Ms Taira's bee found!

168
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,399
If our deduction is correct,
it should still be here"

170
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,567
Yeah...it should still be there!

171
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,141
It. it's nowhere.

172
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,811
I wonder of the killer got rid of it after all!

173
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,547
No. we overlooked it...

174
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:33,419
'hese little footprints of mine

175
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,955
Then, that's a trick after all.

176
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,692
Yeah... we were completely deceived.

177
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,760
But, what re we going to do?

178
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,229
We figured out the killer
but have no evidence.

180
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,032
Iff we got nothing.
We just gotta: come up with something

182
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:51,036
By luring him out to this forest
that the princess lies asleep In.

185
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:55,507
Yeah...although that princess
may already be crying.

188
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,549
"Heap!

189
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,416
Conan!

190
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,885
Really, where are they anyway?

191
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,620
The nerve making us worry like this!

192
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,424
Oh well. all's well since we found out

193
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,760
F.Found out what...

194
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,161
Don't tell me...

195
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,765
Right...the trick that the killer used

196
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:23,602
As well as the fact that the
killer stayed near us all this time

198
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,971
but was playing against us!

199
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:31,210
What?
You mean the killer is among Us?

201
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,146
Who is it?
Tell us who, quick!

203
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,880
Not just yet

204
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:41,687
We'll decide who it is after listening to
what everybody has to say...

206
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,323
First of all, Mr. Kume...

207
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,126
Let's start from you.

208
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:51,797
It's going to be really short,
so bear with me a while, okay

210
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,870
Will the rest of you who are
waiting decide the order in which

212
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,205
you want to be asked...

213
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,549
Hey. what's taking them so long?

214
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,284
They've already been in there
for about 30 minutes

216
00:09:13,285 --> 00:09:14,887
I'm sure they)" becoming out soon

217
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,289
After all, he did say
It was going to be really simple.

219
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,426
Hey. hold it

220
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,327
Hew?

221
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,731
Hey. what's up?

222
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,332
Nothing's up! He ran away!

223
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:32,404
R,Ran away...
which means he's the killer, after all

225
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,474
It's because you made that
sarcastic remark, Heiji

227
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,276
You didn't have to say,

228
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,279
If I have to wait for you to talk
I'll turn into Taro Urashima.

230
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,681
I didn't have a choice,

231
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,950
I since he refused to talk
no matter what I asked him did .

233
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,452
Let's split up and fine Mr. Kume

234
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,423
If he commited suicide going into
the ocean, it wouldn't be right.

236
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,427
Hey, Kume!

237
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,495
Where are you!

238
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,298
Mr. Kume!

239
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,066
Hey!

240
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,260
What the?

241
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:06,398
What're you surprised for...
You're the one who told us

243
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,436
that if we don't want our souls
to be taken by the guso

245
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:15,307
we should hold
knives in our mouths, right

247
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,909
Mr. Daito?

248
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,915
Mr. Kume,
the man you're after is still in the house.

250
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,118
He's fast asleep. though.

251
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,988
I borrowed his clothes to catch you

252
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:33,625
To get you who killed Ms. Taira and
the Captain.as well as wait for Mr. Kume,

254
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,161
who you thought was coming!

255
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,799
The three were the thieves
who not only kidnapped Miyako,

257
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,103
but also stole the folding screen,
and on top of that killed the maid. right?

259
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,639
Hey. hey,
just what do you think you're saying

261
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,944
I was looking for Kume when I
saw a suspicious silhouetted figure

263
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,913
so I tried to catch him, that's all

264
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,651
Besides, I couldn't have killed
Ms. Taira, right?

266
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,722
The writing on the sand that
was near that lady was written right

268
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,592
after the waves pulled away.

269
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:09,861
And you said it would've been
IMpPOsSsSI O or me,

271
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,698
who was in the ship
on the other side of the island to write.

273
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,100
That's true.

274
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,770
Even if something is written
on the sand before the tide pulls back,

276
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,640
it'll be washed away by the waves.

277
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,276
Ere ore. 1 ( >e mpossi re o
Ieave the writing on the sand.

279
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,345
If it was really the waves that
was pulling back then.

281
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
Don't Joke around.

282
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,216
You saw it too, didn't you?

283
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,586
The sand was wet up to about
a meter above the lady's head.

285
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:39,358
If the water was
up there during high tide,

287
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,027
no matter how you think of it,
the tide was receding, wasn't it?

289
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:46,498
That's we calculated wrong
and were deceived.

291
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,433
The waves actually don't come up that far,

292
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:51,903
but because the sand was wet,

293
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,106
we mistakenly thought that during high
tide the waves came all the way up there

295
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,210
Right

296
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,346
the time we found Ms. Taira
was actually high tide.

298
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,949
If so. then it all fits just right. doesn't it?

299
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:08,420
If the tide is high all you have to do is
write where the waves won't wash it away

301
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,957
then lie Ms. Taira
right next to the writing

303
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,495
Okay. then why don't we go look for
the writing right now!

305
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:19,231
Half a day has already past since then.

306
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,900
If it was written where the waves
wouldn't wash it away,

308
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,236
the writing would still
be there, wouldn't it?

310
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,305
No. it was no longer there.

311
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,943
You probably erased it the minute
we left the site, anyway

313
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,345
Hey. hey.

314
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,414
But. my footprints were still there!

315
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,448
Huh?

316
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,985
When Heiji took the picture of
my sandals and the writing.

318
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,621
I was standing right next to him.

319
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,692
But. my footprints were still there.

320
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,996
Yeah, but kiddo,
the sand was wet all over...

322
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,566
I couldn't have wet the sand that way
even if I used a bucket.

324
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,334
You didn't use a bucket.

325
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,571
You used the cruiser we came here on!

326
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:04,710
The waves that the cruiser created
we he shore more an curing ug. ice

328
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,879
All you did was use it to your advantage

329
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,818
You knew that the captain was going to
go around the entire island

331
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,821
Iooking for the stuff
In question until it's time to leave

333
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,990
A. And just what is that stuff I
n question supposed to be...

335
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,158
What else?

336
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,226
The anchor that I found...

337
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,795
He was looking for the princess

338
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,032
that was supposed to
be tied onto the anchor.

340
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,000
Princess"?

341
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,269
It was on the writing on the pillar,
wasn't it?

343
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,805
The princess lies in A and not in B

344
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:37,542
It's hard to understand what
this means.just as it is.

346
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,279
But if you put together the folk tale
of Taro Urashima and the fact that

348
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:45,717
that this island is called Onikame Island,
then the puzzle fits...

350
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,420
The shell of the turtle.

351
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,356
Princess Oto who lives in
the Dragon King's Palace.

353
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:56,428
In other words, the Princess I's not
in the sea, but on the shell of the turtle."

355
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,165
That is, "it is in the forest on this island

356
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,136
Princess is a code name that
the thieves called

358
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,939
the thing that was sunk in the ocean,

359
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,810
but was washed up on this island
during the typhoon that struck a year ago.

361
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,613
This golden folding screen!

362
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:19,518
After they stole it, the thieves were at
a loss where to hide the folding screen,

364
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,188
so they put it in this air-tight case,
tied it onto the boat,

366
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:26,124
sunk it deep into this part of the ocean
that nobody dives into

368
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,927
with an anchor and
decided to wait till things cooled off.

370
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:36,368
But, then a big typhoon hit a year ago.
And the boat was washed up to shore.

372
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,336
Although it was okay that

373
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,138
one of the members
came to see how things were,

375
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,740
but when the next typhoon hit,

376
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,675
he boat that the thief
came on was washed away,

378
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,744
Ieaving him behind on this island.

379
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,780
That's why he left the writings to indicate
the whereabouts of the folding screen

381
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,049
for his fellow thieves

382
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,587
And, since you figured out
the meaning of the writing.

384
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:59,457
You decided to take revenge on the thieves

385
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,194
after hearing about the TV program

386
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,397
Renown Detectives of the East
VS. Renown Detectives of the West"

388
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,533
Since the thieves didn't know
where the folding screen was yet,

390
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,603
you figured that there would be
a high possibility that

392
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,406
the members of the thieves
would come mixed up as the filming crew.

394
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:17,809
B.But, how would I be able to
tell the thieves from the filming crew?

396
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,878
Taro Urashima

397
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,414
See. like you were saying!

398
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,451
You feel like you turned
into Taro Urashima

400
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,721
You knew that the members
of the band of thieves

402
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,190
ho sunk the folding screen into the ocean,

403
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,392
would immediately figure out
the meaning of the writings

405
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,730
That's why you killed Ms. Taira who
came to look for it in the forest, right?

407
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,533
In the way that
you tried to kill me a while ago

409
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,136
It sure is an interesting deduction,

410
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,806
but, if that's the case, anybody
could've committed the murder, right?

412
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,775
No, you're the one who
committed the crime.

414
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,379
Unlike the captain
who was killed violently,

416
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,048
Ms. Taira was treated
as a corpse should be treated

418
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,185
That's evidence that the killer knew that.

419
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,921
The true identity of Ms. Taira was
actually the daughter of the Mayor,

421
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:07,626
Miyako who was
kidnapped 5 years ago!

423
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,762
In other words, that
kidnapping incident was made up

425
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:15,133
and Miyako herself was also a
member of the band of thieves!

427
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,637
I realized that I figured out
the meaning of folding screen

429
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,704
why the thieves called the,

430
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:25,777
Hime "means Princess, and the meaning
of "choinii andkachan that were written

432
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,681
by Miyako when she was
Iittle and living in that house

434
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:35,487
Folding screen was
called Hime because

436
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:38,323
- the name was taken
from the Shirasagi Castle

438
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,795
Kachan", is the Karasu Castle,
formally known as Miyamoto Castle!

440
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,066
In other words, it stands for
Ms. Kako Miyamoto the maid!

442
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,137
Chonii came from the Chiyoda Castle,
which is also known as the Edo Castle

444
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,242
The Edo Castle is a large
castle that is located in the East

446
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:01,980
Isn't that right? You who served as
butler at the Mayor's house,

448
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,949
Mr. Daito?

449
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,886
Although it seems that Miyako
used to call you Dojo-san

451
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:12,057
with the "e omitted in the
beginning though

453
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:19,964
I found out that you were the butler, when
you didn't sit but stood by the doorway.

455
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,169
You have a room but your
chair is only in the kitchen...

457
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:28,339
The time when you suddenly opened the
dish cabinet when looking for the ashtray

459
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:35,380
It was as If you knew there was no
ashtray in this house to begin with!

461
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:41,419
You're the one who prepared that
tea cup with the cigarette butts inside it

463
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,422
beforehand too, to make it look like
the doings of multiple criminals, right?

465
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,593
You probably thought you'd
get away for now somehow,

467
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,228
and was thinking of killing Mr. Kume

468
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,331
who you goofed trying to kill
Iater, too bad you can't

470
00:18:53,965 --> 00:18:56,568
Because the rope you're
holding now and the rope marks

472
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,804
around Miyako's neck are
going to match completely

474
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,942
But, there's still one thing I
can't figure out

476
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,779
I can understand that you found out
about Mr. Kume after he got flustered

478
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,115
when he saw the picture of
Miyako who he thought had died, but

480
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:13,618
How'd you figure that the
captain was also one of them?

482
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,355
If you didn't predict that the captain
would make his rounds around this island

484
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,757
this trick wouldn't have worked out...

485
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,760
How could I ever forget...

486
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:27,699
He was the only one that I witnessed
four years back at the time of the incident

488
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,603
The very one who killed the one who was
to be my wife my cherished loved one

490
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,538
He is the hateful killer who killed her...

491
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,341
Which means that the maid,
Ms. Matsumoto was...

493
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:42,981
Yes, I was engaged to her, I asked the
master for a leave to avenge her death.

495
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,383
I changed my outer appearance
as well as my way of speech

497
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,652
speech in order to pursue the thieves.

498
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:51,089
But, I was shocked when I found out
that Miyako was one of them...

500
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,525
Which means you didn't know?

501
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,063
No. because she looked so different...

502
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,066
Until she mumbled those few words...

503
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,904
I'm sorry, Chiyonii...

504
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:11,608
I felt like I understood for the first time
just before her death, how she really felt

506
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:19,017
That kidnapping incident was
made up because after her mother died,

508
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,453
she wanted to test her
step-father's love for her.

510
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,323
But, when Kaneshiro rejected
to pay the ransom,

512
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:30,028
She decided to steal what Kaneshiro
cherished, and it was the folding screen

514
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,165
Miyako was actually Kaneshiro's wife's
child from another marriage after all

516
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,568
Yes. now that I think back.

517
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,704
It could be that Mr. Kaneshiro
knew that Miyako

519
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,806
was somehow involved in the incident...

520
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:45,310
Because when he gave me time off,
this is what he said

522
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,380
All this happened
probably because of me...

524
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:54,352
So. hate me and forget about
pursuing the incident, will you...

526
00:20:55,888 --> 00:20:58,723
I think that this incident was
just as the master said...

528
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,161
a box that shouldn't
have been opened

530
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,900
As if to speak on his behalf,

531
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:13,338
the golden folding screen was
watching sadly over him...

533
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,774
Because the folding screen
was suddenly exposed to air

535
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:21,045
after being sealed for so long
and oxidized, the paint began

537
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,549
to run and fade.
Resembling tears falling
