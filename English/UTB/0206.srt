1
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,519
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,588
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,557
Mystery after mystery,
the case of arson and robbery

6
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,424
The two cases overlap and become one

7
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:27,927
He sees through the one and only truth.

8
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,862
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,964
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

12
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,048
After Ayumi says
hat she had witnessed the arsonist

14
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,718
of the succession of arson cases
in the city,

16
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,287
we, the Youth Detective Squad,

17
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,656
Officer jakagi and Sato
start investigating the case.

19
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,193
That day also happened
to be the memorial day

21
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:10,196
when Officer Sato's father died on duty,

22
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:13,232
so his friends during his school days
were also having a get together.

24
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:21,741
LOVE STORY AT HEADQUARTERS-III"
Part 2!

26
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,582
What're you doing?!

27
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,952
What's the matter?
Officer Sato, you re soaking with sweat...

29
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:34,887
It's this pub...isn't it?

30
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,287
It's this pub...isn't it?

31
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,491
Okay then let's get off quick!!

32
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,325
No!!

33
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:41,694
M in there alone...

34
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,564
I'm coming right back so you all stay put!

35
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,099
Shoots...

36
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,635
Huh?

37
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,304
What're you doing, AI?

38
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,473
Since we've got nothing to do
while we re waiting,

40
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,242
I thought I'd check the places

41
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,043
that were attacked
by the arsonist up to-now 7".

43
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,213
Do any of you remember the places
where the fire took place?

45
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,115
Oh, I remember!

46
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,251
All of them happened near the
station...

48
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,920
The first. happened in Ikebukuro,

49
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,388
uh...the second one in Asakusabashi,

50
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,058
the third in Tabata
and the fourth in Shimokitazawa.

52
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:15,995
&# The third in Tabata
and the fourth in Shimokitazawa...

54
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:20,766
And the fifth is Yotsuya,
where Ayumi saw the arsonist!

56
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,369
It's just a simple trapezoid
even if connected

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,571
There seems to be no special consistency
or anything...

60
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,741
It sure looks like a scooperefrom here!

61
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,143
You mean-a-soup ladle, right...

62
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,278
soup ladle...

63
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:36,415
Maybe this is the shape
of an unfinished Big Dipper?

66
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,320
Because if so, the handle
of the ladle should be on the left side...

68
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,390
Hey. Conan...
Why don't you help us out...

70
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,191
Huh?

71
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,226
He's one!

73
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,594
ot-again...

74
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:51,363
Huh, they left?

75
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,299
All four, together?

76
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,835
Yeah... just about 40 minutes ago...

77
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,338
Something about feeling uncomfortable

78
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,208
about the arson still at
Iarge in this area, so they left.

80
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,045
Um, do you know what the four
were talking about with each other?

82
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,013
C Conan?!

83
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,415
Yeah!

84
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,985
They were having a ball saying that
good things kept coming!

86
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,323
Mr. Inomata was saying that today
was his company's 15th anniversary!

88
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,159
Something about his company had never
been in the reds since its establishment.

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,562
Mr. Kano was saying that
tomorrow was his 50th birthday!

92
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:26,465
He said that his studying in Italy
for 3 years bore fruit,

94
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,234
and that his shop was doing just great...

95
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,971
Mrs. Kandori looked happy saying that
her daughter just got married

97
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,706
to a well-to-do man yesterday!

98
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,941
As for Mr. Saruwatari, he said that

99
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,911
his son just had their second baby boy
this morning...but he added

101
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:44,683
he had mixed feelings because today
was also your father's memorial day...

103
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,421
The killer of that case is
sure a ruthless one, isn't he?

105
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,124
Not only did the robber take off
with 500,000,000 yen...

107
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,360
He killed the security guard
that tried to stop him

109
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,763
by hitting him on the head with the rifle
that he had hidden behind his coat.

111
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,333
On top of that
he kills the Police Commissioner...

113
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,469
K.Killed...

114
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,538
Didn't he die of an accident?

115
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,006
There was a witness...

116
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:07,706
Huh?!

117
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,075
Who said that

118
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,078
it looked to be that my father was pushed
in front of the truck from behind...

120
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,817
I'm sure that Conan's in the store!

121
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,520
He's really good at being sneaky...

122
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:24,456
Don't tell me he's eating something
in there?

124
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,692
Like fried chicken or pork skewers!

125
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,729
All you have in your head is eels
over rice and meat, don't you, Genta...

127
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,399
Youill have to eat vegetables
to orgyou"ll die young...

129
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,165
Agh!

130
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:36,969
The bad guy was saying something about,

131
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,504
he had just one more vegetable
and it'll be over!

133
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:40,639
Vegetable?

134
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,173
Yes,

135
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,909
vege...eve...or something like that...

136
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,744
Eve?!

137
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,314
Just one more and the eve will be over?

138
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,016
On't tell me that...that this is...

139
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,520
Darn...

140
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,821
I wonder what he's eating?

141
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,558
Huh? AA?

142
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,693
I'm closing the door...

143
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:01,560
Oh...okay!

144
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,434
Hey! No fair, Al...

145
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:09,535
What? She's going to eat something!!

146
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,504
Stay out until I get back!

147
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,074
Shoots

148
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,912
how come we end up staying in here.

149
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:30,322
Hmm?

150
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,691
What's wrong?

151
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:37,062
H He's the one! The bad man that I saw!

152
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,330
What?!

153
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,570
But...don { you think
the shop owner is too well-informed...?7.

155
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:44,937
What?

156
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,406
Like knowing that
e was struck by a rifle...

158
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,540
I Knew nothing about it.

159
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,044
On the day of the incident

160
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,147
the shots thatywere taken by the
surveillance camera was aired on TV!

162
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,217
It was too violent so It was cut immediately

163
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,186
I'm more worried about
Officer Takagi, right now...

165
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,823
The least we need to figure out
IS whether the one

167
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,459
who attacked him was the killer
of 18 years ago, or the arsonist.

169
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,194
Otherwise, there is no way
rrinding him...

171
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,396
hinagawa...

172
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,499
Al?!

173
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,403
The next place the arson is going to
show uplisiShinagawa...

175
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,238
Huh, Shinagawa?!

176
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:20,839
Look!

177
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,942
Leaving the first arson
that occurred in Ikebukuro

179
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,011
and the 2nd arson
that occurred in Asakusabashi as is,

181
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:29,148
then connect the third site of the arson
that occurred in Tabata

183
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,549
to the 4th that
occurred in ShimokitÃ©zawaz.

185
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,319
with a line to the 5th site Yotsuya

187
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,556
Fire?!

189
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,026
The arsonist was writing
the Japanese kanji

191
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,062
character fire on the ground of Tokyo

193
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,963
in the correct writing order of the word...

194
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,267
Then don't tell me that the one
who attacked Officer Takagi is...

196
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,068
Yes.

197
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:49,702
Yes.

198
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,305
If the arsonist mistakenly thought:that he had

199
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,374
been witnessed, it's possible...

200
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,177
If that were to be true...

201
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,414
there should be a corpse rolling around
nearby the next site of the fire,

203
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,882
ust like In the 4th case...

204
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,161
Okay, everybody...

205
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:17,930
Huh?

206
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,665
What? Oh no...

207
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,000
They're gone!!

208
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:23,068
Huh?

209
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,606
Fficer Sato...

210
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,475
Oh, Inspector Shirator!

211
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,411
Didn't you see the children?

212
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,414
Weren't they with yo

213
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,683
Well, you see...

214
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,589
Conan, Conan. can you hear me?

215
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,524
Ayumi...

216
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:46,859
Hey!

217
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,027
Where are you guys
and what're you doing?!

219
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:55,367
Don't yell, the killer will hear you!

220
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,902
What? the killer?

221
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:01,206
The man that Ayumi had seen before
coincidentally walked by the pub,

223
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,608
o we're tailing him now...

224
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:03,609
What?!

225
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,713
We're at the warehouse district
in Shinagawa 6 chome right now...

227
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,650
Hey, take a look at that. He's pouring
something onto the newspaper...

229
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,520
What? The guy hasn't set fire yet?

230
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,690
Which means that the one who attacked
Officer Takagi wasn't the arsonist?

232
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,826
Um, Inspector Shiratori,

233
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:24,430
did you notice anything strange
before parting with Officer Takagi?

235
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,966
I think he was looking up at
the board with the names of the stations

237
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,601
on the platform of Shinagawa Station...

238
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,637
Station name board...

239
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,776
I see!
That's why Officer Takagi figured it out...

241
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:41,947
The meaning of the last words
of Officer Sato's father, Shushiro',

243
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,983
the identity of the kan-n-o0
that was written in his police book,

245
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,454
and the reason why he was able to
specify the killer with only a few clues...

247
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,858
There's no doubt about it,
the killer is among the four.

249
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,095
And the one
who attacked Officer Takagi is also...

251
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,398
Hey! You guys!

252
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:03,235
We'll head on that way with Inspector
Shiratori's car right now, so don't move!

254
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:03,902
Huh?

255
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,171
Let's go in my car, then...

256
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,975
your destination is not there,
Officer Sato...

258
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:10,542
Huh?

259
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,146
You'll have to go and settle the case
that happened 18 years ago...

261
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,647
Settle the case?

262
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,817
It's most likely, that...
it hasn't been settled yet...

264
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:28,093
eah, that'ta boy...grow...

265
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,364
Hey, hey, I don't believe it...

266
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:32,931
Agh!!

268
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,220
25 Em
The hint is the row of the Roman
alphabet where the letter na is...

271
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,289
I'm sure that Officer Takagi realized

272
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,658
it when he was looking at the board
with the names of the station on it...

274
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,794
It's a very simple magic of letters...

275
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,532
That person probably also knows
here Officer Takagi is...

277
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,501
Although it may be impossible
to arrest him now,

279
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,737
he may reveal the truth to you...

280
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,172
The truth of what happened
18 years ago...

282
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,377
Is it going to be okay?

283
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,979
The fire is getting bigger...

284
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,549
1.I'm sure everything will be all right,

285
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,251
because Conan should've contacted
the fire deparment by now...

287
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:30,422
Don't we need to tail the arsonist...?

289
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,892
Remember, Conan told us not to move?

290
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,863
But, I think that it's been 10 minutes

291
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,099
No, not even 5 minutes have passed yet...

292
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,801
It's too dark that I can't see.

293
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,572
Huh?

294
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,742
There, now you can see, can't you? Brats...

295
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,949
I'll line you all up in a row...

296
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,420
as the sacrificial offering of the
real carnival that is about to begin...

298
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,204
uh? Miwako...

299
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,073
Did you finish work?

300
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,475
Well, sort of...

301
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,478
But, as you can see,
they're almost ready to close.

303
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,346
Who cares!

304
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,915
Let me at least treat you to a drink!

305
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,919
Tomorrow's your long awaited
50th birthday, isn't it?

307
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,323
I guess so...but at 50 you don't
really care about birthdays anymore...

309
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:41,093
Oh...I'm sure you've been
Iooking forward to the day...

311
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,496
Because after midnight this evening,

312
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,299
the "Shushiro incident
that occurred 18 years ago

314
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,967
Ill to your joy expire...

315
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:58,043
So, let's have a toast, the two of us...
Mr. Kan-n-0"?

317
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,685
Amnit...
hat the hell is going on...

319
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:10,689
I remember...
Somebody hit me from behind...

321
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,960
1,I've got to do something
about these handcuffs.

323
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,230
All right! My gun's still here!

324
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,667
Kay, I'll shoot the chain off...

325
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,341
a-n-0 .

326
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:33,145
The three mysterious letters that were
written in my father's police l.D. book...

328
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,815
If written in Roman letters
it is read "KANO".

330
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,518
If n" is put together with the vowel "0",
it is read...

332
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:40,786
Kano...

333
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,455
I called Mr. Saruwatari and the others

334
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,157
and confirmed with them
0o just awhile ago.

336
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,192
They told me that Ka-n-0" is probably
the nickname my father gave you

338
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,528
when you used to play baseball together
IN your school days.

340
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,330
But, until I asked them about it,

341
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,966
they told me that they thought
you used to be called by a strange name,

343
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,635
something like Kan-o" or "Kao"...

344
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,970
They never really figured out for sure
what you were being called...

346
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,441
The reason why my father specified you
as the suspect was because

348
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,243
he saw the picture of the man
who hit the securityguard with the rifle

350
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,212
on the surveillance camera...

351
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,248
Father used to always tell me...

352
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,617
that although you had
a unique batting form,

354
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,986
you were the most skilled batter
of the team...

356
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,156
Ha, ha, ha...you've got to be kidding,

357
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,358
suspecting me as the killer
just because of something like that...

359
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:24,563
Besides that case expired
3 years ago, didn't it. .?

361
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:28,266
No, not yet. To put it accurately, there's
still 8 minutes and 17 seconds to go...

363
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,204
You should know,
that if the suspect goes abroad,

365
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,640
the period that the suspect
IS abroad is counted out...

367
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,678
I've already checked it out
with the Ministry of Justice...

369
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,681
And, I've also figured out
that you set it up

371
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,951
to comeback from Italy
on your 50th birthday,

373
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,488
so that you wouldn't forget
the expiration date of the case!!

375
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,374
No! Not until you tell me
what really happened.

377
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,513
Father used to say that a suspect who is
on the verge of confessing the crime

379
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:17,516
always gulps and reaches
out for a cup of tea...

381
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,985
and if you give the suspectithe tea

382
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,521
he will swallow
the confession together with the tea...

384
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,424
I won't let you swallow
this case into yourself,

386
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,262
Not even if your throat gets so parched
t you dry out and wither...

388
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,369
Agh, Ayumi!!

389
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,172
No. no. no, no

390
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,307
you all come here quietly too...

391
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:43,809
Huh?

392
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,113
What's another way of saying,
being kicked in the rear end?

394
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,448
Butt...7!

395
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,188
Utt kick...

396
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,857
Right!

398
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:03,895
Ig... sure IC â¬ some Ing
ally stupid again...

400
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,598
Inspector Shiratori! This way...

401
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,165
Huh?

402
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,868
This way, this way!

403
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,405
A can of kerosene and matches...

404
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,407
I think we've really got him this time.

405
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,543
Uh, is that warehouse
going to be all right,

407
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,712
etting it burn on like that...
Ss burning pretty badly...

409
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,448
That warehouse was scheduled
to be demolished next week anyway,

411
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,583
and it's empty inside.

412
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,619
Besides, the firefighters are busy
extinguishing the fire now.

414
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,291
Darn!

415
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,242
Congratulations...l lose...

416
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,547
I didn't mean to kill

417
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,352
You mean my father?

419
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,355
The security guard!

420
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,491
I just fried to brush him away bull seem
to have hit him in the wrong place...

422
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,593
What about father, then?

423
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,496
You kicked him at the intersection,
didn't you?

425
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,902
No...I'm the one who was kicked...

426
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,769
Huh?

427
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,141
Back then... he saw through all of me
nd I was about to be...

429
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,610
taken to the station by him...

430
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,781
I suddenly got scared

431
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,516
when I thought about my future...

432
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,153
that I dashed out In front of the truck...

433
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:43,295
e pushed me...

434
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:49,200
He gave me another chance
o do my life over again...

436
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,271
But, what good is it, getting back on
my feet with the money that I robbed...

438
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,406
No...

439
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,808
I haven't touched that money!

440
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,144
I have it-hidden
under the Buddhist altar at home!

442
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,214
I was planning to give the money back
as soon as the case expired!

444
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,850
This is true!! Please believe me!!

445
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,919
Sure, I'll believe you

446
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,088
Officer Chiba, did you hear all that?!

447
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,623
Yes, all of it!!

448
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,825
Get a warrant immediately
and confiscate everything!

450
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,493
If the license number matches,
we've no better proof!

452
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,496
Attach the tape of this conversation
onto the money

454
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,397
and send it in to the criminal
Investigation section

456
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,834
make sure he is indicted today,
understand?!

458
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,768
Y Yes...

459
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,972
Hurry,
because we've only got one day left!!

461
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,339
One day left?

462
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,175
You mean you didn't realize,

463
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:34,145
that when you came back from Italy,
remember, there was a typhoon?

465
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,480
Y.Yeah...

466
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,450
The flight that was scheduled
to arrive at 21:00,

468
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,287
was delayed and arrived at 00:04...

469
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:45,156
Which means that your calculation
of the expiration date

471
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,826
of the case, was one day off...

472
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,161
y sympathies...

473
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:55,666
I had a bad feeling...

474
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,969
Because your face
when you came here today

476
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,038
Iooked just like yourfather's back then...

477
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,774
If you refused to confess,

478
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,710
I was ready to turn your house over

479
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,746
and look for the money
In order to arrest you!

481
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,681
But, not father!

482
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,385
He could've told me your name
In the ambulance,

484
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:16,254
but he believed you, so he didn't...

485
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:20,658
My father turned towards you
as you fled from the intersection and said,

487
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,060
rn yourself in...

488
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,964
Because his gasping remark sounded
Iike Shushiro to the people

490
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,769
who were there at that time,
they heard wrong...

492
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:34,739
Now, tell me where Officer Takagi is!
Where is he?

494
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:38,877
Inside a dilapidated warehouse
n Shinagawa 6-chome...

496
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,379
I was going to report it to the police later
and inform them though...

498
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:44,214
Hey, that's...

499
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,053
I.Is that true?

500
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,320
Is Officer Takagi really in there?...

501
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:52,257
If so, he's probably already...

502
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,793
What do you think you're saying?
You'll still make it!!

504
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,727
Move!

505
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,228

518
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,522

520
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,331

521
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,033
Just what are you doing there?!

522
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,001
W. Well, Im...

523
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,207
When I pulled on the bars it came off,
so I got out through the window...

525
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,945
1.1 was walking back and forth, then was
istaken for one of the onlookers...

527
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,179
Il.ll\.;...

528
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,848

529
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,818
How can you walk around
urt like this...

531
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,887
What? Come on, you've got your gun!

532
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,525
Why didn't you use your gun
to blow the chain off the handcuffs?!

534
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,328
He didn't want to break
those handcuffs...

536
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,298
That's your father's keepsake,
isn't it Officer Sato?

538
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,900
That's why he didn't use his gun!

539
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,768
Really cool!

540
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,570
He's the type that'll die young...

541
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,774
You fool...

Uh, No, I just got here too.

599
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,564
I'm sorry. Remember the arsonist?
E started confessing so...

601
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,299
got all absorbed.

602
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,601
L.Let's not talk about work...

603
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,770
Right, we're dating today, dating!

604
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:26,838
R.Right!

605
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:33,211
Sato here! I've caught sight of the
younger sister of the guy in question!

607
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:34,012
Huh?

608
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,047
Okay, keep tailing her!

609
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,749

that you're a cop!

611
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,483

612
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,586
U,Uh, Officer Sato?
Don't tell me that this is...

614
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,123
Okay, let's go, Officer Takagqi...

615
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,331
Officer Sato!

616
00:23:58,237 --> 00:24:01,372
To think that a detective as renown as
Kogoro Mourn was not able to

618
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,143
stop a murder that happened right
efore his eyes...

620
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,743
We appreciate your cooperation.

621
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:07,545
?1 Huh...?!

622
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,380
We'll keep this evidence
that you have with us.

624
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,949
D Don't tell me that...?!

625
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,253
But, if thought of that way,
It Is convincing....!

627
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,690
Even Pop's superb power
of deduction....!
