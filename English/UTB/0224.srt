that prompts us to come to Bikuni Island
BIKUNI ISLAND

19
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,357
What awaited us was

20
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,027
a series of murders revolving around
some dugong arrows

22
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:10,563
that are said to grant
the bearer eternal youth

24
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,367
Saori Kadowaki, the girl who
wrote the letter is missing,

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,771
and her childhood friends
Toshimi Ebihara

28
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:22,241
and Naoko Kuroe are
murdered one after the other,

30
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,978
and on top of that, the warehouse
belonging to the shrine goes up in flames

32
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,315
and the body of Kimie Shimabukuro is
discovered in the rubble.

34
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,518
Is Saori responsible for the murders?

35
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:37,189
We go to search her room for clues

36
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:40,659
and make a startling discovery.

37
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:46,932

Wow...

110
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,787
Why is she here...

111
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,462
Now that all the actors are present,
Iet me begin explaining.

113
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,333
I'm going to give you the truth behind the
3 murders that occurred on this island...

115
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:39,438
The first murder which involved Toshiml
being hung in the Mermaid's Waterfall...

117
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:44,643
and the second, of Naoko being
strangled in the nets...

119
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:50,649
and lastly, the murder of Kimie who was
burned in the warehouse...

121
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,253
The important issue here is
the second murder.

123
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:59,592
Judging from the evidence,
it appeared as though the killer

125
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:03,329
walked along the shoreline to get
to & from the scene of the murder, but...

127
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,632
That kidifrom Osaka
explained that already...

129
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,667
Yes, he told me too...

130
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,205
those footprii'nts were put there by the killer
before the murder to throw us off track...

132
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:18,677
the killer actually went to the scene
during the wake

134
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,147
those fish scales really had me fooled...

135
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:25,084
the killer dropped
the scales around the footprints

137
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:29,088
then on Nahoko's clothes
after killing her, that way,

139
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,825
with the scales leading to the water,
the killer made it look

141
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,927
a mermaid was responsible
& that it escaped into the ocean...

143
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:41,133
And, the only ones who could have left
the wake that night,

145
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,902
were Rokuro & Benzo,
you're the only ones.

147
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,771
Hat...
I don't believe it...

149
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,375
By the way Benzo,
I have a question for you...

151
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,778
on the morning of the festival,
you're the one who sold a dugong arrow

153
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,514
for 1,000,000 yen to
an elderly couple, aren't you?

155
00:06:56,182 --> 00:07:00,185
Ah...that's the arrow my daugh
Saori won the year before...

157
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,055
m her father, I had a right

158
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,625
All that money must've made you greedier

159
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:10,296
so when you saw that
Toshimi won one this year,

161
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,499
you told her to meet you by the waterfall &
then at the waterfall, you stole her platelet,

163
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,969
set her afloat on the swim ring
so that her neck would get caught.

165
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,606
And as for Nahoko who also won an arrow,

166
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,577
you called her out on the night of
the wake, killed her & took her arrow.

168
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:29,014
But if the list of names were checked,

169
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,984
everyone would know
Toshimi's platelet was stolen.

171
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:36,188
So you went to Kimie's home before
we got there to steal the registry, but

173
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:41,093
Kimie saw you so you locked her
in the warehouse & set fire to it!

175
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,396
This registry that you had
in your possession

177
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,665
when you were arrested proves your guilt!

178
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,768
And we've also found your fingerprints
on the swim ring used in Toshimi's case!

180
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,005
You're mistaken, Benzo's not the killer...

182
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,874
If Benzo was the killer,

183
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,011
he would have burned the registry along
with the warehouse, don't you think?

185
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,146
Besides, everyone
who lived on this island

187
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,749
knew where the registry was kept,

188
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,251
I don't think
he'd have to n'xsh overdo stem Vt.

190
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,156
Another thing, it would have been very
hard for him to call Naoko out...

192
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:16,929
Nahoko noticed that Toshimi won
an arrow at the festival too,

194
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:21,700
and she was suspicious of Benzo
who had that winning number...

196
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,436
Alright then, what about the fingerprints
on the swim ringl'?

198
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,974
I'm pretty sure he touched it
when he found it along with

200
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,911
the winning platelet which was
snagged somewhere on the river...

202
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,880
Yeah...the detective's right...

203
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:39,351
I didn't want people to think I was
the killer just because I just happened

205
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,854
to find the winning platelet,
that's why I stole the registry.

207
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,492
Th'e'fi Roku'ro Fukuyama,
YOU must be the killer!

209
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,159
Hat's ridiculous...

210
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,796
Toshimi was your fiancee, wasn't she?

211
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,699
She would have gone to meet you
at the waterfall with no suspicions...

213
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,235
No, he's not the killer either

214
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:57,169
What!?

215
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,906
The killer used a swim ring
to kill Toshimi so that

217
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,744
she'd float down the waterfall
without getting caught on anything,

219
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,113
that way,
it would look like an accident, but

221
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,915
being a fisherman,

222
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,584
Rokuro has very strong arms and
Toshimi wasn't very heavy

224
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:15,654
so it would have very easy for him
to just toss her into the river

226
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,657
He wouldn't have had
to use a swim ring

228
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,126
which would only be left
behind as evidence

230
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:25,197
But if neither of them is the killer,
then who is?

232
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:30,469
The killer made it look like
Toshimi's death was an accident

234
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,740
but made no attempt to hide the fact
that Nahoko was murdered.

236
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,476
Do you know what that means?

237
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:42,080
Well, uh...
no,ldon1.

239
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,349
When Toshimi was killed,

240
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,754
the police didn't arrive right away
because the sea wasj'toonoth,

242
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,356
Normally, the police would have arrived
sometime that night.

244
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,426
And since it was a case of murder,

245
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,961
the investigation would
have been intense,

247
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,163
the killer wouldn't have been able
to move about freely.

249
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:01,200
The killer didn't want that to happen,
that 3 why it had to look like an accident.

251
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,301
Which means,

252
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,840
the killer planned to kill Nahoko
after Toshimi from the very start!

254
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,210
But no one would have known
Nahoko had won an arrow

256
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,812
until she came forward

257
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,214
That's right.

258
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,884
The killer's motive
wasn't to steal an arrow

260
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,687
nor was it to kill whoever won it.

261
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,922
It was only made to look that way

262
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:28,159
to mislead the investigation!

263
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:29,760
That's.

264
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,966
The reason why the killer made it obvious
that Nahoko was murdered was'\

266
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:38,303
so that everyone's attention was
on the scenerofbthe crime,

268
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:39,972
- the killer used that time

269
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,908
to carry out the third murder!

270
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,813
The killer planned and executed
each crime very carefully.

272
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,683
It wasn't on a whim.

273
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,889
The only person who could have
prepared everything before the festival is

275
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,757
No, you don't mean...!?

276
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,827
Someone who knew beforehand that

277
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,097
Toshimi & Nahoko had won arrows...

278
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,431
That's right...

279
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,334
YOU are the killer!!

280
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,439
That's right.

281
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,842
The killer is the holy person!

282
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,244
Yes, you

283
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,318
Humph...you've got to be kidding.

284
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,654
How can a 130 year old lady
do those things...?

286
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,190
What if she had an accomplice?

287
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,330
If neither Rokuro nor Benzo
could have killed Nahoko,

289
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:41,266
then the only other person
who could have done it is...

291
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,801
Kimie!!

292
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,738
That's nonsense...

293
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,474
Kimie was the third victim

294
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,612
But what if it wasn't Kimie
that was in the warehouse?

296
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,212
What!?

297
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,615
Don't you remember,

298
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,650
Kimie 3 dental records and

299
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,952
the burn victim's dental records
were identical

301
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,021
Dad, you were there too weren't you?

302
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,691
When she said she'd gone to the dentist.

303
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,426
Yes, I heard.

304
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,361
She said she went with Saorl!

305
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,163
You don't mean!?

307
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:12,497
A s rlgm...

308
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:15,767
it was Saori's teeth that got worked on...

309
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,772
Kimie went with Saori to see the dentist
on the main land

311
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,310
and when Saori wasn't looking,
she took her insurance I.D.

313
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,248
then she insisted
Saori use her I.D. instead .

315
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:35,187
That's how Saori got her teeth fixed
as Kimie...

317
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:40,125
Then she killed Saori in the warehouse,

318
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,594
and set it on fire with the body inside,

319
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,999
the dental records led us all
to believe it was Kimie who died

321
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:51,236
Then the brown haired girl with glasses
we saw in the garden was...

323
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,839
It was Kimie in disguise...

324
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,376
that's who the witnesses saw
on the the morning of the festival too...

326
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,379
it was to make us suspicious
about the body found in the warehouse

328
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,581
and to make Saori look guilty...

329
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,251
But all this is just your theory...

330
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,787
I called the dentist & got verification.

331
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:13,859
The Kimiekhe worked on
had brown hair and wore glasses

333
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:15,193
Which means,

334
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,196
Kimie Shimabukuro is still hiding
somewhere on this island,

336
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,731
waiting for an opportunity to escape!

337
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,402
Alright then, I'll have this entire island
searched from top to bottom...

339
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,137
There's no need for that

340
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,071
What'?

341
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:28,940
Kimie is right here in this room!!

342
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,542
What did you say!?

343
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,678
Where!? Where is she!?

344
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,113
Kimie's here...
I can't believe it...

346
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,115
That can't be...

347
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:39,718
I don't see her anywhere!

348
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,787
Rokuro told us that

349
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,058
Kimie's talent as a make-up artist
is outstanding...

351
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:47,526
Yes, that's right...

352
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,928
Are you saying
she's disguised herself as somebody?

354
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,265
This isn't a movie, it wouldn't work

355
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,936
You're right, it would be impossible
to disguise herself perfectly...

357
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,938
but what if

358
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:03,542
it's someone who doesn't show herself
to others very much...?

360
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,378
And what if the only time
everyone sees her is

362
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,814
at the festival when she has
on very heavy make-up?

364
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,850
Now your choices have been
narrowed down significantly!

366
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:15,120
Th, that's...
impossible...

368
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,924
B, but, how do you account for
the height difference...

370
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,926
Think back.

371
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,295
Remember the strange corpse you found

372
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,997
when the warehouse burned down
3 years ago...

374
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,668
There were no leg bones
where there should have been...

376
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,605
and the locals said
it was a mermaid's body, yes, that case...

378
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,508
it was probably the body of a woman

379
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,844
who died in the fire with her legs bent...

380
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,513
And tied with rope
made of paper or something

382
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,651
If my theory is right,
that woman was Kimie's

384
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,186
It wasmmy mother...

385
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,824
She carried out the Holy Person's role
that was grandmother's

387
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,293
it was for all the people on the island...

388
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,862
she put her heart into the role...

389
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,732
I feel so sorry for her...
Iook-[What it got her...

391
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,185
You're pretty good, Mr. Detective

392
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,522
I was pretty confident
nobody'd see through this disguise...

394
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:27,192
It was that time when we found
that the register was missing...

396
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,861
Maybe that old lady took it?

397
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,463
She'd never do that...

398
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:35,534
I was suspicious about
how quickly and confidently you replied...

400
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:37,536
I see

401
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,272
But while we were
talking to the Holy Person,

403
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,807
we heard Kimie's voice...

404
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,544
Great-grandmother!
Your bath is ready!

406
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:46,745
Oh that,

407
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:50,182
I recorded that on a cassette tape
and then replayed it!

409
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,584
But why, Kimie!?

410
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,654
You 4 were close friends
since you were kids

412
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,456
The words childhood friends mean nothing

413
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,991
when it comes to
avenging my own mother's death...

415
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,127
Do you mean
those three are the ones who set fire

417
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,929
to the warehouse 3 years ago...

419
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:05,397
IUD...

420
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,133
they were angry
that they didn't win arrows at the festival

422
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,735
and then they got drunk & set it on fire...

423
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,538
Mother was disguised as the Holy Person

424
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,740
and when they saw her
go into the warehouse,

426
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,143
they decided they wanted to see
if she really had eternal life!

428
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,580
. I didn't find out until a week ago,-
when Saori told me,

430
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,882
she was in a panic
because she lost her arrow,

432
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:26,218
I never dreamed
they could do anything like that.

434
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,555
But I thought your mother disappeared
5 years ago while she-"Was out fishing...

436
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,892
Mother said it would be easier to play
just the Holy person's role all through

438
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,628
instead of playing 2 roles
at the same time...

440
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,831
Then why didn't you admit
the truth after the fire?

442
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,234
Why didn't you tell everyone
the body was your mother....!

444
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:47,172
Mother called me on her cellular phone
while the flames burned around her...

446
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,909
Kimie...the rest is up to you...

447
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,645
Kimie the rest is up to you...
That's why...l played the Holy Person...

449
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,182
Don't let the Holy Person die
that was what she sand

451
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,184
and yet...

452
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,054
all of mother's devotion...
meant nothing to them.

454
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,990
After Saori lost her arrow
she had the nerve to say...

456
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,726
If you won't give me another arrow,

457
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,861
then tell me
where the mermaid's grave is!

460
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,865
The mermaid bones that the Holy Person
had hidden in the warehouse,

462
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,333
where are they buried!

463
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,035
I want to be like her too.

464
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,037
Like the Holy Person .

465
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,173
To be in perfect condition
after being engulfed in all those flames

467
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,842
I want to live forever!!

468
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,977
I couldn't forgive her

469
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:27,846
nor Toshimi, nor Naoko...

470
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,050
Getting them to meet me was easy...

471
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,985
when I told them

472
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,588
I'd tell where the grave was
after they won the arrows at the festival,

474
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,057
the eyes of those two
Iit up with excitement...

476
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,593
it was mother's grave...

477
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,931
my mother and I worked so hard
for everyone...

479
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,466
But you two weren't alone...

480
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,637
Ha, Hattorl...!?

481
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,908
I'm pretty sure there were others

482
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,044
who knew what the Holy Person
was up to, isn't that so?

484
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,581
You, old man! I heard you say that
now that Kimie was dead,

486
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,183
there would be no more festivals!

487
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,918
I meant, uh...

488
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,454
I'm sorry, Kimie!

489
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,724
Everyone on the island knew,
except for the younger people...

491
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,526
I, don't believe it .

492
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:20,598
We also knew that it was your mother
who died in that fire 3 years ago...

494
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,600
After the fire,

495
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,137
we went to tell you that
the festival could be ended, but...

497
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,009
when you came out
dressed like the Holy Person,

499
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,579
we couldn't bring ourselves to tell you...

500
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,550
You see, this is the mermaid's island...

501
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,886
and if you decided
you'd carry out the role...

503
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,757
We decided to keep quiet about it
and help you whenever we could...

505
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,427
We thought we were doing it
for the island, forgive us

507
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,896
Forgive us, Kimie...

508
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,565
We're sorry...
Forgive us...

510
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,367
I don't understand...

511
00:18:55,901 --> 00:19:00,005
Why didn't you say something.
Sooner...

513
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:01,806
That's right...

514
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,477
you should all have awaken
from this dream sooner...

516
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,813
this dream of gaining eternal life,
it was just a nightmare

518
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,416
Life comes to an end
that's why It's so precnous...

520
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,755
knowing it has an end makes us
work harder to make a good life...

522
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,358
Isn't that right...Kazuha...

523
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,733
The next morning,

524
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:33,104
all the people on the island
went to the pier to see Kimie off

526
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,573
as the Fukui Police
were taking her to the mainland,

528
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,709
but the sea was rough once again

529
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,544
and the ship took a long time
to leave the port...

531
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,281
It was as if the sea was unwilling
to let go of the young girl

533
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,749
who tried singlehandedly...

534
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,385
to protect the ways of her people
for 3 years...

536
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:55,693
When I called Saori the first time,
that moan I heard,

538
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:59,264
that was probably Kimie crying

539
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,935
She was probably crying while looking at
Saori's body in the warehouse...

541
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,070
But what I don't understand is

542
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:10,942
why Saori sent you a letter
addressed to me

544
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,445
Maybe it was just coincidence?

545
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,547
Why, Mr. Moufl and Hem'.!

546
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:17,749
Huh?

547
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:19,350
I know you, aren't you...

548
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,219
That's how we met for the first time,

549
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,022
on that diplomat, Mr. Tsujimura's
murder case...

551
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:28,026
That's the victim's son,
Takayoshi & his girlfriend, Yukiko...

553
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,761
Long time no see

554
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,566
Did you by chance go to Bikuni Island
because Seen contacted you?

556
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,968
Eh? How did you know that?

557
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,370
Yukiko's from that island

558
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,841
and Saori used to live next door,
she asked Yukiko for some advice...

560
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,376
I see Shinichi didn't come with you...

561
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,713
how disappointing, after I told her
he was the most reliable one...

563
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,647
So it was you!

564
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:52,851
You were behind that misleading letter...

565
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:57,522
Now I remember, I did change back
into Shinichi that one time...

567
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,658
By the way,
did something happen on the island?

569
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:05,329
Weflgtarrived on the island today but
everyone seemed to be in such a rush,

571
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,133
we just decided
to take the next ship back...

573
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,402
maybe it's better if you didn't know...

574
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:13,805
Why'd you pick today to come?

575
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,940
The festival was 2 days ago, you know

576
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:20,545
We didn't come for the festival,
we came for the seafood on this island!

578
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,348
It's cheap, delicious
and the scenery's great!

580
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,283
People are starting to talk about it!

581
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,885
I see...

582
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:32,089
Even without the Dugong Festival,
the island will still attract tourists then...

584
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:32,757
Guess so...

585
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,294
I just hope their wounds heal quickly...

Hey Hem, at me see your scan!

630
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,252
What for?

631
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,120
You know why, come on...

632
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:12,656
That's the wound of love
Kazuha marked you with

634
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,659
Ran, what aare you saying!

635
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,127
Oh. . .that...

636
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,630
When I got up this monolog
the scar had come off

638
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,565
and it had already healed...

639
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,767
I don't believe it...

640
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,437
I should have stabbed you deeper...

641
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,772
Why you!

642
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,174
But I'm glad it's healed!

643
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,646
Now I won't have to hear you say
that I almost killed you.

645
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,582
Kazuha, wait up!

646
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:40,251
UUI.

647
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,253
You've just made me more fired up...

648
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,656
I'm never...

649
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:49,861
Going to let anything happen to that girl...
never...

651
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,100
What an actor...

652
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,105
I see,

653
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:02,906
ifjthe shop is doing good business.

654
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,243
Then the people running it
have to be there all day working...

656
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,445
and during that time,

657
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,781
the one we're looking for
would be é'lo'h'e'in thefib'flse, hiding...

659
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,519
Why this sounds just like the work of
the League Of the4Red Hairs!

661
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,190
Hcame here to see
the 'palm of the God of Fortune

663
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:21,059
What is this?!

664
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,261
I don't believe it 3 years old...
