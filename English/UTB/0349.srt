1
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:03,736
Friendship. Romance. Mystery

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:06,171
Because we cherish them we can continue

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,673
An out of season mystery

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,174
Everyone's feelings solve the case

5
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,009
He sees through the one and only truth,

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,678
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

8
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,147
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

11
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,191
Don't let up, dear. Come on, please.

12
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,727
Don't you give up, dear.

13
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,162
Take it easy. Mrs. Nagakura.

14
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,698
Oh. Wait a minute!

15
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:19,271
This is not a mark left
by hitting or scraping...

17
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,507
What is it?

18
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,476
Don't get in the way, young man.

19
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,177
Oh, oh.

20
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,079
Excuse me.

21
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,122
Red and unconscious... serio

22
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:41,025
Questioning at the hospital
would be difficult.

24
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:44,830
Well, I didn't notice anything.

25
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,798
I drank too much and was fast asleep.

26
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,967
Oh, excuse me,

27
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,404
but Mr. Mouri can solve cases in his sleep.

28
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,307
Oh. ah. Well. Ha. ha, ha.

29
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,142
Mouri, it is.

30
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,980
You are Mr. Kogoro Mourn,
the sleeping detective, aren't you?

32
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,217
The great detective, yes.

33
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,953
Oh. excuse me. Mr. Mourn

34
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,055
The higher ups gave me their consent.

35
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,058
SO please help investigating
with us on this case.

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,626
H. You've got...

38
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,228
From your higher-ups...

39
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,963
Umm.
That's something.

41
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,599
Ha. ha.

42
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:27,606
(1523k)

43
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,677
We are expecting this village to be
registered as the Earth Heritage soon,

45
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,562
and we do not want any incident
Iike this happening here.

47
00:03:33,563 --> 00:03:36,582
As a matter of fact. I'm from this village.

48
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,718
And I hope the case closes
as early as possible.

50
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,487
So please help us on this matter,
Mr. Mourn!

52
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:45,524
I see very well what you mean,

53
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,928
and I, Kogoro Mouri, the detective
of repute, will give a full hand in this.

55
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,863
Thank you very much, sir.

56
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,765
Ha. ha. ha.

57
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,867
So rest assured and don't worry.

58
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,403
This is sudden. Mr. Mourn,

59
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,504
but who is the culprit?

60
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,839
Huh

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,009
Is it a ghost? It can't be!

62
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,812
What are you talking about?
Of course not.

64
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:07,512
Huh

65
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,349
Oh. I'm speaking to the other party.

66
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,451
Then that means the culprits...

67
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,585
Yes. of course.

68
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,386
It's him.

69
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,538
It's him.

70
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,800
But, you saw her, Mami. too, Conan.

71
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,304
No...
something made you think you did.

73
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,040
NN \ ?
VAJIUA VAR on WV Yaa Wan Y

75
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,043
But because Ayumi saw something

76
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,677
it helped us to find out

77
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:42,681
which way the culprit fled.

78
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,419
This way leads to... a dead end.

79
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,372
He leave the village.

80
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,790
That means!

81
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,060
The culprit is yet to go out of the village!

82
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,562
And at this time of the day.

83
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,432
He wouldn't choose
to come from outside this village.

85
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,701
That means the culprit is

86
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:07,004
one of the people in Onizawa village,
and includes the tourists too.

88
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:09,540
Ho on earth are you to...

89
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,777
Oh. don't bother yourself over them.

90
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,047
Any layman can think up
what they just said.

92
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:18,250
That's right. Stay out of it, all of you.

93
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,219
Furthermore,

94
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,088
there's something more important thing
that you should note.

96
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:25,657
And what's that?

97
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,361
The culprit hid the rope there
in the daytime,

99
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,898
during the sightseeing tour,

100
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,968
and used that rope at night
for breaking into the house.

102
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,470
Gosh!

103
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,439
Hen it means that...

104
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,010
the culprit is somebody
who is not from the Nagakura house,

106
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,914
where the Mouri party stayed at,
but is definitely among one of the guests.

108
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,119
Just as expected, Mr. Moun!
I'm so impressed!

110
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,889
Ha. ha, ha.
Oh, no. It's just one of the things I do!

112
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,957
Ha. ha, ha.

113
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,261
That is that,
but the issue is what the culprit...

115
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,499
Was doing there.
That's more important.

118
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,472
Don't push me, Genta.

119
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,708
Hurry up. One more floor to climb.

120
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,712
Maybe he was just a thief after all?

121
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:25,217
But what was he trying to steal?

122
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,719
Then, did I imagine what I saw?

123
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,224
If Conan says so. he could be right, still...

124
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,377
He was not exactly stealing something.

125
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:38,513
But I'm sure he was looking for something.

126
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:41,199
What was that thing he was looking for?

127
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,435
Huh. huh.

128
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,770
What's that?

129
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,470
Nothing.

130
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,406
I just thought from here,

131
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,975
you can get a good view of the scene
where Mr. Nagakura was stabbed.

133
00:06:50,976 --> 00:06:53,979
If you 'can get a good view from here,

134
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,947
it means this place Is
in clear view from there.

136
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,018
Of course! That explains it!

137
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,854
Huh? What did you say?

138
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,090
What's with Conan?

139
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,161
Sey!

140
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,767
Just as I thought.

141
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,837
What's wrong with this?

142
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,705
Keep off!
You'll get a rash if you touch it.

144
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,275
A lacquer tree. isn't it?

145
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,711
I remember the hand
of Mr. Nagakura got...

148
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,681
Yeah.

151
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:33,018
That shows Mr. Nagakura passed
by here yesterday.

154
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,351
Murderer!

157
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,386
Murderer!

158
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,855
We won't tolerate you.
You gave yourself away at last

160
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,191
Turn yourself in
You made them do it.

162
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,342
You lied.
Liar.

164
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,544
What is this all about?

166
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,898
He is the one that was rude to everyone
the day before yesterday.

168
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,001
Could it be that he did it
to Mr. Nagakura?

170
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:54,239
But then,
why are those villagers at each other?

172
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,174
I can explain that.

173
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,976
Oh? Why?

174
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,213
I read an article in a magazine
on the way here.

176
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,548
When applying for the Earth Heritage.

177
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:07,085
The villagers were separated
Into two opposing groups.

179
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:10,505
One side said there would be no need
for more tourism, and they opposed.

181
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,525
The other wanted to introduce
the existence of this village to the world,

183
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,960
and was for promoting application
for Earth Heritage.

185
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,294
If I remember correctly

186
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,730
Mr. Nagakura represented the group
that wanted to promote application.

188
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:22,234
That's why.
Mr. Nagakura was trying to say...

190
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,370
You, you all,... who's behind all this...?

191
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,238
Dear.

192
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,740
I got it. They are behind all this!

193
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:33,311
He meant the opposing group of people
when he said them

195
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,746
Calm down, people.

196
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,198
Let the police take over,
and please go home.

198
00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:38,433
Let the police take over,
and please go home.

200
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,618
We can't.

201
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,819
Let's decide now.
That's right.

203
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,454
Hey. he is getting away.

204
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,923
Don't let him get away.Get him.
Stop it everyone.

206
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:48,960
An investigator?

207
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,930
Uh huh.
He said he was sent-from the committee

209
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,832
that is involved in accepting applications
for Earth Heritage.

211
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,902
I heard 'before that

213
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:03,341
there is a special undercover investigator,
who makes a-fair-evaluation

215
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,479
« That's right. But in his case,
he is the official investigator...

217
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,047
You took bribes from those municipalities
as resources for promotion,

219
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,218
You took bribes from those municipalities
as resources for promotion.

221
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:13,618
Didn't you?

222
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,720
Didn't you?

223
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,355
I don't know what you're talking about.

224
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,558
Cut it out.
Suits for damage have been filed already.

226
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,693
And we've got the goods on you.

227
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:25,564
You asked Mr. Nagakura for commission,
but was turned down.

229
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,501
SO you got mad at him, lost yourself...
And did it. didn't you?

231
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,403
Stop talking nonsense!

232
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,638
Sure, I talked about money.

233
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,540
and it's true that I was turned down.

234
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,676
That's why I gave up

235
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,911
and went to bed early
cause I decided to leave here today

237
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,147
I stayed inside the house.

238
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:46,484
You are an old dog at this business,
and you gave up just like that?

240
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,153
Do you expect me to believe you?

241
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,555
I'm an old dog at this business,
that's why I gave up!

243
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,892
My experience told me the sooner
I quit the better.

245
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,294
I know when I can't expect money!

246
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,829
Look at this!

247
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,733
Its Mr. Nagakura's
watchman s record book.

249
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,135
The record says for the night

250
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,772
All's well up to the ninth house.

251
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:15,080
Mr. Nagakura was found on the way
to the ninth house.

254
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,817
It's very close to the Ishioka house
where you spent the night.

256
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,418
I don't know anything.

257
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,822
I didn't choose to stay in that house

258
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,224
Is there anyone who saw you asleep?

259
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:29,294
I was alone in the room. so no one did...

260
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,197
But it's not me!

261
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,200
I didn't do a foolish thing
as to stab a man.

263
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:36,568
Later,

264
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,322
Kensaku Kawaji was taken to the police
as a material witness

266
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,574
for extortion and attempted murder.

267
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:46,745
But he totally denied attempted murder.

269
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:52,350
He also-denied charges for unlawful entry
into the Nagakura house.

271
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,086
So. the case looked to be closed.

272
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,089
Yr EY

274
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,082
Thank you very much for everything.

276
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,853
Thanks to you, Mr. Mourn,
we were'ablesto get Kawa)

278
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,455
Na. ha. ha.

279
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,891
How about drinking
to the success of getting him.

281
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,326
You ll never...

282
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,296
I would like to say sure...
But .

284
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:24,366
We have to start questioning him.

285
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,667
Of course.

286
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,302
Ha. ha, ha.

287
00:11:27,303 --> 00:11:31,806
Nagakura went through
a series of misfortune, so far

289
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:33,174
It's good hat the case was closed,

290
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,543
uh, rather,
it looked as if it was going to be closed.

292
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:38,513
A series of misfortune?

293
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,215
His son Eiji Nagakura

294
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:44,219
for one thing.
1a a err: ,e nng o 1appen...

297
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:49,957
I'masure of it. Mami.

298
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,762
She came-to see him
because.she believes in his innocence.

300
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:59,734
And Eiji. Tihatfelldw lis not:my son!
Keepithat.in-mind!

303
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,971
Well, because of these things,
ten days ago.

305
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:09,177
They renovated the rooftop after 30 years.

306
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:13,748
And they moved the whole house
to the present site.

308
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,750
Oh! Moved the whole house?

309
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,385
What is it?

310
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:19,654
Theyrmoved that big house?

311
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,157
That's it. That's why.

312
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,893
That explains why the foundation
Iooked so new.

314
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,730
It sure surprised me but that's not all

315
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,866
What

316
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:35,370
- The.:Nagakuna house.was here
until a half month ago?

318
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:37,404
Yes.

319
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:40,408
The house was moved
from here to where it is now.

321
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:43,577
This Otsuzawa house had been over there

322
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:45,279
and they exchanged
the houses all together.

324
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,648
Why did they do that?

325
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,651
They said they did it for complete
reversal or something.

327
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:51,553
It's probably because

328
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:54,889
the place over there commands
the best view in the whole village.

330
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,393
As a representative of promotion
for Earth Heritage application.

332
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:00,260
He managed to do it.

333
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,630
At least some people say so.

335
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:05,332
Well. anyway. they really look alike.

339
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,202
It sure is identical.

340
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,672
You mean to the Nagakura house?

341
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,207
At night, you could easily mistake /
one for the other.

343
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,909
If, the motiv Yof the culprit
had nothing to do

346
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,549
with the application
r the Earth Heritage...

348
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,752
That is, if the culprit simply
made a mistake

350
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:27,789
and took one house for another...

351
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:29,057
Hey. Conan!

352
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,191
What happened to him?

353
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,346
Conan!

354
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,382
Stop running.

355
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:41,669
Just as I thought.
They are identical inside, too.

357
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,904
When he was in the Nagakura house

358
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:45,507
he was somewhere
around here looking for...

360
00:13:46,675 --> 00:13:47,609
Mmm?

361
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,747
I, I've found it.

362
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,383
What? What did you find?

363
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,620
Wow. Great!

364
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,221
Terrific sight to see!

365
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:03,224
Beautiful. very beautiful.

366
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:04,392
Are these 7?

367
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,060
Yeah. Most likely...

368
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,029
Hello?

369
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,398
Oh, it's you. Shin'ichu.

370
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,000
What's that?

371
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:16,904
Tihe jewelry stolen in the robbery case .
Where are they now?

373
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:19,908
They are still missing,

374
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:23,878
Police concluded that
they had been disposed of long time ago.

376
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,813
Speaking of missing.

377
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,152
When he made his escape from the shop.
He took a jewelerhostage

379
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:34,889
and the hostage is still missing.

380
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,928
They say that the hostage was killed
when he was no longer of any use. but...

382
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,063
Ouch! It's hot!
Ah. it's not... it was...ah...

384
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:45,900
It's nothing.
Nothing to do with you at all. Ha, ha

386
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:54,826
Are you alright, Conan?

387
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,910
Are you alright. Conan?

388
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,012
That thing. you know.

389
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,515
We d'better give them to police.

390
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,750
Keep. your voice down.

391
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,753
Well, thanks. ladies. Well, well.
Ha. ha, ha.

393
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:16,397
There's no mistake about it.
The real culprit is that person.

395
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,534
And he will come to that place tonight.

396
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:25,840
I've found it.

397
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:33,915
We've been expecting you,
grandpa.

399
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,583
Ugh!

400
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:38,069
We've been waiting for you.

401
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,354
And you can't run away this time.

402
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,856
What're you talking about?

403
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:45,226
I just couldn't sleep and took a walk

404
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:48,363
but got lost because
the house was so much alike...

406
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,633
Then, what's with that jewelry you have?

407
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:54,902
You broke into the jeweler's shop
in the neighboring town

409
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:55,870
and took them. didn't you?

410
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,072
I don't know what you re talking about.

411
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,041
You can't fool us. grandpa.

412
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,875
You are

413
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,445
the principal culprit of the jewelry robbers
who killed Mr. Eiji Nagakura

415
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,781
and made it look like suicide.

416
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:12,320
Mr. EL Nagakura,
He seems to have been in debt.

418
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,623
That's why he was made to watch out

419
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:18,159
So it was you alone

420
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,362
who carried out the jewelry robbery
and murdered the watchman.

422
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:22,664
I know nothing.

423
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:24,899
What you're talking about is beyond...

424
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,851
When fleeing.

425
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,337
You visited this Onizawa village
as guided by Mr. Eiji Nagakura,

427
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:32,206
You hid the jewelry
you robbed in the Otsuzawa house

429
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:34,375
which was vacant at that time.

430
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,778
You never dreamed that

431
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,113
the house itself would be moved
in half a month.

433
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:44,819
Then, you pinned the guilt
on Mr. Eiji Nagakura alone,

435
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,854
and killed him making
it look like he committed suicide

437
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:50,992
Then you came here as a tourist

438
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,795
to retrieve the jewelry you hid.

439
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:57,098
That's the jewelry in your left hand,
isn't it?

441
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:01,469
That night,

442
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,238
you were looking for the jewelry

443
00:17:04,239 --> 00:17:06,874
as you assumed Mr. Nagakura was away.
But, he saw you,

445
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,243
SO you got out through the window.

446
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,978
That means that you didn't break
into the house

448
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,481
but were inside from the beginning.

449
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:17,719
Mr. Nagakura saw you
when he was on watch

451
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,989
and hurried home.

452
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,357
Yahh.

453
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:25,560
Ugh!

454
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:29,097
Wooh. uh.

455
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:30,565
The watch record shows that

456
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,134
something went wrong with the order
in which the seals were stamped.

458
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,204
I. I'm just an old man

459
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:38,339
and a tourist.

460
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,308
I just found this by accident.

461
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,945
You are not just an old man
and a tourist, and I knew that

463
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:48,116
when I noticed the mark
around your right eye.

465
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,986
\ That mark isithe trace of a loupe

466
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:57,225
The jeweler who was taken as hostage,
murdered, and missing

468
00:17:57,226 --> 00:18:00,695
IS none other than you. Mr. Sakaki.

469
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,332
Surely...

470
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,068
but suppose he kept hiding himself
in fear of the culprit,

472
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,736
Iong after the culprit killed himself,

473
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:14,408
and now he conjured up enough courage
to come out to retrieve the jewelry,

475
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,246
what do you make of this, kids?

477
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,049
you admit that
you were looking for the jewelry

479
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,685
on the third floor
of the Nagakura house last night.

481
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,222
Well. I wouldn't be so sure.

482
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,958
Then you went out through the window

483
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,427
and inured Mr. Na akura. is that ri ht?

485
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:34,796
Oh, that!

486
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:37,832
I was drunk with sake and sound asleep.

487
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,967
So I couldn't possibly have done it.

488
00:18:39,968 --> 00:18:42,937
Then, when and where
did you get the rash?

490
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:50,344
When you were drinking sake together
with Mr. Nagakura,

492
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,146
both of you had no rash
or reddening on you.

494
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:56,384
The people who were with you
at dinner can easily prove it.

496
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:00,588
But the red rash on both of you is
evidence that

498
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:02,272
you were at the same place
at the same time.

500
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,162
Mr. Nagakura!

501
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,262
Call an ambulance!!

502
00:19:09,832 --> 00:19:13,233
The only place the lacquer trees
are growing in the village is that place,

504
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:14,969
there is no other place. That settles it.

505
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,606

And the two houses that
have been moved were returned

609
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,960
and placed back
to where they originally were.

611
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:38,549
He did it because Mr. Nagakura thought
that the spirit of the girl,

613
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,202
who had been a close friend
of his deceased son,

615
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:45,272
had revealed the truth
about the death of his son.

617
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:50,411
Of course, I, the detective of logic
and reasoning didn't believe it =.»

If he didn't do it means he is sloppy or ms

00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,270
Or he foresaw
that somebody else would find it

632
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:17,570

633
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:19,306
