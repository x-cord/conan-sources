1
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:24,177
Today's stage I's an ordinary
Lapartment complex

3
00:00:24,178 --> 00:00:25,378
yooh
Is it-an,accident or a homicide

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,346
A blind spot that cant be
be seen easily

8
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:28,915
He sees through the one and only truth

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,650
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

11
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,652
No case iskleft unsolved,
with) Detective:;Conan

13
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:09,048
Move it, You, get out of here.

14
00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:12,118
You crows sure a nuisance, I tell you...

15
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:28,534
Shoots...Phooey:'there's not
much of anything here, rats...

18
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,869
A.Agh... 1!

19
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:16,249
City Crows

20
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:24,123
I think something happened...

21
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,596
I wonder what kind of case it is?

22
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:32,999
Hey. heyd no\.stand back...

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,867
Oh. what's with you kids...

24
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:38,137
Officer Chiba!

25
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:39,872
No...

26
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,744
T.That's...

27
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,412
A homicide?!

28
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,047
Homicide? Just as I thought!

29
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,548
How frightening! /

30
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:52,585
N.No. It's not a murder case,
its an accident

32
00:03:52,586 --> 00:03:53,519
An accident?

33
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,487
Hmm...God .

34
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,824
It's true. someone is missing

35
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:04,030
Egami Tatsue, a grandma who
used to live here alone.

37
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:07,366
When she was coming back home

38
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:12,104
A flower pot happened -
to fall and hit her.on the head

40
00:04:12,105 --> 00:04:14,373
That fell on her head?

41
00:04:14,524 --> 00:04:17,643
But where did it fall from?

42
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:22,949
That dangerous isnst it?

43
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,384
Its not strange if it fell anytime

44
00:04:25,385 --> 00:04:30,256
That's unacceptable, what kind
of {person is livingkthere?

46
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:35,394
Reom 4045: It's;the apartment. Egami
Tatsue lived in.

48
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:41,600
So that grandma got hit in the
head by the plant she was growing?

50
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:44,003
That is what we believe happened

51
00:04:44,504 --> 00:04:47,406
That's too bad for that Grandma

52
00:04:47,407 --> 00:04:50,126
It's true that its bad for her but...

53
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:52,611
Officer, Chiba, how was it?

54
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:55,948
The neighbors knew of those pots

55
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,285
They asked her to put the pots inside

56
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:02,088
but she didn't listen to them.

57
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:07,793
I see. so if she had listened, this! wouldn't
have happened because of crows

59
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,596
Crows?

60
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,731
Don't you see them??
They're everywhere

62
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:14,734
Don't you see them?
They're everywhere

64
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:22,008
Since it's on the 4th floor,
it's' not likely that a stray ¢at did it.

66
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:26,879
One of those probably dropped
the planter with either their beak or feet...

68
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:39,125
Sigh... Crows sure are strong. aren't they?

69
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:41,927
I wonder if the ¢row is
really the one who did this? ,

71
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:44,296
, There aré no witnesses.
Since it was early in the morning

73
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:46,999
there seems to have
been no one around too.

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,069
Maybe someone who lives. /
opposite here saw something.

77
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,137
Agh?!

78
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,145
Right.:as you can see; it's impossible.

79
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,579
To. be, Killed..by-a. crow.

80
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:03,482
I'm starting to feel more
and more-sorry for granny.

82
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:06,152
There are people
making sarcastic remarks *

84
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:08,554
Iike a crow was killed by a crow.

85
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:10,956
A crow Killed by a crow...

86
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:14,160
It seems that: Tatsue Eue was called

87
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:16,562
grandmothericrow behind her back.

88
00:06:16,563 --> 00:06:18,097
Grandmother crow?

89
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:21,434
She used to go out early in
the morning to make her. rounds

91
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:24,703
going through the trash
that other people threw out.

93
00:06:24,704 --> 00:06:27,773
Moreover, she seems to have
always worn only black clothes...

95
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:32,244
That's why she was called,
grandmother crow, huh...

97
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,980
She had a pretty"bad reputation too.

98
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:38,551
They couldn't standsher going through
their-trash and invading their privacy.

100
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,687
There.even-seems tothave
been people who moved out. ,

102
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:45,290
She was disliked by everyone
in the apartment complex

104
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:49,361
But. why did she do such a thing
as go through other people's trash...?

106
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:51,730
Yeah. well, what'triggered it was...

107
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,441
My. how messy...

109
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:09,482
IV. a oo - -

110
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:12,451
The lottery ticket she found happened

111
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:15,037
to be one for 3rd place or something

112
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,123
So: she seems to h-"Ve
I thought she could find

115
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:19,925
Something valuable again...
«a That seems to have been the /

118
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:22,044
beginning of her reason
Ll for goingAnrBugh trash.

120
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:25,331
Dream come to me once more"...
She hoped. I guess.

122
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:27,199
They took on revenge on her because

123
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,602
she went around looking
Inte other people's trash.

125
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:30,803
Revenge?

126
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:35,708
The crow got mad thinking that
she was going to take away their food.

128
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:38,744
"What's why the crow
dropped the planter ll-see.

130
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:41,680
The crow took revenge
because it invelved food!

132
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:45,851
It's possible, because ¢rows are smart.

133
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:47,820
The old lady seems
to have made her rounds

135
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,622
of the trash dumps this morning too...

136
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:53,092
And when she came back to the
1st floor doorway in order to return

138
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:56,295
to her room, the planter
seems to have fell from above...

140
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,505
Uh? Isn't it funny?

141
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:09,909
The old lady camgyhome
from outside. didn't-sher

143
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,845
From that side then
this way. like this. right?

145
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:15,581
Then she was going
to enter that entrance...

147
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,615
Yeah...

148
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:16,815
Yeah...

149
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,853
I wonder how she came from
in front of the entrance. to this side?

151
00:08:20,854 --> 00:08:22,254
Come tothink of it, you're right...

152
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:23,839
True. If she did go this way,
even If the planter

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,056
True If she did go this way,
even if the planter

156
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:25,991
Tue. If she did go this way
cven if the planter

158
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:29,061
came falling it wouldn't have hither.

159
00:08:29,062 --> 00:08:34,850
The fact is, We thought thatiwas
strange too. the minute we got here.

161
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:39,404
The refrigerator which: was. put-outside
as trash...l mean. because one: of

163
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:43,475
her hands was inserted under it, and
she was lying dead-in a strange position....

165
00:08:45,245 --> 00:08:49,949
But, we figured the reason out,
after we looked under the refrigerator...

167
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,316
1 any
In other words. when she-came back...

169
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:53,052
In other words, when she-came back...

170
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:12,204
and tried to retrieve her coin...

171
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:15,741
the mischievous crow...
dropped the planter...

173
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:19,478
Judging from the circumstances,
this is probably what happened...

175
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,880
Convincing.

176
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:24,750
I really feel sorry for the old lady

177
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:29,288
I wonder if, such a coincidence exists
She happens to drop her coin

179
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:32,891
and i. just happens towroll under
the refrigerator that is put out as trash

181
00:09:32,892 --> 00:09:33,092
Right above her is a row of planters
are hned up And just as she

183
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:36,762
Right above her is a row of planters
are lined up... And just as she

185
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:40,566
tries to retrieve her coin the crow
just so happens to drop the planter...

187
00:09:43,636 --> 00:09:44,770
Oh...

189
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,046
Hey I cy 1 PE
-% Fy a

192
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:11,163
can't make it out to the roof... If

194
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:16,368
What's up. Conan?!

195
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:25,044
The only way it can be done
is from that room on the 5th floor...

197
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,215
Y.You re...

198
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,652
Ms. Imai... Thank you just a while ago.

199
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,455
Thank you for doing your rounds.

200
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:38,057
Have a nice day.

202
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,394
good morning.

203
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:46,465
O...Oh, good morning...?

204
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,005
Ayumi.-do you know her?

205
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,674
Well. she looks very familiar, but...

206
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:59,912
Um: she lives right above
that old lady's room. right?

208
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:05,784
Yeah, we asked her if she saw anything
during our investigation.

210
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:08,787
Does she live with her family?

211
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:11,323
No. I heard she was living alone.

212
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:14,326
But. is something about
her bothering you?

214
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:17,262
Nuhuh, I'll bet you
fell in love: at first sight with her

216
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:21,600
Po you likewolder women like her?

217
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:27,673
I wonder who she is...
I know I met her seamewhere before...

219
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:36,682
This 1s not an accident.

220
00:11:36,683 --> 00:11:39,318
B.But a homicide...?!

221
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:45,991
If the crow hooked
its feet onto the planter

223
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:48,994
it would have fell
upside down or diagonally.

225
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:53,432
Naturally, if the planter fell on
her head it would crack to pieces...

227
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:59,505
But that planter was cracked
as if it had fallen bottom first

229
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,408
Which means

230
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,260
it came falling straight down...

231
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:08,347
In other words, the planter
was not hooked by the crow

233
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:11,016
but rather, removed from
the fence and dropped.

235
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:19,957
Only humans can do something like this!!

237
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:33,255
But... then who killed granny?

239
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:36,058
The person living on the top floor...

240
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,897
She's the only one who could've done it

241
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:42,464
She's the only one who could've done it.

242
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:45,601
I checked and found that
nobody can go out to the roof...

244
00:12:45,602 --> 00:12:49,538
The one who can hang a planter
from granny's window is the one

246
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:53,725
who lives on the floor right above her...
No one other than her could.

248
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,479
Its true that you can't
do it from a lower floor

251
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:03,819
Please wait, Conan. It's true
that she can hang a planter. But...

253
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,623
You're going to ask why
granny was under the window, right?

255
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:12,961
Yes, because granny went there only
because she dropped her coin and

257
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:17,699
it rolled under the refrigerator...
In other words: it was a coincidence.

261
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,634
Right!

263
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:20,702
It's true'that, that part was a coincidence.

264
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:25,774
If so. your deduction
won't work out, Conan. because

266
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:30,112
your can't possibly bring your
target to the place of your choice

268
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:31,046
144 of )
Yes you can

270
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:32,848
How?

271
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:36,251
Well...I've been thinking
from morning. but I still don't know.

273
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:37,920
But, I'm certain...

274
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:39,955
Wrong. Conan!

275
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:43,025
She's not the kind
of person-who would do

277
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:46,028
a frightening thing like that. She's kind!

278
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,630
So. do you know her after all. Ayumi?

279
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:51,500
She wasn't wearing the usual uniform

280
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:53,902
&X AAU) ~~ IDA WE - >
but now I remember

282
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:57,906
If I'm not:mistaken:-she:works at
the bakery sin front of the station.

284
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:03,912
Oh.-:80, you're still in 1st grade.

285
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:06,915
Yep. I go to Teitan Elementary.

286
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,784
You're really fantastic
being able to run errands.

288
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:13,455
Oh. no, not really, anybody can do this.

290
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:15,991
Here you go. thank you, for waiting.

291
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:20,662
When I was in 1st grade,
I was kind ofrdense.

293
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:23,765
Same here... That's how
mostiofeus are in 1st grade.

295
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:26,768
Right: that's how most of us are.

296
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:32,507
I was so embarrassed, so
I haven: ttbeen to that. shopsince then...

298
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,309
She was nice enough to remember me.

299
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,312
I don't see how you can suspect
someone as nice as her.

301
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,782
It's not a very good to suspect people
right off the bat like that. Conan.

304
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,453
Ayumi!

305
00:14:44,454 --> 00:14:46,121
Conan!

306
00:14:46,122 --> 00:14:48,357
Aha. ha...

307
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:59,001
No matter how much you thinkO&™
here is no way to lure

309
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:02,004
the old lady to come
right below the window

312
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:05,507
The poor granny was accidentally killed

313
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,843
by a mischievous crow, after all...

314
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:12,481
No. there is always some way

316
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:19,888
Oh. hey. sonny. it's dangerous?!

317
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,491
Aha. could you wait a while...!

318
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:27,629
So. that's the story...

320
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,170
What's the matter. Conan?

321
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:41,243
I'vé figured out how she lured
granny to. go below the window

323
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:42,577
It's this.

324
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:44,980
What's that?

326
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:47,649
Don't tell me that this is

328
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,517
Yeah,

329
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:52,571
it's the thing that Grandmother Crow
wouldn't miss for the world...

331
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,859
Conan and the others really get me mad.

332
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,797
How dare they suspect
such a nice and'kind lady...

335
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:02,864
Agh?!

336
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:07,269
Gee whiz, they're still
investigating something on her!

338
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:08,070
S== 4

339
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:12,858
Excuse me, about that lady that
works at the bakery over there.

343
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,277
Gt?!
Oh. Ayumi...

345
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:19,081
You know..Conan how sad
do you think a person would feel

347
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:22,818
if sheis«suspected when
there's no proof?! Cut it out. already!

349
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,753
W.Well. you see. Ayumi

350
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:27,756
We've found the evid Thce...

351
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:30,625
Huh No.

352
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,838
Did you want anything with me?

353
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,308
Um, about yesterday...

354
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,845
Um. can you show me your lottery ticket!

356
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:54,716
You bought a lottery ticket yesterday.
Didn't you? Just one ticket

358
00:16:54,717 --> 00:16:58,320
at the lottery ticket sales booth
near the bakery Please show me that.

360
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:02,190
You have it. don't you?

361
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:08,530
Please show it to us.
You have it with you. dong you?

363
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,435
It's okay. already \ umi.

364
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:14,503
Yes.

365
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:15,904
But...

366
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:20,759
It wasn't an accident that
the planter came falling and hit granny!

368
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,845
Although you insist
that it can't be. Ayumi...

370
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:28,617
the only thing thinkable is that
the lady living in that room above did it...

372
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:45,067
She hooked up granny's
planter and got hold of it.

374
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:48,470
Next, a long string was suspended, right?

375
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:55,010
Then you stuck the-lottery ticket
that you bought on the tip of the string

377
00:17:55,011 --> 00:18:01,216
and put it by the entrance
and waited for granny to return.

379
00:18:11,527 --> 00:18:14,930
When granny tried to
pick the lottery ticket up...

381
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:17,632
Noriko pulled the string...

382
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,239
When granny tried
to pick up the lottery ticket...

384
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,442
I don't think you could see granny's head

385
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:30,512
because of the over-sized refrigerator.

386
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:58,740
All you had left to do was
retrieve the lottery ticket, right?

388
00:19:04,914 --> 00:19:08,116
The 500 yen was something
that you had put there

390
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:12,154
to begin with, to camouflage
an unnatural situation, right?

392
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:14,156
I couldn't figure it out at first,

393
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:18,093
but when the trash collectors
came a while ago

395
00:19:18,094 --> 00:19:21,363
I noticed the traces of a string
underneath the refrigerator.

397
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:28,603
Moreover, the ripped part of
the lottery ticket was found there too.

399
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:29,404
Moreover, the ripped part of
the lottery ticket was found there too

401
00:19:30,273 --> 00:19:36,878
With the torn piece of lottery ticket,
I'm sure we'll find your fingerprints on it...

403
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:43,151
It's okay, you don't have to go out
of your way to look for the fingerprints

405
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:50,025
But. why, why did you kill granny?

406
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:55,881
She made me look like a fool,
at the bakery I work for

408
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,736
See, see

409
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:07,158
Iiread your letter.
Af: What-allaugh this letter is. LooK at it

411
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:09,711
Why do you have that?

412
00:20:09,712 --> 00:20:10,111
Why do you have that?

413
00:20:10,112 --> 00:20:12,514
I ripped it and threw it away!

415
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:17,719
you're grandmother crow.

416
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,055
You got it from the trash.

417
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:21,522
Give-it.back'to me!!

418
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:31,066
Hah; ha: hadha,
just:.what do.you think:yousre doing. 4

420
00:20:31,067 --> 00:20:33,068
Talk abolit being:scatterbrained:

421
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,070
I'mYgoing to enjoy myself
with-this letter for a while.

423
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:39,274
He's-ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha.

424
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:45,614
It was a le ter of
goodbye fromimy boyfriend.

426
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:52,887
How cruel. I was trying to forget him
But she had the nerve to-go out of

428
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:57,225
her way to pick it up and laugh
about it on top of shewing It to others

430
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,560
But...

432
00:21:02,732 --> 00:21:07,102
You're stilljlittle, so
you may not understand. But,

435
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:12,307
you'll eventually find out
that there are things that

437
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:17,178
people cannot forgive even
if it seems to be very trivial...

439
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:20,015
But...No matter.how unforgivable.

440
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:24,152
You're not supposed to take
other people's lives, Noriko!

442
00:21:28,657 --> 00:21:30,025
You're right.

444
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:53,647
Will you please accept this.
I can't possibly take it with me $0.

446
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:54,349
ANY 4

447
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:55,416
pd . NO

448
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:59,187
What is it?

449
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:01,156
Wow!

450
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:11,433
I understand how sad you must've
been at that time even if I'm a child

452
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,685
But,

453
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:17,689
what's bad is bad!

454
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:23,578
Exactly, Ayumi

455
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:30,819
City crows . sure are sinners .

that person we saw a while ago!
Whi¢h means...

504
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:10,018
The two cases must be different cases
with no connection to each other.

506
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,687
It can only be explained:
as a case of synchronicity.

If Takehike was really*Killed.,
