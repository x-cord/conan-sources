00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:05,338
and the light of truth pierces through
the most mysterious case.

4
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,340
Today's case is a very strange kidnapping.

Boy what a terrific shew!

13
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,299
The animals were $0 cute.

14
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:32,138
That white lion's act was especially good!

15
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,774
Well. that lion is the!star of the show...

16
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,042

00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,336

He's the man
who sponsors the animal show

38
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,883
that's Randy Hawk!

39
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,753
He's from Oklahoma,
a southern state in the United States.

41
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:26,325
He struck it rich in oil and
he started collecting animals as a hobby,

43
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,163
but then his son Paul and daughter Annie
also becam. interested in animals

45
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:35,901
and now they take
their animal show all over the world.

47
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,003
That's right!

48
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:38,771

49
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,341
His picture's on the last page
of the pamphlet.

51
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,245

around the world with Kits show.

and going to the zoo in each country... ¢

54
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,683
According to him,

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,953
he says. We've been cowboys

58
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:57,356
that's why he doesn't take bodyguards
with him when he travels

60
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,426
I heard him say it on television!

61
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,262
He speaks Japanese very 'well...

62
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,098

63
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,333

My name isn't Hawk...

Oh come on, you can't fodl us...

68
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,512
Is it true that you're donating
half the Pp oceeds of your show

70
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:21,981
to zoos all overt e world?

72
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,118
You haven't been toe Japan
in three years, how does it feel?

74
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,420
Please say something!! Mr. Hawk!!

75
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,490
Mr. Hawk!? Mr. Hawk!'?

76
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,258

huh?

128
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,776
I wanted this so badly.

129
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,245
That's why I came all the way to Japan!

130
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,714
Oh. we bought that one too!

131
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:40,853
But that strap's popular around-the world,
It's sold everywhere...

133
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,589
you didn't have to come to Japan for it...

134
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,459
No. no... look at the back of the strap!

135
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,330
It says In Japan'. doesn't it?

137
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,731
This istthe only place you can get-it!

138
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:57,870

139
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,204
However...

140
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,474
that incident back there was
very, very unfortunate!!

142
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,310
I didn't get to meet my friend,

143
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,713
we were supposed
to meet after the show!

145
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,983
Did you happen to see
a man with long hair?

147
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,050
I don't think sO...

148
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,586
After all. that. place was packed...

149
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:15,888
Oh...

150
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,157
and you're very astute...

151
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,826
how did you-know he wasn't Mr. Hawk...

152
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,661
It's the way he talked...

153
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:24,463
The way he talked?

154
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,431
What!?

155
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,366
Mister,

156
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,004
back there you pronounced
the word can't as count, didn't you?

158
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,573
That's the Queen English...

159
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,276
If you came from a long line of cowboys,

160
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:41,413
then there's no way a man from the South
would have an English accent

162
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,716
it just seemed unnatural!

163
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,485
Now that you mention it,

164
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,520
the Mr. Hawk I saw on TV had

165
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,423
a strong Southern draw!
And spoke rather loudly...

168
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,427
I looked at the picture
in the pamphlet very carefully

170
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,062
and saw it was completely different!

171
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,430
But then

172
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,300
I don't blame the Japanese reporters
for making that mistake...

174
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,070
Like Westerners can't tell
one Oriental from the other.

176
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:09,842
We Orientals can't tell
one Westerner from another

178
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,976

and skin coloring...

don't you feel something about that guy?

257
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,396
No. not really...

258
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,531
I see...

259
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,099
guess it's all right then...

260
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,090
Excuse me sir...

261
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,359
We're with the police...

262
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,161
IS this your car?

263
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,696
Y, yes...

264
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,432
this is the car I'm renting...

265
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,867
I see

266
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,403
Actually, this is a stolen vehicle.

267
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,472
Oh not!

268
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,109
It was reported stolen a week ago...

269
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,278
Could you tell us where you rented it
and give us:the details...

271
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:05,317
We'd also like your name and the name
of the hotel you're staying at...

273
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,853
Rather than stand here
in the middle of the street,

275
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,489
Why. don:tjwe go to the police car
on the other side of the alley...

277
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,457
Do you mind?

279
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,763
We won't take up too much of your time...

281
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,566
Huh?

282
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,201
What's the matter!? *

283
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,874
please get in...

284
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:30,776
Oh...

285
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,079
I just remembered
I have friends waiting for me!

287
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,015
May I go-and tell them I'll be late?

288
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:37,816
Huh!)

289
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,753
Get in...

290
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:44,690
What!?

291
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,726
Shut up and get in the car!!

292
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:53,832
Huh!?

293
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,335
What is it?

294
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,904
The guy dropped something...

295
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,845
It's just a strap...

296
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,949
Okey! Let's get going.

297
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:11,783
All right!

298
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,092
Ouch!

299
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,994
Look what you did. I cut my finger...

300
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,629
Good grief...

301
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,931
what a bother.

302
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,899
Y. you men...

303
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,002
You're not really police offiers,
are you?

305
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,637
Be quiet...

306
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,107
You're just a cowboy wanna be
that:come into a lot of money...

308
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,942
No. you're wrong!!

309
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,577
I. I'm not...

310
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,414
You made your money by whipping
poor defenseless animals...

312
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,916
We just want you to share it with us...

313
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,659
That's strange...

314
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:57,562
40 minutes...have gone by already...

315
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,297
He's so lété...

316
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,500
I wonder what-he's doing...

317
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,668
I'm so hungry.

318
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,870
Ome on,

319
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,972
Doctor Agasa an wait here,

320
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,374
the rest of us will go check on him!

321
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:10,475
Good idea.

322
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:15,180
Thére aren't that many parking lots
(around here in walking distance...

324
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,015
Ail, come with us!

325
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:17,582
Okey

326
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:18,984
Sure...

327
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,189
I wonder if this is the place...

328
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,926
Mr. Black! Mr. Black!!

329
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,428
Hey, .are you in here?

330
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,864
Oh...we're-not looking for-cats...

331
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,000
Mr Black!

333
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,171
"Found it!

334
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,472
I'm sure this is it!

335
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,374
This is his car.

337
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,912
ee eres as u ec ion
by the driver's seat...

339
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:52,083
But...there's nobody inside.

340
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,252
The door was left open...

341
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,821
the key are still inside...

342
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,922
Hey you guys!

343
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,523
You looking for somebody?

345
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,060
If it's the foreigner with the beard,

346
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,030
he was going to get inside the car
but went that way

348
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,598
with two guys wearing coats!!

349
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,232
Ehh!?

350
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:11,736
Hum?

351
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,205
Oh!? Hey Conan!!

352
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,284
Conan.

353
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,552
Rat's the matter?

354
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,554
Hey! Did you find him?

355
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,223
Co. Conan?

357
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,292
it's @ lion Strap, isn't it...?

358
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,795
I wonder if it's Mr.Black's...

359
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,163
If it is .

360
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,732
This is where he probably got
into another car...

362
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:47,806
He did say he was suqpbssédl to mes'? I
a friend .didn't he...

365
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,711
do you think that guy forgot all about us

366
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:56,081
and went to go eat with his friend?

368
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,450
I don't believe it.

369
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,552
No, I don't think he forgot.

370
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,319
Pn my

372
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,154
Most likely...

373
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:06,458
He got himself mixed up in something...

376
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,831
Look at this strap!

377
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,133
Eh!?

378
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,573
The P & A have been smeared
with blood.

380
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,308
Maybe

381
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,344
he was trying .to leave us a mesage

382
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,114
because he thought we might come
to look for him...

384
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,181
don't, ou think so?

385
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,449
Ehh!?

386
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,885
Th, that's terrible!!

387
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,954
We've got to call police...

388
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,022
She's right!

389
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,556
But...

390
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:39,858
what?

391
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,459
Don't get it.

392
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,695
Why the P & A...

393
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,368
It was so easy!

394
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,004
Now all we've got:to:do.is

395
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:57,208
see how much this moneybag's
son and daughter will dish out for him...

397
00:17:57,343 --> 00:18:00,011
I'm thinking 5 million at least...

398
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,781
After all this guy has
SO Much money to spare

400
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,217
he gives it away to all kinds of zoos...

401
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,653
Oh well...

402
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,221
we can thank you

403
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:15,093
for fixing this car up to look:like
areal cop car not to mention...

405
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,732
Mr. Hawk here...
Who thinks he's some tough cowboy

407
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:25,337
and wonders around without
a bodyguard to protect him

410
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:27,639
You've made a mistake!!

411
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,607
I'm not Hawk!!

412
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:30,909
My name's James Black!!

413
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,310
You've got the wrong man!!

414
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,645
James?

415
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,450
First a cowboy. now; you're
an English secret agent?

417
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,551
Huh 2

418
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:40,919
No. not!

419
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,588
Oh, you mean James Bond!!

420
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,956
Never mind...

421
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,992
That's not important.

422
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,298
I just want you to keep your mouth shut
until we get to our hideout...

424
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:53,964
heh...

425
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,204
Mr. 007...

426
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,012
Just you watch...

427
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,515
how we snatch the ransom...

428
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,318

2]: FAI». oELY

447
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,166
BAD FEHL OILY

448
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:35,906
What. Ni?

449
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,541
Pay attention

450
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,778
I've been trying to explain...

451
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,714
he's a foreigner and
he has glasses and beard...

453
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,817
he's teen involved
In some accident or something!

455
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,854
He might have been
kidnapped or something!!

457
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,357
But boys...

458
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:57,529
you didn't actually see him
being kidnapped. did you?

460
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:58,797
Besides...

461
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,599
There are a lot of foreigners
with beards and glasses.

463
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,401
We wouldn't know where to begin...

464
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,137
It would be easier...
if you had a picture or something...

466
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,808
I've got a picture!

467
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:10,809
Hum.»

468
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,976
If you need a picture!

469
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:12,844
Here!

470
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,045
This is how he looks!"

471
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,248
this is Randy Hawk!

472
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,150
If this is the guy. he's safe!

473
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:21,685
I just heard him talking on the radio...

474
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,755
No. you don't undersrand!

475
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:27,826
James Black looks just like Randy Hawk!!

477
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,161
Listen...

478
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,098
was tr at radio program a live broadcast?

479
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,599
Yes,

480
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,968
that's right...ll think he's still on...

481
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,570
vy) .
Es, more wan I ey...

483
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,038
Pat's not good...

484
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:45,777
if the men kiddnapped Mr.Black
thinking he was Randy Hawk,

486
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,713
they'd probably listen to
the radio program

489
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,781
he Wa supposed to be on,
wouldn't they?

491
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,183
Oh no!

492
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,285
Then they're bound to find out the truth...

494
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,123
after they find out
they've got the wrong man...

496
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,127
they'll probably kill him...

497
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,461

We planned when we got
to-the mountains in Gunma...

520
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,246

521
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,982
we'll figure out another plan...

522
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:58,750
okey?

523
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,387

524
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,422

525
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,291
we won't get caught...

526
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:10,595
the cops have noidea who we are

527
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,130
and besides...

528
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:16,668

as to why some foreigner

530
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,237
would get kidnapped.
