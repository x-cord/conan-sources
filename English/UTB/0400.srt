1
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:05,939
Stars are for some reason attractive

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,741
They can "bathe culprit or the actor

3
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:09,610
Ran's suspicion has finally
come to the truth,

5
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:11,378
The password brings her
even closer to the truth

7
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:12,945
Its a one-on-one battle
between love and deduction.

9
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,548
He sees through the one and only truth

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,916
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

12
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,752
No case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

18
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,228
I'm done

19
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:09,997
It was delicious.

20
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,534
Okay~then, hit the sack right this minute!
Its already after midnight...

22
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:14,935
Yes, sit

23
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,970
Oh. wait.

25
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,071
Huh,
What is it... Ran?

27
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:20,841
Huh,
What is it Ran?

29
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:24,912
Huh yeah.
Well. you know

31
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:26,914
Brush your teeth and go to sleep now.

32
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:31,084
Y. Yep. I know. Heh. heh. heh .

33
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:36,023
What's with him? Ho sooms oddly jitory

35
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:42,095
I'm suspicious of his true Identity

36
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:46,099
Shinichi...

37
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:50,554
Oh, no...l may have forgotten
to lock the dodr of the office!

39
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:53,840
Make sure you lockdit before
going to bed then.

41
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,176
Boy, am FSIOODY. ..

42
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,884
Whether what I suspect is true.

43
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,664
There's only one way for me to check .

44
00:03:24,472 --> 00:03:27,274
Suspicious Ran

46
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,952
I'm going to return the car...

48
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,495
Agh...

49
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:59,022
Conan's cell phone...
if the mail that I sent is inside...

51
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:03,644
it'll serve as definite evidence
that Conan is Shinichi...

53
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:08,081
Just as I thought the cell phone
is switched off so that

55
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,484
the sound of my mail sent out
to him won't ring.

57
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,519
But, you've no choice already,
once the cell phone's switched on

59
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,022
everything will become clear.

60
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,625
But. wait. as thldwlfii you really want?

61
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:24,931
What if Conan is really Shinichi...
How are you going to face up to him?

63
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,967
Tins Day 8.

64
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:29,886
C.@uto.

65
00:04:29,887 --> 00:04:31,938
Ugh ..M.My heart

66
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,239
Ugh. MM My heart

67
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,044
He's always been mean since his-childhood
days and always full of confidence

69
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:40,112
He s a deduction freak. whose always
there in time of need &hd courageous.

71
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,484
He's cool . and I like Shinichi
more than anyone else

73
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,790
I. can't sleep!

74
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,045
It was sure a lot of fun
washing each other's back. wasn't it .

76
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,179
Ugh?!

78
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,533
My. your nose is bleeding?
Maybe the water was too hot?

80
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:04,004
Maybe I should just wait until he decides to
tell me from his side after all...

82
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,673
He must have a reason,

83
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,810
and besides, it's not nice peeking
to other people's cell phone...

85
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:14,631
But, all I'm going to do is check whether
the mail I sent is inside or not...

87
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:18,118
If that's all I'm going to do. it's okay,
isn't it?

89
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,986
Sorr . Shinichi!

90
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,627
Oh I see! So. just as I expected. .

91
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:32,215
But, most times I guess the password
would be his birthday or something...

93
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,535
BAH =

94
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:40,439
I guess, it's not all that simple...
Now what?

96
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,580
There are 10.000 possible matches
for 4-digit numbers,

98
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:50,250
and it would take at least 8 hours
to try them all out.

100
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,520
What other possibility could there be...
Oh ma be m birthday...

102
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:58,992
How silly, of course not...

103
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:07,334
Impossible...
Hmm No way!

105
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:11,471
But, I guess there's no harm trying?
Yeah.

107
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,172
Uh. mine is .

108
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,740
Uh. mine is .

109
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:19,663
But, what shall I do

110
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:22,816
If it Is, what should I do .

111
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:25,201
=7" My

113
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:31,208
Oh. so. it's not after all! HMM.

114
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,828
What number is it. then?!

115
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,499
Tell me what it is.

116
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:46,173
Rats
No. Ran. cool head...

118
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:52,045
It seems they both went to sleep
Nobody will bother me here...

120
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:56,449
and a slight sound is net audible...
I've got all the time in the world too.

122
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:13,133

Yawn
No good

126
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,541
At this rate. it's going to take me till morning

127
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,478
I guess I'll just have to try to figure out the
numbers that Shinichi is most likely to use.

129
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:30,750
He likes Holmes

130
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:35,355
Maybe the number is the year in
which Holmes handled a case...

132
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,992
No, that can't be it,
because I just checked all the numbers

134
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,211
from 1 to over 2000 just a while ago .

136

00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:55,795
And bean curd shop without the

198
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,667
In recent years people get to choose

00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,670
their number plates
as long as they request it,

202

00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:27,073
Darn!

268
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:34,647
Officer! A car with a
fraudulent license plate just went by...

270
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,182
A fraudulent license plate?

271
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:41,454
It's a black sedan with the plate number
Shinjuku510-shi 15-64

273
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:46,226
Hmm, but how do you know that the car
has a fraudulent license plate number. 7?

275
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:51,197
Agh... .15-64="hitogoroshi which
means murderer

277
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:54,000
Huh...?! Ha. ha .

278
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:58,404
I mean you guys, just because
the number can be read "'murderer'...

280
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:02,141
The point 18 not the numbers,
but rather. the hiragana character.

282
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:06,412
There should be no license plate numbers
with the characters'shi and "he"!

284
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:11,284
Going around like that with a fraudulent
Iicense plate numbers goes to show

286
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:16,723
that the ones who thought out
a crime are about to execute it...

288
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:19,559
You've got to go after them!

289
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,162
Okay!
Leave it to me!

00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,898

00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,445
So. what happened after that

297
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,948
Yep. I was worried

298
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:48,888
Sorry sorry Those guys fell under the
categor number "510" and not "15-64".

300
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,957
Huh?! 510"7?

301
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,759
510-"goto" which means robber!

302
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,629
But thanks to my deduction
it ended in just an attempt .

304
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:59,065
So they were arrested!

Well. ..if I were to pick a number

336
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,581
I wonder what Shinichi was trying to say .

337
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:26,853
If it's a four digit number,
he could be using it as a pass code...

339
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:39,098
But. a play on words. could be it.

340
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,666

before I got mail from Ran though.

I locked the cell phone to buy time,

442
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:25,024

was a bit too difficult.

But that's the only play on words I could
find that was common for both Conan and I.

voice after such a long time...

Because even if I want to hear his voice

459
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:41,406
it's hard for me to get a hold of him
from m side...

461
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:46,345

There's no deep meaning to it...

I may call you at the wrong time. you know?

471
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,768
No...but I'm so busy that most times
all you'll get is my answer phone...

473
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,972

that can't be relayed correctly

475

478
00:21:18,545 --> 00:21:22,397
