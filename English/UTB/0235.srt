Hi, everybody,

00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,518
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting

191
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,856
I thought the party was going to end
the way things were going.

193
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,691
Pardon me for my rudeness.

194
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,960
Right! What do you say that we...

195
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,430
change plans for Wine tasting

196
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,967
and have Mr. Tonomura, the sommelier
pick out the right wine?

199
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,338
well, it does sound interesting, but...

200
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,908
If he's a sommelier it's only natural
that he chooses all the wines correctly.

202
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,677
Well,

203
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:49,081
if Mr. Kusaka sugge'St's so, he must have,
some very secret item in his possession;

205
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,784
It is only natural for asommelier
to get the names of the wines right,

207
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,153
but If he misses, he loses face.

208
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,189
Therefore, there's got to be some merit
for going through this...

210
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,925
Okay, then let's do this.

211
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,927
If'Mr. Tonomuna gets all the wines right,

212
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,131
I'll take on the you know what" thing...

214
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,067
I 366,

215
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,569

to your heart's content.

218

Good wine...

221
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,796

jUSt as expected of you Mr. Tonomura...

228
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,812
There's far more to go,
he's just warming up...

231
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,359
this is very rare wine indeed!

232
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,528

Well, utterly fantastic!

239
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,207
He sure is a true sommelier!

240
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,977
It's as if he knew what wines were going
to be given to him!

242
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,415
Not really, everything so far requires only
a beginner sommelier's knowledge.

244
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,552
Oh, well. well...

245
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,820
I'm so scary

246
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,888
that all the wine I have offered
you to taste so far were all for beginners

248
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,258
Let me give you
the best of my collection then!

252
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,733

253
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,168

255
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,471

258
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,543

260
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,512
I'm a bit pooped myself.

261
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,952
I'm going to get
a bit of fresh air and sober up

263
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,955
I guess I'll go to the restroom...

264
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,558
Boy, was I nervous, weren't you?

265
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,226
Yep.

281
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,827

Mr. Mouri, how is my husband...

303
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,713
Mrs. Kusaka, please call the police.

304
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,582
Your husband's been killed!

305
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:20,819
Mrs. Kusa'ka

306
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,255
Mrs. Kusaka, please get
a hold of yourself!

308
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:23,956
Mrs KusakaH

309
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,390
Why...

310
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,228
Why is he lying
in such an unnatural position.

312
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,497
Why.

313
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,606
The victim IS Shohei Kusaka, age 52.

314
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:45,344
He is the man of this house and.
Runs a financial institution.

316
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:50,883
The cause of death is suffocation
due to strangulation by the rope

318
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,351
that was found around his neck

319
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,854
Can you explain the circumstances
when you found the body?

321
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,222
Yes, sir.

322
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:01,058
Since Mr. Kusaka did not come back
from the wine cellar for quite a while,

324
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,762
I came here to check on him
together with Mrs. Kusaka...

326
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,266
Then we found him lying on his back
on the floor...

328
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,803
And, what about the door, was it locked?

329
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,272
Yes.

330
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,005
Inspector!

331
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:19,010
Mrs. Kusaka told me that these are
the keys that Mr. Kusaka had on him

333
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,980
They are the key to the wine cellar
and to the house...

335
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,284
The door of the wine cellar auto locks,

336
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:29,187
and the only ones who had both keys
were Mr. and Mrs. Kusaka.

338
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,455
She's says there are no other spare keys.

339
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,992
So, the door auto locks...

340
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,963
Mr. Tome, How's the window over there?

341
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,399
Nothing here.

342
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,870
There is dust accumulated
on the dust shelf

344
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,272
and there are no traces of anyone
having broken in from outside...

346
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:52,744
Besides, as you can see, the handle
on this wmdow is on the inside,

348
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,448
it would be extremely difficult to open
and Close the window from the outside.

350
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:56,682
\ LsTIWTIM

351
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,718
Moreover, look there.

352
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,654
That's an alarm system,

353
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:09,226
so if the window is forced open, the alarm
system is set to go off immediately.

355
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,130
The switch to that alarm system is this.

356
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,002
When you push the switch of the remote
control that is attached to the keys.

358
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,771
The alarm system is turned off

359
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,505
and the window can be opened.

360
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,509
And, when the window is closed again,

361
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,178
the alarm system switches back on

362
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,814
Isee...

363
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,351
It'd be imposs'iblegor the killer
to go in and our of that window...

365
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:33,986
If so,

366
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,022
we can narrow down the killer quite a bit,
can't we, Inspector?

368
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,760
I mean, the killer is an acquaintance
of Mr. Kusaka.

370
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:46,598
The person probably had Mr. Kusaka
himself open the door

372
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,266
and came into the wine cellar,

373
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,969
then, committed the murder...

374
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,973
Wine bottles were probably cracked
and lying around Mr. Kusaka

376
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,276
beause the killer and Mr. Kusaka had
a fist fight or something?

378
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,878
Most likely!

379
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,779
But, wouldn't that be sort of strange too?

380
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,950
Because, look over there.

381
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,620
The wine bottles all fell only
from the very top of this low shelf,

383
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,923
and nothing's wrong with
the wine bottles on this side.

385
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,993
If they really had-a fist fight
in a clustered place like this,

387
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,663
wouldn't everythin'g be more messed up?

388
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,465
I see...that's true...

389
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:26,404
Just coincidence!

390
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,941
What are these traceswon the floor...

391
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,644
The two traces seem to
have been made by

393
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,146
rubbing something strongly
against the floor

395
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:40,085
Inspector, let's go take a look at
the back of the house

397
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,821
If there are no traces of anyone
having come in from the back door,

399
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,822
Wait a sec...
If there are no traces of anyone
having come in from the back door,

402
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,057
somebody that is in this house
has got to be the killer.

404
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:45,891
Maybe...
somebody that is in thus house
has got to be the killer.

407
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:46,658
Maybe...

408
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,898
There are no traces of the back door
having been broken into.

410
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,635
Maybe a spare key was secretly made...

411
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,305
Oh, I think that IS unthinkable.

412
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,474
What do you mean?

413
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:06,545
The keys of this house are
all special electronic keys.

415
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,481
An electronic key IS not something

416
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,250
that you can easily have made
in a hardware store in town.

418
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,353
You can't make a spare unless
you place an order to the manufacturer

420
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,488
Now,

421
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,258
it's pretty much definite that the killer is
someone who is within the premises!

423
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,059
Hmm!

424
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,462
Where are the people of this house
and the guests?

426
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:24,362
Yes,

427
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,264
I have xthem waiting in the living room!

428
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,099
Okay,

429
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,500
Iet's go hear them out.

430
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,240
Hey, Conan

431
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,175
Just what do you think
you're doing up there?!

433
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,778
Oh, um, -w-;well,

434
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,747
practicing the horizontal bar.

435
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,148
What?

436
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:43,715
Inspector

437
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,984
What's the matter, Chiba?

438
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,854
We got a report from the identification
officers just now saying that

440
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:49,988
they found two pairs of finger prints

441
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,391
other than that of the Kusaka's
on the door of the wine cellar

443
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,595
One was that of Yukari Takano,
a guest at the party.

445
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,598
And the other one of Jokichi Tonomura!

446
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:00,565
What?!

447
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,068
Okay, let's go to the living room}!

448
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,902
Yes, sir!

449
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,904
Take care of Conan, will you,
Officer Chiba!

451
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:06,905
Yes, sir!

452
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,240
What?!

453
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,048
Um, Officer Chiba.

454
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,017
What is it, Conan...?

455
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,952
Um...

457
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,759
I haven't heard that something like
that has been found.

459
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:29,928
Have you heard anything Mr Tome?

460
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,029
NC»,

461
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,564
I haven't heard of any such report.

462
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,601
I've found conclusive evidence

463
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,871
The killer still had the stuff,
not being able to throw it away

465
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,674
W,What?!

466
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,544
Are you saying
that the killer is among us?!

468
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,079
Please give us a decent explanation
Inspector!

470
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,215
I'm saying that judging
from the circumstances at the scene,

472
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:55,487
it is most likely that someone
in this house had committed the murder.

474
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,790
That goes for you two in particular,
Mr Tonomura and Ms. Takano!

476
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:03,628
The fingerprints of you two were found
on the door of the wine cellar.

479
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,631
H,Hey, hold it there, will you.

480
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,767
I did go to the wine cellar!

481
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,436
To ask him to loan me more money.

482
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,172
But, I didn't go inside!

483
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,641
How about you, Ms. Takano?

484
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,277
I went to the wine cellar to ask him to

485
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,413
extend the period of
which to repay my loan,

487
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,081
but I didn't go inside either!

488
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,852
And, young. Nonaka?

489
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,286
Huh?

490
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,157
After Mr. Kusaka left the room,
I was strolling around the yard.

492
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,060
So, I haven't gone to the wine cellar.

494
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,428
I DUE

495
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,030
Where were you, Mrs. Kusaka?

496
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,634
I was in the kitchen right through;

497
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,837
In order to go to the wine cellar;
I had to come through this living (room .

499
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,973
where Mr. Mouri and everyone else wereao

500
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,277
I was seated at the table of
the living room all the while,

502
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,746
but Mrs. Kusaka never left
the living I'oom!

504
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,414
Hey,pbps.

505
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,052
I found something strange
in the wine cellar...

507
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,421
Something strange?

508
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,393
Hey, Conan...where is it?

509
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,262
That strange stuff. . .?

510
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,634
I'd like you to call my lawyer

511
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,235
Right!

512
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,204
I won't say a word till then?!

513
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:22,240
Well, well, let's not get all excited...

514
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,844
EXCUSE me for a moment...

515
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,546
Hello, Megure here.

516
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,918
What?! you've-fig'Ured
out Who the killer is?!

518
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,626
Well. everyone, let me explain...

519
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,497
How this ruthless
murder was committed...

521
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,198
and disclosed who did it too!!

522
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,171
Just a while ago, I mentioned that
the killer is among the three people here.

524
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,608
There is no doubt about that!

525
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,541
What?!

526
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,546
First, the two whose
fingerprints were found on the door...

528
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,050
Mr. Tonomura and Ms. Takano...

529
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,452
However, they are not the killers!

530
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,755
Hey, then are you
saying that the killer is not here?

532
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,224
No, no. The killer is here.

533
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,828
H,Here, then...

534
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,098
Yes!...Mr. Nonaka,

535
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:21,967
The killer is you!

536
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,906
W,Wait. I was in the yard at that time.

537
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,710
I didn't even go near the wine cellar!

538
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,146
Shall we replay the situation then?

539
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,084
First, you went around to the backyard,

540
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,453
and knocked on the
window of the wine cellar.

542
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,361
Oh, I forgot to mention the role of the
killer will be played by Officer Chiba

544
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:55,767
Then Mr. Kusaku turned off the
alarm system and opened the window...

546
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,268
Officer Takagu!

547
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,403
Y,Yes sir!

548
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,271
Please play the role of the vnctim...

549
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,240
Yes, sir...

550
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:12,017
Mr. Nonaka, then you lured
Mr. Kusaku out into the yard.

552
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,854
Saying something like you
would explain what trick

554
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,189
Mr. Tonomura used
during the wine tasting

556
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:24,162
Mr. Nonaka, you killed Mr. Kusaku in
the backyard when he was off guard...

558
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,798
Then you went around to the backdoor,
Iocked the door with the keys you took,

560
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,934
and then put the keys
back into the victim's pocket.

562
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:35,373
Wait, Mr. Mouri, then how did
he put Mr. Kusaku into the wine cellar?

564
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,876
Even if he were to throw
him in from the window,

566
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,079
wouldn't it be impossible to
Iie him down in the center of the cellar?

568
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,149
He used the clothes rack pole!

569
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,418
The clothes rack pole?

570
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:50,221
Mr. Nonaka lined two poles up together

571
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,891
and laid the dead body on it like so.

572
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,294
He pulled the pole
through Mr. Kusaku's belt

574
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,064
to keep the space between
the poles from widening.

576
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,334
Then he pushed the
poles through the window...

578
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,537
and if you tilt the angle...

580
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,507
II DUE

581
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,611
The wine'abottles broke when Mr. Kusaku's
Iegs knocked them off the shelf!

583
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,681
Finally the pole is pulled out...

584
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,820
It, It is similar to the time
Mr. Kusaku was found,

586
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,254
what about the window ?

587
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,058
He hooked a narrow wire or
something on the tab of the window

589
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,094
then pulled on it with all his might.

590
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,930
It closed

591
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,733
In this way/, it is
possible to lie Mr. Kusaku

593
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,471
on the floor between the shelves
without coming into the wine cellar.

595
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,072
That's all a bunch of baloney

596
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,074
Do you have evidence,
where's the proof

598
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,743
Would you be so kind to show
me your handkerchief?

600
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,816
The one with your initials
on them that Mr. Kusaku gave you

602
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:56,187
When Mr Kusaku was
dropped, some wine bottles broke

604
00:20:56,188 --> 00:21:00,325
Wine would then naturally
splatter onto the poles.

606
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:04,462
But, no wine was found on the poles!

607
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:10,034
That's because you wiped off the wine to
hide your trick of having used the poles!

609
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,304
Since you didn't expect
the wine bottles to break,

611
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,573
you wiped it off with
the handkerchief you had!

613
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,877
I'm sure you still have it with you,

614
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:22,814
because if you threw it away,
it would be obvious that it's yours!

616
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,351
N, No!

617
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,287
He's, He's to blame

618
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,556
He lends money and demands
ridiculously high interest.

620
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,458
Then, when it becomes
inconvenient for him,

622
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,126
he demands that you pay
him back the next day!

624
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,262
You've got to be kidding
I've got employees to feed too!

626
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,798
That's why I did for the
sake of everyone else!!

628
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,699
You foo!

629
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:45,537
No matter what your
reasons are, murder is murder!

631
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,807
You can't look away from
the fact that you took someone's life!!

633
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,278
Think deeply about it!!
