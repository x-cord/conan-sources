1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,535
Friendship. Romance, Mystery

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,371
Because we cherish them we can continue

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:10,743
He sees through the one and only truth,

4
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:11,777
A child inappearance

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:12,544
with the I.Q. of an adult

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:13,445
no case is left unsolved

7
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:14,963
with Detective Conan.

8
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:31,589
<< 2D

9
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:55,547
Wedding at Huis Ten Bosch...

10
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,404
The rings nowhere in sight...

11
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:06,525
It so small that it can be hidden
anywhere too

13
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,160
Hey, Ran... 7?!

14
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,229
What's the matter. Ran?

15
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,298
I'm worried,
so lym going\to go see how Akane is...

17
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,266
Ran!

18
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,272
What are the bad things that happened
that grandma was talking about?

20
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,107
Oh... that...

21
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:26,678
Recently, there were two incidents
here we experienced close calls...

23
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,620
Ma'am!! The brakes aren't working!!

24
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,360
Whaaa!!

25
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,165
M. Ma am?!

26
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,836
The second time was

27
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,738
on a clear. fine morning...

28
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,606
When was takingra walk with grandma

29
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,941
along Holland Slope near 'our house...

30
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:57,843
Huh

31
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,345
Look out!!

32
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:03,482
Well,

33
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,551
wé were saved by ashairsbreadth, but...

34
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,754
\ losing the ring is
the third bad thing that happened

36
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,557
so Grandma Taeiis probably fed up...

37
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,101
Akane...

38
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,314
Strange.

39
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,251
I'm sure that someone who
came into the waiting room took it, but...

41
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,452
Sonoko!

42
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,157
Ran!

43
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,194
A. Akane is not in the waiting room!

44
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,128
What?!

45
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,197
Meave. heave

46
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,099
the wedding dress was on the chair

47
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,734
and Akane was nowhere in sight...

48
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,536
Don't tell me that

49
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,672
Akane put on an act just as Mika had said.

50
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,608
Ind actually stole the ring herself...?!

51
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,010
Akaness not kind of person!!

52
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,311
O eo 0

53
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,380
Let's go look,for her.

54
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,549
But what about the ring?

55
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,218
Without it there'll be no wedding...

57
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,890
I'm... really bothered about
the Hydrangea in the picture.

59
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,793
Hydrangeas signify "A change of heart"...

60
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,597
I think we'll find the ring in a place
where the Hydrangeas are...

62
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,100
Shinya!! What's with the wedding?

66
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,770
Well,

67
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,872
Akane, disappeared.

68
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,875
W.What? The bride's gone?!

69
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,543
Y.Yes...

70
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,713
We were just thinking of splitting up
and looking for her.

72
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,982
I'll help look for her too!

73
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,217
Thank you!

74
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,785
I'll go look for the ring!

75
00:04:51,307 --> 00:04:55,527
Hydrangeas,
where do I look for them

77
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:57,496
Kane

78
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,232
Kane

79
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,171
Hydrangea...change of heart...

80
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:07,806
Music box?

81
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,408
Change of heart...

82
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,009
Seabolt

83
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,144
Wait a sec...

84
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,578
I learned of it before.

85
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,649
Dr. Seabolt is the one who took
Japanese plants back to Europe...

87
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,920
And, one of the main ones was
the Hydrangea.

89
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,079
The old scientific name for
this flower is Hydrangea Otakusa.

91
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,600
The name was taken from Seabolt's
Japanese wife's name, Otaku...

93
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,804
Just as I thought...

94
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,709
Akane's picture was not
about 'what the flower signified

96
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,610
but rather about the scientific name...

97
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:48,397
jiKR

99
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,817
Otakusa ..Otaki san... Taki...

100
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:52,984
Taki(waterfall)...

101
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:53,785
Right!

102
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,069
I found it!!

103
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,074
Otaki-san... Taki(waterfall)...

104
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,208
My God...

105
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,345
I don't know who hid it but...

108
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,966
1. 1 get it.

109
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,919
This fountain-is Aphrodite and Pushke!!

111
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,689
Conan!

112
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,057
I found the ring!

113
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:06,958
R.Really?

114
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:08,860
Is something the matter?

118
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,529
W. Well...

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,599
Huh 7!

120
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,003
Akane's high heel shoe!!!

121
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:22,441
It's not normal for her to go around
with just one shoe...

124
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,143
I'm sure that she was kidnapped here!

125
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:29,347
We find the ring
and now Akane's Kidnapped!

127
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,417
Only...one shoe

128
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,753
was found by theiwindmill shed...

129
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,221
This is...

130
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,023
WwW. What's going on?

131
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,092
I'm just assuming from the circumstances.

132
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,929
But I think she was dragged away
against her will

134
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,565
N.No. do you mean she was abducted?!

135
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,200
Don't be ridiculous!

136
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,069
I'm sure she couldn't take staying/here
and fled!

138
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,039
I checked at the departure gate
of Huis Ten Bosch

140
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,508
and found that
she hasn't gone outside yet!

143
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,310
It seems that Akane,

144
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,546
in the past had a man that hertparent's
had decided' she get mariied to. I

146
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:06,151
I thinkithat-she is still seeing that man...

147
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,421
And maybe she had planned to

148
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,390
\. .1!
Embarrass Shinya to begin with...

150
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,792
N.No way!

151
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,394
I know her best!

152
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,030
Grandma's right!

153
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,200
Shinya: you've been completely deceived!

154
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,503
Like they say from long ago.
Love'is blind!

156
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,170
agNo!!

158
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,140
You're talking about the man that was
Akane's fatherzs'apprentice, right?

160
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,576
That's anold story that 'goes back
10\ ears ago

162
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,046
He left 10 years ago and
hasn't contactedlher

164
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,815
even once, since!

165
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,518
Well,

166
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:43,255
without the bride,
we can't possibly have the wedding.

168
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,790
After the engagement and all.

169
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,126
If it turns out that the wedding
IS canceled,

171
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,695
it will be a blow to the trust that
people have in the Ohga Financial Group.

173
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:53,965
If the wedding is really going to
be called off,

175
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,701
then Shinya's promotion to
Vice-President of the bank

177
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,438
will probably have to be reconsidered.

178
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,842
D.Dear...

179
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,747
She's slim and
her hair is about this long...

181
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,117
I think she was wearing
pink one-piece dress...

183
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,919
I wonder if you mean her?

184
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,520
Have you seen her?

185
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,254
Yes...

186
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,623
she went into the windmill shed alone...

187
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,158
About what time was it?

188
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:24,029
It was just about the time...
I came back from lunch break...so,

190
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,463
maybe around 13:00...7

191
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,798
About 13:00...

192
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,270
¥ she was abducted as you say.

193
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,040
Are you saying that
the one who took her away is here...

195
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,174
among us?

196
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,076
I can't say for sure, but

197
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,579
I think the probability is high )

199
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,480
How rude!

200
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,883
Do you know what you're talking about?!

201
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,185
Calm down. Mochida...

202
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,722
And just what are you planning to
do gathering us together like this?

204
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:56,161
Akane was seen going
into the windmill shed about 13-00 today.

207
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,896
by a sales clerk at the cheese store

208
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:02,933
So. I'd like to know
where you were at around 13:00.

210
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,803
Checking for alibi...eh.

211
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,974
I was here adjusting the books.

212
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,243
«I was here with my wife all the while

213
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,145
Around 13:00

214
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,648
I was horseback riding
in Friesian Horse Land.

216
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,584
Since the wedding was cancelled

217
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,653
I was drinking at the lounge here.

218
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,021
What about you. Mr. Takahashi

219
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,456
13:00...7

220
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,891
I think that's just about the time

221
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,427
I went once again to the Glass Museum
to look-at antique glass...

223
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,161
beep. beep...

224
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,363
Just as I thought!

225
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,130
Can I borrow it?!

226
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,066
Yeah. .sure

227
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,002
If you want the pictures that are in it,

228
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:38,837
they'll print it out for you at the front desk.

229
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,205
Don. okay!

230
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:43,608
Thank you .

231
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,045
, May I ask you something,.
Mr Mochida?

233
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,146
What is it?

234
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,849
,,ls there something special
about Akane's family?

237
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,919
Her father used to be a renown glass
craftsman in Nagasaki,

240
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,422
but passed away 10 years ago.

242
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,725
Anything else?

243
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,961
A WP.
There are rumors that
he committed suicide

247
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,363
because Ohga Bank pressured him
to return the money

249
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,865
that w financed 'him:...

251
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:07,966
Sfiuicide?!

253
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,404
The glass workshopsthat grandma owns
in the city used to be his

255
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,441
Grandma bought the workshop
that the bank forfeited as collateral.

257
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,409
She wanted the workshop.

258
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,064
SO she pressured him toreturn the money
nd got a hold of the workshop...

260
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,984
1IS'what some people say,
but that's wrong!

263
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,487
All we did was carry out
a legal transaction

265
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,123
Hmm -well...

266
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,659
Yes! This person came

267
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,028
He was drinking beer alone...

268
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,397
right through...yes. for about an hour...

269
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,767
Yes. I remember her.

270
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,870
She seemed to have really liked it
and rode twice...

272
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,938
Oh. I see!

273
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,505
Thank you so much...

274
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,880
This isn't the place...
It's more to the back...

276
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,317
Here?! The long hand fits.

277
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,619
So its 15:05 now...

278
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:02,220
Huh

279
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,621
Wait a sec...

280
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,591
Which means that this picture was
taken not at 13:00 sharp.

282
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,792
But rather at 13-05!

283
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,796
Since it's a faceless clock when the long
hand and the short hand overlaps.

285
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,731
It looks to be 13:00 sharp!

286
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:18,837
If the abductor abducted: her
at-the:windmill shed at 13:00,

288
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,339
and is here at 14:05...

290
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,677
Akane is probably confined
somewhere that's not too far away

292
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,347
between the windmill shed
and the flower clock!!

294
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,051
I've got to find her quick!

295
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,590
You mentioned that you like high places,
didn't you?

297
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,141
Right...

298
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,228
Oh...you mean I get to ride that?

300
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,217
Darn...where is she...

301
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,010
Hmm?!... The melody sounds strange.

302
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,814
I get it! Some bells aren't ringing

303
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,582
Maybe...

304
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,854
here...
Huh? Aren't you riding?

306
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,690
No way. I hate high places and

307
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,292
Aadiad 2
just thinking about it
sends chills up my spine

310
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:14,626
Aalad 2

311
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,927
Aalad 2
So go ahead and enjoy yourself.

313
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,260
Wong,

314
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,862
'um'?
Foh, foh, and you're still so young.

318
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:49,994
Akane!!

319
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,995
Uguuuuh...

320
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,164
Mr. Takahashi's going to kill
Grandma Tae...

322
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:53,565
What?!

323
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:56,467
Hello...!!

324
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:56,768
Hello...!!

325
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:58,536
Oh, Conan!

326
00:13:58,703 --> 00:13:59,437
Grandma is...

327
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,172
Where's grandma Tide now?

328
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,674
Grandma is...

329
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,777
Uh. she went to ride the balloon
ith Mr. Takahashi...

331
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:09,147
Yes. the hot air balloon... Luftballoon.

332
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:10,582
Foh, foh, foh...

333
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,534
I feel like a bird.

334
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,463

00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,983
That's...

339
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,288
Huh? WW. What's that?!

340
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,507
AA bomb?!

341
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:57,428
There he is'!
W.we're not going to make it!!

343
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,731
There he is!!
W. we're not going to make it!!

345
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,851
Huh? What's that?

346
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,552
No! Don't touch it!!

347
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:25,106
It's a tgiggering device that will set off
the bomb set up on the balloon!

349
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,591
That's why don't touch it!

350
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,625
W What?!

351
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,733
I guess you two saved

355
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,705
I'm so glad grandma...

356
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,108
Akane!

357
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,743
I'm so glad you re okay!

358
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,278
Shinya. I'm so sorry.

359
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,446
Mr. Takahashi...

360
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:48,746
What?!

361
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,248
Mr. Takahashi?

362
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:53,084
A.Akane. did you know him?

363
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:53,584
Yes...

364
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,553
What is the meaning of this?

365
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,755
What do you mean Grandma was
in danger?!

367
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,431
S-Sonoko...

369
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:07,465
poke

370
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,702
Ugh?! Aaah

00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,313
QYSOHOTKQR

372
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,148
H Huh

373
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,049
What?!

374
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,584
S.Sonoko...

375
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,554
This entire case to begin with,

376
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:32,623
started with two people
with different ideas

378
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,125
acting at the same time

379
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,878
Therefore, it looked as if one person was
scheming everything.

381
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:40,064
"SA 9
One of them was you,

383
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,367
wasn't it: Grandma Tae?

384
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:43,801
What?!

385
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,905
Since you were against the marriage
between Shinya and Akane

388
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,808
G.Grandmother!

389
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,511
My heart's just started throbbing a bit.

390
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,580
I'll get better after a little rest...

391
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,618
That's right. isn't it, Mika?

392
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,720
My God!

394
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,555
Conan. please bring the, you know what...

395
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:05,990
O «7 Bg Mag Sing

397
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,327
All!
Akane! Here you go...

404
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,963
Wow!! You found it...

405
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,397
the ring!

407
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,531
T.Thank you!

408
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:15,400
Oh. Conan!

409
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,868
I wonder where it was found?

411
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,437
You know the fountain by Mauritz
Square, don't you...?

415
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,772
He seems to have found it there.

417
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,476
Leaving it too close to yourself

418
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,978
would increase
the chances of us finding it

420
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:27,945
when we go looking for it.

421
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,014
Since Grandma Tae said so.

422
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,983
You hid in at the fountain!

423
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,051
Isn't that right, Mika?!

424
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,219
Y...Yes, that's right.

425
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,320
Then

426
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,039
« 2-0
what was the picture of
the Hydrangea about?

430
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,289
What was the picture of
the Hydrangea about?

433
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,223
what wasisthe picture of
the Hydrangea about?

436
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,626
I was deceived by that too.

437
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,529
At first because the Hydrangea signifies
a change of heart,

439
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,130
I thought it was criticizing

440
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,464
Akane for her change of heart.

441
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:50,501
But there was
another meaning to that picture...

443
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,803
Another meaning?!

444
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,873
The water of that fountain flows
Iike that of a waterfall. doesn't it?!

446
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:56,641
Yes.

447
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,210
The scientific name that was given to.

448
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,512
The Hydrangea in the beginning
was Hydrangea Otakusa.

450
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,181
A name that Seabolt had given it?

451
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:07,301
He called it:Otakusa
after his wife's name Otaki.

453
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,320
Otakusa...Otakisan...

454
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,756
Taki(waterfall)... right?!

455
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,124
That's what it was!

456
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:13,658
Yes... >

457
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:13,991
Yes...

458
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,827
Did you know about it?

459
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:16,627
Huh?...Yeah...

460
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,331
Although that picture looked to
be criticizing Akane.

462
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,999
Ifiwaswacitually indicating

463
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,301
where the ring was hidden...

464
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,570
Now you'know.

465
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,672
The people who stole
the ring are

467
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,574
Grandma and Mika!

468
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,143
But.

469
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,911
Akane being abducted

gave up-on:marrying Shinya.

486
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,489
Then, on her own initiative
she decided to disappear...

488
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,825
What happened after that?

490
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:48,693

I'm going to give it to that old lady!

Huh 7!

500

Have you forgotten?

501
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,595
Your father passed away
all because of that old lady!

503
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:28,132
The one who stole the.ring is
that girl called Mika, you know.

505
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,367
N., No!?

506
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,669
Of-course the Old lady, told her todo so,
though...

508
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,872
Please let me go through with
what I've planned

510

And- till Conan came toisave.me

511
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,045
I was locked up
in Carillon Symphonica...

Th. Then he...

514
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:43,981
Yes.

515
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,816
He's the one who had been chosen;
as Akane's groom in the past

517
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,851
that Grandma was talking about.

518
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:47,818
What?!

519
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:50,288
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it.

520
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,258
When I saw Mr. Takahashi yesterday
with Sonoko and theé-others

522
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,594
I was really surprised

523
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,095
because its been 10 years
since I last saw him...

525
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,530
Akane...

526
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,799
you saw Mr. Takahashi last night,
didn't you?

528
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,600
Yes,

529
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,935
I asked him why he came.

530
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,270
He answered

531
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,508
that he came to watch my wedding
from a far.

533
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,678
I was worried whether
he'was really telling me the truth

535
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,779
nd if hat,was all there was to it...

536
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,447
Mr. Takahashi,

537
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,382
isn't it about time you got up?

538
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,518
Just how long do you
intend to stay sleeping there!

540
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:22,820
Oh, my .

541
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,856
Since-when did youlrealize

543
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,358
I thought something was
strange to begin with,

545
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,962
because although you said
you were from Hotaru,

547
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,197
when you saw Akane
in her wedding dress,

549
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,299
you spoke in Nigasaki dialect

550
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,867
and said she was beautiful...

551
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,503
You're the one who tampered with
the brakes of Grandma's car

553
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,506
as well as dropped the rock from
above thegstone wall. right?!

555
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,075
Yeah, that's right.

556
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,911
Ops. . .Akane's father

557
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,879
was killed by this old lady!

558
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,481
Pops...

559
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,618
was suddenly pressured to return the
money that Ohga Bank had loaned him,

561
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,020
and committed suicide out of desperation.

562
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,490
I've never forgot the miserable
sight of her father,

564
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,958
not even once.

565
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,894
Pops.

566
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:07,064
Pops. why'd you do this...

567
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,100
Ieaving Akane all alone...

568
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:16,474
This all happened because the old lady
wanted a glass workshop for her pastime

571
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,978
ust before this, we were gradually
Iosing orders from our big dealers.

573
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,350
I went to ask a wholesaler in Hotaru
where Pops had transactions with.

575
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,586
He finally admitted

576
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,756
He was reducing-ordering to us because
he was concerned about Ohga Bank.

578
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,156
Wirong!

579
00:21:37,512 --> 00:21:40,014
Mother liked Mr. Katori's glass works

580
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:42,366
So. wanting him to somehow continue

581
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,569
she even gave him advice on
how to manage the workshop

583
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:46,504
What?!

584
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,471
However

585
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,574
Mr. Katori who was a craftsman through @
and through refused to lend an ear.

587
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:55,445
He insisted saying, "My glass work is
only for those who see the value in them!

589
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:00,034
He kept making fantastic glass works
spending time, putting his all into them...

591
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,588
Of course his works were expensive
but they were indeed masterpieces.

593
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,024
However, they didn't make out

594
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,260
and he went more and more into the reds;.

595
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,728
As a result...

596
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,265
As a result, he started delaying payments
for the loan he had with us.

598
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:18,135
First he delayed 3 days. a week,
then two weeks and so on forth

600
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,540
We're not all that big a bank either, so
we couldn't afford this to goon forever...

602
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,374
@&L >
That's a lie!

604
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:24,742
It's not a lie!

605
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,344
Ts ale...

606
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:29,146
It's notea lie. Mr. Takahashi...

607
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:29,447
U.Uuugh...

608
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:30,948
ts ale

609
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:31,949
It's a lie.

610
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,918
Pops-isn't such a weak person...

611
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:38,806
He used to sweat from early morning
to late at night...

613
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:42,493
teaching me,
who knew nothing!!. from A to 2...

615
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:46,063
Grandma, you were against Akane
gettingsmarried:because

617
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:49,867
you blamed yourself for not being
thoughtful enough therefore,

619
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,268
driving Akane's father to suicide. right?

620
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,072
That's why it really hurt for you
to look at Akane, right?

622
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:56,841
Grandma...

623
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,778
So. since Akane found out

624
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,449
that Mr. Takahashi was attempting
to kill Grandma, she was locked up

626
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:09,053
I know U's not something
that can be forgiven

628
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,188
but. Please.

629
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,190
Please forgive Mr. Takahashi

630
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:14,759
Akane...

632
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,264
Grandma.
Chairman!...

634
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,334
About playing the role of the father
of the bride, Mochida,

636
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,772
although hess quite young,yet,
why don't we have Mr. Takahashi do it?

638
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,741
Lo.of course, I totally agree!!

Then...you're approving of them
getting married?

644
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,883
The ring was found, so most naturally

645
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,584
Oh. I'm glad!

646
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,687
Grandmaghad intended things
to turn out this way to begin with

648
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:44,488
What?!

649
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,159
She was intending to approve of
their marriage when the ringpwas found...

651
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,060
How do you know?

652
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,516
The sculpture of that fountain is
Aphrodite and Psyche.

654
00:23:56,234 --> 00:24:01,238
Aphrodite, jealous of Psyche
who had fallen in love with her son. Eros.

656
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,641
Gives Psyche many trials to.accomplish.

657
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,178
However, she finally approves both
to see throughstheir love

659
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,512
afters Psyche accomplishes everything
that'was dished out to her...

661
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,884
That fountain describesithis final scene.

662
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,989
Grandma knew of this Greek mythology
and had the ring 'hidden there.

664
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,926
She even deliberately left the picture
of the Hydrangeas

666
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,628
behind as a hint,
pointing to Taki, Seabolt's wife,

668
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,598
isn't that right, Grandma?

669
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,719
It" so full of western letters,
that I have no idea what it's about.

671
