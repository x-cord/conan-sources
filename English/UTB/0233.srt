Sounds good!
It's a very cute girlish concept!

46
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,884
You're too picky.

47
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,285
All right, all right.

48
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,189
Well, it's been 10 year

49
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,191
since I've been here
and this town has really changed.

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,328
Did you find the new parking lot?

52
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,263
That area resembles a we-like pattern
and is very complicated...

54
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,101
Ai navigated 'me using the map
sol didn't get lost.

56
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,810
Hey, Arthur, stop it, will you!

57
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,281
Strange, he rarely gets excited
and barks like this...

59
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,216
Um, Doc...

60
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:04,950
Huh?

61
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,587
Didn't you touch a dog
before you came here....?

63
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,022
Moreover,

64
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,124
a male dog
that is larger than this Shiba dog.

66
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,060
Y,Yeah,

67
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,494
together with An,

68
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,898
I saw a Doberman that a friend of mine
brought along with him this morning...

70
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,866
But, why?!

71
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,736
You had dog hair on your slacks.

72
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:27,373
Moreover, dogs are able to tell the
size and sex of another dog by smell.

74
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,108
Among male dogs,

75
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,743
when they find that there is
another dog bigger than themselves,

77
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,711
a sense of enmity is aroused at times.

78
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,480
Besudes,

79
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,550
you and Ai came over to this gate once,

80
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,852
were told by Mr Kanoh
to go park your car again,

82
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,053
and then came back, right?

83
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,389
Therefore,

84
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,159
Arthur got the mistaken impression
that you and Ai are his owner's enemy,

86
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,495
because despite
being shooed away once,

88
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,297
you came back again.

89
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,566
Oh...is that why

90
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,434
You're not too bright, are you?

91
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,670
You seem to resemble,

92
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,172
Conan when it comes to being
slightly absentminded, don't you?

94
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,407
Hey. hey...

95
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,076
Well, I guess it can't be helped,

96
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,812
because his mistaken impression is
due to his natural behavior as a dog.

98
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,915
Dangerous people
who are not of his kind...

100
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,684
In my case...

101
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,154
maybe he's not all that mistaken...

102
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,356
H,Hey .Al...

103
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,290
Just kidding!

104
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,998
And, one more thing

105
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,468
There is one other
reason why Arthur barks...

107
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,270
Huh?

108
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,305
It's your voice when
you hold Arthur down

110

you hold Arthur down

So, keep that it mind, will you.

Y,Yes, sir.

132
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,454
Who is he?

133
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,957
He is Mr. Tsunashima
who I met at the Dog Lovers Club!

135
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,694
He's here for the same
reason as you are, Dr. Agasa!

137
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,031
Wow~how nice!

138
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,100
Oooh-ucomb'.

139
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,135
This plane is mine!

140
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,970
This doll for me!

141
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,307
This antique hour-glass is for me then

142
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,042
But, are you sure you don't mind?

143
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,076
They look so expenswe...

144
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:13,112
Of course not...

145
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:14,112
Those are just objects that,

146
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,882
my grandfather bought and collected
as a pastime While traveling abroad...

148
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,753
Although all three of us in
the family have no interest in antiques,

150
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,189
we wouldn't feel right
selling his things off either, so...

152
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,859
Therefore, both my parents decided,
to give them away to our acquaintances...

154
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,360
Come to think of it,

155
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,329
where are they. . .?

156
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,232
They've both gone over to the new house,

157
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,266
that was just built and are getting
ready to move, so they're not here...

159
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,171
I'm going to be moving to
England because of work,

161
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,906
so my parents are going
to move to the country,

163
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,609
where my father's
youfi'ben bro'th'éflives...

165
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,244
That's why,

166
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,379
I'm trying to clear all kinds
of things out of this house!

168
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,814
Oh...

169
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:52,918
The only thing I'm going to
take with me to England is Arthur,

171
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,387
all that my parents will
be taking with them"is...

173
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,990
my mother's dear dog, Doyle here.

175
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,729
It's a Papillon!

177
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,831
If there's an Arthur and 8 Doyle,

179
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,099
There must be 3 Conan too?

180
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,769
My father had a dog named Conan,

181
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,471
but it med of an mess 2 years ago.

182
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,807
I...see...

183
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,508
But, no problem,

184
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,943
because we've got Conan with us.

185
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,778
Just what do you mean, Ayuml...

186
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,749
But, the name Papillon
is sure a funny name...

188
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,586
Papillon means butterfly in French!

189
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,754
They were really hailed by

190
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,357
the Imperial Court of
France in the 16th Century.

192
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,828
It is said that Marie Antoinette
also owned a pet Papillon.

194
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,133
A fine coat of fur indeed!

195
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,470
It's no surprise that he was
awarded the championship award!

197
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,903
Championship award?

198
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,341
He just happened to win the award at
the contest my mother entered in.

200
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,876
Well, this dog is fine dog indeed

201
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,546
that there were people asking to by him
for a million yen on the spot.

203
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,015
A,A million yen-LA

204
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,785
Really,
what a gracious and refined dog he is.

206
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:05,790
He is so much like the spoiled, selfish
and beheaded Queen of France...

208
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,593

216
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,702

give me anything I want.

218
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,573
As for this living room the only thing that
I'm interested in is that large flower vase.

220
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,877
You people can go help yourselves
for all I care.

222
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,613
No offense,
but I'm going to hunt around on my own.

224

she wasn't like that before, though...

229
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,553
Phooey.

230
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:39,425
She's jus't all sul _\ because her dog lost
to Doyle at the contest!

232
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,060
Oh, no, no...!

233
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,962
I can't have that lady claiming the clock
in the Japanese room

235
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,898
that I reserved for myself!

236
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,634
I'll have to stick a note on that clock
noting that it's already reserved...

238
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,538
Hey! Why don t you get yourself
something too, An?

240
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:52,971
HUN!

241
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,741
I say we should take this opportunity to
go help ourselves!

243
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,910
There are a lot of interesting things here!

244
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,878
I guess so...

245
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,148
Maybe I should takenDfiSer...

246
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,316
Huh?

247
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:09,621
Because if I am put to the guillotine
and diéappgarkéym'ist like Marie...

249
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,727
don't you think this dog will come after me
and jump iritbAheFrS'ein'e

251
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,762

Hey, hey, come on...

254
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,736
S,She sure is quite an odd girl,
isn't she...

256
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,304
Oh, yes, sort of...

257
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,175
Hey, Shinichl,
can't you cheer her up a bit!

259
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,844
I really had a hard time bringing Al,

260
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,281
who refused leave the house
after that bus incident, you know...

262
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,118
Strange...

263
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,185
after the incident,

264
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,355
I called her on the phone and told
her not to worry since no suspicious

266
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:49,528
or unidentified people
came up during'fiolice interrogation.

268
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,765
But, the way she's freaked out,
is not normal.

270
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,234
She even refuses to eat.

271
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,836
She doesn't seem to be sleeping much
at night either...

273
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,408
The only thing I can say for sure now
is that

275
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,911
even if there were any men on that bus,
who were members of the men ir'fgblé'Ck,

277
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,513
it was mere coincidence

278
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:11,850
and not because
they knew of her existence)...

280
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,387
It's been 10 days since then alneady.

281
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,823
If it weren't a coincidence,
we would've been killed by now...

283
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,893
Including you and them too,
because you were all there tob...

285
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,726
What the...?!

286
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,633
Hey, hey, not again, you guys...

287
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,071
Mr. Agasa, if you find something
you want, please feel free to take it too!

289
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,940
0,Oh, I guess so...

292
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,076
Oh...then...

293
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:41,779
I guess I'll take this stereo.

294
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,215
Agh, I'm sorry

295
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,150
Somebody has already reserved that...

296
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,351
Huh?

297
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,488
A,Arthur'?!

298
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,824
No, you can't come/U'p'=f wtth
dirty feet like that

300
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,126
H,Hey!

301
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:55,594
What is it Arthur?

302
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:56,462
AHéy!

303
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,996
All right, all right,

304
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,266
I get the message, so let go of me,
Arthur!

306
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,902
What is It, of all things...

307
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:04,970
Oh...

308
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,638
I'm sorry...

309
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,007
I pushed the door bell many times,

310
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,375
but it seems to be broken...

311
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:10,808
Shino Hasukl

313
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:13,545
Arthur was nice enough to go
and get you...
Shino Hasukl

317
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,081
so, please don't scold him.

318
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,349
Oh, no,

319
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,917
I'm very sorry for not knowing
you had come...

321
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,353
(30 can; and play with-Arthur

322
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,193
Wow, they really get along, don't they!

323
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,796
A Shetland Sheep Dog!

324
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,197
Yes,

325
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,298
her name's Christie!

326
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,900
I see

327
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,569
the King and Queen in a detective story...

328
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,838
By chance, is she the one...

329
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,273
who reserved that stereo set'?

330
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,040
Yes...

331
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,676
I thought it'd be a good gift to give to
my younger brother

333
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,978
in celebration df his enrollment
into high school.

335
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:50,449
If you ask me, the sooner you separate
the two dogs, the better.

337
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,383
Huh?

338
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,786
You can't sell cross breed babies
for a high price!

340
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,189
Needless worry,

341
00:10:57,557 --> 00:11:01,226
because Arthur is going to be leaving
for England soon,

343
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,226
right Kanoh'?

344
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,495
Yes...

345
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,063
Agh...

346
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,037
I wonder what's got unto Doyle?

347
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,605
It's his snack time...

348
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,606
What ?!

349
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,476
My grandfather liked dogs a lot too.

350
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:23,348
My mother, in an attempt to Show
Doyle to late grandfather,

352
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,284
used to feed Doyle snacks in front of
the Buddhist altar in the Japanese room...

354
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,656
And, Doyle acquired the habit of doing
so ever since.

356
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,760
So, when the clock in the Japanese room
strikes 12:00 noon,

358
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,361
he runs over to the room,

359
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,864
sits on the cushion and waits

360
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,500
A cushion?!

361
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:42,968
Yes,

362
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,202
Doyle loves the blue cushion,

363
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:48,440
so he bring it in front of the altar himself.

364
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:52,778
But, doesn't the clock ring
at 00:00 midnight too?

366
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,447
What happens if Doyle mistakenly brings
the cushion then?

368
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,182
That's no problem

369
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,951
because we asked the clock maker
to fix the clock

371
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,753
so that it would only ring at 12:00 noon...

372
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:06,224
Are you sure you don't mind me taking
such a precious clock with me?

375
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:07,459
IUD...

376
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,995
because mother also mentioned that
it's about time we stop pampering Doyle

378
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:13,031
and start feeding him only twice a day,
in the morning and at night.

380
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh, I guess it's all right then...

381
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,803
Go ahead and look through that space.

382
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,074
Doyle is sitting there, isn't he?

383
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,676
On the blue cushion...

384
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,244
Doyle's not there...

385
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,147
The blue cushion is not out either...

386
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:29,981
Huh?

387
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,121
Maybe he couldn't pull out
the blue cushions

389
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,056
because there in
between the brown ones?

391
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,759
No, because he usually pulls
the blue cushion out

393
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,196
from under the others with
his mouth and puts it on the floor...

395
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,598
Strange. .I wonder where,;.heT~-Went...'?

396
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,868
Anyway, let's split up and look for him!

397
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:53,372
What if he's stucktsome
place and cannot come out!

399
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:53,805
Yes...

400
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,408
Doyle

401
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,909
Where are you 7!

402
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,278
Come out here, Doyle!!

403
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,614
Doyle

404
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,850
He's nowhere intsight.

405
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,919
Uh, did you find him?

406
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,053
No, we didn't!

407
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,156
We even looked in the bath tub

408
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,292
Arthur's barking!!

409
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,827
Christie's barking too!

410
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:17,663
The back yard!

411
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,664
Let's go!!

412
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,240
S,Smoke is coming out of the incmerator!

413
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,444
We've stopped using that
incinerator long time ago...

415
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,912
D,Don't tell me that...?!!

416
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,682
Shoes?!

417
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,891
It can t be...It can't be...

418
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:49,861
A c,collar'?!

419
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,465
D,Don't tell me that's...

420
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,832
Doyle's...

421
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:59,371
It can't be...It can't be...

422
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:11,917
Doyle...

423
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,454
Doyle! Doyle!

424
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,088
Doyle

425
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:16,688
Don't worry...

426
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:17,422
What?!

427
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,560
Only this collar was burned...

428
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,496
There was no dead body
of a dog in the incinerator...

430
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:25,630
By the way,

431
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,199
is this really Doyle's collar?

432
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,900
I didn't see anything just a while ago...

433
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,102
Y,Yeah...

434
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,704
It's usually covered with
his fur and is not visible...

436
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,941
It's burnt black, but I'm sure of
the color and the print on it...

438
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,843
Grandpa bought this collar,

439
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,846
in France for the Papillon,

440
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,781
that he used to own.

441
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,316
It's very old...

442
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,484
Please take a look over here!!

443
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,051
Hun /

444
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,353
The lock of the back door is open!

445
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:50,889
Oh yes, really...

446
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,357
Isee...

447
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,762
The one who took Doyle away,
fled from this back gate...

449
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,730
But, why?

450
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,433
Why'was the collar in the ifibinerator?

451
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,602
The one who took Doyle
away took off the collar

453
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,404
so that it would be hard
to tell one Papillon from the other.

455
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,374
Besides, that collar was a
unique collar with decoration on it...

457
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,743
I don't think so.

458
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,310
HUM.

459
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:16,081
Because why would somebody who
steals a dog and'is in a rush to flee

461
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:19,751
go out of the way to burn a
collar which is covered under the fur

463
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,921
that can't be seen and leave
traces of how he or she escaped?!

465
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,256
I'm sure that the one who did it

466
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,092
wanted to make it look like
he or she fled outside of the premises!

468
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,994
Which means that Doyle is still...

469
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:34,099
Yeah...It's most likely that Doyle is
being hidden somewhere in this house!

471
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,802
H,Hey, does that mean...

472
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,406
Don't tell me that the person who
hid Doyle is still in this house...

474
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:46,011
Hey, hey, don't tell me
that you suspect us?

476
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,280
Oh, no, but...

477
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,916
But, if it's as that boy's says,

478
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,785
we already have a
definite idea of who did it...

480
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,320
Look over there.

481
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,823
Those ladies shoes

482
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,493
Those are mine... .Why'?!

483
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,361
Come on, let's not play dumb!

484
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,131
Aren't those your shoes that you
brought from the front entrance?

486
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,566
N,No.

487
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,434
That can't be

488
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,970
The criminal would never leave
shoes out like that, and besides,

490
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,606
if someone is seen carrying
their shoes in the house,

492
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,274
anyone would deem that
person to be acting suspicious...

494
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:21,146
Ms. Hasuki, you've been here more
than one or two times, haven't you?

496
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,582
T,That's right...

497
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,151
If so, that you could've

498
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,454
trained Christie to bring your
shoes from the front entrance to here,

500
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:33,491
then back to the front
entrance again, right?

502
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,127
That's r,ridiculous'?!

503
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,065
Anyway, let's go
and look for Doyle again!

505
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,935
We'll go with him,

506
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,171
so...why don't you three go and
search for Doyle together, Doc!

508
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,106
0, Okay...

509
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,614
But, Conan, how are
we going to look for the dog?

511
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,817
We've looked practically all
over the house just a while ago!

513
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,154
That's why this time we donét'search
for places where dog might hide,

515
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,024
but we look for places where
humans would hide them!

517
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,794
That'.s night! Let's('ave Arthur help us!

518
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,463
Don't you get it...?!

519
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,031
His nose! Knows!

520
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,301
We'll make him help us by using the
best weapon he has, which is his nose!

522
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,538
A dog's nose is a 100x more capable
of sniffing out smell than that of humans!

524
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,776
So, if we make Arthur sniff Doyle s smell,

525
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,012
I'm sure he will help us find him!

527
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,415
Here it Is!

528
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,416
The cushion used in Doyle's bed!

529
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,452
Come on Arthur!

530
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,556
But...he's not a police dog...

531
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,093
But, it may work!

532
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,597
Because father used to play around
with Arthur doing things like this.

535
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,868
I think he's found him!!

536
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,505
He's going into the Japanese room!

537
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,607
Doyle is in there, then!!

538
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:57,742
Huh?

539
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:57,976
Huh?

540
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,913
A blue cushion?

541
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,052
Come to think of it, Doyle likes
blue cushions too, doesn't he?

543
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,921
Do dogs Ilke blue?

544
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,123
HUN (

545
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,458
That's strange...

546
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,495
just a while ago there were only
two blue cushions.

548
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:22,334
Counting the one that Arthur
brought our, makes three blue cushions...

550
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:25,670
One extra cushion...

551
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,873
What does this all mean...

552
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,345
Maybe he can't do it, after all...?

553
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,850
Uh, did Arthur ever do
something like hide shoes?

555
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,386
No, he once did the opposite, though...

556
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,589
It was back when
Arthur was still a puppy...

558
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,059
When I stood up, Arthur, thinking
that I was going to take him for a walk,

560
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,894
would rush over to the front door,

561
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,832
take my shoes out of the shoe
cabinet and bringing it to me...

563
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:59,604
But, once he found out that it wasn't
always the case, he stopped doing it.

565
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,839
But, that's fantastic

566
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,942
Arthur is no ordinary dog, after all!!

567
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,779
Go ahead and sniff
Doyle's smell once more!

569
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,617
Oh! There he goes!

570
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,454
But, he's stopped in
front of the living room...

572
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,991
He looks to be thinking.

573
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,795
Oh...he's walking again.

574
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,831
He's heading for the front entrance!

575
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,368
Huh'? He's gone outside...

576
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,505
Maybe Doyle was taken outside!!

577
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,011
Oh, come on, all he's doing
is frolicking with Christie.

579
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,281
Maybe he's just tired
of searching already!

581
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,050
I,I guess it can't be helped

582
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:49,320
Uh...is there any place that Doyle
usually hides whenhe's scolded?

584
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:49,820
Huh?

585
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:54,225
Maybe when the person
removed the collar by force,

587
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:57,796
Doyle got scared and hid
somewhere on his own?

589
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,500
Hmm~~Arthur used to
hide under my bed a lot.

591
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,035
Under the bed?

592
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:09,441
Yeah, when I first got Doyle,
I used scold Arthur 3 lot...

594
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,044
When I was hugging Doyle
as a puppy in the living room,

596
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,915
Arthur used to get jealous and tear the
cushion in the living room apart...

598
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,819
They get along now, though...

599
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,089
Oh...l wonder where Doyle
is hiding though.

601
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,325
Poor thing if he's
trembling in fright somewhere...

603
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,426
Right.

604
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,931
The people who are looking for you,
are bound to find you one day.

606
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,531
There 3 nothing tougher
than to live in terror hiding...

608
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,201
Hey!

609
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,368
That's enough! What are you all
sulky about?

611
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,437
No...

612
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:41,839
I'm just trying to tell an optimist
with no real strategy prepared,

614
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,709
of the dangerous situation involved
here...

616
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,345
I don't know for what reason,

617
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,949
but what I know for sure is that
one of their men were on that bus!

619
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,954
If they even had the slightest
notion of'my identity back then,

621
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:00,358
me, you and everyone else...

622
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,963
Don't worry about it! I can assure
you that you haven't been identified...

624
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,699
Why?! How can you be so sure?!

625
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,735
Just as you can sniff
them out, I just know!

627
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:15,707
I can tell when someone has
a threatening air about them.

629
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,009
I guess you could call it
the intuition of a detective.

631
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,778
Well, if I were able to tell who
possesses this threatening air,

634
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,647
I wouldn't have problems...

635
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,916
But, I know for sure that no such
person was on board that bus.

638
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,554
That is, the person that is making
you feel threatened...

640
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:33,658
What's with that look on your face...
Do you despise detectives or what?

642
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,927
No, I'm just totally bored!

643
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,795
Oh, I see...

644
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,166
Let me recall once again...

645
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,735
back when Doyle disappeared...

646
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,940
Doyle, at the chime of the
clock which struck 12:00,

648
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,276
headed for the Japanese room
where he could get his snack,

650
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,111
and disappeared from our view...

651
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,213
After that...

652
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,918
we all followed Mr. Kanoh who went into
the kitchen to get the cheese snack...

654
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,756
Then we went to the Japanese room
and found that Doyle was not there.

656
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,059
So, we split up and looked all
over the house for Doyle...

658
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,429
This is approximately how
the layout 'ofthe house is...

660
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,199
We don't really know
who searched where yet...

662
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,170
But, where on earth did
the person hide Doyle...

664
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,641
And how in the world is that person
planning to carry Doyle out of here?!

Want a sec when I looked a while ago.

708
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,143
Hmm~what's this cotton like thing?

709
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,111
It looks like some sort of chemical fiber.

710
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,914
What is the matter Conan?

711
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:13,284
Was Doyle burnt In there after all .g

712
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:17,322

713
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,358
