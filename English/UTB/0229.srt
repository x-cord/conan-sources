Isn't this the apron you use for class?

54
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,553
I know who the killer is but...

55
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,256
I'm. finished!

56
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,156

It's my tea cup!

58
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,959
Pretty good, huh?

Year-that's really qUite-good,

60
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,165
but you know, young man,

61
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,434
it appears you're
worried about something,

63
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,603
you're either hiding some deep,

64
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,606
dark secret or debating
about something important...

66
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,543
I'm- right, aren't I?

Youlr'e'fyvery good, sir!

69
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,152
I think you should take
care of your own affairs

71
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:44,056
before meddling in other people's...

72
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,461
this is the cup YOU made

73
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,599
While you Were busy
Iooking through the desk,

75
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,968
I put yours over here!

76
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,004
I thought for sure you'd'catch on!

77
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,374
And if this is your cup

78
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,512
then YOU must be hiding something...

79
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:12,251
Mr Mino, sin, what are you hiding?

80
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:24,763
Murder at the Pottery Making Class

81
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,374
This...kid...

82
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,775
Uh...

83
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,645
Did you find a pen?

84
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,280
Yes-where. .

00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,150

Thank you...

87
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,454
and may I also use this desk?

88
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,989
By all means.

89
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,790
I appreciate this...

90
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,060
Now please go back to the storage room
where the inspector is waiting...

92
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,262
All right.

93
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,434
Nb doubt about it.-...

94
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,270
Mr. Mino is the murderer...

95
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,307
I've pretty much figured out
hisfalibi trick an

97
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,978
while I was checkingth 1b0dy.
He hid the evidence...

99
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,314
I saw him pick up those scissors,

100
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,551
that means the evidence
is still somewhere

102
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,687
it's got to be some place,

103
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,355
but if I can'-t fund ht...

104
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,758
Darn, isn't there something'el's'e'?

105
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,496
Something that the killer's missed...

106
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,302
Oh, thanks kid.

107
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,503
A necktie

108
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,439
Yes, this is it!!

109
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,508
Rvefoundifl

110
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,510
I've finallafound it,

111
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,980
you overlooked a piecelolf evudence

112
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,583
only a professional potter would
Ieave behind!

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:53,919
Inspector Megure!!

115
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,155
I've confirmed the details!

116
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,590
Give it to me!

117
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,627
And that's not the only thing I learned...

118
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,199
I see, debts eh

120
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,769
Miss Kasama

121
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,406
it seems you have debts
totalling 10,0005000 yen

123
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,874
Yes, [1 die»...

124
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,378
I found this great condominium.
What about it?

126
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,179
Nothing,

127
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,879
I just thought it was in'ter'e's'ting

128
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,383
The late Mr. Motoo just took out
an insurance policy last week

130
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,719
and the premium was
for exactly 10,000,000 yen,

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,455
payable to you

133
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,658
The timing just seemed so perfect...

134
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,293
On top of that,

135
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,896
just before Mr. Motoo's body was
discovered in the cabinet,

137
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,367
ou had come to at the first aid kit
from that very cabinet.

139
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,169
If you weren't the murdener

140
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,472
you surely would have seen
his body in there...

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,507
I already told you

143
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,644
I opened the cabinet
but nobody was inside]!

145
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,645
Besides,

146
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:55,848
it didn't take me more than a minute
to go get the first aid kit and return!

148
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:59,818
There's no way I could kill someone
and hide their body in the cabinet.

150
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,387
According to everyone's testimony,

151
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:07,225
'when Mr. Minggot hunt.
You volunteered to get the first aid kit

153
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:12,164
What if you had alneady put
Motoo's body in the cabinet

155
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,134
You «didn't want his body
to be discovered yet so

157
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,037
you went to gét the first aid kit yourself.

158
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,972
But when ybu opened the cabinet,

159
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:24,176
his apron slid out and
got caught in the door,

161
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,644
maybe thz'at's what happened

162
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,349
Th. that's absurd!
I'm not a murderer...

164
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,184
Don't lie, Kikuyo...

166
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,521
I saw you

167
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,058
I came in here looking for you

168
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,561
I saw you choking Motoo's neck!

169
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,464
Is that true?

170
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:50,569
It she said shejwas
helping Motoo change but...

172
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,805
that's not what it looked like...

173
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,807
I, I was just playing...

174
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,942
You can tell us about it
down at the station...

176
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,944
Now just hold on a minute officer

177
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,353
What's wrong, Inspector?

178
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:08,687
You know,

179
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,589
everytime we start to
walk out with the suspect,

181
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,592
a strange voice stops us,

182
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,362
It goes, Furiyaa or Oops"; likedhat...

183
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,331
Oh, you're talking about Kogoro Mourl.

184
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:22,201
Well. you can rest assured.
He's not here today!

186
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,436
Oh, that's right...

187
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,371
Funya

188
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,239
nyalala

189
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,412
Sonoko, what's the matter?

190
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,015
I just remembered, this girl does it too

191
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:41,787
Inspector Mequre.
You've done it again, I'm so bored...

193
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,889
How dare you!

194
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,657
Didn't you notice it?

195
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,159
The victim Motoo's
sleeves were rolled up

197
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,562
but the lengths weren't the same!

198
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:51,997
Doesn't that seem like

199
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:56,702
he was attacked while
he was working in the class?

201
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,903
And if that's the case,

202
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,839
then the killer could only
be that person, don't you think?

204
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:02,674
Who are you talking about?

205
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,542
You don't mean...

206
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,843
1 (es

207
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,545
that person who
came into this storage room

209
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,680
while Kikuyo was
helping Motoo change

211
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:13,652
then forced her to return to {We class

212
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,156
Ieaving him alone with the victim...
that person is

214
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,558
Muneyuki Mino!

215
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:22,528
Yes you are the murderer

216
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,265
Hahaha Sonoko!

217
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,134
We noticed the thing
about his sleeves but

219
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:30,936
Mr Mino has an alin

220
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,038
According to Ran's testimony

221
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:37,308
when Mr Mino left
the storage room earlier today,

223
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:40,813
the apron wasn't sticking out like it was
when they discovered the body

225
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,117
And he was with all of you
the entire time later that day, wasn't he?

227
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,985
Besides, just before
the body was discovered,

229
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,321
Kikuyo had come
and opened tHe cabinet!

231
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,791
We're not sure she's
actually the killer yet

233
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,860
but she should have screamed
if he was inside,

235
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,895
wouldn't that be thé natural thing to do?

236
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,431
That is, if She didn't kill him.

237
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,266
And unless Mr. Mine was a magician,

238
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,235
there isn't any way he could have
put the body in the cabinet

240
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,638
without using his hands.
Isn't that right?

242
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:07,473
No. actually,

243
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:08,941
he did use magic...

244
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,213
Mr. Mino used Ran and
Kikuyo as assistants

246
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,115
and made Motofu's body
appear in the cabinet

248
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,284
after making it seem like
he wasn't inside!

250
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,321
Kikuyo and I were assistants?!

251
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,356
The proof of the pudding
is in the eating!

253
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,592
You'll know what I mean
when we reenact it. /

255
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:28,927
Let's see.

256
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,598
Officer Takagi.
Will you be my assistant?

258
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:33,432
Wan"?

259
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,933
Who, me?

260
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,510
Take 'a good look people!.

261
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,813
What you see before you is
a simple cabinet with nothing rigged...

263
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,581
Hahaha.

264
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,851
Please check and make sure
nothing is sticking out of the cabinet!

266
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,854
Uh. - .eVerything's clear...

267
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:56,688
All right then,

268
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,624
please open the door on the right side.

269
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,260
It's opened

270
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,862
You've checked and
made" sure nothing is inside?

272
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,664
Uh: yes...

273
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,566
I didn't notice anything unusual

274
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:08,867
GAEI

276
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,404
A piece of cloth is sticking out
from under the the cabinet?

278
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,606
That's strange.

279
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:18,076
That cloth wasn't here before

281
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:22,814
So-that's how it was done!

282
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,216
I'VE on the inside of the doorl!

283
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,082
That's right!

284
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,619
I asked Conan and
the man from the crime lab

286
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,721
to stick that handkerchief there.

287
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,858
I'm almost certain Mr. Mino

288
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,994
taped the end of the apron

289
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,764
to the inside of of the
accordion style door's right side

291
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,101
then closed the door while
pushing the end of the apron inside!

293
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,137
Then,

294
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,939
when someone opens the door,

295
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,308
the apron will be pulled out,

296
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,409
and when the door is closed again,

297
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,812
the apron would stick out.

298
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,049
What I'm saying is,

299
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,351
Mr. Mino deliberately cracked
the plate in front of the cabinet

301
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,621
so that Ran would see that

302
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:06,058
there was nothing sticking out from
underneath when she was cleaning up,

304
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,893
then he made Kikuyo
go get the first aid kit

306
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,262
telling her he had hurt his hand,

307
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,364
when she opened
the door to theflsabinet,

309
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:16,802
the apron came loose and
got caught under the door.

311
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,137
I see!

312
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:22,507
That way it would look like
there was nobody in the cabinet

314
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,443
when Ran was cleaning up
the broken plate and

316
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,580
as if someone had put it in there later.

317
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,315
B but

318
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:35,520
if Kikuyo had noticed the apron
when closing the door,

320
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,422
after getting the first aid kit.

321
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,491
I don't thifik'she would look
down when closing thé door,

323
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,260
not knowing that there was an
injured person Waiting for her!

325
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:43,662
Hmm...

326
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,866
so where was the body all that time?

327
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,836
When the door was opened,
the body fell out

329
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,106
that means the body was probably
Ieaning againstithe door

331
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:58,510
Kikuyo had to have seen it
when she got the fist am km!

333
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,481
I think we'll know the answer when
we open the door one more time.

336
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,082
But this time,

337
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,719
open both doors at the same time...

338
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,154
Both sides at the same time?

339
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:12,391
Whal'?

340
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,661
A mop'?

341
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,197
This wasn't in there
the last time I opened it Up!

343
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,001
How'd you do the?

344
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:25,003
It's a simple trick! /

345
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,340
I tied some string to the top of the mop,

346
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,010
then made a knot at the end of the string.

347
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,416
Next. I passed the string through the
hanger bar on the right side shelf

349
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,385
and hung the mop so it leaned forward,

350
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,990
then I passed the string through the
opening above the door on the left side,

352
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,659
pulled it so that the knot would get caught

353
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,695
when the door closed
and that kept it in place!

355
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,697
That way,

356
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,731
even when the door
on the right is opened,

358
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,867
the mop is hidden by the joint,

359
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,970
when both doors are
opened at the same time,

361
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:01,873
the knot. which is
the stopper comes loose

363
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,711
and the mop falls out!

364
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,513
The mop is Motoo,

365
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,048
the string is his necktie,

366
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,451
and the knot in the string...

367
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,219
You've got to be kidding...

368
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,053
hlS tie p'in!!

369
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,656
That's right!

370
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,359
When you look at the tie
around Motoo's neck,

372
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:22,894
you'll see for yourself, it' so obvious!

373
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:27,032
The reason his tie pin was
so attached so low was,

375
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,335
it was adjusted to
accommodate this trick,

377
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:33,171
the hole the tie pin
made was big proving

379
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:37,175
Motoo's weight. stretched it out!

380
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,479
B, but

381
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,348
but wouldn't someone notice if

382
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,018
the end of the neckties Were sticking out
from above the left door?

384
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:52,524
Not if you were to roll it up and
stuff it into the space in the door!

386
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,661
Then when-did-he retrieve
the piece of apron?

388
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,930
When the police arrived,

389
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,600
we did nit fi rid-anything
Iike that in the cabinet.

391
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:02,834
Besides,

392
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,203
he discovered Motoo's body
when all you students Were present,

394
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,505
didn't he?

395
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,675
He couldn't have retrieved it
with all of you watchihg...

397
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,977
He certainly could!

398
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,013
When Motoo fell out of the cabinet,

399
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,082
Mr. Mino moved to
the right side, bent down

401
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,850
and while he pretended
to be trying to rouse him,

403
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,253
he opened the right door fully and

404
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,822
used his body to hide the apron

405
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,991
sticking out from under the door

406
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,326
then if he tore It tape and all,

407
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,561
no one would notice it, would they?

409
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,329
Ucc,

410
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,300
when the door is partially open,

411
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,171
the apron is hidden by the
V shape joint on the inside and

413
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,473
when {the door (is opened fUllYp

414
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,842
it sticks out from the left side, doesn't it?

415
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:49,981
Mr. Mino tore that
and hid it in his pocket!

417
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,117
Yes, see what you mean

418
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,621
Then we'd find that piece of cloth
if we search his pockets...

420
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,191
Humph, this is absurd...

421
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:00,225
Take a look

422
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,861
as you can 899.
I don't have such a thing?!

424
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:07,199
What is this, Sonoko'?

425
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,067
He probably hid it
in the toilet or some place

427
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:13,939
before the police arrived
while I waé checking the body.

429
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,207
In the toilet?

430
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,076
Conan saw Mr. Mino looking for scissors

431
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,445
so he probably meant
to cut it into little pieces

433
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,681
and flush it (Pawn the toilet.

434
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,417
Takagi, check it out!

435
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,351
Yes sir!

437
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,458
it doesn't matter what and where
you find it. I'm not guilty...

439
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,596
No one actually saw me hiding anything

440
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,264
Besides,

441
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:44,269
anyone could have rigged
the trick that girl just explained!

443
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:45,804
You're right

444
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,640
even if we do find the piece of apron,

445
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,710
the moment it left your'person,

446
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,445
it lost it's weight as
evidence against you...

448
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,749
But unfortunately Mr Mina...

449
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,621
there's solid evidence remaining
that incriminates you...

451
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,421
Eh'?

452
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:08,026
It's on the back of the tie
that was tied around Motoo's neck.

454
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,295
These look like!

455
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:11,997
Scratch marksl?

456
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,901
That's right

457
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,371
it's from the soil that's embedded
in Mr. Mino's fingertips...

459
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,774
it's not unthinkable for those
scrat'éh marks to be there

461
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:27,812
Mr Mine was making
a tea cup with Conan

463
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:31,082
and judging from the
position of the tie pin,

465
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,353
the neck tie was just barely long enough
to keep the body suspended

467
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,457
The only way he could avoid getting his

468
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,560
fingerprints on the tie pin
while pulling the body up

470
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:46,031
and getting the tie pin over the door.
Was to grip the necktie tightly...

472
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,867
Mr. Mino, you made 2 mistakes!

473
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,370
Firstl, you didn't use gloves...

474
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,372
and second,

475
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,343
you chose to use that necktie
to pull the body up...

477
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,378
If you had used gloves,

478
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:04,249
you could have looped the tie pin
with your fingers and pulled the body up

480
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:10,355
and if you had used string
with a knot instead of"the=f'ne'cktie,

482
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,192
you wouldn't have made
those scratch marks.

484
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:22,467
Putting gloves on makes it seem as if
I were touching something dirty...

486
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,569
My lét'éi'daughter gave that tie to him,

487
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,473
it-'gwas a symbolaof her love for him...

488
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,142
it was for Christmas.

489
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,410
Then.

490
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:37,115
The birthday card and that tie
he found in his bag yesterday...

492
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:38,817
It was from me,

493
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:43,989
I knew he'd assume it was from you...

494
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,094
I was determined to use it to show him
the grief my daughter felt...

496
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,663
And I wanted you to take all the blame...

497
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,166
I started to suspect the
relationship between you two

499
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:59,371
when my daughter was struck by
the truck and died, 2 years ago...

501
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,607
It was 3 days after Ohristmas...

502
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,276
me whens was over

503
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,313
and I was cleaning her room.
That's when I found it.

505
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:15,053
The necktie was crumpled and
thrown in the trash bin, box and all

507
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:22,093
I thought he did it my mistake so
I rushed to the airport to give it to him,

509
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,663
I expected to see a man grieving over
the recent loss of his beloved wife

511
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,335
waiting sadly for his flight to
take him to his work assignment...

514
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,973
the man I saw at the
airport wasn't a man

516
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,841
who had recently lost
e woman he loved...

518
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,911
what I saw was a fraud,
he was holding you and

520
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,814
you two were laughing
and enjoying yourselves...

522
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,718
That's when I knew,

523
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,887
my daughter wasnit hit by the car,

524
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:53,391
she found out about you two

525
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,228
so she threw herself in front of the car.
Killing herself].

528
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,470
hoWjdid you know this
necktie was for Motoo?

530
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,908
Maybe she was
going to give it to you...

532
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,310
I knew...

533
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,212
after all, she.

534
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,081
She told me .

535
00:20:17,715 --> 00:20:18,850
Beige?

536
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,254
Isn't that color rather plain for Motoo?

537
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,957
It doesn't matter!
I like beige and besides,

539
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,093
I want him to be a little more like you!

540
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,228
Beige is the color of the soil!

541
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,363
That's your color, isn't it, dad?
