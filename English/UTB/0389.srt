00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,327
And, he was murdered the following day.

268
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,564
A physical exam

269
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,332
D.Don't tell me that?!

270
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,100
Is anything the matter?

271
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,735
Oh. no. not really

272
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,138
Okay. I guess I'll go back to work then

273
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,008
I have things to finish before
the police bother me with questions.

275
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,276
See ou sonn

276
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,380
It's not impossible

277
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,183
Rather, If that method was used,

278
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,918
1 EAAROROR WAI 0 Too) ON

279
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,220
But. I have no proof

280
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,223
Sakurajima.

281
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,025
If I remember correctly, back then...

282
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,293
Wh? 3 RN

283
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,495
Oh. Mr. Mourri. »

284
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,398
I was just thinking of heading'that way

285
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,933
Huh?

286
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,002

Mr. Tatsumura's corpse for me...

291
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,142

293
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,432

Goodness!!!

300
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,196
Gotting right to the point, tho stuff was not
found on his clothes at all.

302
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,031
£7 h7. What's this about?

303
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,534
All idht. This is it .

304

You know,
What you asked us to do a while ago...

306
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,806
Oh, no, Dad. You mean you asked a favor
and forgot what you asked

308
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,874
Huh?

309
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,709
OQ. .Oh. that stuff

310
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,213
Oh. so nothing.was on at all.

311
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,880
He's really good at playing along

312
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,950
And. who is at"?

313
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,118
Who is what

314
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,286
I told you on the phone

315
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,356
That we could figure out«the suspect
if we could confirm that fact.

317
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,058
Who is the killer?

318
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,659
{ Did you really say something like that?

319
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,228
Mico DOME: cor fal)

Hitomi Maezono?!

323
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,601
Dad!

324
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:12,504
My reason for coming
that conclusion is...

326
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,573
Pops. this is your chance to.show

Guess:so.

331

This MT na1ging Director Tatsumura's

333
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,424
who is t "&killer?!

334
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,659
The real killers.is.

335
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,295
Gh~~~! Sakurajima?!

337
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,734
Is something wrongrwith the mountain?

339
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,601
NO, OC a 0 oz olen,

340
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,172
Agh!

341
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,375
{5 AA \/

342
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,010
Agh. Officer Shinpuku!

343
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:53,778
Oooh~I

344
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,129
Oooh~!

345
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:59,000
Is this the famous Sleeping Kogoro?!

346
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:09,377
What is it. Conan?

347
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:10,779
WH" he's gone

348
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,279
Conan?

349
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,818
He probabl. went ou. side thinking that
Sakurajima &rupted; or something

353
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:20,822
Mn. Ona
thus 1s the famous Sleeping I OOgoro.

355
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,022
Excuse mo. I'd Mk0 to Mk0 u pncturo

357
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:21,456
Excuse me. I'd like to take a picture

359
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,124
Excuse me, I'd like to take a plcturo.

360
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,426
Quiet!!

361
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,928
In preparation for killing Mr. Tatsumura.

362
00:12:26,929 --> 00:12:29,431
The killer also schemed an alibi trick

363
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:35,286
Alibi trick?!

364
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,772
I had an idea of what the trick is

365
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,874
but I needed proof.

366
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,710
And that's why I asked.you
to do me that favor.

368
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:45,146
The "ashes" of Sakurajima. you mean?

369
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:48,266
Yes. If thoro was any found on the;clothes
r. Tatsumura was wearing...

371
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,187
There was nonetwhatsoever on his clothes

372
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,521
Howovor,

373
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:57,325
I already checked with the Kagoshima
District Weather Station a while ago...

375
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,760
And found that on the da of the incident

376
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:02,130
In the Kagoshima city area
where Mr. Tatsumura's house is.

378
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,466
Ashes;were falling all thexway through

379
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,534
from around noon to midnight.

380
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,706
Uh. doesn't something feel sandy?

381
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,628
The ashes probably came falling...

382
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,380
Yep. ashes» were fal Ing back then.

383
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,149
Isn't it odd?

384
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,786
We arrived at his house at 6:00
in the evening...

386
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:30,391
If Mr. Tatsumura was killed and
carried out ust about that time

388
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,762
it's only natural that ashes
would have been on his clothes too.

391
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,469
there were no ashes on his clothes at all»...

392
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,891
In other words, Mr. Tatsumura did not
Ieave home at 6:00 sundown,

394
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,843
but before the ashes came falling'...

395
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:51,062
that 1s some time in the morning

396
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,597
I seal

397
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:54,866
No. but then...

398
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,751
Yes, there's-a discrepancy.

399
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:01,422
It's blood

400
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:07,629
I wonder whit that blood stain was,
Mrs. Shiraishi.

403
00:14:13,202 --> 00:14:16,004
I was mistaken about one thing.

406
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,676
The reason youswant out of your way
that day to take us sightseeing...

408
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:24,679
thought it was because...

409
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,515
Mr. Tatsumura asked me to pose
for advertisement of your product...

411
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,217
Mr. Mouri,

412
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:32,954
please refuse what Mr Tatsumura
ilShed you to do tor ham yesterday

414
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,490
I thought that you showed us around
because you wanted me to refuse his offer.

416
00:14:37,092 --> 00:14:38,393
Wasn't

417
00:14:38,427 --> 00:14:41,462
ou did so to establish your alibi and...

418
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,499
To set us up as witnesses to testify

419
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,238
that Mr. Tatsumura was killed
just before we arrived at his house.

421
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,807
Am I not right.

422
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,942
Ir 30 Sd 5 = nl

423
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,048
MM. Mr Mouri?!

424
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,917
I said aaswhile ago that
the real killer isia woman.

426
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,018
A woman

428
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,787
EO WARN) WO WES WEFAN

430
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:08,823
I'm talking about...

431
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,525
Mrs. Fumiko Shiraishi.

432
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,997
NOW GHOOA REMY «0
to take us sightseeing.

434
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,365
That morning-you .

435
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:22,136
Made up some excuse and summoned"
Mr. Tatsumura out to the park...

437
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,408
Mrs. Shiraishi

438
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,261
Mrs. Shiraishi

439
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,615
She probably said something like,
I'd like to talk to you."

441
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:36,601
andimade him get in the car once more .

442
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,186
Ind put him to sleep...

443
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,958
Getting anesthesia ready and
gettingwblood samples

445
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:47,395
wore onsy for you to do
for you were a nurse before

447
00:15:48,097 --> 00:15:51,265
Then, after that you came
to pick us up at the hotel.

449
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,736
Oh." good morning!

450
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,471
Good morning

451
00:15:57,072 --> 00:16:00,241
You spent the whole day with us

452
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:03,828
and cleverly lead us
to Mr. Tatsumura's house

454
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,381
Oh. it's open.

455
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:08,449
I'll go check inside

456
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:10,218
Mr. Tatsumura!

457
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,619
This is Shiraishi!

458
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:16,891
And, you carried out what you schemed
in the living room...

460
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:26,634
Kyaah!
Mr. Mouril!

462
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:27,969
Mrs. Shiraishi!

463
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,471
What seems to be the matter?!

464
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:33,057
Out of the two mysteries one of them.

465
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,610
Why did the killer go out of the way
to carr the corpse out

467
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:38,312
rather .
Du didn't carr him out.

469
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:42,383
There, was no corpse
In that house to begin.

471
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,453
But the lights in theihouse were on,
weren't they?

473
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,458
Before you came to pick us up.

474
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,494
You borrowed the keys from Mr. Tatsumura
who was asleep

476
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,879
went into his house.

477
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,030
Turned on the lights

478
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:59,584
as well as unlock the
ront entrance door at that time

480
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,371
So. that's he story

481
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,306
age. I [goon A
Hold on a second!

483
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:07,842
Now for tho 2nd mystory

484
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,510
Wait. Wait a minute. I said.

485
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,714
W at you.re saying is strange.

486
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:14,882
0 It's. totally strange

487
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:17,919
You seem to want to insist
Hat Fumiko is the killer.

489
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,422
But. she was.with you al day that day.

490
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,958
There's no Way she
could've done it

492
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,528
When on earth could she have dono it?

493
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:32,366
Right. Dad. when. ?

494
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,203
Right after the you know what,
right Mrs Shiraishi?

496
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,444
I'm sorry to have otten you involved
in something bothersome like this. . "

498
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,280
After youl dropped us off at the hotel...

499
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,216
hats when

500
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,597
You got a bronze statue

501
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:06,601
just like the one at Mr. Tatsumura's
house beforehand...

503
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,336
n other words. this case occurred after...

504
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,490
he police began investigation.

505
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:32,794
It was a blind spot...

506
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:33,895
It cant be helped

507
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:38,049
No one ordinarily checks for alibis
after the investigation starts

510
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,852
You triedto make usithink

511
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,387
that the-estimated™timeiof the murder

512
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,772
was; justibefore we arrived
at Mr2Tatsumura's residence

514
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:49,727
Doing so would give you a perfect alibi

515
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,481
Because after a I
you were with us right through.

517
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,583
The 2nd m ster...

518
00:18:55,584 --> 00:19:00,621
Why did the killer notify the police of the.
whereabouts of the corpse:two days later?

520
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:02,089
Since time passed and

521
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,425
an accurate estimate-time of death
couldn't be acquired.

523
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:07,762
But if\the corpse was found between
sundown that day or -at night...

525
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:12,767
The estimated time of death
would come out accurately.

527
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:13,801
16 Om mmormmm dom 1 emG0 mem lon Somer mmmmus sm omsom
On the other hand

529
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:17,004
if the corpse 1s left as is for ma \y days.
It would be impossible to figure it out

531
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:20,775
Either way, would make
meaningless the alibi that is perfect.

533
00:19:20,776 --> 00:19:24,846
That's why it was bet
for the corpse.to be found 2 days later.

536
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:26,848
Mr Mouri...

537
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:29,116
When and how did you figure out
I committed the murder

539
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:30,751
On:-the:da ibeforeithe-incident

540
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:34,387
you fecommended Mr. Tatsumura
to go get a physical exam «didn-t you?

542
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:36,307
Oh~ ..that...

543
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,025
What:do you mean?

544
00:19:38,393 --> 00:19:39,827
If you take. a blood sample.

545
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,296
The trace of the needle
would be left behind.

547
00:19:42,297 --> 00:19:45,466
And that would bring about
suspicion during the:-autops .

549
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:49,437
But. if he gets a physicalthe day before

550
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,473
blood samples would naturally be taken

551
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,507
In other words.

552
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:57,645
She injected him in the exact same place
that he was injected the day before.

Why did you kill Mr. Tatsumura 7?

565
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,387
I was 8a: 4

566
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:09,557
I thought that if he kept on staying
at this brewery,

568
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:12,610
one day someone would be
influenced by-him and

570
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,595
stop making sake. the old way

571
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:17,464
as "1 result dropping t-he quality of our sake

572
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,267
That someone who was concerned

573
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,769
only about making monaqy
would one day come along

576
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,170
No way. Mrs Shiraish

578
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,973
Not among anyone of us. never!!!

579
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,408

580
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,177
But, people change
when various things happen.
