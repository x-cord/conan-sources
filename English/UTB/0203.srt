00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,454
I don't know if it's some problem
that the producer has or what,

82
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,722
but, he has no right to tell me
to give my part up, just like that!

84
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,025
What? You're headed this way?

85
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,726
You don't have to come!!!

86
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,360
I tell you...!!

87
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,800
She's actress Chizuru Bizen.

88
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,469
Y. Yeah...

89
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,305
You, just what is the meaning of this?!

90
00:03:59,306 --> 00:03:59,572
Huh?

91
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:04,410
I heard it was a nice place, and I'm
brought all the way out in the mountains!
Chizuru Bizen

94
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:07,046
It's a nice quiet place

95
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:11,083
I can't stand to think that I'm going to
have to spend 5 days together with you!

97
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,520
Front desk clerk!
Please give me a separate room!!

They don't even have an elevator!!

106
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,475
She sure is different from what she
portrays to be on TV and in the movies...

108
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,543
U,Uh-huh...

00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,763
if it's all right with you, would you
Iike to rest a while in the restaurant?

116
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:58,898
The restaurant?

117
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,468
We can serve you
some cold herb tea if you'd like.

119
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,703
Wow, how nice!

120
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,906
Dad, let's drop in for a rest!

121
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,274
Oh, all night...

122
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:12,211
I'd prefer a shot to herb tea though,
guhee-hee-hee...

124
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,414
Wow, what a nice restaurant...!

125
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,283
Welcome!

126
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:17,850

00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,486
She is our chef

00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,176
Boy, I just can't wait for dinner time.

140
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,846
I hear that you ve got some
really"good local beer here...?

142
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,982
Of course,
we've got that ready for you too.

144
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,886
Shinobu, please serve
our guests some herb tea.

146
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:54,386
Yes, sir.

147
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,356
Oh, I'd like to taste
some of that local beer

149
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,825
Wait till night time!

150
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,301
Puhaa, this sure is good!!

151
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,439
Dad, why don't you stop drinking
and eat something?

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,307
This soup is really good.

154
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,676
I've never tasted such lousy soup!!

155
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,377
What?

156
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,846
And, you claim to be a chef?!

157
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,414
Cut it out, Chizuru.

158
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:23,816
You stay out of this!

159
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:29,054
Uh, would you please tell me
what you don't like about the soup?

161
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,027
A guest is saying it tastes terrible!
Can't you at least apologize?!

163
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,465
I am very sorry OI'll bring our}
a new bowl of soup of soup immediately.

165
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,167
RShinobu!!

166
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,736
Mr. Arimori...?!

167
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,809
That's what you should've
«done in.the*first*place!wr

173
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:11,463
I heard from my husband that you are
the renown detective Mr. Kogoro Mourn.

175
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,565
It's an honor to meet you all.

176
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,035
1.1, 1 am the one who is honored!

177
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:22,241
I'm always looking forward to
your great capacity of: solving cases.

179
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:22,708
Oh?!

181
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,980
Wow.

182
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,948
I am Chizuru's husband, Shiromoto.

183
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:30,482
Huh?!

184
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,852
Since I'm here on an inspection tour
of the development of Leisure Land,

186
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,721
we've decided to spend
a holiday here while we're at it.

188
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,425
O, Oh, so you're a business man!

189
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,861
So, the rumor about
the development was true after all...

191
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:43,329
Huh?

192
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,831
There are unusual butterflies

193
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,767
inhabiting this highland area,
as well as alpine plants.

195
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,837
What are your plans
on the preservation of all these things?

197
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,373
Ah, as to that we are planning to

198
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:56,775
have a discussion
with the local people here, in time...

200
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,711
Heck with the locals!

201
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,746
There are people who are all worked up

202
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,147
about preserving nature
and all that anywhere!

204
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,816
It's about cash, plain cash.

205
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,218
What a thing to say, Chizuru...

206
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,054
Oh, did I say something upsetting?

207
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,124
I'll divorce you
any time if you want me to...

209
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:16,161
But, I wonder if you can pay me
alimony in your state of affairs right now?

211
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,431
Chizuru!!

212
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,265
Ugh!! 7

213
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,072
Chizuru, please, just this time,
please forget about the part, please!!

215
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,676
You're still talking nonsense like that?!

216
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,544
For what reason, in the first place?!

217
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,178
Uh, well, Chizuru,
I can't talk about that...not here...

219
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,281
Uh, well, Chizuru,
Il can't talk about that... . not here...
Kota Miyabe

222
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,217
Never mind, just tell me!!

223
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:43,188
The sponsor doesn't want you.
They want somebody who's younger.

225
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,757
Rather, they want to use Reika,

226
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,359
who debuted last year, since
her popularity is on the

228
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,661
They say they won't
dish out the cash otherwise...

230
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,330
Reika belongs to our production too, so...

231
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,566
If this movie goes down the drain
we'll be thrown into hot water.

233
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,469
Please try to understand, Chizuru!

234
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,240
W What! What's with
that look on your face!!

236
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,343
I'll bet you'll all wishing that I were gone!!

237
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,079
Okay, I'll die just like you want me to!!

238
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,880
Chizuru!!

239
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,051
I tell you...

240
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,687
Well, don't let it bother you too much...

241
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:18,924
Um, is this you, Mr. Arimon?

242
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,291
Huh?!

243
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,058
Huh?

244
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,961
See, that picture...

245
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,166
Mr. Arimoiii is in the middle and
the one to-the very right is Shinobu, right?

247
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,134
Yes, that's right.

248
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:33,105
We've been doing
hand-gliding together from

250
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,706
Hand-gliding?

251
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:38,177
We used to be able to hand-glide in the

252
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,912
highlands at the
peak of a mountain before.

254
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,515
We can't do so anymore because of all the
developments that have been going on...

256
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,619
Oh, that's too bad.
I used to do it too when I was young.

258
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,356
Who is the man that is standing
to the left of you, Mr. Arimori?

260
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,560
O, Oh, that's my younger brother.

261
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,896
We used to fly a lot together in the past...

262
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,866
We haven't flown for 5 years already...

263
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,603
The hand-gliders are left stored
in the storage on the roof...

266
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:09,207
Conan, let's goy
to the highlands tomorrow!

268
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,710
It's just perfect for the sketch
you have to do for your homework.

270
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,377
Okay!

271
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:27,526
Pops is snoring so loud
that I cant sleep...

273
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,963
I'm going to go buy some juice...

274
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,505
1, I can't reach the slot...

275
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,639
I've had enough!

276
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,510
What on earth did I do anyway.
I have nothing to do with it!!

278
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,562
I wonder why...
Chizuru's so angry...?

280
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,736

Mr. Shiromoto...

285
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,313
How is Chizuru?

286
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:23,715
I'm sorry about what happened last night.

287
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:27,219
She always like that
so please don't let it bother you.

289
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:28,820
I'm sure that she'll soon...

290
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,563

Hey, lady, you know last night

294
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,601
Ugh!!!

295
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:48,507
How-rude to-address her like that!
Please don't let his remark bother you...

297
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,744
Oh, no...

298
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,682
Daaaah...what am I supposed to do!

299
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,117
Its impossible to convince her now.

300
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,821
What do you say we go fishing together
while we wait for her to cool off?

302
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,624
My work schedule starts from tomorrow,

303
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,493
so I was planning to
spend the whole day fishing today.

305
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,430
I'll lend you a fishing pole
if you need one too.

307
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:14,366
Yes, I'd like to go with you.

308
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,437
Dad, let's go to the highlands
at the top of the mountain!

310
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:23,141
You guys go on by yourselves!
I've got an important mission to carry out!

312
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:23,842
A mission?

313
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,279
First, I've got to watch Yoko Okino's
new release promotion video.

315
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,548
Then,

316
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,784
I'm going to watch her concert video
which I got a hold of by a top secret method.

318
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,286
Furthermore,

319
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:38,190
I've got to watch the rerun
of Yoko s drama special!

321
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,692
Dad, what on earth
did you come all the way here for!

323
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,329
The rerun is broadcasting
only in this district!

325
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,532
So, you came all the way
here to watch it...

327
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,503
If you don't mind, would you
Iike me to show you up the mountain?

329
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:52,303
Huh?

330
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,539
That would be a great help!

331
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:58,343
Oh, that's right, why don't you
go along with them, too, Shinobu?

333
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,211

As for lunch, all you have to do is
Ieave us some box lunches or something!

But, Izstill have to get dinner ready...

342
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:20,399
Why don't you have barbecue
out in the yard then?

344
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,634
That'll save you
the trouble of preparation, won t it?

346
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,704
Since my wife gave you
a bad time last night,

348
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,407

to the sun if I had wings

418

Icarus...?

419
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,301
He appears in,Greek Mythology.

420
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,070
Icarus, who had wings...

421
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,107
He forgot his father's warning telling him
to keep from going to high,

423
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,109
and flew high,

424
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,912
believing that he could fly to the sun...

425
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,350
However, since Icarus had flown
too close to the sun,

427
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:27,185
his wings could not tolerate the heat...

428
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:33,692
And, Icarus, whose-wings were burned,
went falling straight. down to thésground...

430
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,062
A sad story...

on Mr. Arimori's shoulder!

564
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,272
Oh, yeah, okay okay!

565
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,875
Hi, there.

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,977

568
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,015
How ls Chizuru doing?

569
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,684
Come to think of it,
she hasn't come down at all...

571
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,052
Not at all...?

572
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:24,022
What a nuisance...

573
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,525
Mr. Mouri, could I have the master key?

574
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,394
Oh yes, yes, sure.

575
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,496

Here go, the catch for today.
I'll leave the rest up to you two.

581
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,370
Yes, Hotel Arimorl.

582
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,506
Oh, Mr. Arimorl.

583
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,274
I can't get my car started.

584
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,110
I hate to trouble you,
but could I have you come pick me up?

586
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:46,578
Okay.

587
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,518
I will go with you, just in case!

588
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,887
I'm very sorry, Ran.

589
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,333
Mr. Mourn!

590
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:10,034
Chizuru doesn't look well!

591
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:10,668
What?!

592
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,639
I opened the door of her room
with the key, but the door guard is set,

594
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,841
and she won't answer no matter
how much I call out to her!

596
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:18,877
Oh no!

597
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,317
Chizuru! Chizuru!

598
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:28,586
Let's break the door open!

599
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,454
Y. Yes, sir...!

600
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,856
There!

601
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,223
Agh MI.

602
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:32,724
Ugh!

603
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,327

Chizuru!!

607
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,077
MM. Mr. Mouri, how is she...?!

608
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:59,017
I'm sorry to say that it's been a while
since she's passed away...

610
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,423
It can't be...?!

611
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,325
Kugh...!

612
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:07,858
Hmm...?

613
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,130
The metal part of the door guard...

614
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,165
cratches...

615
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,301

616
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:20,838
Just as I thought...!!

617
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,474
Chizuru...

618
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,944
did not commit suicide...

619
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,748

664
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,674
Scratches?

665
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,376
