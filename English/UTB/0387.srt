1
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:24,223
The strings play a murderous tone *

2
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,091
Annoying human relationships

3
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,926
Hat ON ICAO NO SESE Ne
and the case is solved!

5
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,428
He sees through the one and only truth

6
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,996
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

8
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,298
No case is¥left unsolved
with Detective; @onan

10
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,751
We were summoned by
Ms. Hasuki Shitara

12
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,621
and wenti/to visit Choichiro Shitara's
residence. Pops. Ran and I.

15
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,458
Hasuki had called us because
incomprehensible accidents revolving

17
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,160
around the famed musical
fin'strument Stradivarius«

19
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,462
have been occurring consecutively
from the year before last.

21
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,065
Her request was for us
to investigate these accidents

23
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:16,735
However as soon as we got there,
the annex went up in flames)

25
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,905
('a zaburo who was Inside. dies.

26
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,541
Moreover, that night,

27
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,178
while Kyosuke was playing the
Requiem on his violin

29
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,881
Ayana falls {from
the 3rd floor to her death!

31
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,117
Left behind are a violin and
SSVaNS IRIS TS SES At I IE St

33
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,153
What is going on...?

34
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,187
What is going on...

36
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:43,629
Cacophony of Stradivarius! Postlude!

38
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,324
That's no doubt the bridge of a violin

39
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,311
But the bridge was on the replica

40
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,496
as well as the Stradivarius

41
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:05,217
Which means
there was one more violin

43
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,087
Oh and one more thing,

44
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,623
here was something that
Iooked, like the tip of a chopstick

46
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,959
And that was a tact

47
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,394
The conductor's staff used
in an orchestra.

49
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,496
Yeah

50
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,698
we found something that looked
to be the burnt remains of a case

52
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,466
Right,

53
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,385
shaped something like this,

54
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:25,604
and maybe two thin sticks
would fit into it...

56
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,007
Which means that
there was nothing in the case. right?!

58
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,579
So. that's the story

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,815
But. there is one thing I don't understand

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,686
What is the killer so hung up on

61
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,323
Come to think of it,
Mom told me some time in the past

63
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,047
Do Do. Re-Mi-Mi-So
Mi-Mi-Re-Re-Oo

65
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,859
Why do I spread my fingers and play?

66
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,611
Well

67
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,280
there's this thing called a chord.

68
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,982
For example,

69
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,184
This is the "CC" chord

70
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,587
This ls.

71
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,124
This is Oka

72
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,366
Well? Doesn't this, chord make
you feel sort of uncomfortable?

74
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:42,648
Inspector, it's suicide, suicide...!

75
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,284
The entrance door and
the door of the storeroom

77
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,619
were both locked up.Zyou know

78
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,721
In such a locked room. it's impossible

79
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,525
If Ayane used the chair as a step
and jumped out

81
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,960
Ol? Will, JAdallie= ike) 110 Oikedk JO

82
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,230
hen, doesn't it bother you that

83
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:00,799
people with the Initials in keeping

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,969
with'the musical scale,
D-E*=F=G-A have died...?

86
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,572
It's true that before the A of Ayane

87
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,742
comes Genzaburds .
But. it's probably just a coincidence.

89
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,512
That room was locked too.

90
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,314
And the fire was probably caused
by him falling asleep while smoking

92
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,466
But .

93
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,686
At any rate. I think we should call it a day

94
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,824
D.Dad!

95
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,628
WW.What is it. Ran

96
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,263
WwW. What???

97
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,766
Well, after yawninc and making
a funny looking face.

99
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,768
You fall asleep and starl
your deduction show

101
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,403
A funny leoking faco

102
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,574
Right, right,
and you also make strange sounds'

104
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,475
Iike "hanyah or whatever.

105
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:45,977
I thought it sounded more like Hohee?

106
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,047
No. I think it was "Henyo" the other day

107
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,853
Nohyoo

108
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,254
Right. right. it's this face. this voice!

109
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,558
H 000

110
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,994
Oh, the Sleeping Kogoro!

111
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,697
He's sure putting on
a haughty pose today

113
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,848
Of course

114
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,850
because after all I solved the mystery ?
That even you Inspector.

116
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,852
Could not solve despite all your thinking

117
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,307
regarding the truth about the
serial killings. that have been occurring

119
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,509
In this house ovethe last two years

121
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,546
But you kept insisting that
It was suicide till just a while ago

123
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,483
Well, it was an instant flash
of inspiration. you see

125
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:29,421
Please gather the things I ask for here :

126
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,457
After everything's ready
please call the four suspects here

128
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,393
And of course: please don't forget

129
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,628
that famed musical instrument,
the Stradivari.

131
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,963
Okay. what do we bring for you?

132
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,634
No, Officer Takagi,
please wait for us In another room.

134
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:43,869
Huh. Why?

135
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,637
Youwrll find out later.

136
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,373
Don't come out until I call you, all right?

138
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,099
sO you've figured out who the Killer.is...

139
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,419
Which means you think this is
a serial murder tase?

141
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,653
Are you referring to
Great Uncle GinZaburo

143
00:07:02,654 --> 00:07:04,122
and Grandmother vane too?

144
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:08,727
Yes, they arc all victims
that have been killed by one person.

146
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:11,163
It is most likely that Eimi
ho tripped over the stairs

148
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,332
and Furuto who fell to
his death: from the veranda

150
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,936
were also killed by the same person

151
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,138
OO. Oh no...

153
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,609
why would solving the mysten have
anything to do with this Stradivarius

155
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,945
He's probably figured out

156
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,381
who it Is was that switched
the violin with a replica

158
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,917
then came back here
just to return the violin

160
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,419
thought I'd like you to listen!to

161
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,389
a'song I will play before starting
my deduction show.

163
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,490
In other words.

164
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,425
A prelude to solving the mystery,
I guess you could say

166
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,793
What!

168
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,262
H-He Dad?!

169
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:44,863
Yes,

170
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,131
Yes,

171
00:07:46,315 --> 00:07:49,000
just like I did in front of you a while ago

172
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:50,769
Are, ou read 7?

173
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,373
Oh. well

174
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,842
I don't think you should

175
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,527
Of course you shouldn't.

176
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,646
Just what do you think
my Stradivarius is?

178
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,281
Just what do you intend to do
If an amateur like you

180
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,566
handles it and scratches it or something!

181
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,700
Well. well.

182
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:08,203
El's see what he wants to do

183
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:10,822
I'm sure he has something in mind.

184
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,542
Or, as there some reason
why you don't want to let him have it.

186
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:14,960
Uncle Choichiro...?

187
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:17,963
N No I don't.

188
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,931
Here

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,368
I'm all ears

190
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,723
Fuh, fun

191
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,560
$0. it was you after all,
wasn't it. Kyosuke

193
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,912
You're the one who switched the violin

194
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,816
He . he

195
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,652
I To),
I just handed itover:to you
because you said you wanted to play it

198
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,089
If I remember correctly, the people
who handled this violin was

200
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,124
in the order as follows

201
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,795
Kyosuke tuned the violin this afternoon.

202
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,431
And handed it over to Hasuki

203
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,401
When she was showing me the violin

204
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,169
fire breaks out at the annex

205
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,707
The Stradivari that was left .on the table

206
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,876
was taken to the storeroom
by/Ms. Tsumagari

208
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,247
If the one who switched the violins were

209
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,617
either Ms. Tsumagari or Choichiro
who could go in and out of the storeroom,

211
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:15,387
it would have been switched

212
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,422
after I played the violin/in:Hasuki's room

213
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,775
If my fingerprints are found on the violin,
either oneof the two

215
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,762
would've been-the tine
who switched the violin

217
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,431
Ifr-so.

218
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,435
Hat person would've 'let.me touch
the Stradivari one more time

220
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,022
in order to make unknown
when my fingerprints got on the violin

222
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,143
If it were Kyosuke or Hasuk
1a Cle 2G SWIC WOU ¢ HC 1eYvsame

225
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,895
They would want me to touch it here

226
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,049
If my prints are not found
on that genuine violin,

228
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,585
it would mean that it had been switched

229
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,452
to the replica before I-played It.

230
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,356
And both of you would be suspected

231
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,124
However... Hasuki and

232
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,694
Choichiro. as well as Ms. Tsumagari

233
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,364
objected to my touching the Stradivari

234
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,666
But. ou urged me to go ahead

235
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,301
In other words. Kyosuke

236
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:06,371
this is evidence that you are

237
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,490
the one who had committed
the serial murders

239
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:12,177
G.Groat Uncle...Oh, no

240
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,447
B.But, it.couldO™be that
when Kyosuke was tuning the violin

242
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,532
It was alrondy the replica I

243
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,234
That's not possible

244
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,853
With an ear like his

245
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,892
He would know right off
the bat that it's not:genuine.

247
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,596
Well. But what makes you say
he's the murderer?

249
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,599
Ayane's room was locked, and besides

250
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,836
Genzaburo's room that caught fire
was also locked

252
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,005
Iay, kid. show them the stuff

253
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,608
Okay! Here it is

254
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,444
It's the metal piece that was
found in Genzabure's room.

256
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,219
Tako a good look, Inspector,

257
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,588
only tho holo on the topipartiisibent

258
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,924
If the locked door was
destro ed and forced open

260
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,460
the top and bottom
should be bent out of shape

262
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,295
Hmm, rue

263
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,003
When he found that
the firefighter was saying.

265
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,305
That the bolt sticking out of the door.

266
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,241
The top part is the knob
and the bottom part is the lock

268
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,326
So from the looks of the direction

269
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,878
in which the door was opened

270
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,580
it doesn't seem to have been locked
when it was broken down.

272
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,216
But. when, we went back to,
the burnt remains later

274
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,153
the door key was locked...

275
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,673
Kyosuk@.locked it.

276
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,361
Back then he pretended
that the door was locked

278
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,562
and broke it down

279
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,764
No good. it's locked!

280
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:46,337
When we were all distracted
by the sea of flames

282
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,774
1,] sesO...

283
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,712
But what has that to do
with switching the violin?

285
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,783
He used it to make Ayane jump to
her death from this room...

287
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,284
What?

288
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:03,221
But during that time he was ina
room below. this one.

290
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,190
«it was also a trap"

291
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,426
to lure Ayane to the window

292
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,462
try to imagine it

293
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,466
the Stradivarius that she used to
stare at:every night as if it were her son

295
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,067
switched for:a replica.

296
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,803
Outraged, she destroys the violin
Can you imagine how she felt.

298
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:25,143
She then turns to look towards
the window

300
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,645
and listens to the beautiful melody
played by Kyosuke

302
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,216
Hey. kid. show them the other stuff next!

303
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,283
Es, sir!

304
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,766
Yes sir!

305
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,335
Wiwhat is the meaning of this?!

306
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,939
This Is what Ayane saw back then

307
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:07,185
Don't tell me that Ayane thouc ht
that was the real Stradivariu ¥...?

309
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,269
Yeah.

310
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,423
More so, If the Requiem played
by Kyosuke from the floor below

312
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,161
sounds like
the genuine Stradivarius

314
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,971
She used the chair as a stepping stool
and climbed up the window,

316
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,106
trying to take the violin

317
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,046
But, I wonder if
she'd fall down so easily,...?

319
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,816
Let me show you how it was done.

320
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,018
Hey. kid. go get Officer Takagi

322
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,787
ThenYMs. Tsumagari,

323
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:43,888
Yes sir

324
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,691
you took the real Stradivarius
to the storeroom...

326
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,999
Uh. did you call me

327
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,170
Um Officer Takagi, while Pops was
explaining the, trick to everyone

329
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,672
a Stradivarius happen to be hanging
out the window

331
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,606
What?!

332
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,409
Since you're tall, you can reach it, right?

333
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,911
Well, I guess so

334
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,683
I hope there's nothing behind all this?

335
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,153
No, no,
but be extremely careful will you,

337
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,522
because it's valued at more than
several billions of yen

339
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,993
HO 1.1., fill.
But. mind you it's not my fault.if I drop it.

341
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,731
Huh? Oops?

342
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:27,665
Hey. hey...
Whaaal!

344
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,499
Ky hey
Whaaa!

347
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,535
Watch out!

348
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,804
Be careful.- Takagi!

349
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,340
It, It moved,
When I tried to take the violin.

351
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,609
It moved away... Agh?!

352
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,211
Agh?!

353
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,888
I see, a pole was attached
to the window frame on both sides.

355
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,090
Then the violin is suspended
with a string.

357
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,192
Then the more the window is opened,

358
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,927
the farther the violin pulls away!

359
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,129
But. Dad...

360
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,131
What if it gets stuck like that?

361
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,568
There was no violin or pole
anywhere at the site

363
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,704
This is a temporary gimmick that
I made by borrowing a long chopstick

365
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,439
from the kitchen

366
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,844
If the two sticks that were used to carry out
the crime were the conductor's staff

368
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,545
that was stolen from Genzaburos room

369
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,547
they would be very flexible,

370
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,451
so the violin that moves to the edge will
eventually fall from its weight.

372
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:24,188
Therefore if thé other string that
Is attached to the violin is

374
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,758
stuck on to the window frame
of the room below

376
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,295
after we ran over to Ayane who
we were looking down upon,

378
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,397
he secretly went to collect the violin.

379
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,300
The staff would. still...

380
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,335
That too, .

381
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,638
Since it was only stuck on
using scotch tape

383
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,375
all he had to do was attach a string to it
to collect it later

385
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,679
The sound that we heard)
before Ayane fell. ispthe sound of that

387
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,481
violin bumping inte the wall. I

388
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:57,121
As proof of that,
a broken staff was found near the corpse.

390
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:04,362
He set up this/gimmick when he came
into this room to tune the Stradivarius...

392
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,066
This is probably when he switched
the genuine one for the replica too...

394
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,035
I'm sure that the conductor's staff and

395
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,205
violin that he collected are hidden
somewhere in the room below.

397
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,607
Of course,
with Kyosuke's fingerprints all over it.

399
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,311
It's hard to belicve that he hand time to
erase his: fingerprints or to take the things

401
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,449
to another place back then since Hasuki,
ho broke out in tears was there...

403
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,617
It can't be...! That's all baloney!

404
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,886
Uncle Kyosuke-can't Be the killer
because he saved Grandmother

406
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,724
who couldn't make:!'it. out of the fire in time.

407
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,796
If so. then why?!

408
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,799
Tha 8 because of
the rule of the "musical scale

410
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,801
that even you know of as a musician...

411
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,221
Huh...why do I spread my fingers out
when I play the piano?

413
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,874
Because see, when you play notes that
are alongside each other...

415
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,047
Cacophony.

416
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,083
When notes that are alongside each other
are played it sounds disharmonic...

418
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,785
D.Don't tell me that...

419
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,286
Exactly...

420
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,822
I couldn't stand the fact that:
Genzaburo with initial "G" and.

422
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:09,310
Grandmotnor Ayane with initial A's
die at the sameitime!...

424
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,066
Why you... just what do you
take the lll§of people to be!

426
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:19,037
Phooey! I'd like you to say those words
to Uncle Choichiro there too.

428
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,104
What?

429
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,906
To that old man over there, who was to
blame for my father getting seriously hurt.

431
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:26,411
Drove my mother to her death
from the heavy load of caring for father.

433
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,848
30 years ago You mean back
when that robbery occurred...

435
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,252
I had completely forgotten
about it until 2 years ago

437
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,522
when I was asked 10 tune the Stradivarius
during that old man's birthday.

439
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,224
The sound of the, the feel... it brought back
memories of when I was still a child.

441
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,727
The.:sound of the. the feel...

442
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,962
it brought back memories of
when I was still a child,

444
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,099
of when my father who: gave me the-violin...

445
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:52,937
When I confirmed with Aunt Eimi,
Swe o< mew: valpae ace.

448
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:58,309
That 30 years ago, that old man over there
borrowed: the Stradivarius from Father.

450
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,345
Saying that he wanted to make Furuto,
his songplay it...

452
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,918
The old man who fell in love with the tone,
didn't want to return the violin so.

454
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,238
He exchanged it for a replica
that looked exactly alike.

456
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,774
But, father found out right away
and the. got into an argument.

458
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,461
On top of that, after father
fell down the stairs

460
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,464
he was seriously hurt...

461
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,210
That old man had the nerve to leave father
who was seriously hurt as is and

463
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,810
didn't. even call.an ambulance.

464
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,314
He then told the four who
were there the following.

466
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,615
Genzaburo

467
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,618
tie.,Ayane. and me up and
ou. go Ss goon home!

469
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,652
What?!

470
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,489
We're going to make it look as if
we, were-attacked by robbers.

472
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:48,493
Don't you want to-play: this
famed musical instrument?

474
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:53,464
If Danjiro dies, this is mine
I'll lend it to you any time you want.

476
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:01,105
Aunt Eimi, who told me everything,
was besides herself and left the room.

478
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,040
Kyaaah!

479
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,022
So you decided to take revenge onuthe four
who agreed to the scheme back then.

481
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:24,128
When I saw Aunt Eimi trip over the stairs
and fall to her death like Father.

483
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,732
I took it to be a sign from God .

484
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,605
Starting from
my mother China

486
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,107
m. father Danjiro...

487
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,475
Aunt Eimi, they all died

488
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,211
I Kg,
in the order of the musical scale
And if lined the Initials of the ones

491
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,146
who Would be dying.

492
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:46,150
I figured It would begin
with "C" and end with "C".

494
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:50,621
Well but after pushing Furuto
off the veranda a year ago

497
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:55,560
I was sort of flustored when I found out
that the last one on the list with Initial

499
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,762
Gramps Choichiro was
about to die of an illness.

501
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:02,733
Ugh: ugh, cough, cough.

503
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,603
what took place 30 years:ago.

504
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,688
Was next in line to be killed after all...

505
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:15,146
No... in Germany after C-D-E-F-G-A
comes the alphabet

507
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,147
it's pronounced "HA".

508
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,333
In other words. it stands for Haga

509
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,718
Hey!
Agh!

511
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,520
Uncle!

512
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,733
Pops told me to do so.
So I told them to wait below with a mat.

514
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:40,704
Because he said that
\ osuke may commit suicide

516
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,075
But, if it was initial "H"
it could've been Hasuki.

518
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,111
It could've been her turn next.

519
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,449
Since Kyosuke brought the
Stradivarius back to.this room

521
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,517
I figured it wasn't going te be so.

522
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,954
If Ayane didn't break the replica
as she did back then

524
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:00,241
it would've been likely that
no one would've even noticed that

526
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:02,960
there was a replica of the
Stradivarius at all.

528
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:06,530
The fact that he came to return
the genuine one means that

530
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,199
he wanted to leave the famed.
Legendary gift that

532
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,035
his father had given him
o its rightful owner,

534
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,671
to the one that he had thrown into the
same situation as he was thrown into.

536
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,440
When they killed his father...

537
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,326
That is. Hasukl

538
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:21,245
He wanted to give it to you.

uh... .when I asked you about
the melody from my cell phone...

586
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,879
you answered "Me?"

588
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,254
Tell me what the notes are. please

589
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,356
H-A-G-A?

590
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:17,395
If in German would it be
pronounced HAGA?

592
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,432
That's right.
You've got a good ear too. sonny.

594
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,702
Which means that the
notes are Tl-La-So-La?

596
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:25,803
Hey. Conan...

597
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,873
Uh. do you know of any song
that begins with Ti-La-So-La?

599
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:33,310
It could be some sad,
yet nostalgic type of music...

601
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,713
Oh. if so, it's probably...

602
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,319
This song?

603
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,958
Isn't that song...

604
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,829
Crow little crow. why do you cry

605
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,597
Right, Conan?!

606
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,749
Conan?!

607
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,642

Oh...doesn't something taste sand ?

613
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,956
It's probably the ashes...

614
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,460
What's the matter?!
