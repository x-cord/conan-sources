Dr. Agasa s weird code is
even tough for the Youth Detective Squad

00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,112
Who's going to be the first to solve it!

Once hot summer day,
we came to collect insects.

00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,655
Doc gave us 1 codo quiz

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,795
But I couldn't solve the code either.

22
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,932
Meanwhile, I get a call
from Ran and'Sonoko

24
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:19,304
who are at the beach :sayingithat'there was
a murder at the héitdlrsthétirfftfeyére staying at!

26
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:24,743
Sonoko says that"there were strange letters
written on the window of hotel room

28
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,846
where the man:was killed...

29
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,748
S.Strange letters?

30
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,518
Yep...something like a code...

31
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,053
Who found the body?

32
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:39,341
The three friends of
Mr. Miyama who wastkilled!,

34
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:42,327
Mr. Miyama and those three wen.
Planning to have dinner together

36
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,997
but when they went to his room to get him

37
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,667
because he didn't come,
they found the door unlocked

00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:53,772

Then we...

43
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,566
Then the "tent" in the code points
to the Tento festival?

45
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:09,121
Even if that's so, I still don't
understand the maru mushi part...

47
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:14,525
That's where...
Marumushi hot spring is located...

49
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:18,847

does that mean to light it up?

Theré're a lot of people...

57
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,319
There must be some kind of a gathering,
don't you think...

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,390
Stupid! Take a closer look!
Everyone is holding a basin.

61
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,192
How: true!

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,712
The village probably bought the closed
down inn and the people are using it

64
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,581
as a public bath!

65
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,466

66
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:58,720
public bath...sento...

67
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:03,058
Maybe this tento
means "sento

69
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:08,180
No matter how you look at it,
Genta. this te doesn't look like se!

71
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,584
And it can't be "tentou because
there s no "u" after the "tento

73
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,258
I don't get it!

74
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,995
He I Genta...
Don't lie down in despair!

76
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:29,501
I'm not in despair! Remember
Doc told us to lie down and think it through

78
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,603
I just might get it!

79
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,338
Yeah. but...

80
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:40,679
Ai was saying that if we still don't get it,
we should wash our faces and start anew.

82
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,417
Since there's a public bath...why don't we
go and wash our faces and our bodies!

85
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,953
Tihat-s a great idea!

86
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,921
It's no use .

87
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:50,989
Huh!?

89
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,326
It's no use going to that inn...
there's nothing there...

91
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,528
W've got to do something!

92
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:59,398
Then tell us!

93
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,533
Where is the treasure?

94
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,402
Please! Tell us...

95
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:09,141
Sure...l can tell you...
If someone here gives up...

97
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,208
Umi?
Huh!?

99
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:11,810
Huh!?

100
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,413
I'm not giving up!

101
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:20,085
Hmm!? Mail...
It's from Sonoko...

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,689
Hmm? I thought her cell phone was
in the bag that was stolen...

106
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,497
I found this bag on the street
and since there was no ID,

108
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:40,237
I mailed the most recent person the
cell phone listed to have sent a mall to.

110
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:46,427
I want to send this bag to you, so-can you
please let me know your address. and-name.

112
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:51,183
It seems like the purse=snatcher just took
the purse and threw the bag away.

114
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:57,588
Wouldn't you usually ask for the address
and name of the owner of the bag...?

116
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,991
Why did this person send a mail?

117
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,326
Wouldn't it be quicker to look
at the record of calls made

119
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,395
and call someone from that list?

120
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:03,895
Huh!?

121
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,463
Huh!?

122
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,064
You give up. right?

123
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:08,266
Huh?

124
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,936
Oh...ah...Time out!

125
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,558
Take the bag to the police if you found it!

126
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:22,697
Hello, Ran? I just got mail from the person
ho found Sonoko's bag...

128
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:24,699
Oh. really?

129
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,322
You'll probably received mail too,
so can do something about it...

131
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:30,856
Hey. I'm sorry...

132
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:31,790
Hey. I'm sorry...

00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,591

135
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:32,924
What's up?

136
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:37,396
My batteries are almost gone.

the letters might mean tel shite"?

149
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:57,382
But that doesn't help to specify the killer,
SO we're going back to the hotel for now.

151
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:02,587
Hey, be careful. The purse-snatcher is
probably still roaming the streets.

153
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,856
We'll be alright!

154
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,094

Beach?

200
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,484
Talking about the beach. I found a jellyfish)!

201
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,752
+ What are you talking.about{Ayumi!

202
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:11,022
There are no jellyfish in the mountains!

203
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,224
Yas, there areal

204
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,961
See, there!

205
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,931
Really?

206
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,700
Huh!?

207
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,668
Se88...8 jellyfish

T.true

209
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,877
turn the hot spring mark upside down
and it looks like a jellyfish...

211
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,778
See?
Yeah .

213
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,413
I 88...

214
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,355
Turn the hot spring mark upside
1nd it looks like a jellyfish...

216
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,630
So that's it. that's what it is .

217
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,169
Lie down and wash you face. huh...

218
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,611
How stupid of me...
Having trouble with a code such as this...

220
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:11,182
Sometimes easy codes
are difficult to solve...

222
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,618
Huh?

223
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:19,424
Doc! It's about time...
Tell us the answer...

225
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,893
What's 'maru mushi nl tento"?

226
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,496
Ha. ha. ha...alright

227
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:28,700
No! I won't tell you until everyone gives up!

228
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,103
I'll give up so just tell me...

229
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,972
That's not fair Gental

230
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,106
Why Ran .

231
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,441
Conan

232
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,509
Huh!?

233
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,778
Can't you still solve it?

234
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:45,584
Uh, no... It's totally Greek to me,
I haven't got a clue...

236
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,053
Then hurry up and give up!

237
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,255
Conan! Admit defeat!

238
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:54,426
You guys give up too easily!

239
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:59,764
Ha, ha, ha, it seems like Shinichi
can't solve it yet either...

241
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,402
Anyway, let's think it over
from the very beginning

243
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:09,040
Let's take (these (8tters that
are written only in katakana...

245
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,243
It's understandstable that 'maru mush
and tento are written in katakana...

247
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,981
Don't you think it weird for the "ni"
in between to be in katakana too?

249
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,716
That's true...

250
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:22,921
Secondly, if you look closely,
the letters are not balanced.

252
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:23,989
How true!

253
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,525
Isn't that because
Doc's handwriting is messy

255
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,327
Ha, ha, ha

256
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:33,865
And thirdly.
The hint Doc and Haibara gave us!

258
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,302
What!? Did they give us a hint?

259
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:42,240
Yeah...
Iie down and think carefully and

261
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,710
If you don't get it,
wash your face and start anew"

263
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,613
are things Doc and Haibara
don't. usually say...

265
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:54,786
It's obviously a hint!! Maybe it means
to "lie down and look at these letters'

267
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,588
Okay!
Ah...

269
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,424
Lie down. right?

270
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,962
Ummm...

271
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,865
I don't see anything different.

272
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,135
Huh? What happened Gental?

273
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,003
Did ou get something!?

274
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,272
Yeah

275
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,491
Huh??

276
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:17,709
What?

277
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,577
Hey. Genta. what's going on!

278
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:24,481
Uh. no...ll thought I almost got it.

279
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,951
Almost?
Which Is it!

281
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:31,122
Shut up! I thought I could almost
read it when I lied down!

283
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,725
Phew
Close call, close call...

285
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:39,798
No...
That smile. that provoking annoying look...

287
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,667
He probably... already knows...

288
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:44,786
Hmmm

289
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:49,974
Mmmm, nothing comes to mind
evenuif I look at it from the side

291
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,579
Then let's look at the other hint

292
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,933
You mean the "go wash your face one?

293
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:02,687
But...to wash your face
in the middle of the woods...

295
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:07,926
Ah! Maybe...Does it mean to go
take a bath at the bath in the inn.

297
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:14,265
Huh? No...remember Halbara and Doc
said there was nothing at the inn...

299
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:16,601
Then where do you say we should wash?

300
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,669
Yeah. that's right!

301
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,806
I don't know... maybe it doesn't mean
to actually wash your face...

303
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,943
Maybe it has something to do with
what you do when you wash your face...

305
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,812
Hmmm... first of all, turn the faucet on...

306
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,348
Splash wator on your face...

307
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,683
Wipe your face with a towel...

308
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:34,686
And then after that?

309
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,887
After that...

310
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:39,090
Hmmm

311
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,659
Let's eat!

312
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,396
Hey! Gental We're talking about
when we are washing our faces!

314
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,465
You eat after you wash your face,
don't oul?

316
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,533
Mirror!

317
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,634
Huh!?

318
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,736
I look in the mirror!

319
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:56,341
Mirror!? You can only see your face in it}

320
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,676
I'm getting more mixed up!

321
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:01,546
I think the mirror is on the right track... see!

322
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,884
Turn it upside down
Iike that hot spring mark...

324
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:09,387
and it looks like something totally different,
Iike the jellyfish.

326
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:14,759
Ven if I hold ithupside down.
It doesn't look like a porgy or a flounder!

328
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,694
I can't even read what it says...

329
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,962
W.wait a minute!

330
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,801
Could it be, to wash your face
while lying down...

332
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,404
To look at the mirror with the letters written
downwards by turning it sideways...

334
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,875
Turn it sideways, reverse the paper
and look at it through the mirror!

336
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,856
Wow!

337
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:46,424
Wow!

338
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,495
Mum mutsun no torn

339
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,698
Mura matsuri no tori
(The shiine gate of the village festival!)

341
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,167
It's that shrine!

342
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,635
Are we right?
Doc! Ail

344
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:00,839
Correct!

345
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,509
You're correct! Hahaha...

346
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,110
San!

347
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,046
We did it!

348
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,414
Hahaha .

349
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,683
Let's hurry and go there!

350
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,418
Yeah!
Treasure! /,

352
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,693
1...you look like you taught the ki
that they can do it if they try...

354
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,229
Uh huh...don't I look great?

356
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:25,897
Huh...

357
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,435
Shinichi, aren't\you going to go see
what the treasure is?

359
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,971
I bet you want to see it 100...

360
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:37,041
I don't have to see it to know what it is!
The place of the code Is the tori gate of

362
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:42,313
the shrine that's lit up even late at night .

363
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,723
If we put sap on the pole of the toril gate.

364
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,226
DW OAR 0 OR BA exCtron

365
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,895
I found it!

366
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,596
Wow!

368
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,500
Unicorn beetles and stag beetles!

369
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,236
That's right!

370
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,406
Anyway...

371
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,443
You did a great job with the code .

372
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,513
This can be read from the front-and back .

373
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,248
Thanks to Ail

374
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,953
First
we were going to make it an animal code...

376
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:28,259
We thought of sticking paper with
animal names on the window!

378
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,597
Watching that from the outside. Ai told me!

379
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,800
Isn't "sanNnso (oxygen)
a little bit hard for the kids ?

381
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:36,534
Isn't 'sanso (oxygen)
a little bit hard for the kids?

383
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,802
Like that...

384
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:42,974
I see
The letters kirin looked like sanso

386
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,776
from the back and
mu thought of the coda.

388
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,780
Shinichi...?

389
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,952
Glass. back?

390
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,355
See through...w.wait a minute...

391
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,223
This!?

392
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,962
Dar ;!
That's it!

394
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,196
Shinichil?

395
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:06,264
Kudo!?

396
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:10,401
So that was it!
That's why Ran's face crossed my mind...

398
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,604
Ran...Ran's in danger!

399
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,186
Oh, Shinichi?
Where am I?

401
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:32,423
I told you
Returning to the hotel in Mr. Kanou's car...

403
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,126
What? Get out of the car now?

404
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,513
I got what "teiu really means!

405
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:45,386
There was a little punctuation
before the "t" in "teiu!!

407
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,272
Put that vertical and reverse it!

408
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,807
The killer's name

409
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:55,413
H.hey, Rani?
Ran!! Ran!

411
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,783
The batter's dead

412
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,518
Your husband...what did he say?

413
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,121
Hey Sonoko!

414
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,257
Um... get out of the car,
make it vertical andfreverse it?

416
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,458
VVihatis)it

417
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,828
Your husband! Maybe he's jealous?

418
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,065
N.no way...

419
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,804
What!? Ran and Sonoko are in trouble!?

420
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:25,743
Yeah... Sonoko saw it! The letters written
by the person murdered in the hotel room...

422
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,478
Letters!?

423
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,783
It was in lower case
alphabet written horizontally!

425
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,552
To be more accurate,
there's a comma before the.

428
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,893
It's the same as "Mura matsurl no tori!

429
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,464
Tun the letters written horizontally.
Vertical and read it from the back.

431
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,200
Maru mush! nl tento"

432
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,803
Make "Sanso vertical and read
from the back. and?

435
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,339
Then what about teiu!?

436
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,543
That is um .

437
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,812
It becomes "Kanou"...

438
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,866
Kanou...

440
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:12,757
Why did he leave such a difficult code
as ad ing message?

442
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,426
It's not a code!

443
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,029
Th murdered guy fell on the floor and

444
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,031
wrote the words
othe window from the inside

446
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:24,435
And Sonoko saw
the letters from the outside.

448
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,339
Then we have to hurry and tell Ran...

449
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,926
Ranis phone ls dead...

450
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:37,214
And the thing is, Ran and Sonoko are both
In a guy anous car.

453
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:49,310
Hey...this is not the way to the hotel.

454
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:52,463
Dont worry. it's a short cut...

456
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:56,400
where's the hotel those two are staying at?

457
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:01,939
If I knew I would call the police!
They told me they were going to the beach

459
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,341
but I don't know where...

460
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,777
Darn! I should've noticed earlier...

461
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:09,614
When I received the weird mail from
Sonoko's cell phone

463
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,583
whieh was thought to be mugged!

464
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:17,121
The picture sent to my cell phone,
he wanted to delete the picture

466
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,490
with the dying message

467
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,710
Thatrg why he asked
form address and name...

469
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,863
Wait a minute...then it must mean!

470
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,165
Hmmm...

471
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,600
The guy you were talking about,
Shinichi. he's only in high school.

473
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,135
Yet he's a detective?

474
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,837
H eah sort of...

475
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,673
Wow...having a detective boyfriend...

476
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,476
Uh. no he's not my boyfriend...

477
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,145
They're so lovey- dovey...

478
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:47,285
That's why I sent her boyfriend
a picture of her inf her bathingssuit

480
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,953
Hey Sonoko!?

481
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,320
Haha

482
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,825
That's so unfortunate...
Shinichi is not here. right?

484
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,095
I would have liked to meet the detective...

485
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,142
If the killer is waiting for me to contact him

486
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,879
he should be carrying Sonoko's cell phone
around with it switched on.

488
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,283
Realize that he's the man!
He's the killer!

490
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:25,022
NOT TNE Wie,
the same as Sonoko's...

492
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,893
Or rather, that...
IS mine...

494
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,895
You're right!

495
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:31,229
You're right!

496
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,347
Really!? But why?

497
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:40,070
TQ VY LLOLLWDY VANDA JWG
who snatched the purse from. you...

499
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:41,088
Huh!?

500
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,260
To erase the evidence of the killing!

501
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:47,545
What!?

502
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:52,883
When we go a little farther,
I want you to talk to me...

504
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,220
Andigive"me the address

506
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,158

Be quiet!

508
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,295
Uh...yeah...

509
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,765
He answered!?

510
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:12,887
