1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,253
A strong heart along
with deduction and power

3
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,988
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

5
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,956
A mysterious separate building
on the legendary pond.

7
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,725
The windmill turns as
the water changes color.

9
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:27,460
He sees through the one and only truth.

10
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,128
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,497
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

14
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,983
Mr Mourn.
You-mean that renowned detective?!

16
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,417
Yes, well

17
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,520
I got a notice from Mr. Shiro Suzuki
of the Suzuki financial group,

19
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,657
that someone else would be
attending in his place,

21
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,359
but I had no idea that it would be you.

22
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,861
Don't be too hard on me, please.

23
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,536
Just as expected from the master of the
tea ceremony. What a splendid house!

25
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,374
Jeez, a tea ceremony what a drag...

26
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,510
I wonder why I came along...

27
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,313
Conan, let's go.

28
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,015
Okay.

29
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,386
I guess I'll have to go through with it...

30
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:41,093
THE LEGEND OF THE 5 COLORED
WATER PALACE" Part I

32
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,898
How beautiful! Fantastic!

33
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,635
What a'terrific scenic view it is!

34
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,805
How wondrous for it
to be glowing golden!

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,573
You can say that again!

37
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,375
Is this the first time you've seen a pond?

38
00:02:57,044 --> 00:03:00,613
At this time of year,
depending on the angle of the sun,

40
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,680
the surface of the water changes into
5 different colors.

42
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,549
I seal

43
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,755
So that's why your home is called the
Five-colored water palace"!

45
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,958
Right By the way,
may I 'ask whattyour names are?

47
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,227
Oh, how rude of me.

48
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,063
They are the master's disciples and,

H... Hello!

61
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,674
They are the renowned detective,
Mr. Kogoro Mouri and his family.

63
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,210
You mean that famous!

64
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,978
What an honor.

65
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,650
Now that you are all here,
I will go and inform the master.

71
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,456
Master?

72
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,225
The master of the tea ceremony.

73
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,764
How interesting.
I wonder what sort of reception

75
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,201
the finicky master is going to give
Mr. Renowned Detective?

77
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,738
That's why I didn't want to come
Iin his place!

79
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,908
I'm sorry, but Sonoko pleaded with me so

80
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:09,315
Huh?
The maid

82
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:14,920
Which means that the master is there

83
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:19,692
Is that building in the middle
of the pond the tea room?

85
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,795
Huh? Oh, I guess so

86
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,497
The solemn atmosphere is just fantastic!

87
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,665
It is indeed the world of Wabi Sabi!

88
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,068
I'm sure that's the tea room!

89
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,269
Yes! that's right

90
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,173
It is called the "5 Colored Retreat

91
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,609
because it is built on top of the pond
that changes color.

93
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,211
It was built to get away
from worldly affairs,

95
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,146
as well as to forget about time.

96
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,448
I vs called the "5 olored Retreat'?

97
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,350
What a wonderful tea room.

98
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,018

Oh, you've already heard about him?

112
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,562
While you're at it why don't you tell

113
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:59,098
Mr. Renowned Detective
the monster story too?

115
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,168
Monster? What is that about?

116
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,672
Well, it is what you would call
a superstition regarding this pond.

118
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,308
Oh, no, not that please.

119
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,745
I just came to say hello,
so if you will excuse me...

121
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,451
Tell. you, Ms. Mimura,

122
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,121
I thinksyou je overdoing giving
R*oichi a bad time.

124
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:26,425
Well, let me tell you about it
over some plain hot water over there.

126
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,264
I hear it was towards
the end of the Edo Period.

128
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,203
This pond used to be filled with cold.
Clear spring water,

130
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,705
and was much larger than it is now.

131
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:47,012
Now, a beautiful woman
appears near the pond.

133
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,316
She plays the flute and changes
the color of the pond,

135
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:53,152
entertaining all who come to see her.

136
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:59,758
A wealthy merchant fell for the woman
one day. and married her.

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,328
He then built a house near the pond.

139
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,532
The woman married the man &
under one condition saying.

141
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:10,802
AThefoond is mine,
and no one shall set foot on it."

143
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,906
However,
the merchant breaks this promise,

145
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,009
and builds the bedroom
in the middle of the pond.

147
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,511
Not only does he get angry at his wife

148
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,248
who. clings to him and pleads him to
move the bedroom away,

150
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,316
He kills her and

151
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,787
sinks her body into the pond

152
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:34,093
One night. however,
a large snake appears from the pond.

154
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,995
And attacks the merchant.

155
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,966
The serpent turns out to be the woman.

156
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,402
She became the monster
that resides in the pond.

158
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,504
Although the merchant is*badly wounded,

159
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,974
he somehow makes it
back to the bedroom.

161
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,012
Since a talisman for keeping away
evil spirits was posted in the room,

163
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,948
he was no longer in danger
of being attacked.

165
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,285
However, the monster kept waiting,

166
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:02,087
be it day or night,
for the merchant to come out.

168
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,558
The merchant,
exhausted beyond capacity,

170
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,962
is said to have hung himself
in the building

172
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,102
It is still said today,
that the pond changes color

174
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,639
because the monster changes
into the figure of the woman

176
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,108
and appears, blowing the flute.

177
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:27,346
To think that there is a story
Iike that about the pond...

179
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,614
Everyone!

180
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,985
Thank you very-much for waiting.
Please follow me to the tearoom.

182
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,859
Huh? Isn't « oichi joining us?

183
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,097
Although he is the son of
the master of the tea Ceremony,

185
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,732
he isn't the least bit
interested in the practice

187
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,468
Oh, that sure is a problem.

188
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:54,139
Uh, I haven't said my
greetings to the master yet, though.

190
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,042
Please excuse the rudeness.

191
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:02,214
The master rarely comes out recently.

192
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:07,386
He does not. in particular--
cross this bridge alone.

194
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,963
Master, I've brought the guests

195
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,999
Master?

196
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:24,136
Maybe the monster ate him up?

197
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,709
Just what are you doing?!

198
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,478
M-m-monster!

199
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,517
How rude of you to look inside like that!

200
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,587
This is a sacred tearoom, understand?!

201
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,724
Away with you!
1 ~.»Leave this tearoom wightithis minute!

203
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,527
Master please calm downy

204
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,063
He is our guest today, Mr. Mouri!

205
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,132
What? A guest

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,168
You mean that person
who came on behalf of

208
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,836
Well. well .

209
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,140
Huh? A windmill in a place like that...?

210
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,776
Um, is that windmill there
just for decoration?

212
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,146
That's used to send water
to the river in the garden.

214
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:09,081
I hear it operates electrically now.

215
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,284
A timer is set-and it moves accordingly.

216
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,287
It used to be famous
as the water used for tea.

218
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,690
But. ever since this tearoom was built.
The amount of water decreased drastically.

220
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,161
Ms. Mimura, the master will hear you!

221
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,571
I'm sorpy for my rudeness 1 while ago.
In spite of-you having come all this way.

224
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,573
Thank you for spending your time here
with me today.

226
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,176
Thank you for spending your time here
with me today.

228

A talisman for keeping away evil spirits.

231
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,124
There are talismans posted everywhere.

232
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:55,127
Is he afraid of the monster of the pond,
after all?

234
00:09:55,727 --> 00:10:00,332
Master, did you already look at the object
that I asked Ms. Hanazaki

236
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,835
to hand over to you a while ago?

237
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,404
It is an object that had been handed
down for generations,

239
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,173
and given to me by a master

of the tea ceremony.

Mr. Mouri, today we have some fish that
is superb as a side dish to drinking sake

274

that we would like for you to taste.

will you warm up the sake for us?

00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,039
Dad, how embarrassing!

283
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,575
I'm going to get ready for the night, &

284
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,211
so don't anybody come near the tearoom ID

285
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,079
Yes, master.

286
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,826
Where are you going, Ms Mimura?

287
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,362
I've got another engagement.

288
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,364
Just what do you mean?

289
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,367
I«ll be right back!

290
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:48,073
How selfish can she be? The master
personally invited us, and yet

292
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,277
Oh, Mr. Yakura, the bath is ready.

293
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,413
Thanks so much.

294
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,552
The water of the pond has changed color!

295
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,088
The reflection from the light is gone,

296
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:06,325
and the inside of the pond can be seen,
That's why it's green

298
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,528
Next it will change to crimson
when the sun tilts its angle.

300
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,435
Ms. Hanazakil WW-what on earth
happened 'to'this fishing rod?!

302
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,135
W-well...

303
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,073
Master told me to burn it.

304
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,476
I thought...so...

305
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,946
No, Ryoichi!

306
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,014
Ryoichi!

307
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:34,086
We have guests tonight, so I'd advise you
to wait till the tea ceremony is over.

309
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,223
I know, I'm just going
to put-my-fishing rod away.

311
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,661
Fishing is Ryoichfs only- hobby.

312
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,597
What a cruel thing for the master to do.

313
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,869
But. to suddenly burst out in rage,
and burn fishing goods out of the blue?

315
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,639
I wonder if you can call that
mere foul temperament.

317
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:59,144
His wife passed away exactly during
the completion of that tearoom last year

319
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,614
She took the legend very seriously

320
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,018
and was against the building
ofithis tearoom to the very end.

322
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,254
It sure sounds familiar

323
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,056
Yes, sort of.

324
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:16,728
Among us, it is rumored that some have
seen the shadow of the monster.

326
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,999
In other word's, you're saying
that the master has become difficult

328
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,734
to get along with because of his
fear for the monster?

330
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:27,105
Not really. He laughs it off saying,
It's superstition without any grounds.

332
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,875
I'll go get the bath ready.

333
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,513
L:guess I'll go take a bath then.

334
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,181
Please excuse me

335
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,154
I wonder if there is really
such a thing as a monster

337
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,223
D-d-don't be ridiculous!

338
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,815
W who is I rd

339
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,091
Huh? You're...

340
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,660
Are you bored?

341
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,061
Sort of.

342
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,032
Did you catch that big fish?

343
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,667
Yeah, right!

344
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:32,504
Conan, there you are!

345
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,239
Oh. I'm sorry

346
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,943
Shall we go to the guest room
and eat some candy?

348
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,478
Okay.

349
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,949
Hey! Conan, where were you?

350
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,151
He was at Ryoichirs room for a while.

351
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:49,054
There was a large fish print
decorating his room.

353
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,257
Well, Ryoichi is really something.

354
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,659
He invites me to go
night fishing with him sometimes,

356
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,195
but I can't come anywhere near him
when it comes to catching fish.

358
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,367
That's the burglar alarm
Maybe somebody's come.

360
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,010
Huh?

361
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,581
+. Why might she be looking around?

362
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,655
Look, the pond is red now!!

363
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,958
It's SO bright and can't bare looking at it.

364
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,664
00. Just about this tin
the sunlight diffuses reflection

366
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:37,569
Oh, I'mlso, so hot. Ms Hanazaki,
do you have 'anything cold to drink?

368
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,672
Ms Mimura, where were you?

369
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,408
What? It's none of your business, is it?

370
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,113
Her clothes are falling apart
and she Is sweating profusely.

372
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,549
She must've been in one heck of a rush.

373
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,385
Ms. Mimuratahow rude of you!

374
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,687
He invited you ever, after all, you know.

375
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,391
Phooey. just who the heck
do you think you are?

377
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,594
It's a tea ceremony
that is to be given by the master!

379
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,863
It is utterly rude
to run out on him like that!

381
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,834
Well, come now: both of you.

382
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:12,170
I hear that after all. this will be the
Iast tea ceremony he 'will be carrying out.

384
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,009
That's it! I'll bet you were dying
to have the master resign!

386
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,413
Just what do you mean by that,
Ms. Mimura?!

388
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:24,282
I would rather you not
make ugly assumptions!

390
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:28,920
Oh, all right, all right, I'm so sorry.

391
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,460
Oh, my, how upsetting!
Even the color of the pond looks hot.

393
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,435
What's wrong?

394
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,571
T-that's...

395
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,074
The master!!

396
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,043
¥Father?!

397
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,455
Father?!

398
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:05,857
Frey, what's with all this blood?!

399
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,293
No good, the door is locked!

400
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,895
Is there 'any other entrance?

401
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,463
The washing basin entrance is behind.

402
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,230
Wellelallk

403
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,866
The door to the washing basin
is also locked!

405
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,035
We've got no choice,
Iet's kick the door open!

407
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,403
Please move out of the way!

408
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,677
Master?!

409
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,779
Master!

410
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,220
No good... he's dead.

411
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,088
Father .

412
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:44,629
I-ites the legend! Justias in-the legend,
Master was killed by the monster!

414
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,400
Father!

415
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,739
Officer

416
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,843
Wow?! Well, hello there, Conan!

417
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,412
Officer Yokomizo?!.

418
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,981
Which means that Mr. Mouri is also here?

419
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,317
Yep, he's over there.

420
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,989
Hello, Mr. Mouri
I'm sure 'glad to see you again!

422
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,759
I'm sure not happy to see you, though.

423
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,796
Ah, you don't have to hide
your embarrassment.

425
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,232
Officer Yokomizo.,
what we've found out so far is

427
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,635
that this door of
the miniature entrance was locked

429
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,437
from the inside by a long wo den stick.

430
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,374
As for the window,
the sliding door was slightly open,

432
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,443
however, as you can see,
it is blocked by a trellis.

434
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,213
To the east there is the entrance
to the washing basin,

436
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,816
but this was also locked from the inside.

437
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,352
Are you saying
that all the doors were locked?

439
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,653
Yes.

440
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,656
The estimated time of death is
between 15:30 to 16:00.

442
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,858
The corpse was bleeding

443
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:52,397
However, the direct cause of death is
thought to be suffocation by strangulation

445
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,634
It's suicide. Look at the blood stain.

446
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,173
The master first tried to commit
suicide by slashing his wrist at the porch

448
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,977
But he failed. so then he maybe
he tried slashing his neck?

450
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,945
If so, that explains the blood stains

451
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,349
that are seen all the way
from here to the tearoom.

453
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,123
If he failed to commit suicide
at the porch and tried to hang himself,

455
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,492
he wouldn't have had the time
to lock the room.

457
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,329
The windmill is spinning

458
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,267
Talk about a small entrance!

459
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,341
There are remains of
a thumbtack or something

461
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,942
having been stuck in the back of the door.

462
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,255
Tithe rope is cut in a strange fashion.

463
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,691
It seems to have been cut part way,
but pulled apart towards the end.

465
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,034
The hanging scroll is spreadwwut on the floor.

466
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,471
He must've beenggetting ready for
the tea ceremony to be held this evening.

468
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,842
Although he was getting prepared,
he impulsively chose to die.

470
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,710
I guess that's what happened.

471
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,146
The writing is only half done

472
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,483
This rubbish? Wooden shavings?

473
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:23,988
Even on the tatami floor...
I see!

475
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,156
It's wood from the pillar
that the rope was tied onto.

477
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,395
Th...?7 But, there is a scrat
on the wood that served as support.

479
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,698
I can't see too well.

480
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,603
Hey, when the heck did you get in here?!

481
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,105
Sto>y ettin in the wa!

482
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,509
Will you carry me on your back?

483
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,511
What the heck are you talking about?!

484
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,512
Get out of here!

485
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,147
Hey, hey!

486
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,818
Just as I thought!

487
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,522
Marks of friction are left on places
other than where the rope was hung

489
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,425
Moreover, it's still new...

491
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,762
Suit yourself!

492
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,066
He was killed by the legendary monster?

493
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,605
Do ou expect me
a police.o ficer, to believe that?

495
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,707
T-there's no doubt about it.

496
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:18,743
From the blood stains on the porch
to the fact that he hung himself,

498
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,412
it's all so similar to the legend!

499
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,149
There may be no monster,

500
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,185
but he was killed as the legend said...

501
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,021
so it's just as if he were killed
by the monster after all.

503
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,992
This tearoom shouldn't have been
built after all.

505
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,829
Right after the completion of the tearoom
his wife dies of a heart attack

507
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,666
And, now the master...

508
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:45,136
This is unmistakably
the doings of the monster.

510
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,139
Which means...

511
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,709
He seems to have been pretty
worn out mental, ,

513
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,512
so I'm pretty sure he committed suicide.

514
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,445
Yes.

515
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,453
No, this is not suicide!

516
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,156
It's homicide!

517
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:11,362
Lymisu e that someone here schemed
a'very-clever trick and killed the master.

519
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,897

00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,923
Care only about how it looks like
on the outside"...
