12
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,211

One more time...

22
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,831
Is that what you're saying?
Shinnichi!

24
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,332
Yes...

25
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,569
If you couldn't find the weapon
in the cabin,

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,940
the killer could still have it
In their possession.

29
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,308

35
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,155
notepad and a ballpoint pen.

36
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,693
That's it. Nothing resembling
a weapon is in here...

38
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,194
How about that pen...

39
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:42,795
Huh?

40
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,765
Did you check inside the pen?

41
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,200

a few motion sickness pills...

50
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,584
The only sharp instrument would be

51
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:09,488
the tiny sewing scissors and
needles in this...

53
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,059
but you couldn't kill anyone like that
with these, it's impossible.

55

00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,731

84
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,169
He said he was going to buy some art
objects sold at an auction here in Japan...

86
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,938
but since he didn't find anything
interesting, he stopped payment.

88
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,207

00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,942

101
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,499
both Chizuru and TsuGumi
gave me some

103
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,133
Right?

105
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,137
May I see these negatives for
a little while?

107
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,111
Why you!!

108
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:17,716
The man in this picture... Isn't it
Mr. Dickson, the American senator?

110
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,653
Why you're right... He's with a woman
in this picture

112
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,189
Hey! That's enough

113
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,025
Wait a minute, those are the same
as Kazuhiro's!.

115
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,160
He same, you mean...

116
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,330
And if they're in your possession.
That means...

118
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,832
No. no! Wait...

119
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,970
These are definitely mine!

120
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,040
Ohtaka & I were staked out at the hotel
together, we both took those photos...

122
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,608
They're...

123
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:48,713
not as good as Ohtaka's but I was
going to a newspaper in Los Angeles

125
00:05:48,714 --> 00:05:51,951
and... sell my pictures too

126
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:57,022
Besides, you should find the weapon
efore accusing me...

128
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,994
Now now... we'll listen to all your
complaints after the body check

130
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,262
Now... ladies &gentlemen

131
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,664
just like beforeÂ» I want you to come
to the toilet one by one...

133
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,401
The women will be examined by the flight
attendants & we will examine the men .

135
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,675
So this where the victim sat.

136
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:20,312
According to the seat numbers on
the boarding pass}

138
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,849
Mr. Saginuma was behind him &
Mr Crow in the front...

140
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,453
Miss Amano to the right &miss
Tachikawa on the inside.

142
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:31,123
And across the aisle to
the left is Mr. Ukai...

144
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,463
Why this is!

145
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,633
A piece of a negative...

146
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,569
what is something like this
doing beside Mr. Saginuma's seat...

148
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,704
Shinic

149
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,907
They're done with the body checks...

150
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:52,645
It seems no one had the weapon...

151
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,814
Which means... that's the only answer...

152
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:59,385
There. you see!!
We didn't have the weapon!

154
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,987
I had to undress twice!

155
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,657
I don't want to go through this again!

156
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,225
What shall we do, Inspector?

157
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:11,597
Hmm. we've searched everywhere...

158
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,399
No, not quite everywhere

159
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,199
What?!

160
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,636
There's still one place we haven't
searched...

162
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,840
Inside the victim's bags!!

163
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:30,015
Which one is his?

164
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,786
Uh... it's that black bag in the back...

166
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,290
Is something wrong?

167
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:43,162
No .l just remembered something
strange he said...

169
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,597
Something... strange?!

170
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,235
It was about a week ago, he said he
forgot his bag at the studio

172
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,872
& someone cut it to shreds...

173
00:07:53,873 --> 00:08:01,747
That's why...he bought a new one...
for this trip...

175
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,750
Maybe someone was after those
negatives

177
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,219
that's why it happened...

178
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,925
Passport, camera, film, sunglasses,
3 packs of cigarettes...

180
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:17,496

00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:22,601
Shinichu...

185
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,135
Shinichau...

186
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,171
Really?

187
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,809
What's this? Kazuhiro Ohtaka...

188
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:36,181
Mr. Ohtaka... is he the fellow who won
the Nichiuri Newspaper's

190
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,283
Photo contest 3 years ago...

00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,121
Why yes. . that's him

192
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,654
I knew it...

193
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,157
What is it, Takagi?!

194
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:48,861
Look... it's that picture of a mother trapped
in the fire, she's handing her

196
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,928
k... it's that picture of a mother trap
in the fire, she's handing her

198
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,731
daughter to the fireman on the ladder

199
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:54,832
Oh...

200
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,736
Forget about that!
That's not the issue here!

202
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,407
Are we or aren't we cleared?
Which is it!!

204
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:05,476
But you 4 were the only ones who
went to the toilet: at the time the

206
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:09,782
crime was committed...
That boy gave the statement.

208
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,954
Humph! I'll bet that kid who
thinks he's a detective...

210
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,024
fell asleep &missed a.couple
of people...

212
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,162
It seems you've read a lot of books &
id a lot of studying but...

214
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:27,099
this is a real murder! It's not like
your book...

216
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,171
Children should behave. go back to
your seat & take a nap

218
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:36,408
Shinichi! Why don't you say something!

219
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,377
What is it with this case...

220
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:44,416
the weapon can't be found... and all
their alibis just don't add up...

222
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,220
How about telling us the truth

223
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,321
What?

224
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,390
It's you, isn't it? You killed him...

225
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,692
Hey come on now...

226
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:58,063
Tithe only one among all of us obviously
telling a lie, is you...

00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,533
I saw you!!

229
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,403
When this girl was asking the flight
attendant for medicine,

231
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:08,073
the victim was asleep & your seat in
the back of him, was empty!

233
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,975
You're a liar!!

234
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:14,980
I am not lying! The truth is...
truth is we... both...

236
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,216
There... that's the flight attendant!

237
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:21,186
She &ll, that flight attendant is my witness...

238
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,957
And that's his statement...

239
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,426
Is it true?

240
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:33,999
Es... this passenger was wandering
around the cabin so I called out to him...

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,572
he asked me to caution a<passenger.in
the non smoking section:who was smoking...

244
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,676
And? Was this man in this seat when
you got there?

246
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,580
No... I don't believe so...

247
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,817
Hey! You, are you blind or something?

248
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,586
You were the one who brought the

251
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,856
You saw me sleeping in my seat.
Didn't you!

253
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:04,162
No, I don't remember clearl

254
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,969
Excuse me... when you brought the
medicine, could it be possible that...

256
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,374
could that have happened?

257
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:20,279
That's right! But I though
was my imagination...

259
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:26,652
Therese n ydoubt about it!
That's the killer!

261
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,055
That'll explain, everyone, except
the killer's story

263
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,558
& why a piece of negative was on the seat...

264
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,726
the unexplainable blood on the toilet wall,

265
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:43,168
&why the victim's pocket was wet.!!
But why?

267
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,238
Why didn't the killer have the weapon?

268
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:51,009
Because it couldn't be gotten
rid of, is that possible?

270
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,779
Is it something the owner would miss
if it was gone?

272
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,751
Wait a minute... I just realized
that person did...

274
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,689
Hey! Shinichi Inspector Megure's
calling you

276
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:09,394
He wants you to go around the cabin &
see if anyone else went to the toilet!

278
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,532
Mind that Ran, you're...
school, aren't you?

280
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,134
What? Of course I am...

281
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,903
Then let me...ask you...

282
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,307
What?

283
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,081
Tell me quick!
I'm embarrassed to ask this...

285
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:33,118
Yes... that's right! Most of
them are like that now...

287
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,021
I see, so that's what it was...

288
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,158
do you mean by that...
do you look so satisfied?

290
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,363
I finally figured it out! I know what
the killer's trump card is.

292
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:47,899
What was used to snuff the life out of the
VIC II'mn.

295
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:55,841
At any rate! The only one who acted
suspiciously, is you

297
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,276
Mr. Saginuma, onl you!

298
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,311
No. not...

299
00:12:59,345 --> 00:12:59,745
No, no...

300
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,648
You're wrong, Inspector Megure

301
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,052
He's not the Killer!

302
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:13,392
He was never near the crime scene so
his chances of being the killer is zero!

304
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,493
But, but...

305
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,862
See, what a relief!

306
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:21,199
I had nothing to do with all of this!

307
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,103
No... that's not exactly true...

308
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,073
Mr. Saginuma...

309
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,175
you were taken advantage of without
your knowing...

311
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,580
By a person in that group... the one
person who gave a false testimony...

313
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,082
the killer...

314
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:41,952
Which means, Inspector... it was Miss
Tachikawa who said she went to the toilet

316
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:46,457
to check on the victim & knocked
on the door & got a knock in reply!

318
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,161
Wait just a minute!

319
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,797
No, she wasn't lying

320
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:59,271
There realll was someone inside the
toilet at that time...inside with the victim...

322
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,040
Mr. Crow...Yes, you!!

323
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,143
Are you sure about that?

324
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:10,348
He put his hand into Mr. Ohtaka's
pocket looking for the negatives &

326
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:16,254
realized the cologne on his wrist
rubbed onto the pants!

328
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:19,825
So he hurriedly washed his hands to
wash the cologne off then he wet his

330
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:24,730
handkerchief to wipe the telltale
scent from the pants...

332
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:29,735
The proof is, there's no cologne on
his Wrist

334
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,105
That's not what I'd consider proof...

335
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,907
besides, to get his statement, we'll
have to ask him in English...

337
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,111
No... he speaks Japanese!

338
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,713
Isn't that right Mr. Crow?

339
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,884
The boy's right...

340
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,652
He... spoke!

341
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,156
Japanese...

342
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,091
Of course he did!

343
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:58,764
He intended to buy those negatives
with the check from the National Bank

345
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,332
Buy?!

346
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,700
That's right

347
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:07,606
Senator Dickson himself asked me to...

348
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,675
So was it you?!
Did you kill Ohtaka?

350
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,778
No, he's not the killer...

351
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:18,617
Because when he went into the toilet,
Mr. Ohtaka was already dead

353
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,853
What was that?!

354
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:25,123
Isn't that right... Mr. Crow?

355
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:30,695
Es... when I heard he had gone to th
toilet.

357
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,031
I thought it was my chance to
ake a deal with him...

359
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:38,203
but there was no answer when I knocked
so I opened the door &went in

361
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:42,908
he was dead. Of course, I didn't
get the negatives

363
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,411
Then YOU answered my knock?

364
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,612
Yes...

365
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:54,219
Hey, don't be fooled by this! He's
just confirming that kid's guesswork!

367
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,389
Guesswornk?
Absolutely not...

369
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,159
There were bloodstains on the toilet wall...

370
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,532
Yet there was no blood on the victim's back
although he was leaning on the stains...

372
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:14,439
this indicates someone else moved the
body after some time had passed...

374
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,576
Someone who found the body but
didn't notify anyone...

376
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,811
the only reason I can come up with for
moving the body is,

378
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,881
to look for those negatives.

379
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:26,551
But unable to find them. the
person searched his pants pocket...

381
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:32,023
Ly one who would do that... w
be someone sitting in front of the victim.

383
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,894
Someone who couldn't see what the victim
was doing, that could only be Mr. Crow!

385
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,363
Yes, I get it!!

386
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,832
Alright then... who did it?
Who's the killer?!

388
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,236
We have now eliminated Mr. Crow
&Miss Tachikawa

390
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,238
who was outside knocking on the door

391
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,509
Which leaves us Mr Ukai & Miss Amano

392
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,614
This is the crucial point...

393
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:59,217
Mr. Ukai testified that when Miss Amano
asked for the medicine,

395
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:04,956
Mr. Saginuma's seat behind the victim,
was unoccupied!

397
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,858
I'm sure about that!

398
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,129
And I'm telling you, I was there all
along, sleeping!

400
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,967
He's right... Mr. Saginuma was asleep
in his seat...

402
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:20,805
The killer put a knit cap on his head
& covered his eyes with an eyemask!

404
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,641
Hat was that...!

405
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,476
That style. do you mean...

406
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:28,246
That's right. . that is Mr. Ohtaka's
sleeping style...

408
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,918
After killingÂ¥him. instead of return
to their own seat,

410
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,354
the killer, sat next to Mr. Saginuma &made
him up to look like Mr. Ohtaka

412
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,989
then called the flight attendant!

413
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,927
To give the illusion Mr.
Ohtaka was still alive at that time...

415
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,762
Hold it, you mean...

416
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,298
I don't believe it

417
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,499
That's right...

418
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,868
The person responsible
for killing Mr. Ohtaka

420
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,238
& using Mr Saginuma to fake an alibi is...

421
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,219
Tsugumi Amano!
It's you!!

423
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,621
No way, he's kidding isn't he?
Tsugumi...

425
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:10,655
Tsugumi?!

426
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,460
1.... we can't blame the flight atten
for making a mistake...

428
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,128
after all, the cabin was dark...

429
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,998
& the only part of his face not covered by
the blanket, was the nose up...

431
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:23,535
While the flight attendant was getting the
medicine,

433
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,570
Miss Amano went back to her own seat...

434
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,106
Then woke Miss Tachikawa by moaning
exaggeratedly!

436
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,951
Making sure she noticed Mr.Ohtaka's
seat was empty...

438
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,289
This gave Miss Tachikawa & the
flight attendant the wrong impression about

440
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,024
when Mr Ohtaka went to the toilet!

441
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:49,327
Then... the empty seat I saw...Â»

442
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,164
Just by chance, there was an empty seat
behind Mr. Saginuma

444
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:59,237
But she wouldn't have been able to
use this trick if the seat was occupied!

446
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:03,875
She made several reservations &unless she
cancelled, the seats would remain empty...

448
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:08,947
if the medicine she gave Mr. Saginuma was
sleeping pills, rather than air sickness pills,

450
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,815
he wouldn't wake up so easily...

451
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,185
the knit cap was in her bag...

452
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:22,060
and she knew his habit of using an
eyemask so there was no problem!

454
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:26,698
But what if the flight attendant noticed
Miss Tachikawa wasn't

456
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,767
next to her the first time...

457
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:34,139
All she had to do was create a camouflage,
drape a blanket over her bag...

459
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,274
I believe she cut the negative into
small pieces with the scissors in the

461
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:40,078
sewing kit &flushed them down the
toilet bowl.

463
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,448
The killer wanted usÂ«to think the
murder was linked to the negative.

465
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,184
Drawing attention away from her...

466
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,720
I found a piece of the negative she
cut on the seat next to Mr. Saginuma

468
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:53,691
it was stuck to her clothes &fell
there when she sat down...

470
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,160
Check it out!

471
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,094
Yessir!

472
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,864
This is how it went...

473
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,334
She waited for Miss Tachikawa to
fall asleep &told Mr. Ohtaka

475
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,771
she had to talk to him &told him to wait
in the toilet...

477
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,041
Then she got the bottle containing
the anesthetic soaked handkerchief &

479
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,743
weapon &headed for the toilet...

480
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,945
As soon as he opened the door.

481
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:17,348
She pressed the handkerchief over his
mouth knocking him unconscious

483
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:22,353
then stabbed him in the cervical cord...
after that, she cut the negative up,

485
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,522
flushed it down the toilet bowl &
Iocked the door from the outside

487
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:29,560
Using this trick... when she returned
from the toilet, it would appear

489
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,998
Ohtaka was still alive...
alibi was perfect!

491
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:40,338
But-what if someone goingsto the
toilet saw her leaving the scene...

493
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:45,877
I'm sure that while committing the
crime, she left the door unlocked

495
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:51,349
That way, even if someone tried to get in,

496
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:55,653
it's so narrow in there, it wouldn't open up
if someone held it closed from inside

498
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,324
& realizing someone was inside, the
person outside would go to another toilet...

500
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,326
That's enough!

501
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,428
After all these accusations, I'm sue you
have proof, don't you!

503
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,130
Proof that Tsugumi did it!

504
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,367
I have the murder weapon &the proof

505
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:13,271
I'm sure she still has it on her!

506
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,345
Hah! What are you saying! She's had
2 body checks!!

508
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:23,581
Because it's something we would never
suspect...

510
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,352
It'll even pass the metal detector at
the air ort...

512
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,288
Something only women use...

513
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,656
Something only we use?

514
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:35,927
Ridiculous. nothing as convenient as
that could possibly exist!

516
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,631
Tsugumi... you didn't...

517
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:45,870
Miss Amano...
it's the linger you're wearing .

519
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,339
It's the wire under your right breast...

520
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,911
Hahaha. a woman couldn't possibly
kill anyone with something like that!

522
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:56,881
If you sharpen the end & stic
it into the back of the head.

524
00:21:56,882 --> 00:22:01,853
Putting all your stcength into it & push it 5
to 6 centimeters into the cervical vertebrae.

526
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,088
The tip will reach the
cervical cord

528
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,791
even a woman could do it!

529
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:11,695
Along with the fatal injury on Mr Ohtaka's
neck. there were many scratch marks...

531
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:15,934
That's where the unsharpened end
moved &scratched him

533
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,772
The reason Miss Amano didn't get
rid of the wire is.

535
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,443
If it was found at
the scene, we would suspect

537
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:30,281
the woman with wire in only one
side of her bra. that's why...

539
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:38,256
I understand! We'll just have her go
through another body check!!

541
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:41,226
No Mr Saginuma... it's no use

542
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,464
If they search me again... thÃ©y'lll*find, its.

543
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,199
Tsugumi

544
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,835
It's true... I killed Kazuhiro...

545
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:56,641
3 years ago, he won the Nichiuri
Newspaper's news photo contest...

547
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,843
was that photo's fault...

548
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:04,349
What are you saying! That photo's the one
that brought you two together, isn't it?

550
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,387
That's right... I became interested in
im because of that photo...

552
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:14,058
I was so impressed that anyone could
have captured the ferocity, the tragedy,

554
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,529
the grief of that fire which took my
brother's life, all that emotion in a photo...

556
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,799
So why... then?

557
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,871
That photo... wasn't the only one he
took that day.

559
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:30,475
I found a mountain of them in his room!!

560
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,845
Some showed smoke rising from
the condominium my brother lived in...

562
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:38,816
and there were so many shots of the
condominium BEFORE the fire!!

564
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,953
You don't mean. . Kazuhiro...

565
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,288
He set the fire himself...

566
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,289
That's right!

567
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,158
When I asked him, he practically
boasted about it!!

569
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,194
You can't just wait around for a great
hot to come along...

571
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,497
You have to make it happen...

572
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,831
That's what he said...

573
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,041
I'm so upset...

574
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:08,880
I was so sure no one would figure out
where I hid the murder weapon

576
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,349
It's the arm you raised...

577
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,752
When you were about to lower his
bag from the cabinet,

579
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:19,424
you raised your left arm &then stopped but
then raised your right arm to take it out

581
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,759
That's what gave you away

582
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,229
The sharpened end of the wire must
have shifted

584
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,067
& poked into you making
you stop, isn't that right...

586
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,338
You mean... a detail that small
made you suspect me?

588
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,941
The smallest, most likely to be overlooked
detail usually

590
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,943
turns out to be the most important...

591
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:43,014
Your seemingly
casual action... in my eyes,

593
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:46,150
appeared unnatural & thus stuck with
me...

595
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:54,791
Her arm... did you noticeiit?
Inspector!!

597
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,327
No... not at-all

598
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,837
By the way, Inspector. why are you
going to LL. A.7?

600
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:10,908
Oh uh... to pick up a Japanese national
on the International wanted list...

602
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,845
I see...So that's what it was about...

603
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,081
That's why you asked me about it...

But you said,Show me your bra!!

648
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:57,482
There's wire in it, isn't there!
Is that how you're supposed to ask?

650
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,985
That, Shinichi, is considered
to be sexual harrassnent!

652
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:05,389
Oh no... don't tell me... that Ran,
she's dreaming about that case...

654
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:11,729
Hey! What are you talking about!
Did that creep so something to you?!

656
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,397
I wonder what she's dreaming about

657
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:17,568
I dreamt about stuffing myself
with eel on rice...

659
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,672
Sir... we will be in the landing
position soon,

661
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,608
please return to your seat...

662
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,714
You idiot! How can you expect me to
remain calm when my daughter is suffering!

664
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,115
But sir!!

665
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,284
Hey... what does sexual
harassment mean?
