00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,737
Because we cherish them we can continue

Leaves the secret of

He sees through the one and only truth,

00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,611
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult

Secret Hidden in the Toilet Part 1

15
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,168
Do you know?

16
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:17,803
Huh

17
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,009
If you put those on,
nobody will ever-guess your identity

19
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,313
You fool!

20
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,555
Don't run. At!

21
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,125
Don't run from destiny!!

22
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:46,732
Besides.

23
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,067
I gave her my word...

24
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,804
That if she.gets into trouble
I would look after her!!

26
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,507
Because she's not
as tough as she looks...

28
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,719
Medicine...

29
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,555
A doctor examined me...

30
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,158
But. don't remember...

31
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,661
The only thing I remember is...

32
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:17,529
that Doc carried me...

33
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,399
and we left the department store...

34
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:24,570
If I remember correctly... after that I...

35
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,088
How stupid of me...

36
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,923
If they found me

37
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,892
I would be in no circumstance
to be dreaming something like that.

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,295
Dr. Agasa wouldn't be dozing off like that

40
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:10,415
Doc .

41
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,891
Doc '2!

42
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:21,927
Hey. Al...

43
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,294
Hey. Ar...

44
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,062
So. you're up?

45
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,487
Tomato juice...

46
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,757
Tell Doc

47
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,725
not to drink canned tomato juice
while looking through the Internet...

49
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,830
because he always falls
asleep part way and spills it...

51
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,534
B-By the way. why are you here...

52
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:06,038
I had this bad feeling
so I came to check on you...

54
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,574
I told Ran I was going to
help Doc take care of you...

56
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,878
Well, it seems it wasn't worth the worry,

57
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,080
SO you can go back to sleep...

58
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,850
Sorry to keep you waiting

59
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,054
Your egg porridge is ready!!

61
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,657
It's not as good as
the one at Tarugatei, but...

63
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,360
Huh? She went to sleep?

64
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,162
Strange...

65
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,129
I thought she was up just a minute ago...

66
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,301
Okay then I'll leave this here...

67
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,338
After Al eats this.
tell her to let me know how it was

69
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,740
O-Okay!

70
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,409
See you, since I've got to go see Sonoko.

71
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,646
Ah. go out the same way you came in...

72
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,749
Go through the basement and then
through the back door, right?

74
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,985
You'd better hurry and
get the front door fixed. Doc!

76
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,153
Y-Yeah...

77
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:58,523
Bye. Conan.

78
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,725
Thank you Ran!!

79
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,479
What's with you...

80
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,899
You're really good at fake crying...

81
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,936
But you're the pits when
it comes to faking being asleep...

83
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,371
What is it with you?

84
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,673
She comes all the way here
to make egg porridge for you

86
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,007
and you ignore her completely!

87
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,376
I didn't...

88
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:19,044
ask her to do it for me...

89
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,080
It's not that I understand you
don't care much for people like Ran

91
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,816
who like to take care of other people but...

92
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,119
he did make it for you.

93
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,621
So eat it before it gets cold!

94
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,793
You don't understand anything...

95
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:35,894
do ou...

96
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:37,996
Well

97
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,632
it's not that I want you.
To know either. but.

99
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,807
But. we:re lucky that the weekend's come...

100
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:49,775
Yeah...

101
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,177
we can't let Ai go walking around

102
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,379
when weird guys are sniffing around...

103
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,281
LA TX

105
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,763
It seems that Ali's recovering
from her cold too...

107
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,634
At this rate. we may be able to go visit

108
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:21,440
Al's father, Dr. Miyano's friend next week.

109
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:21,940
Huh

110
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,243
Hey. what does it mean?

111
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,280
Oh, didn't I tell you?

112
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,617
I asked my doctor acquaintances
about Dr. Miyano, and

114
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,587
found out that he had a childhood
designer friend who

116
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,224
was with him together in elementary,
intermediate and high school!

118
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:43,612
Something about this designer
having helped him bind a book that

120
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,781
he had privately published...

121
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,335
Although the book didn't sell,
the design was innovative and

123
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,138
was reputed highly
among the other doctors too...

125
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,740
If we see that person,
we may be able to find out

127
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,009
about the Men in Black
that you're looking for

129
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,380
and about Ali's parents too...

130
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,985
My... father and

131
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:08,386
mother...

132
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,328
Hey. hey!

133
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,430
You're not well at all.

134
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,032
We don't need to go today. do we

135
00:08:21,484 --> 00:08:23,818
We don't know

136
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:24,986
where they're looking out for.us. you know.

137
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,772
Aren-t you the very one

138
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,274
who wants to go?

139
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,509
Well,

140
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,178
it's true that I'd like to see him if I get
to find out about those guys. but...

142
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,348
Then, stop blabbering.

143
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,268
Well. it's true that I mm worried.

144
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,621
But we're fine just like this.

145
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,624
So I'm sure they haven't
grasped anything on us yet...

147
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,108
Yeah...

148
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,659
fl guess so...

149
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,963
If my deduction's correct.

150
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:57,068
We should all be
in the world beyond by now...

152
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,538
na~Design Office
Yes...

154
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,808
na~Design Office
it's true that I that Atsushi Kanno and
I were childhood friends...

157
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,979
But. unfortunately,
I haven't seen him for the past 30 years...

159
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,549
The last time I saw him was when

160
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,153
he rented this house that he inherited
from his parents, to me...

162
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,222
Which means that

163
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,293
this house is Dr. Miyano's?

164
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,127
Yes...

165
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,430
I wanted a design office,
so he said that

167
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,733
since he'd be leaving his house empty
for a while, he'll rent it to me...

170
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,672
I've been renting this house
ever since for 30 years.

172
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,373
Thisyis where...

173
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,442
my father was 'born andOfraised...

174
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,913
Then... where was Dr. Miyano living
I after lending this house to you?

176
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,948
Beats me...

177
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,817
He said that he was going to

178
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,853
a large research laboratory of
a sponsor that approved of his theory...

181
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,323
u ave no icea wiere 1a Is...

182
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:52,824
It's those guys...

183
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:53,391
1 Co Deee

184
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:54,593
most probably.

185
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:59,464
And? You got no word
from Dr. Miyano after that?

187
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,032
N-No

188
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,269
I just got a postcard saying that
he got married, that was it...

190
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,039
h...That person came once whe
Â» ou were out President Dejima.

192
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:08,773
Huh

193
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,207
Remember...

194
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:14,913
you used to go out for walks when
you couldn't come across designs

196
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,248
and stayed out for quite some time.

197
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,683
He happened to come by just at that time.

198
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,637
He: cameralong with
a.pretty-foreign wife and

200
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:25,457
a cute girlkabout'4 or 5-years-old...

201
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,393
He seemed to want to talk to you
about something important and

204
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,129
he ended up spending
the night here. then left...

206
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,367
I mentioned that you may be back, but...

207
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,768
Didn't I tell you about it?

208
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,436
No!! I haven't heard anything.

209
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,672
And...

210
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,874
his wife's name was Elena

211
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,610
His daughter's name I think was Akemi...

212
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:46,778
My older-sister...

214
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,752
There seemed to be
something odd about them...

216
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,586
Yeah...

217
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,623
His daughter's mischief
was really hard to handle...

219
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,394
She hid our tools all over the place...

220
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:06,231
She saw how troubled we were
nd seemed to enjoy it...

222
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,267
His wife remained quiet all the while so

223
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,469
we thought she couldn't
understand Japanese,

225
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,539
but she spoke in Japanese
with her daughter...

227
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,942
He kept looking out the window and
seemed to be worried about something.

229
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,844
Come to think of it.

231
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,814
a car was parked for some time
outside this house.

233
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,417
Oh!! it was a black
car with smoked glass...

235
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,117
Yeah...

236
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,452
They were being watched...

237
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,355
Hey. hey. just when was that?

238
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,157
It was just after

239
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:36,661
we reformed the old
house into an office so.

241
00:11:36,828 --> 00:11:39,364
I think it was about 20 years:ago...

242
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:44,034
Did Dr. Miyajosay anything
to you all before he left. ?

244
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,971
Nothing that I remember.)

245
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,409
By the way, what's your
relationship with Dr. Miyano?

247
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,976
Oh. well...

248
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,746
we're both doctors...

249
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,549
He's going to finally get married at his age!
And. he is going to ask him to come

251
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,884
to the wedding but...

252
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,121
he didn't have the doctor's address
so he came to ask you for it!

254
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,289
Right?!

255
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,191
Y-Yeah...

256
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,630
I'm going to go buy lunch pretty soon...

257
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,433
Okay. get me a hamburger then. will you!

258
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,838
You want the usual Teriyaki
and fish with M size French fries

260
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,573
and corn soup. right?

261
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,640
What else?

262
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,009
I'll take the same thing as the president.

263
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:29,080
I'll take the same with apple pie
and two learge size cokes!

265
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,315
Ghads...

266
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,518
you always drink too much, that's why you
have to go to the restroom so many times

268
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,987
orry, I'm so much like a kid

269
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,856
Oh. Imai

270
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,058
will you please get
coffee for the guests too!

272
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:40,592
Yes. sir...

273
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,997
So. ll don't know
Dr. Miyano's address either...

275
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:47,632
I don't want to be rude,
but since we have work to do.

277
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,867
After you drink your coffee. please...

278
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,801
Oh. yes, sure...

279
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,471
Akemi dropped by some time ago...

280
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,306
PT ~~ =

281
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,175
She did?

282
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,428
WwW Why

283
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,854
Remember the girl?

284
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:11,956
The cute one who came to use the toilet!

285
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,726
She greeted us saying "Long time no see.

286
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,928
So. we were surprised...

287
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:19,364
Was she Dr. Miyano's daughter?

289
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,734
Huh? Didn't I tell you?

290
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,601
I said, you didn't tell me!

291
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,805
Sorry!

292
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,041
And. that woman

293
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,010
really only came to use the restroom?

294
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,411
Y-Yeah...

295
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,779
But. she did say something strange...

296
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,216
She said she was embarrassed
that-she came to use the toilet

298
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,018
so.to not tell anybody about it...

299
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,824
I wonder... who she wanted
to keep it a secret from...?

301
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,736
Hey. wait...

302
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,141
There...

303
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:04,742
Huh

304
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,745
Y-You're both going in together??

305
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,650
No doubt about it...

306
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,353
Akemi definitely hid-something...

307
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,387
Yeah...

308
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,257
Somewhere in this toilet...

309
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:23,361
But... even if she hid something
in a small toilet like this

311
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,365
I'm sure-that. someone
would've foundOitalready...

313
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,519
Yeah-iltswvern likely...

314
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,471
But. still...

315
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,175
something may just come out.

316
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,178
Some clue... to who those guys are...

318
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:49,687
H-Hurry... Hurry up. will you!!

319
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,731
I guess we'll search later...

321
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,431
Yes.

324
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,201
Thanks for waiting!!

325
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,237
You guysiwannachave some too, sonny?

326
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,239
Oh. no thanks!

327
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,775
You know, after that woman came,

328
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,710
didn't anything strange happen?

329
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,878
Yeah...

330
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,413
a burglar broke in...

331
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,482
And. twice too!

332
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,616
A burglary

333
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,653
Nothing was stolen, though...

334
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,988
Is your stomach okay...?

335
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,357
Yeah, somehow...

336
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,827
The problem's the other stuff, though...

337
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:30,795
Huh?

338
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,299
After that woman came...

339
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,968
for some strange reason...

340
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,569
For some strange reason...?

341
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,237
Pr-President?!

342
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,324
President?!

343
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,599
Poisoned to death...

344
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:09,634
Yes...

345
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:13,237
'The victim is Mr. Shohei Dejima,
54 years old,

347
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,606
the President of this design office...

348
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,308
He seems to have been
eating his burger for lunch

350
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,745
together with the other
three employees there

353
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,681
when he suddenly started
suffering and collapsed]

355
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,617
And. who bought the hamburger?

356
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,720
Oh... 1 did...

357
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:34,092
Which means you had the most probable
chance of poisoning the hamburger?

359
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,193
W-Wait!!

360
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:35,927
W-Wait!!

361
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:36,527
W-Wait!!

362
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,764
The President picked up
the hamburger on his own.

364
00:16:40,015 --> 00:16:43,835
Besides, he picked up the Teriyaki burger
that everyone else also ordered!

366
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,137
I couldn't have poisoned the hamburger

367
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,272
because I would've had no idea who
would pick up the hamburger he did!!

369
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,041
Is this right....?

370
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,476
R-Right...

371
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,544
It could be that

372
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:58,316
the poison was on something that
President Dejima always used.

374
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,984
Where is his desk?

375
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,953
H-Here...

376
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,654
Whose seat his that next to his?

377
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,089
Oh , Mr.Imai's .

378
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:11,029
Then. he would've been able to use
the poison without being noticed too...

380
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,499
That may be my seat but...

381
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,870
Before eating the hamburger,
we president was picking on cookies.

384
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,643
that empty cookie bag next to
the coffee cup on his desk?

386
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,047
I brought that from the kitchen...

387
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,049
Since he asked me to
bring coffee for everyone,

389
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,251
I brought his coffee for him too.

390
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:34,685
'1. \\
I STC...

392
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,522
If poison was on something
that the president used.

394
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,992
You're saying that he would've
died when he ate the cookies?

396
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,828
What's with this medicine?

397
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,695
Medicine for constipation...

398
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:48,866
The president had a bad case of
hemorrhoids and used to drink it all the time

400
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,471
But, he would over drink it at times
and get a bad case of the runs...

402
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:54,172
Yes,

403
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,140
especially recently...

404
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,544
Yeah, he went to the restroom
just before eating the hamburger too.

406
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:01,879
He had a stomachache
and ran to the restroom.

408
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,181
Restroom?

409
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,218
Didn't anyone go into the restroom
before the president did?

411
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,954
I-I went I A

412
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,889
before I went to buy lunch...

413
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,293
I went in after him... and after me,

414
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,794
Mr. Zaitsu...

415
00:18:16,994 --> 00:18:19,730
Then, after that the president went in.

416
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,300
Came out and ate the hamburger?

417
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,668
Yes...

418
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:24,535
In other words.

419
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,772
If you had put poison
somewhere around the restroom...

421
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,774
You gotta be kidding!!

422
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,944
It's true that I went into the restroom
before the president did.

424
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,413
but it wasn't right before
the president went In

428
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,684
Because between me and the president,

429
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,953
these children went in...

430
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,156
C-Conan?!

431
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,460
And, Al and Dr. Agasa too?!

432
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,628
Oh. well

433
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,064
we just happened to come by because

434
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,233
we had some business
with Mr. Dejima but...

436
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,569
You people sure get mixed up in
all kinds of cases, don't you?

438
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,472
You re starting to look like Mr. Mourt...

439
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,577
And? Which one of'you went in first?

440
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:07,812
We went in together...

441
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,813
Huh

442
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,448
You used the toilet together?

443
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,183
Yeah... well

444
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,452
I dropped my loose change some place...

445
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,690
I though maybe it slipped through the
space of the door and rolled into the toilet,

447
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,592
so. we lookedtfor it together, right?

448
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,493
Yes...

449
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,797
We looked for the thing
thatiAkemi hid from

451
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,733
the eyes of the guys of the organization.

452
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,737
If so where:'was the poison...

454
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:33,504
Then, why not check all the way
from the work place to the restroom?

457
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,739
Then, why not check all the way
from the work place to the restroom?

459
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,525
Then, why not check all the way
from the work place to the restroom? _g

461
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:39,377
From the work place...

462
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,645
to the restroom...?

463
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,915
After eating the cookies,
the president went to the restroom,

465
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,217
went back to the work place,
and ate the hamburger.

467
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,685
Then, he collapsed. didn't he?

468
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,088
Which means that the poison
may still be around some place!

470
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,825
Because from the time the president
collapsed to the time you came here,

472
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,228
nobody left the work place

473
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:00,498
took anything out,
threw away or wiped anything...

475
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,416
I guess so... Let's start checking anyway...

476
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,218
1 CO...

477
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,470
Iet's do that together with
a body check of everyone

479
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,879
W-What?!

480
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,515
There's no poison reaction anywhere?

481
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,418
Nothing from the toilc
corridor, work place and

483
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,020
everywhere else that
the victim could've touched...

485
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,622
the strange thing

486
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,857
there was a reaction by the right side of
the victim's slacks and the:place

488
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,760
where the belt holes are,

489
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,331
as well as the victim's
Ieft fingertips and handkerchief...

491
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,733
and the wrapper of
the hamburger he was eating...

493
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,868
it was a very small amount,

494
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:42,772
and it seemed that the victim
touched them with his poisoned hand...

496
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,810
But why was there poisons

498
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,281
L.get.it!! The handle of the-coffee cup!!

499
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,099
If the poison is put there,

500
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,952
he would eat the cookie
with his right hand and

502
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,021
poison would go on his left hand
when he drinks the coffee!

504
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:00,091
If so. even if he went to the toilet after that.

505
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,260
If he opened and closed
the door with his right hand,

507
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,296
there would be no poison
reaction in the toilet!

509
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,164
In other words. the killer...

510
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,634
IS the one who brought the, coffee...

511
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:13,037
You!! Mr. Imam

512
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:13,271
You!! Mr. Imai!

513
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,308
Oh... No... Inspector!

514
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,046
We of course checked the handle
of the coffee cup andithe cookie bag,

516
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,181
but there was no poison reaction.

517
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:30,488
Besides--the lever to flush
the toiletiis on 'the left side...

519
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,291
If the poison:was on his righthand
before he went into the toilet."

521
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,761
when he pulled his slacks up and down,

522
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,596
the poison would most likely
be on the left side of his slacks...

524
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,699
$0. why was there poison on
the right side of his slacks...?

527
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,169
Uh, did the president have
some kind of habit?

529
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,204
Was he left handed...

530
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,473
the only character
I can think of was that I

532
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:52,743
he was very neat and loved coffee...

533
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,979
He was neat and loved coffee?

534
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,616
He used to first always wipe his hands with
wet tissue before he sat at his desk.

536
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,952
It took me 10 years before I succeeded in

537
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,788
making coffee the way the president liked.

539
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,825
Didn't you seÃ©'any suspicious
people watching this house?

542
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,728
We were burglarized twice...

543
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,296
But. nothing after that...

544
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:13,597
B-Burglarized ?!

545
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,301
Yes. the burglar broke in through the window

546
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,669
Uh. AI,

547
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,404
don't tell mesthat the burglary is...

548
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:21,439
Yes.

549
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,041
It sure is similar to the way
those guys get rid of their target...

551
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:26,310
without any evidence...

552
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:31,349
And vanish like the fog...

After my older sister Akemi:came here

599
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,475
the burglars who broke in
were probably them!...

601
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,509
Yeah...

602
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:09,113
They probably guessed that
she 'may have hidden something here

604
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,481
and came to look for it.

605
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,055
No! Don't!

606
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:20,224
You don't have to know!

you'll really...!
