1
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:19,886
Be strong I say to my heart

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,488
And step into the essence
with strong rhythm

4
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,490
The contents of the hat will
finally be disclosed.

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,626
The mistake that
Inspector Megure had made.

8
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:27,894
He sees through the one and only truth

9
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,129
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult,

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,097
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan

13
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,716
We accompanied Sonoko
to the department store

15
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,217
because she wanted to go shopping

16
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,121
However, Pops

17
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,023
gets mixed up in the decoy-investigation

18
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,324
that Inspector Megure and
the others have set up

20
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,261
The Inspector and the others
were in the midst of

22
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,963
Investigating a serial woman
attacker case.

24
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,699
Right at that time,

25
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,634
Ran finds the dead body of a woman

26
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,636
in the basement parking lot
of the department store!

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,748
Inspector Megure and the other officers
carry out their investigation but

30
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,784
It seems that Inspector Megure
Is not acting as his usual self...

32
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,287
Superintendent!

33
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,623
Please let me stay and
investigate a bit further!

35
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,025
I know I'm close to ettin somewhere!

36
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:43,362
Besides, I have this feeling that
the killer is still somewhere nearby...

38
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:45,631
Well, all right...

39
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,732
Well, all right

40
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,168
Inspector Megure...

41
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,406
I hope you're not still...

42
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,442
dragging the you-know-what case inside of you

43
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,915
That case that you sealed up
inside that hat of yours.

45
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:11,557
INSPECTOR MEGURE'S
SEALED SECRET" PART II

49
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,441
Mr. Mourn?

50
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,176
Please lend me the key to the car...

51
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:32,644
I guess it'll take a while longer

52
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,915
so I'm/going to go put the things
in the car and then go to the restroom...

54
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:40,119
You'd better hurry
because+it"s almost closing time.

56
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,821
Thank you.

57
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,522
Take this too, please.

58
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,764

63
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:58,037
Ghads, what's with this car anyway.
What a way to park!

65
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,773
I can't even open-the door!

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,713

00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,614

Inspector!
Its been confirmed!

74
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,455
And?!

75
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,993
That woman did get off the car after all
and went to theirestroom in the park.

77
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,862
Oh, I see!

78
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,865
I don't understand it...

79
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:30,035
why would the killer want to go after
hip, fashionable girls who are riding cars?

81
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,004
Or, is he after something else...

82
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,040
Some other thingithat the 4 victims
have in common...

109

The next closest restroom
is on the 8th floor,

111

Hey! Watch her foot!

00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,347
Oops, sorry!

120
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,020
Huh, this shoe.is;jtoo big for her...

00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,626

125
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,232
Right, that's it!

126
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,067
All tanned black and dressed
Iike that, yet...

128
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,969
I mean, you know what is
absolutely outrageous?

130
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,771
I"-If so.

131
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,506
Don't tell me that the killer is. ?!

132
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,685
H-Hey, don't turn the lights off on me!!

133
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,386
I'm still here, you know!!

134
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,758
Hey! Is anybody around!?

135
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,067
High soled boots?

136
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,403
Are you saying that the victim Ms. Aizawa

137
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,939
who was killed in this parking lot
was actually wearing high soled boots?

139
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:18,277
Yep! Girls who are that dark
and wearing such flashy clothes

141
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,146
would never wear
such regular low heeled slip ons.

143
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,249
Right, Ran?

144
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,956
Why did the killer go out of his way
to change her shoes?

146
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,259
He didn't want anyone to notice.

147
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,894
That he was going around attacking only

148
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,831
drivers who are wearing
high soled shoes!

150
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,566
What?!

151
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:45,337
The other three victims
were also tanned black

153
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:49,074
and wearing flashy clothes
when they were attacked.

155
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,143
Which means that it is very likely

156
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,780
that they were also wearing
high soled boots!

158
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:55,414
Yes, Sir.

159
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,183
Igh soled boots...

160
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,453
When Ms. Aizawa got into
that traffic accident a year ago,

162
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,055
one of the causes of the accident was

163
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,424
that the woman who
stepped on the brakes

165
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,160
was wearin hi h soled boots.
Yumi told me that

167
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,829
the victim couldn't step on the
brakes fast enough because of the shoes.

169
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,198
Is that true?!

171
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:13,932
1 CO.

172
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,069
The late boys' divorced parents

173
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,904
strongly insisted that it was the reason

174
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,507
but, it wasn't acknowledged after all...

175
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,475
His parents were divorced?

176
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:25,077
Yes, the reason was

177
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,946
because his father used to get violent
under the influence of alcohol...

179
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,017
If I remember: correctly
he fathers name was...

181
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,153
Sadakane maybe?

182
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,423
Right, right, it was that sort of name!

183
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,158
W-Wait a minute please!

184
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,094
The name of the security guard
that we talked to a while ago

186
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,529
was also Sadakane...

187
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,831
Hey!
Don't tell me the killer is...?

189
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,766
You mean, that securi\ guard!?

190
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,573
Taka I 0 and check on
That case from last year!

193
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,307
Yes, sir!

194
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,077
You guys go and look for the
security guard Sadakane!

196
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,311
Yes, sir!

197
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,448
How'd you ever figure it out?

198
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,383
It was really easy.

199
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:10,389
Because the killer is after people
W O are wearing 1g soe 00S,Trig

201
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,525
You can't tell if the person is wearing
that kind of shoes from outside,

203
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,829
and the ones attacked were
all customers of this department store...

205
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,398
So, it had to be somebody
who could watch the customers

207
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,167
get in and out of their cars
in this parking lot... The only person that

209
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,237
I could think of as suspicious
was the security guard!

211
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,805
But,

212
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:32,144
the victims all testified
that the attacker was about 150 cm tall!

214
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:35,981
That security guard said
he was 167 centimeters!

216
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,549
Ha, ha, ha...

217
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,385
Come on...!

218
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,721
All the women who were attacked
only said that

220
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:47,192
the attacker was about their height.
So, if the women were wearing boots

222
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,196
that were more than 10 centimeters high,
I know that you already realize that

224
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,933
10 centimeters more have-to
be added on to the killer's height!

226
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,540
I see, we measured their height
when they came to headquarters.

228
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,343
Since they were summoned
for interrogation,

230
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,645
they probably avoided wearing
high soled boots and flashy clothes.

233
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,416
if the killer wanted to avenge
his son's death why didn't

235
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:14,753
he go directly to her house
rather than ambush her in a place like this?

237
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,522
Did you forget, Mr. Mourn?

238
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,358
The victim is 20 years old, isn't she...

239
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,362
At the time of the accident
he was still under age, wasn't she...

241
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,999
The address of a juvenile
is not publicized...

243
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:32,171
That's probably why he waited for her
here, where his son was run over

245
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,312
I guess he got agitated
because she didn't show up.

247
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,082
So, he decided to attack women drivers
wearing high soled boots

249
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,218
just to vent out the anger
he had within him...

251
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,259
Inspector! I've got what we need!

252
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,663
That security guard is the father
of the boy who died in the traffic accident

254
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,097
a year ago, after all!

255
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,600
And, where is he now?

256
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:07,072
W-Well, his car is in this parking lot,
but he's nowhere in sight...

258
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,611
What's up, Ran?

259
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,847
Sonoko's not back yet...

260
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,483
She said that she was going to
take her things to the car,

262
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,084
then go to the restroom, but...

263
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,919
Her things to the car...?!

264
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,022
If I'm not mistaken,
Sonoko was wearing high soled boots...

266
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,731
Hello . ? Oh, Ran?

267
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,132
Huh? Now?

268
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,534
I'm still in the department store

269
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,738
Listen to this...
I mean, I tell you...

271
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,541
I know I was taking my time
in the restroom

273
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,643
but the nerve of them to
urn the lights off on me...

275
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,996
What is it?
Is something the matter? Sonoko?

277
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,898
Oh, no, It's nothing...

278
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,867
I just thought I sensed something funny...

279
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,062
S-She saw me...

280
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,096
She saw me...

281
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,798
She saw my face?!

282
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,936
H-Hey, Sonoko?! Sonoko?!

283
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,237
He's made a mistake!

284
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,473
He's mistaken Sonoko for a driver
wearing high soled boots

286
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:53,077
because she had the keys to the car
and was putting her things in the car!

288
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,346
What?!

289
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,249
Where did she say she Is now?

290
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,717
She said she is in the department store...

291
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,652
Was the phone cut off?

292
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,955
No, it's still connected but

293
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,991
I hear a computer-like voice
in the distance...

295
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,392
Computer-like voice?

296
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,996
Please choose the frame of your choice.

297
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,765
Push the button after you take a pose!

298
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,335
It's, It's a picture taking machine!

299
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,971
Is there a picture taking machine
in this department store?

301
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,372
Huh? Yes, there is!

302
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,707
I'm sure there were two machines

303
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,043
by the stairs of the restaurant arcade
on the 10th floor

305
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,144
I see!

306
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,815
Even though the lower floors are closed,
the restaurants close late

308
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,784
So, Sonoko must've tried to get down
using the elevator there...

310
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,987
Okay!

311
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,555
Officer Takagi,
you go get the lights turned on!

313
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,725
Officers Megure and Sato,
go around to the top with the elevator,

315
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,527
and the others go from below to the top,
take custody of the girl and

317
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,363
nab the suspect as well!

318
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,130
Yes sir!

319
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,834
Hey! Out of the way! Move!

320
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,704
Inspector, you're really into this case,

321
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:53,404
aren't you?

322
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,574
They're very similar...

323
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,043
This case is

324
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,445
very similar to
the first case that he handled...

326
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,752
Where is your daughter and
the boy wearing glasses?

328
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,324
There it is!

329
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:49,361
This is hers!

330
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,029
It's unmistakably Sonoko's cell phone!

331
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,734
The customers at the restaurant arcade
don't seem to have seen Sonoko,

333
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,470
so she must've run into
the department store.

335
00:13:58,738 --> 00:13:59,638
Hey, Takagi!

336
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,239
Can't you get the lights on yet?

337
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,879
You guys are devils!

338
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,281
Moreover...

339
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,587
You're devils pretending to be cute girls,
hile committing crimes...

341
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,557
Devils don't deserve to live!

342
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:24,730
A black out?!

343
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,798
Damn! Why, at a time like this?!

344
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,636
S-Sonoko...

345
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:33,939
Sonoko, where are you?

346
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,141
Sonoko!!

347
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,476
Shh! Quiet!

348
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,381
It's the sound of a lot of little things
falling to the ground!

350
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,317
And... grains...

351
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,385
no, something bigger...

352
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,622
I think it's the sound of the pebbles
that are used on the floor of aquariums...

354
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,724
The pet shop is on the 4th floor...

355
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,459
She's on the 4th floor, then!

356
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:55,894
Let's hurry!

357
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,438

IEA LEKRERYAADRARD 207

360
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,749
I'm sorry...

361
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,154
All I wanted to do was teach you a lesson.

362
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:24,456
But,

363
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,225
you saw me, didn't you...

364
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,262
You saw my face...

365
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,667
Sonoko?

366
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,169
Sonoko?!

367
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,370
Range...

368
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,505
nobody's in the pet shop!

369
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,540
Sonoko?!

370
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,108
Strange,

371
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,911
nothing is broken
nor is anything on the floor!

373
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,680
D-Don't tell me that the sound
we just heard was...

375
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:52,284
You saw... my face, didn't you!

376
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,201
I-Inspector...

377
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,677
Do you feel good, huh?

378
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,784
I'm asking you if you feel good
about hurting people...

380
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,720
You may be thinking that

381
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:33,825
you are flinging that metal bat of justice
upon young drivers with bad manners

383
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,293
but, unfortunately,

384
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,663
she is just a high school girl
who was putting her things in the car

386
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:46,471
What you're doing is not for justice
or for the sake of your late son.

388
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,439
It's no more than an act of

389
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,874
unjustified resentment
based on misunderstanding!

391
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,210
You took the lives of people
who had nothing to do with the case

393
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,745
just for your own satisfaction

394
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,681
in order to amuse yourself
and distract yourself from your grief!

396
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,818
Don't you see what you're doing!

397
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,232
A-A-All I wanted was
for that woman to apologize...

399
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,269
For her to wear normal shoes

400
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:23,074
and apologize to my son up in heaven...

401
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,312
That's really how I felt in the beginning...

402
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:29,514
It's true...

403
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,761
Sonoko!!

404
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,396
Agh, Ran!

405
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,698
Ran!!

406
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,467
Are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

409
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,003
I wasaso scared!

410
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,570
Inspector!

411
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,307
Amazing how you figured out
where she was...

413
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,875
Oh well .

414
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,145
This.léd merhere...

415
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,814
This go stone...

416
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,451
I-Inspector!
Are you all right?

418
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,920
No need to worry.

419
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,289
It's just that the old wound
opened up again...

421
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,858
The old wound that

422
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,428
I was supposed to
have left way back in the past...

What

469
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:51,723
an old wound that
he got from a case in the past?

471
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:52,257
Yeah...

472
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:55,226
Megure wears the hat in order to hide

473
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,796
the old wound that he got in the past.

474
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,030
But...

475
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,867
isn't a wound equivalent to
a medal of honor for an officer?

477
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,136
Why should he hide it...

478
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,639
It's been more than 20 years already

479
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:08,673
Yes,

480
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,008
it was back then, when...

481
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,844
Megure had just become
a police detective...

483
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,114
I take it you all know about

484
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,584
the case of high school girls being
run over, the hit-and-run case...

486
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,185
Oh, yes!

487
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,756
The motive of the criminal was...
the grudge that he held towards

489
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,725
the delinquent high school girls
who blackmailed him for money...

491
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:29,027
What the criminal did was

492
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:32,664
catch the girls alone and
run them over with his car.

494
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:33,932
Totally outrageous...

495
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,301
Back then...

496
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:38,837
the fad among
delinquent high school girls

498
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,240
was to waer long skirts
below their knees.

500
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,975
He went and ran over
every such girl he saw...

502
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,144
At first...

503
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,781
he just bumped into them and fled,
but his actions eventually escalated

505
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:53,184
and a victim ended up being killed

506
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,156
Therefore,we warned
the high school girls in the vicini

508
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,791
not to wear skirts like those
when going out.

510
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,294
No more cases were reported
after that, however...

512
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,163
One day,

513
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:09,534
a high school girl came up saying that
she would like to act as decoy

515
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,537
so that she could avenge
the death of her friend...

517
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,839
Of course we turned her offer down, but...

518
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,976
we had no way of stopping the girl

519
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,711
who had her doubts
about the police too.

521
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:20,979
Therefore, having no choice

522
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,349
we had Megure watch over her...

523
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,535
The criminal tried to run her
over as well as Megure...

525
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,937
Fortunately,
Inspector Megure remembered

527
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,405
the license plate number of the car.

528
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:51,342
Although the criminal was caught,
Megure paid a large price in return.

530
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,680
Although Megure got away
with¥a wound on his head

532
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,184
the girl slammed her body and head
hard against the pavement

534
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,486
and by the time we got to the scene,

535
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,820
she was covered with blood
and totally ravaged...

537
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:10,028
Then, the reason why
the Inspector doesn't take off his hat

539
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:10,428
IS because...

540
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:12,597
Yeah, that's right,

541
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,599
because most surely anybody
would ask him

543
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,302
how he got the large wound
on his head if they saw it...

545
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,437
And, each time...

546
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,772
He'd have to recall
the incident from back then'.

548
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:27,278
That's why Megure sealed off
the wound with his hat...

550
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,216
That old wound packed with
bad memories...

552
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,953
That's why the Inspector was...

553
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,921
so much against the decoy idea...

554
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,692
He didn't want the same thing
to happen again .

556
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,563
Oh, but although
the girl was badly hurt...

558
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,131
she didn't die.
She's still alive!

560
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,768
After all, she's Megure s...

561
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,837
Oh, Superintendent Matsumoto!

562
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:56,474
You've come to visit too, huh...

563
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:01,312
Officer Takagi and Shiratori just left...
Midori Megure
Inspector Megure's wife

567
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,482
Oh, so they've also come!

568
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:08,219
Yes, they've all come
between working hours.

570
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,189
She has a wound on her forehead?

571
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:12,890
D-Don't tell me that...

572
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,761
Hey, Midori,
will you peel an apple for me?

574
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,232
I will tell you,
he is so spoiled regardless of his age!

576
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,867
I guess I'll go blast him one

577
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,637
so that he shapes up and
gets back to work as soon as possible.

579
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,206
Oh yes By allO'means.\

581
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,843
Come to think of it

582
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,945
I've heard that Inspector Megure's wife

583
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,281
used to be a delinquent before...

584
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,184
Maybe the reason the Inspector
never takes off his hat is because...

586
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:45,256
He doesn't want to be teased about
his first encounter with his wife...

588
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,729
Hey, what's taking you so long...
