1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:02,368
Just as flowing water has no form,

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,870
and the breeze is invisible,

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,905
deductions take all shapes and styles
In each and every case to be solved.

5
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,711
He sees through to the one and only truth.

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,211
A child in appearance with the I.Q. of an adult,

7
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,448
no case is left unsolved
when Detective Conan comes to the scene.

11
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:55,848
MURDER ON THE S.5. SYMPHONY,
20 YEAR VENDETTA

15
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,482
2 MA TAS

17
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:05,992
I know I heard it!!

18
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,229
It sounded like something fell into the
ocean, it's very suspicious!

20
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,766
Like I told you, it was
probably the sound of fish jumping!

22
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:18,137
I hear there are a lot of
bonito and flying fish in this area.

24
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,843
Listen! Did you see the young guy
who speaks with a kansai accent?

26
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,311
Kansai accent?

27
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,680
Oh. he came here to borrow a
flashlight?

29
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,416
Flashlight!

30
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,952
That means...chances are,

31
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:36,455
he went out on the deck to look
for something!!

33
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,726
Then...that sound...it couldn't be...

34
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:42,862
It can't be!!

35
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,731
No! Wait!

36
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,867
It's impossible! He'd never let that
happen...

38
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,402
Not in a million years!

39
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,539
Hattor!!

40
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,374
Hey!

41
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,576
Hattor!!

42
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,512
Where are you!!

43
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,680
Answer me!

44
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:02,415
Hey!

45
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:05,551
Hattori...

46
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,960
31... can't be true...

47
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,295
Hattori....!

48
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:16,862
Hey!

49
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,934
Hattori!!!

50
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,376
Hattori!

51
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:31,710
Hey kid!!

52
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,113
You've got to be careful!

53
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,482
You couldn've fallen over...

54
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,516
Oh...thanks...

55
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,584
He's right, kid!

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,789
The ocean is extremely vast,
a person were to fall in...

58
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,326
a mere human bein would be hel less.

60
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,263
death is a certainty...

61
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,133
Conan!

62
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,269
What in the world are you doing?

63
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,506
You see, Heiji's...

64
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,475
Well, that kid again...

65
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:06,178
he's probably off somewhere
Iooking for clues!

67
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:07,346
Dad's right!

68
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,950
Don't worry, he pops up soon...

69
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,821
Yo...Yoshimi...

70
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,225
Oh..uh..er...

71
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,196
Your voice, it sounded just like
someone I knew... haha...

73
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,869
Never mind that, what's going on here?
What are you 3 doing here?

75
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,340
She asked us to help her look for something...

76
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,975
You were looking for something?

77
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,143
My pendant.

78
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,579
I noticed it was gone just when I was
going to bed,

80
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,915
I was looking all over for it when
I ran into these fellows...

82
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,818
They didn't look like they had anything
to do so I asked them to help me...

84
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,522
there's a better chance of finding it
with 3 rather than 1 person searching

86
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,590
Oh!...Could it be

87
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,093
Are you talking about this locket with the

89
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:59,932
The clasp was unhooked, I found it on the bow

90
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,369
Yes, this is it, thank you.

91
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,838
I must have dropped it this evening
when I was up there...

93
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,743
Then, the little girl in the picture is you, Nagisa?

94
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,179
Is that your father carrying you?

95
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:15,381
£ ot » CC
TV, yes...

97
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,684
For goodness sakes, why didn't you
return it to her earlier?

99
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,586
I meant to...

100
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,757
There was a hole in her father's face & I
didn't know who it belonged to!

102
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,929
After all, it could have been someone else
carrying their daughter.

104
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,999
I intended to ask who it belonged to
during dinner but I forgot!

106
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,470
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
there was a hole in it.

108
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,575
It's alright...it's an old photo taken
over 20 years ago.

110
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:47,479
This is the only thing I have left...
to remind me of my late father.

112
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,818
Are you all out of your minds? , .

113
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,754
A killer is on board and you're all: wandering
around!

115
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,959
Mouri!! Why did you let them out of the
restaurant

117
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,030
Well...they said they wanted to go
back to their cabins and rest.

119
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,500
That's right! You have no right to give
us orders!

123
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,037
didn't want to stayghere anymore!

124
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,273
Especially not with a hysterical old man!
Nagisa Isogai
Passenger
1.&9 Owl

128
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,108
Wh, what did you say!

129
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:20,278
If you say being alone is dangerous.
Then I'll lock myself in my room

131
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,481
with these kids
and spend the night playing cards

133
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,084
At least it'll be better than being here],

134
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,418
Isn't that right!

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,953
Excuse me...

136
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:32,024
I don't think it's a good idea to split up...

137
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:36,028
I think it's safer
if we all stay together in one place.

139
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,763
By the way,

140
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,699
Have you found Mr. Kameda,
the man you were looking for?

142
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,737
0...he seems.to have disappeared
Along with Mr. Kano!

144
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,507
Oh, have you seen Heiji Hattor1?

145
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,443
Good grief, are you telling me Heizo's
son is also missing?

147
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,981
What is going on on this ship?!

148
00:06:56,716 --> 00:07:00,619
Alright then! I don't anyone of you to go
anywhere alone!

150
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:07,059
The killer could be someone outside this
group...or it:could be one of us

152
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,362
The killer could be lying in wait for us to
be alone!

154
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,199
He may be right...when we heard the
first gunshot,

156
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,735
Mr. Samezaki was with us in the lounge

157
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,838
And Mr. Kujirai had just returned
from the restroom.

159
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,042
And right after
we all ran to-the upper deck

161
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,243
there was an explosion at the stern

162
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,912
the box with the body inside was
set on fire.

164
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,849
We all ran up to the deck together,

165
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,987
and even Mr. Ebina and Ms. Isogai who
joined us later

167
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,955
wouldn't have been able
to start the fire.

169
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,961
Which means that-since we can't at
present identify the fire victim,

171
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,766
the only one capable of setting the fire
were the men not on the deck with us,

173
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,536
Mr. Kameda, and Mr. Kanie...

174
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:55,641
And the old man calling himself
Saizo Kano

176
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,179
But... something's bothering me...

177
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,681
it's the strange behavior of the people
in this group

179
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:09,488
And to add to everything else,
Mr. Samezaki's almost fanatical reaction.

181
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,957
Something had happened?!.

182
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,729
What happened during that robbery
20 years ago...

184
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,836
I'm going to the restroom, please wait for me!

185
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,439
Darn it all! If only Hattori were here

186
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,509
He'd easily be able to
ask Kogoro and Samezaki about the case

188
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,512
Where in the world"d he go off to.

189
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:38,250
Dr. Agasa's house

190
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,284
Hello...? Hi there, how're things going?
Pr Gasa's.house

193
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,988
The 400 million yen robbery 20 years ago?

194
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:43,455
14'-

195
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,725
« We were, just watching a special
on that case!

197
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,495
The statute.of limitations is running out

198
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,597
so they've been doing a lot of specials
on it since last night!

200
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,401
I thought you'd probably want to see it
SO we're recording it.

202
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,036
Did they mention something about the
theives?

204
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,573
Wait a second...I'm sure there was
something!

206
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,812
They identified the ringleader Saizo Kano

207
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:12,151
but as for the remaining 3, all they had
were montages and no names!

209
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,354
Did they mention whether Kano
died or not?

211
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,290
Yes...his blood stained coat
with a bullet hole

213
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,993
was washed: up on shore
so the police deduced

215
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,329
he was Killed by his
3 accomplices after a falling out!

217
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,600
But how did they know it was Kano"s coat?

218
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,570
In the inside pocket of the coat

219
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,706
they found'a photo. it was the one
he always.carried on his person

221
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,042
It was a picture of him carrying
his daughter

223
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,577
What?!

224
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,548
It.certainly was a tragic case

225
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,683
the alarm went off that scared
one of the robbers,

227
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,385
then he panicked and fired wildly

228
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:52,124
One of the bullets hit a teller named
Samezaki'and it killed her

230
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,293
En? You mean someone was shot!

231
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:58,330
A female teller,
her name was Yoshimi Samezaki

233
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,567
The poor thing, she was still so young

234
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,069
Yoshimi Samezaki?!

235
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,137
It can't be...

236
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,372
but it's just too much of a coincidence.

237
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:13,545
Why are there so many people connected
to that case here on this ship?

239
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:18,350
Who is this Masaru Furukawa
who sponsored the tour?

241
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,254
Who in the world is he anyway?!

242
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:30,829
Wh, what was that!

243
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,164
I have to go now!

244
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,766
Call me if you think of something!

245
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,501
Hey, wait!

246
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,137
Where'd that come from?

247
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,105
The stern I think!

249
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:44,743
Alright then! I'll go from the left,
you go around from the right!

252
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,680
Hey! Conan!

253
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,700
NO. one's. here...

254
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,603
That's impossible!
Look around!

256
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,404
Alright!

257
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,574
Hattori... where are you?

258
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,577
Why don't you show yourself?!

259
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,981
If you'd heard that sound,
you'd be the first one here.

261
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,385
What's happened to you Hattori?!

262
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,755
Superintendent!

263
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,125
Do you suppose he went this
way back inside...

265
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:34,960
It's Kano...

266
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,398
Kano is the killer, I just know it!

267
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,368
He's trying to confuse us
by firing shots all over the ship!

269
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,238
But what's he trying to do?

270
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,005
It's me...

271
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,178
He's... he's trying to kill... me

272
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,917
I..don't want to die.

273
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,955
L...don't want to die...not yet...

274
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:06,592
Please, protect me, please!

275
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:10,329
I'll tell you everything...

276
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,635
Yes...that's right.

277
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:23,575
I was one of Kano's accomplices
in the that robbery 20 years ago

279
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,878
I'came aboard this ship because

280
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,183
the three of us wanted to celebrate
the end of 20 years of hiding out.

282
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,786
One of the others sent me a letter.

283
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,788
He said there was no chance
of being caught

285
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,691
once the ship sailed because the
statute of limitations would run out.

287
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,862
There was an old 10,000 bill in the letter,

288
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,865
but it'd been so long since we'd seen
each other.

290
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,838
We'd all changed our faces and our names
so we didn't know who was who,

292
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:55,774
until Kanie called out to me.

293
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,412
And he told me our other
accomplice was Kameda.

295
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,018
And?
So who's the one trying to kill you?

297
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,822
Th...that's the thing
I don't know who it 1s

299
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,191
You're lying. It's Saizo Kano, isn't-it?

300
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,795
The man you and the others
double-crossed!

302
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:22,300
That's impossible! One of:.the:others
shot him to death'20{years ago.

304
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:27,706
Then it's probably one of the others.
He wants all the money for himself!

306
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:31,308
You haven't used that money yet, have you?

307
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:34,246
That's what I thought at first

308
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,581
but something's strange

309
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,717
it just doesn't make any sense!

310
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,420
What was that?!

311
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,788
Arggghhhhh!!

312
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,588
Everyone! Get down!

313
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,125
Are you alright?!
Kujirai!!

315
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,327
Where! Where were you shot?! Wy

316
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:51,963
Don't move!

317
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,635
You've been shot!

318
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,406
Where'd the shot come from?!

319
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,512
Hey kid! Get down!!

320
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,214
Somebody's out there.

321
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,650
There! On the bow!!

322
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,986
It's the killer!
I'm not letting him get away this time!!

324
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,021
SS... Superintendent!

325
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:25,063
Hey! You've no where to run!

326
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,066
Throw your gun down
and surrender yourself!

328
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,703
Hey Kano! Are you listening to me?

329
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,406
You are Saizo Kano, aren't you?!

330
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,644
Come on! Say something!

331
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:41,613
Ahh!

332
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:43,882
Kane?!

333
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,686
That's impossible!

334
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,596
1 shot to the head

335
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,297
He died instantly.

336
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,565
Looks that way.

337
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,434
The body's still warm.

338
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,803
His blood hasn't coagulated vet

339
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,607
There're powder burns on his temple
indicating he placed the gun there

341
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,475
and pulled the trigger

342
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:16,548
When the gunshot was heard, everyone
except Kane was in the restaurant

344
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,921
There's no other explanation, Kanie shot
himself in the head.

346
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,756
Which means

347
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,627
Kanie, who was hiding out on the bow of
this ship, was so upset to hear

349
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:32,264
his old partner blab about the robbery
20 years ago,

351
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:38,036
that he tried to shoot him...
but failed to kill him!

353
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:42,841
He gives up and commits suicide.

354
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,511
What a fool.

356
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,882
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

357
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,684
The burnt body atithe bow

358
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:56,087
was wearing Mr. Kanie's clothes
and his wristwatch, wasn't he?

360
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,224
Then whose body is that anyway?

361
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,160
Well, it's either Kameda,

362
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,597
who is. another of the accomplices
who disappeared earlier

364
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,999
or Saizo Kano

365
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,838
Either way, Kanie here was the killer.

366
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,674
He disguised the body to look like him

367
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,743
and set it on fire to make it
appear he was dead.

369
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,145
The question is,

370
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:25,550
how did Kanie manage to evade our search
and hide out here...

372
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,485
Hey, what's this...?

373
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,590
There's something weird tied behind
this guy

375
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,658
Huh?
Hey! This is...

377
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,493
Rope ladder!

378
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:41,499
No one would find this hiding place
If you were playing hide and seek!

380
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,639
I get it...Kanie hid here,
hanging on to the ladder

382
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,478
There's some rope marks on his arms
and legs. So I'm sure you're right.

384
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,313
But I don't understand.

385
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,817
Why go to all the trouble of making
it look like you died

387
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,685
and then hide out here.

388
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,655
The only explanation I can think of is

389
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,724
he wanted to surprise his next victim

390
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:08,260
by appearing suddenly before him.

391
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:11,496
Filling the guy with fear... that's my guess

392
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,233
But who was Kanie trying to kill that
he had to go through so much trouble?!

394
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:19,637
Kujirai, who just got shot was
one of his old buddies, wasn't he?!

396
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,807
Oh... haha, you're right.

397
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,916
Good grief, look+at all the blood.

398
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,387
It looks like an artery's been damaged.

399
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,454
He needs medical attention right away.

400
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,626
Ran's gone to get the first aid kit.

401
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,563
You are arvery lucky person.

402
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,335
You got off with only a hole
through your coat and arm.

404
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,537
Hey Mouri, I found it!

405
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,006
I found where the bullet passed through.

406
00:17:55,308 --> 00:18:00,645
I'm pretty sure Kanie fired the gun from the
bow and it passed through the window here

408
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,949
Now...all we have to do is find is

409
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,251
the bullet which should be
embedded somewhere

412
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,788
Do you mean this?

413
00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:14,358
Yes, no doubt about it, this is it!

414
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,595
Boy, what a sharp shooter.

415
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,931
He missed his target but

416
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,901
He fired the shot fromiway over there
with a pistol.

418
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,469
Have you forgotten?

419
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,041
One of the men Kano hired to help pull off
the job was very handy with firearms.

421
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,608
That's right,

422
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,545
we were able to learn

423
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:37,682
he probably served in some foreign army,
but that was about it.

425
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,820
Yes, so"that must-have been Kanie!

426
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,456
Dad!

427
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,858
Good! You got the first aid kit!

428
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,598
We've got to stop the bleeding!

429
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,868
Hey? . . Where's Conan?

430
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,704
Hun =
Isn't he somewhere around there?

432
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,275
A boy with a kansai accent?

433
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,578
He came to borrow a flashlight
but never returned

435
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,380
he hasn't come to the bridge either.

436
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,983
Somethin's wron
Where could he have gone?

439
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:16,054
Listen, could you search everyone's cabin
just to make sure?

441
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,556
Sure but I doubt we'll find him.

442
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:23,395
That's right, when we were looking for that
Kameda fellow with Mr. Samezaki

444
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,097
we went through all the cabins too.

445
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,933
Oh. well did you happen to notice
If he might been searching

447
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,101
for something somewhere?

448
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,237
You see... he's a private detective too.

449
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:32,871
Hmmm...

450
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,171
Hmmm...

451
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,406
I didn't notice anything.

452
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,643
Besides, all the cabins 'were locked.
Except for Mr. Kameda's.

454
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:42,079
Come to think of it, there is
1 cabin we didn't search!

456
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,914
Oh that's right.

457
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,316
It was so neat we didn't bother

459
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,054
You know, that guy with the glasses,
Mr: Ebina, it:was his room?

461
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,456
There was only a trunk
in the middle of the room,

463
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,758
the bed looked like it hadn't even used.

464
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,861
It looked like he hadn't even
even unlocked his trunk, remember?

466
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,395
Yeah.

467
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,866
Hey!
Can you show me where that cabin is?

469
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,602
Mr. Mouri asked me to look inside!

470
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:10,608
Conan?

471
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,611
Conan!

472
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:23,088
Hey kid...are you sure
Mr. Mourn wanted it hike this?

474
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,592
Yes! And he also said he didn't want
anyone else to know about it.

476
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,362
Quick, let's get back inside!
That body's giving me the creeps.

478
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,565
Yeah...you're right.

479
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,166
Go back to the inside soon!

480
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,202
Okee dokee!

481
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,738
Boy this tour sure turned into a nightmare

482
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,174
I heard the killer committed suicide though

483
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,410
And that guy Furukawa who planned
this tour,

485
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,812
I'll bet he's waiting at Ogasawara
for the ship to dock,

487
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,714
thinking everyone's having a fun.

488
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,983
Masaru Furukawa...

489
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,954
The man who planned this tour,

490
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,490
all the mysteries start here.

491
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:04,929
If the killer is Kanie...and this Masaru
Furukawa is also Kane

493
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,799
Then all the pieces to this case will fit,

494
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,735
but I'm still not convinced.

495
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,805
There's the watch the body had on

496
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:19,944
and that Furukawa seal Mr. Kameda had
IS another puzzle.

498
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:25,783
Darn it, I wish I at least knew who this
Masaru Furukawa is.

502
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,427
Uh, excuse me!

503
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,297
Did you see a little boy weaing glasses?

504
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,766
LI..don't believe it...

505
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,736
Masaru Furukawa is

506
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,110
A burn mark...?

507
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:56,614
And the paint's coming off
on the other side.

509
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,117
Maybe?!

510
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:03,922
Conan!

511
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,970
Here's another.

512
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:29,012
And other here.

513
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:35,053
I've got it...that's how you can control the
time and everyone's movements.

515
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,722
And that's where Hattori's role
as private detective fits in.

517
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,425
T... why Hatto

518
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,428
He's famous in Osaka but that's all.

519
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:47,699
Why hire a private detective all the way
from Osaka?

521
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,141
Conan! You're always wandering around
and making us worry!

523
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:01,279
)h...l...was just about to go bac
Th...that's why I...

525
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,615
I'm begging you

526
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,785
Don't leave me alone...

527
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:12,757
What?

528
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,539
Conan, you know what:a scaredy cat I am.

529
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:34,145
If you get lost, I'll have to search this
spooky ship all by myelf!

531
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,785
By the way,
where'd you get this tennis ball?

533
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:45,790
Back at the restaurant just now, I found it
under the table while I was looking for you.

535
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:50,194
I asked who it belonged to but no one
came forward.

537
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:53,464
Did Mr. Samezaki say something
when he saw it?

539
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,503
No, because he and dad
went off somewhere before seeing it.

541
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:01,406
They were talking very loudly.

542
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,741
It was something about
an O< >U 6 WOLIM

544
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,943
they found on Mr. Kanie's body.

545
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:11,281
Listen...
where was everyone when Uncle Kogoro

547
00:24:11,282 --> 00:24:15,353
and the others left the restaurant
the first time to look for Mr. Kano?

549
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,954
They all left too, separately.

550
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:22,627
But when they came back with Heiji,
the others were already back.

553
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,463
I HTT

554
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,199
I've figured everything out.

555
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,736
I've solved the mystery behind this
strange case!
