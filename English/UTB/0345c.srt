So, he wasn't dead

00:02:38,141 --> 00:02:39,858
It.It can't be...

31
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,314
N.No way
I got rid of that kid some time ago

33

See...You have nothing
to complain of now, do you!

00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:51,620

Cough, cough

44
00:03:58,922 --> 00:03:59,771
Huh?

45
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,809
Will you grant me...just one favor?

46
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:04,927
Cough-Icough

00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,958
Wha, ha, ha, ha

49
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:23,128
Detective kid, long time no see!

50
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,528
I don't want to bum you out,

51
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,231
after you've made
your grand appearance but,

53
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,967
11S Case as areacy een so ve

54
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,168
The one who shot Captain Fukuura

55
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,970
from the top of the mast
that you're standing by right now

57
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:36,475
when he was just about
to give out the hint to the quiz,

59
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,345
that is, the one who sneaked out
of the cabin, the party hall

61
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,015
and came out to this dark deck

62
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:46,118
as well as the one who was able
to place the card of the devil

64
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,503
on the arrow of the:bow gun
that was fired

66
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,956
can be none other than

67
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,792
the one who has no alibi at that time

68
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,994
on top of not having the card
of the d Vii on him.

70
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,797
Mummy. who's right here with me!

71
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,299
U.Uuuuugh!

72
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,201
Where in my deduction am I off track?

74
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,905
Hey! Come on say something!

75
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,874
Oh, excuse me

76
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,310
I've a bit of a cold, and my throat's

77
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:12,477
cough, cough...

78
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,846
Huh~A A cold?!

81
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,084
you mentioned
his alibi and his card, is that right?

83
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,535
The killer probably

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,057
plC -pOC €é€e ummys car
in order to frame him-as the killer

86
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,192
The killer pick-pocketed?!

87
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,026
Heck!

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,129
If you insist that
Mummy's net the killer

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,865
the only probable deduction is
either he dropped it,

92
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,534
or somebody stole it from him!

93
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,302
After all

94
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,739
the card is specially made so that
there's only ene card to a person!

97
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,576
whether the killer knew
was aware of this or not

99
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,578
he stole it from Mummy,

100
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,080
inside the restroom!!

101
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,765
In the restroom?

102
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,516
Hey. is that right, Mummy?!

103
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,985
B.Beats me...

104
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,754
He, himself says
he doesn't know

106
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,724
so that's out!

107
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,558
Well...

108
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,693
It's not surprising that
he doesn't remember

110
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,427
The killer probably

111
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,232
went into the toilet compartment
next to the one Mummy went inside

113
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,266
and injected an anesthetic or something

114
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,469
with a syringe or something

115
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,302
from the space of the partition of the toilet

117
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:14,840
After-Mummy
sucked the vapor in and passed out

119
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,759
the killer probably snuck in
from the top part of the partition

121
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,848
and pulled the card out,
taking it from Mummy.

123
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,719
Hey. hey!

124
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,555
Where do you have such evidence!!

125
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,158
I have no such evidence

126
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,225
I just mentioned

127
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,494
I just mentioned

128
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,996
the easiest way possible
to carry out the murder

130
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,064
Besides,

131
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,567
I believe that the anesthetic and syringe
are already inside the sea

133
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,836
Just what do you think
you're talking about!

135
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,907
Don't tell me you're going to say
you don't know who the killer is!

137
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,242
Wha, ha. ha!

138
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,210
Fuh. fuh. fun

139
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:58,116
There is indeed only one person
who could be the killer though

141
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,317
Detective Mourn

142
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,520
WwW. What?!

143
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,055
The one who killed Mr. Fukuura

144
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:07,659
as well as
tried to put the blame on Mummy is

146
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,162
none other than

147
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,797
you!

148
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,266
Wolf Man!!

149
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:16,201
W. What?!

150
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,403
WwW, Wolf Man?!

151
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,772
Gaha. ha. ha!!

152
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,508
Your head must've dulled
from your cold

154
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,878
We all saw Wolf Man
come out of the restroom

156
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:31,149
as well as just before Mr Fukuura
gave out the quiz!

158
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:36,688
While on the contrary
Mummy wasn't seen by anybody!!

160
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,523
Just what are you talking about?!

161
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,360
When I came out of the toilet...
you were watching me!

163
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:44,629
Huh

164
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,466
A.Are you doubting my memory?!

165
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,433
I was here too

167
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,469
when the:quiz was just about
to be announced,

170
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,270
right near you!

171
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:52,904
Hey, hey,

172
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,007
don't tell me that you're going to say
that you weren't the Mummy

174
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,142
but the Invisible Man, eh?

175
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:03,365
Franken has the key
that will unravel the mystery.

177
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,550
W. Why?

178
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,520
Won't you tell us.why,

179
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,858
you were acting your role
as a monster even inside the toilet

181
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,061
as well as what you were surprised at,
right afterwards

183
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,418
It.It's a well-known thing
among we horror fans that

185
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,137
If there is anyone within
the party grounds that is sending e-mails,

187
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,107
that person is a movie staff
that is judging to see

189
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,209
whether they should give us a chance
to appear in the movie or not

191
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,447
That's why I knew right off the bat
that he was a staff member

193
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,717
So. I followed-him toiselmyselt and

194
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,954
kept acting my role until he came out

195
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,358
But the one who came out of the toilet
that he went in was

197
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,428
WwW. Wolf Man?!

198
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:55,200
What?
You mean Mummy was Wolf Man?!

200
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:55,967
Hey. hey,

201
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,836
then~Don't tell me that

202
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,938
That's right

203
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:05,409
The killer not only wanted to put the blame
on Mummy who was asleep in the toilet,

205
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,713
he also put something else on Mummy

206
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,082
And that}something else was
his Wolf Man's mask!!

208
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:14,836
You probably cracked the mirror
in the restroom

210
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:19,124
to keep Mummy
from finding out what happened

212
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,893
He doesn't have to look inte the mirror

213
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,812
to realize that he's not wearing
hisforiginal mask. does he?

215
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,298
I mean he's wearing something
Iike this, you know!

217
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:30,335
Since Mummy was originally
wrapped up in bandage,

219
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,237
and moreover, if he was put to sleep

220
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,272
it's no wonder that
he didn't realize what had happened

222
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:37,826
Onitopr f that, the mask covers and
hides everything from neck down,

224
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,829
so even if the color
of the necktie changes, it's hard to tell

226
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,748
Besides. both of them
were wearing white gloves

228
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,183
and their outfits
are more or less similar.

230
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,321
Sol don't think
anyone would've suspected anything

232
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:55,427
Their physiques are similar and
they hold the same card of the devil,

234
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,362
both of them are reticent

235
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:00,565
and they end up in the compartment
next to each other

237
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,634
Doesn't everything
fall too much in place?

239
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,805
The only coincidence here is
probably the pattern of the card

241
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,558
The killer was waiting for
the right person to come to the toilet

243
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:13,945
There were a lot of passengers
who didn't speak a word

245
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,282
because they wanted
to sell themselves as monsters

248
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,985
as for piercing the card with the arrow,

249
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,952
the killer probably
thought it up right on the spot

251
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,856
The person that would be suspected as

252
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,092
the killer would be someone
that didn't have his card

254
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,760
He probably made light of it.

255
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,230
Thinking that no one would figure out
who the real killer was

257
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,398
B.But...

258
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,567
when Sonoko called

259
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,303
Wolf Man came out of the restroom!!

260
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,840
If he was drugged to sleep.

261
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,308
How come he came out
at such great timing!!

263
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:48,146
You heard something before he
came out of the toilet, didn't you?

265
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,114
Huh

266
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,183
Oh. I see!!

267
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,120
The howling of the wolf!

268
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,255
Aoooon

269
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,359
It seemed that he was playing
the howling using a tape recorder

271
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,430
If he turned the switch on
from the toilet compartment next door

273
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,400
Aooon

274
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,137
Mummy would be surprised
and wake up!!

276
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,221
Yeah

277
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,776
The speaker was probably attached
behind the mask

279
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,144
The killer attached a wiretap
with the speaker

281
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,061
and put the mask on Mummy

282
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:26,418
so that he wouldjreact swiftly 3
to the voices of the people around him-"

284
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,354
Even if someone were to talk to him,

285
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,589
Mummy would think that
Wolf Man was being talked to

287
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,494
because the howling is heard at
close range.

289
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,664
I see... very true!

290
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,366
I thought it was strange

291
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,101
because each time he heard howling.
He was looking here and there.

293
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,637
That's how

294
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,507
Wolf Man gave everyone the impression
that he was at the party hall

296
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,009
and 'created his alib:.

297
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,611
Then he went up on deck
and fired the arrow from the bow gun

300
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,346
coos
at Mr. Fukuura who was
on top of the mast!

303
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,350
Then he.used the howling to guide him
to where Mummy was. among the crowd

305
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,021
and: tore off the mask within the crowd

307
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:03,654
and put it back on himself

308
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:07,358
and put it back on himself

310
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,663
then went back inside
the crowd of pebple

312
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,567
So. I guess this is how the story goes

313
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,836
Right, Wolf Man?!

314
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,275
Am I wrong in any. way?

315
00:12:34,352 --> 00:12:35,186
Phooey...

316
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,790
I donstekNnow
if you're a high school detective

318
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,308
or what but...
you can sure blabber on, can't you!

320
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,396
I put this mask-on Mummy, you say?!

321
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:49,634
Do you have proof that I did it, or what"?!

322
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,538
If it's something that points in
the direction that you're the killer, yes.

324
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,341
I have two!

325
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,712
One is this!

326
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:07,118
The hint of the quiz was that a human
was among the monsters here

328
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,019
cock-a-doodle-doo

329
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,188
¢ RR. Rooster?!

330
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,356
H.Hey. where d you get that?!

331
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:15,159
It was tied to a rope here

332
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:20,498
I think that Mr. Fukuura with the spotlight
on himself was going to do this!

334
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,369
What?!

335
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,371
Suspend. itupside:down...?

336
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,472
Upside down?

337
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,475
The opposite of rooster...

338
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,710
retsoor...

339
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,077
retsoor?

340
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,146
Phooey!

341
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,882
Just what kind of hint
is that supposed to be

343
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,585
Retsoor...Retsoor...

344
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,853
I get it

345
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:42,620
Huh 2!

346
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:46,791
Male roosters are called cock,

347
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,560
and he's holding it by the tail

348
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,661
It is said that long ago

349
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,730
all-kinds of liquor were made by
stirring them with the tail of the cock.

351
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,866
C Therefore. -the drinks were called
cocktail since then

353
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,968
That's the origin of the word cocktail

354
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:57,919
What?

355
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,538
You mean cocktail is the hint?

356
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,073
Detective Mouri

357
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,209
you also drank it too,

358
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,177
that cocktail

359
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,146
I'm a beer drinker!!

360
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,081
I would never drink something
sissy like that... 7?!

362
00:14:11,482 --> 00:14:12,851
Aagh!!

363
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,421
Come to think of it,
I was looking for Wolf Man and

365
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,959
Hey, boss! What's up?

366
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,260
Oh, bartender,

367
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,396
can you give me the same thing
he's drinking.

369
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,898
I did drink it

370
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,466
now that you mentioned it

371
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,168
If I remember correctly it was...

372
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,804
a cocktail called Silver Bullet!!

373
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,772
We were given instructions

374
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,075
by Mr. Fukuura
to drink it at the bar of the party hall!

376
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,509
Which means

377
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,746
you rushed out of the toilet like that
back then because

379
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,116
you fell asleep in the toilet
and still didn't drink the cocktail?

381
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,885
Y. Yes!

382
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,689
That's a coincidence,
because I drank it too.

384
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,091
What?!

385
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,626
Wrong!

386
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,129
It was Mummy
who you had put your mask over!!

388
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,732
It's just as Shinichi had deduced!!

389
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,234
Phooey!

390
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,537
Stop putting on airs brat!

391
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,107
I'm the only Wolf Man here!!

392
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,576
And... Wolf Man!

393
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,079
Did you really drink that cocktail?

394
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,749
You, who wanted to sell your act
as Wolf Man

396
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,751
and appear in the movie?

397
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,253
Yeah...to pep me up

398
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:27,258
Or. are you 'saying/that Wolf Man
is not supposed to'/drink liquor?!

400
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,462
You really drank Silver Bullet?

401
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,931
Shut up, persistent brat!

402
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,632
I drank it!!

403
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,635
Silver Bullet...?!

404
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,104
Hey, no way

405
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,606
Silver Bullet?

406
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,774
Ilver Bullet, that's...

407
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,474
Yeah...

408
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,344
Wolf Man would never drink it

410
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:50,381
Yes...

411
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,818
the name of the cocktail was
Silver Bullet

413
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,121
Just as the name goes. a silveribullet

414
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,591
Is the one weapon in the movie

415
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,228
that is capable of
killing the Wolf Man

417
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,353
It's a thing that
any horror fan would know

419
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,521
And...

420
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:17,275
a cocktail with that name is also
used to ward off evil

422
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,080
Mr. Fukuura probably intended
to use this cocktail as a hint

424
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,182
and lure people to the bar

425
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:29,020
then later ask{the bartender
who drank what kind of liquor

427
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,456
and have everyone answer that

428
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,927
Mummy who ordered Silver Bullet was
the human among the monsters

430
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,498
Because no monster would go out of
their way to order liquor t ward off evil

432
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,736
Isn't that right. Wolf Man?

433
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,808
Since the bartender heard nothing
beforehand from Mr. Fukuura

435
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,211
he seems to have served

436
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,380
Detective Mouri the same liquor,
though

438
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,317
If Mr. Fukuura was the one
who did the make-up for Mummy

440
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,351
it's most likely that

441
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,454
the thing-that is
the answer is under the bandage

444
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,424
the bull's eye mark that indicates that
you're the answer to the quiz!!

446
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:07,091
Ares

448
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,358
Excuse me

449
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,432
Here it is!

451
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,735
It says human

452
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,637
Qooo0

453
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,539
He's the one

454
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:28,212
And?

455
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,882
What about the other evidence?

456
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,717
Even a marksman
at the bow gun could never pierce

458
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:36,687
a person with an arrow poked
with a card through it

460
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:41,275
Of course. he wouldn't be able to do it
from on top this unstable rope too

462
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,778
In order to make sure he kills his target,

463
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,999
he would have to climb up here
and fire at his target at point blank

465
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,870
The traces of Wolf Man
having come up here back then is here.

467
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,039
WwW. What?!

468
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,277
The traces of pieces of glass that are
embedded into the soles of your shoes

470
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,346
that you stepped on when you cracked
the mirror in the restroom

472
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,117
If we have the forensic officers
match the pieces

474
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,819
I'm sure they will match completely

475
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,521
Now. Wolf Man

476
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,227
please show us the soles of your shoes

477
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:21,099
and tell us
why you came all the way up here

479
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,970
So. please show us then, Wolf Man!

480
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,406
Come on, and lift your foot

481
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,010
1. didn't do it

482
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,247
It.It's not me!

483
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,616
I had no intention of killing him!

484
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,518
That devil is to blame

485
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,819
Huh

486
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,622
It.It's all that devil's fault!

487
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,656
It's that devil's fault!

488
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,659
The one called BBellmott!

489
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:24,695

494
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,558
Dr. Niide. what seems to be the matter?

495
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,295
That's for me to say.

496
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:33,731
What do you intend to do with her?!

497
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,366
No! No!

498
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,102
We were just taking a drive!

499
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,037
Unlike you,

500
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,974
I've got a lot of time on my hands,
you see!

502
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:43,941
Lot of time?

503
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:49,146
Dr. Niide. it's almost time
for the trial for the homicide case, isnt it!

505
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,983
You've got to testify
as would be expected of a good citizen!

507
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,317
And tell everyone that

508
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:57,255
the home helper Hikaru Tamoto is
the one who pulled the trigger

510
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,889
and killed your father

511
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,459
which is a hidden fact

512
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,995
Hikaru pulled the trigger?

513
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,163
No-use playing dumb with me!

514
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,434
Detective Mouri. told me the facts
to everything!

516
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,970
Just what are you talking about?!

517
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,123
The killer of the case back then is
my step mother

519
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:21,212
And, besides, he died of electrocution,
not bullet wounds!!!

521
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,019
B.Bellmott? You say

522
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,820
Are you saying that-you Killed Mr. Fukuura

523
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,258
because that character called Bellmott
asked you to do so?

525
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:34,825
Hey!!

526
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,798
N.No It's true that
I had a grudge against Mr. Fukuura

528
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:44,635
becausenhe concluded
the Unlucky Days series that

530
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,370
I loved more than anything else...
just like that

532
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:51,642
2h TUN
andustarted'this kindergarten-style
Phantom Ship @aptain series

535
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:56,213
Sow wrote about this,on the'BBSw
«Of a certainsinternet site

537
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,849
saying that
I wanted-to work off my grudge

539
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,654
T.Then, this personscalled Bellmott
contacted me

541
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,089
saying that she'd tell me how to kill him

542
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,392
as well as prepare the murder weapon,
so if I'd like to carry it out

544
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,362
What do you make of the life of a person,

545
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,432
carrying out murder on a motive like that!!

546
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,535
OQ. Of course I refused at first!

547
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:19,603
But, after that

548
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,306
pictures of mysfamily
and I that were taken secretly,

550
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,141
along with tapes
of wire:tapped telephone conversations,

553
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,145
as well as documents with my daily
actions written to minute detail,

555
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,817
a whole cardboard Bx full was
delivered to me!!!

557
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:34,985
I was told that if I refused
or reported it to the police

559
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,988
either my family or I would die

560
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,125
Everything I received implicated this!!

561
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,933
Zen]!
IS cause 0 ea : 'was e eC rocu ion
and not by a gun?

564
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,902
Fuh... fuh. fun. fun

565
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,972
Aha, ha, ha, ha...

566
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,175
WwW. What are you getting at?

567
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,280
Oh, sorry the trigger I was referring to
just now wasthe electricity breaker

569
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:09,420
The killer is the one who rigged
everything to commit the murder but

571
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,958
the one who actually lifted the breaker,
and triggered the murder is

573
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,628
Hikaru Tamoto who knew nothing at all.

574
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,364
Therefore.in order not to hurt her feelings

575
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:25,403
the killer and the police got together and
made up a fake record of investigation!

577
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,073
It said that the method of killing was
something else

579
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,511
Well, it's only natural that
you don't know about this!

581
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:37,114
Because nothing of this sort was written
on the investigation report that

583
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,483
you stole from the police

584
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:44,755
The document that
you~-stole to get over the trial and

586
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,709
keep existing as Dr. Araide

587
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,932
WwW. Who are you anyway?!

588
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,904
A secret makes a woman a woman

589
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,039
Do you remember?

590
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:05,543
Theselare the final words
you left behind with me

592
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,912
And the words I kept repeating

593
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,980
so as not to forget them

594
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,384
the words of the one who killed my father

595
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:15,853
right

596
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,454
Chris Vineyard?

597
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,235
Rather...
the other name that you go by

599
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:49,520
Vermouth!
