1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:03,569
Inspiration flashes.
Piercing through to the truth.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,037
Once he gets going, nothing can stop him.

4
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,006
In today's episode,
the mysterious key is the key

6
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,175
A surprise behind locked doors.

7
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,710
The one and onM truth is brought into light

8
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,578
He looks like a child but he's got the
brains of an adult.

10
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,214
His name is... Detective Conan.

11
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,781
I'm sure it was around here

12
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,484
Did you say Hikari Soh?

13
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:02,388
Yeah. it's an rundown old apartment
building that looks like it'll fall any minute

15
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,994
Hey... I think,
this might be it

17
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,396
Maison Hikarl...

18
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,834
I... don't believe it...

20
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:21,507
CASE OF THE KEY UNDERWATER
IN A LOCKED ROOM

22
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,477
Oh I'm so sorry.

27
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,613
I had this place rebuilt this Spring
into a condominium
Mitsue Souda (73)
Landlord of Maison Hikarl

31
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:27,912
I had this place rebunlt this Spring
into a condominium

33
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:32,051
Gee... I didn't know that,
what a shock

35
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,421
It's a lot different from the
apartment you stayed In

37
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,923
when you were a student, isn't it?

38
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:40,126
It sure is, like night and day

39
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,629
As a matter of fact, you left here
after only 6 months

41
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,031
to get away from
your nagging landlord didn't you.

43
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,100
Un, I. don't remember. Ahahaha...

44
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:55,374
Hey, ma'am, do you live here all alone?

45
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,178
That's right. My children have moved away.

46
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,015
But my grandson fives on Him floor.

47
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,984
Here you go, eat up/eat up...

48
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,386
Wow, looks delicious

49
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,655
You're not so Ioneh then

50
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:15,528
No I'm not... Makoto is studing construction
at Jyonan Universitx

52
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:18,564
but lately he's been so depressed.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,069
I asked why but he won't tell me.

54
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,474
So I thought a famous private detective like
you would be able to get him to talk...

56
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,976
Is that why you called me?

57
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,380
He said he'd drop by around 8...

58
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,283
I think I'll go check on him

59
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:41,087
Only he and I live on the fourth floor.

60
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,623
I'm only renting out
the rooms on the 1st to 3rd floors.

62
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,895
That's Odd

63
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,668
He might be sleeping...

64
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,304
Do you think we should go in without
his permission?

66
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,573
It's alright, he's my grandson

67
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,178
Makoto, are you in?

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,082
Good grief, what a mess

69
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,487
What is this...

70
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,526
Excuse me

72
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,233
Is that what I think it is.

73
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,902
No. it's just crayon...

74
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,170
Oh no!!
Even over here

76
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,372
Oh no!!
Even over here

78
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:04,403
Monument in the water...

79
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,405
What in the world is this

80
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:07,907
How awful...

81
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:08,807
Makoto'?!

82
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:12,978
There's a key in the water...

83
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,651
Makoto'?!

84
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:20,819
Makoto'?!

85
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,489
Makoto'fl "

86
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,693
Ma koto'?

87
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,329
Makoto!!

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,797
What's wrong?!

89
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,504
Makoto?! Wake up!

90
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,672
Makoto'?!

91
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,340
Makoto?!

92
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,576
Makoto'?!

93
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,549
Gash on the inside of his
Ieft wrist...

95
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,585
No hesitation cuts

96
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,887
Hurry, call an ambulance...

97
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,754
No it's too late.

98
00:05:56,755 --> 00:06:00,659
That's ridiculous! oh, I know,
call Kido!

100
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,260
Ki'do?

101
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,662
He's a medical.studen't'. He lives
on the 3rd floor.

103
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,397
He and Makoto are friends!

104
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,700
But your grandson is already...

105
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,501
Just get him!

106
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,869
HI -0 et him!

107
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,011
Mr. Kido! Mr. Kido!

108
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,314
Mr. Kid0!?

109
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,185
Mr. Kido"?

110
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,021
Mr. Kido...!

111
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,355
Mr. Kido...!

112
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:29,822
Mr. Kido...!

113
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:34,426
How smell
Oh he's only in a drunken sleep.

115
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:36,762
Just look atqthis place

116
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,038
Un? Who're you ?

117
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,508
Mr. Kido! Something's happened to
Makoto! Come quick!

119
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,409
LE'hU

120
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,868
Makoto!!

121
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,010
The deceased is Makoto Souda.
22 years old.

123
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,912
He was a senior at Jyonan University,

124
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,214
majoring in construction in the
engineering department.

126
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,516
Cause of death IS assumed to

127
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,886
be loss of blood due to the severed
artery of the upper arm

129
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:38,257
Hmm... judging from rigor mortis of
the neck region,

131
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,926
it looks like he's
been dead for 2-3 hours

133
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:46,965
Which puts the time of death bet-ween
6 and 7 PM, is that correct? fl

135
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,002
Inspector, this is clearly a suicide

136
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,637
A suicide?

137
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,173
Yes. Please follow me!

138
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,475
Lboki'atlath is!

139
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,743
And what is this 7

140
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:04,249
A model the deceased made.
Notice there's a key in the lake.

142
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,485
It's the key to this apartment,

143
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,423
It's a specially made key so duplication
is impossible

145
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,459
And there are only 2 spares,

146
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,930
his grandmother has one and the other is
kept by the management company

148
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,467
When you got here, the door was...

149
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:26,305
It was locked. Which means the apartment
was completely'? sealed off.

151
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,308
I see, so that's why you concluded
it was suicide...

153
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,676
You're wrong!

154
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,712
He would never commit suicide!

155
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,248
When I brought him juice this evening,

156
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,851
he said he wanted to eat
pumpkin for dinner...

158
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,887
What time was that?

159
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:47,793
Just about 5. I went out right after that...

160
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,262
he was killed while I was gone...

161
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,464
What kind of juice was it?

162
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,269
It's my own blend to prevent
summer heat fatigue.

164
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,639
It has some honey, garlic, banana in it

165
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:05,377
And anyway. he showed no signs of
wanting to kill himself.

167
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,580
Besides, he had no reason to...

168
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,481
was troubled

169
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,086
In what way...

170
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:14,553
in? 13 (22)
flax? Egfi4$

172
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,689
He said the design he was wanking on
for his graduation project
Yoshihiko Kido (24)
Jyonan University Medical Student

176
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,324
wasn't coming along.

177
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,926
I knew it!

178
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,663
Maybe that's why he was so depressed

179
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,936
And judging from the red crayon scratches
on the wall and the mess in the room,

181
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,372
he must have been in a
very unstable state of mind...

183
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,540
Excuse me, Inspector

184
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:38,644
What/is this white thing attached
to-the;key

186
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,114
You're right...What could it be...

188
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,151
What are you doing. you fool

189
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,987
I think this is toilet paper

190
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,622
Tbilbt paper?

191
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,962
Yes. Tissue and other kinds of paper
won't disintergrate so easily when wet.

193
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:02,334
I'll bet someone out the toilet paper really
thin then rolled it to make string

195
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:07,473
but why would they put it on a key?

196
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:11,543
Well... he could be rather
strange at times...

198
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,678
It was probably just due to curiosity!

199
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,582
At any rate, this place was
completely locked...

201
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,582
No it wasn't

202
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,517
What?!

203
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,954
Over there... the ventilation
duct's open

205
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:28,026
You dummy, do you think some one can
get in and out through that tiny space?

207
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:34,733
Take a look. The duct's onlyfabout
15 centimeters wide

209
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:40,205
All the other keys are accounted for,
this was definitely a locked room

211
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:44,009
But I still think it "8 strange
to be a suicide

213
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,580
It was pitch dark? you-couldn't cut the
artery with such precision could you?

215
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,915
Pitch dark?

216
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:53,552
Where the fights 0 when you
came in here?

218
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:57,154
H yes but the bathroom...

219
00:10:57,155 --> 00:11:02,226
The light m the bathroom was also
off . I turned it on and then went in...

221
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:07,933
It's still light outside at 6-7 PM
which is the estimated time of death

223
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:10,802
but there're no windows in the bathroom.

224
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:14,473
Without the light on, you wouldn't be
able to see past your hands

226
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:19,912
The killer may have inadvertently turned
the lights off when he was done...

228
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:25,484
If this was murder, could the crayon
markings on the wall be to cover the crime?

230
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,986
The question is this key.

231
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:33,358
How was the killer able to leave the
key here in the Water.

233
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,327
There are 2 more mysteries.

234
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:41,133
Why did the killer mark not only the wall
but also the edge of the (filler

236
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:45,103
and the lock on the front door with crayon...

237
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:49,341
and that ventilation duct,

238
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:55,347
it was open from the start, I doubt
the killer would have overlooked it.

240
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:59,585
Wait a minute, that's not the only
place that was open

242
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,654
I've got it!
Inspector. I've solved the case!

244
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,860
Forget what I said before,
this is a murder!

246
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,964
Just follow me!

247
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,767
The key to solving this case is...

248
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,071
Is that mailbox!

249
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,573
First, the killer...

250
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:26,945
threaded some string under the bridge,
pulls it to the front door.

252
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:30,415
Passes it through the mailbox,
goes outside & locks the door...!

254
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,154
And then, puts the key on one end of
the string, when the other thread is pulled.

256
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,457
The key moves toward the model,

257
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,729
and when it passes under the
bridge, the paper string breaks

259
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,398
and the key falls into the water...!

260
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,801
What do you think?

261
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,372
That solves the mystery of the locked room!

262
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:56,475
Yes, I see! Brilliant deduction, Mourl!

263
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,912
That's it...! I've got it!!

264
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,915
Uh, sir. I don't understand

265
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:08,452
This entrance and the living room are
at a right angle. Isn't that right?

267
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,589
Huh? What about it?

268
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,925
If you pulled the thread
from outside the door.

270
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:17,928
The thread would rub against the pillar at
the corner and leave a mark. wouldn't it?

272
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,903
It's not here...

273
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,940
I wanted them to see the killer deliberately
colored the edge of the pillar

275
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,244
that this trick had nothing
to do with thread .

277
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,846
Now for this...

278
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,149
That's it! I've got it

279
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,287
The killer locked the door
through] the mailbox rigging it...

281
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:46,058
the marks are... not here

282
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,196
That's it! The ventilation duct!

283
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:55,600
The killer used the trick I explained
but wuth the ventilation duct

285
00:13:55,702 --> 00:14:00,572
Umm. . theoretically, it I's-possible

286
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,641
No. it's impossible

287
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:08,046
See. there's a dog in the house
on the other side

289
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:13,385
that is a wonderful watchdog, he won't
Iet anyone except his master get close

291
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,220
Isn't that right, Kido?

292
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,356
Yes It always barks at me too.

293
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,426
This place is in plain view of that yard.

294
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,229
If someone was doing
something suspicious.

296
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,365
That dog would bark like crazy and
everybody'd look outside.

298
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,102
I guess I missed on this one too

299
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:34,239
it must've been suicide after all,
Inspecto'rc'.

301
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:40,245
No, it is murder! And the killer.

302
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:47,185
The victim's wound shows no hesitation cut.

303
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,287
The gash is perfectly straight and deep

304
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,825
The only ones capable of such precision,
would be a doctor or a medical student

306
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,863
ut what trick did he use . ?.

307
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,001
The buglight'?

308
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:09,174
Wait a minute The sweater in the
entrance! The crayon markings all

310
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,810
over the apartment! And...
That's it!

312
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,112
That's why that duct was left
open just so much,

314
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,848
making this place an
almost sealed room!

316
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,456
Now to prove it...!

317
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:28,360
There has to be something.
There has to be...

319
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,695
Hmm, what's this?

320
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,664
Wha'tjs-tms' émem.

321
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,337
The smell's coming from here...
I wonder)! /

323
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:44,709
There it is!

324
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,412
Excuse me, Ma'am!

325
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,180
Yes?

326
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,950
Is that the cup you brought
the juice in?

328
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,055
Why yes it is... how unusual
he washed it...

330
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,259
I knew it now I have the proof

331
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,362
Thank you for all your cooperation.

332
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,031
That's all for today.

333
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,566
I've got 'it'!

334
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,536
I figured out the trick the killer used.

335
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,204
What?!

336
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,972
Are;you sure, Conan?!

337
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:18,176
Yup, I'll demonstrate. Ma'am,
may-J-borrow your key?

339
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:21,046
You dummy, how would you know...

340
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,516
Here kid, you need the key, right?

341
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,383
Take it.

342
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,651
Thank you

343
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,086
Wait here for a while

344
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,867
Hey», what in the world are you doing?!

345
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:45,503
Never mind. just watch.
And now ma'am.

347
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,575
When Igggqnbutithe'door, I Want you to
turn all the lights off

349
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,576
Alright...

350
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,580
OK? I'm going to start, everyone
watch quietly

352
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,283
Humph. how "Coo \

353
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,827
Something fell...

354
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:21,139
A beetle
A male beetle

356
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,367
What!

357
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,386
The key...

358
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,310
A buglight!

359
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,447
How did it go?

360
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,115
Conan.

361
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:44,155
I see, so this is how the killer did
it... but why did the beetle-come here?

363
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:45,557
The smell 1)

364
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,893
It was lured here because the top of
monument was coated

366
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,029
with the scent of something it liked

367
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,632
And what about the sweater
on the threshold?

369
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,970
The killer put it there so the
beetle would be able to walk easily

371
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:03,475
Beetles have a hard time walking on
Wb'dd "flooring.and tile!

373
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,878
This hallway and the living room
are carpetted...

375
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,916
The conditions were ideal for the killer.

376
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,985
Good work Conan.

377
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,622
Hey? Where did you get the
beetle you used?

379
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:22,027
Oh, I just took one of them Mr.
Kido is raising in his room

381
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,663
I didn't ask permission.
Sorry Mr. Kido, I let one get away!

383
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,966
Oh, uh, forget it

384
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,102
By the way. Mr. Kido... were you here in
this apartmen'utonight

386
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,504
before I went tofget you?

387
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,406
Eh? No, I didn't come here

388
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,643
Reall; ? Are you sure?

389
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,646
Of course I'm sure!
Why're you asking that...

391
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:47,385
Then why does your handkerchief smell
ike the juice Mrs. Mltsue made?

393
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,520
Em?) "

394
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:54,492
Mrs. Mitsue brought the Juice to
him at about 5 this evemng

396
00:19:56,462 --> 00:20:01,031
Mr. Kido...after Makoto drank the
juice, you washed the cup, didn't you?

398
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,035
And the juice that dripped to the floor

399
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,771
you wiped it up with your handkerchief,
didn't you

401
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:10,141
hy did he do it...

402
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,510
The reason is...

403
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,880
The male beetle might be lured by
the juice being its smell is stronger

405
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,781
that the female beetle's scent.

406
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:20,752
So it might climb something other
than the monument!

408
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:28,560
You coated the monument wit'hsthe .
Female's scent, didn't fiou.

410
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:32,262
Kido, you didn't...

411
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,038
Let me see your handkerchief

412
00:20:40,638 --> 00:20:43,208
boy. I

413
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,812
I was so relieved I shut him up

414
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:50,682
I forgot to get rid of the handkerchief.

415
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,618
All because I got drunk celebrating
and fell asleep

417
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,687
Why did you do it...?

418
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,656
About a year ago, he come to me
with a proposition

420
00:20:59,657 --> 00:21:02,460
that I stole some sleeping
pills from the university's hospital.

422
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,595
We sold them.

423
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:08,399
But recently, he told me he wanted to quit.

424
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:15,440
I was a 'raid he'd tell you about it and
I'd get arrested

426
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,142
Why you...

427
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:30,121
I'm sure Makoto regretted what he did and
was prepared to be punished...

429
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,358
This comes late, the crime
has been committed

431
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,697
but a life is a burden
heavier than you could ever imagine

433
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:45,103
Delve on that burden
while you're in prison

435
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:49,574
you'll have a lot of time to think
about It. .'I

I feel so sorry for Mrs. Mitsue.

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:28,306
You can't replace her gran

481

her from time to time

Conan you were so sharp tonight.
I was amazed.

486
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:42,754
Uh that's because I always get to
see the famous Mr. Mouri in action...

488

Like they say. "Learn by watching,
