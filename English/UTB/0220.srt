1
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,987
With a strong heart
and power of deduction

3
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,622
step into the essence
with strong rhythm.

5
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,724
A beautiful and mysterious lady makes
an appearance in today's episode

7
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,525
An odd request begins the case

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,960
He sees through the one and only truth.

9
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,662
A child in appearance
with the I.Q. of an adult

11
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,597
No case is left unsolved with
Detective Conan.

13
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:59,251
A CLIENT FULL OF LIES PART I

14
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,225
You say, you're looking for someone?

15
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,393
Yes,

16
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,228
There is a person that I really want to see.

17
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,796
Well, I'm so sorry,

18
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,665
but I happen to be tied up just now.

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,334
Please, will you help me please?

20
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,471
To tell you the truth,
I'm right near your office already.

22
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,674
If it's okay, I'd like to

24
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,944
Kaminari-Boy!

25
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,612
The winner is, Kaminari-Boy!!

26
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,248
He has won the final race
with his graceful legs!

28
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:29,615
Oh no! I lost again!
He has won the final race
with his graceful legs!

31
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,150
Oh no! I lost again!

32
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,019
Hello, Mr Mourn?

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,588

I Know...

41
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,142
What kind of person was the caller?

42
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:58,444
Some middle aged lady.

43
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,079
She says she's coming over right now!

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,781
I'll bet she one of those,

00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:06,251

Please come in!

49
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,869
I called just a while ago.
My name is llkenami.

51
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,573
Please forgive me for intruding on you
so suddenly like this

53
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:31,143
An acquaintance of mine
mentioned that you,
Shizuka Ikenami

00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,045
Mr. Mouri would definitely find

Shizuka Ikenami
IR MR

63
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,512
Mr. Mouri would definitely find
the person that I'm looking for.

65
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,714
Please help me

66

Talk about beautiful...

68
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,492
Where did dad go?

69
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,931
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting...

70
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,066
mademoiselle...

71
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,706
I was looking through some,papers of
a very difficult case, you see...

73
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,844
Come now, and relax on the sofa,

74
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:09,014
and calm that pulsatinggheart of yours
before I hear you out.

76
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,483
Ran!

77
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,984
Get us something to drink, will you!

78
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,486
Okay...

79
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,222
Here he goes again...

80
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,062
You re looking for
a Jr. High School classmate.

82
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,063
Yes,

83
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,298
we belonged to the same kendo club.

84
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:30,636
Couldn't you find his address
on the graduation list?

86
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,737
He moved before graduation,

87
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,674
and the space where his name is
supposed to be is blank

90
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:36,842
51,08 BIC...

91
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,644
I see...

92
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,881
I've brought a picture of him back
In those days with me.

94
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,720
He's the one In thercenter
holding-the winner's cup.

96
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,456
His name is Shiro Shibata.

97
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,692
Isn't the girl standing next to him?

98
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,762
How embarrassing, but it's me...

99
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,466
It's already been 30 years though.

100
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,902
T, Thirty years ago?!

101
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,970
Don't tell me that you're already over 407?!

102
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:05,838
Yes,

103
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,673
I will be 42 this year.

104
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,477
But, the boy in the picture
Is still in 8th grade.

106
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,446
Although I think
he may have grown taller 'byinow.

108
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,316
Any hobbies?

109
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,884
Oh, yes...

110
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,253
I don't think he has
any special hobbies though.

112
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,022
No, I mean yours.

113
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,158
I, I like knitting,

114
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:30,062
and I usual knit sweaters...

115
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,265
My what a nice hobby!

116
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,468
Oh, my mother's hobby Is knitting too!

117
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,172
I'll bet you're good at cooking too?

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,608
No, not at all.

119
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:47,146
See, I cut myself in three places when
I tried to cook after a long while last night.

121
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,615
O Oh well, no big deal!

122
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,718
Shortcomings help make a person
more attractive at:times.

124
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:53,886
Right, right,

125
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,421
Just like mother!

126
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,792
But I'm full of shortcomings...

127
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:04,230
That's why I'm still single at this age

128
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,665
What?! You're single?!

129
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,665
Yes...

130
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:12,638
Well, to leave a beauty like you single,

131
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,641
the guys around you must be blind.

132
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,443
Really, what a fantastic person.

133
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,478
Just like mother,

134
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,947
it's hard to understand the guy
who doesn { give a hoot about her

136
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,215
Ran...

137
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,086
Oh, I'm\sorry...

138
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,256
What's wrong?

139
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,257
Do you have a cold?

140
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,290
Oh, no...

141
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,293
I was born with bronchial problems

142
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:36,662
I'm, you see, allergic to dust.

143
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,497
I'm sorry,

144
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,567
it must be dusty-heme because
we were cleaning just a while ago...

146
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,002
Let's change places then

147
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,004
I'm sorry...

148
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,645
Picture?

149
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,713
So, you re looking for this Mr Shibata

150
00:06:55,714 --> 00:06:59,184
because you wantsto
get a picture back fromthim?

153
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:01,787
It s only one picture

154
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:05,357
that was taken when we won
the semifinals in a summer contest

156
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,160
during our Jr. High School days...

157
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:11,864
Just the other day, my grandmother
seems to have mistakenly thrown away

159
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,766
the plate we received then.

160
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,468
So, I thought that I'd like to at least
have a picture of it.

162
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,773
But, why does this Mr. Shibata
have that picture?

164
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:25,144
I was using that picture as a bookmarker
for a book that I borrowed from him,

166
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,680
but I forgot to take the picture
out of the book when I returned it to him.

168
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,785
Then, Mr. Shibata is not your first love
or anything like that?

170
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,488
No, well...

171
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:40,259
And, do ou have an other clues on him?

172
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:41,660
Well...

173
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,962
Mr. Mouri, may I take your order?

174
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,764
Oh, coffee for me!

175
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,900
I'll have iced lemon tea.

176
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,069
Reiko...

177
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,438
Reiko?

178
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:53,872
Who is she?

179
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,407
Oh, no...

180
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,644
He used to call me by that name.

181
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,780
Something about the character
called Reiko,

183
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,451
in the book that I borrowed
from him resembled me.

185
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,853
What would you like, Conan?

186
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,988
Ice coffee for me!

187
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,390
I'll take the same.

188
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,092
All right.

189
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,995
So, where should I start...

190
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,099
The only clues I have are his name,

191
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,202
age and this picture of 30 years ago.

192
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,237
You know what...

193
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:25,571
Then,

194
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,575
what about asking him for help?

195
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:31,777
Him...?

196
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,647
I've heard rumors about him.

197
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,151
Also that the high school detective,

198
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,354
ShlnlChl Kudo IS in
and out of your office at times.

200
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:45,758
Shinichi?!

201
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,626
Isn't that right, sonny?

202
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,163
No, he hasn't come around at all that brat.

203
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,666
He only rings me up once in a while
to say stupid things.

205
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,236
Well, I'm sorry that
I only have stupid things to say.

207
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:02,975
What a bummer,
to have such rumors going around.

209
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,178
If worse comes to worse,
they may hear about it too.

211
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,950
LWlhhave to keep my deductions
to myself for a while, I guess...

213
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,286
Conan.

214
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,722
What dofyou think, Conan?

215
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,592
Wella ou were about to say
somethingfljust now, weren't you?

217
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,428
What good IS it going to do, asking a brat?

218
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:27,399
But, he always takes
note of interesting things, doesn't he?

220
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:28,933
Oh, no, it's nothing.

221
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,869
Something just happened
to cross my mind.

223
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,940
Since he's holding the trophy,

224
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,176
this man won the tournament, right?

225
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:37,976
Yes.

226
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,880
If he was that strong
when he was in the 8th grade,

228
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,082
I just thought that maybe
he would still be participating

230
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,851
In some tournament even now.

231
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,656
Oh but just thought maybe...

232
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,860
What? He's participating?!

234
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,995
In the Shizuoka Tournament,

235
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,565
among the general contestants,
Mr. Shiro Shibata?

237
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,532
Yes,

238
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:01,733
yes!

239
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,403
Did you find him?!

240
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:05,704
Yes!

241
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:09,141
He seems to be awregular
who always appears in the top ranks!

243
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,745
He seems to be working
as a high school/PE. teacher in Shizuoka.

245
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,981
And is presently residing
with his wife in a condominium.

247
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,019
I'll go rent a car right now.

248
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,156
I'm glad you found him!

249
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,924
Yes, really...

250
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,027
He's been found.

251
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,630
The one she's looking for
has been found,

253
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,234
but, what I can't make out is this lady

254
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,135
who is full of lies.

255
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,140
Almost everything she says is a lie.

256
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,976
I wonder what she is up to.

257
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:50,282
Could it be that she's hiding her identity?

258
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:53,318
Hey, hey, come on

259
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,553
don't tell me that this lady is.

260
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,123
Thank you!

261
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,392
It's all thanks to you.

262
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,606
Nobody seems to be home.

263
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:18,176
I'm sure the couple
has gone out together,

265
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,878
because today Is Sunday.

266
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,981
Why don't we go kill time
somewhere nearby, then?

268
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,683
Wait.

269
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,988
Are you by chance looking for
Mr. Shibata?

275
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,257
Oh yes...

276
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,760
Please finish what you have to do
as soon as possible,

282
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,464
because he promised to play mahjong
together today at my house.

284
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,334
Oh, but he doesn t seem to be in

285
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,803
It can't be.

286
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,438
I'm sure he's asleep or something.

287
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:50,709
Seemhesssthome.

288
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,012
This program is brought to you
by the following companies.

290
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,614
This program is brought to you
by the following companies.
It's the sound of the TV.

293
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,014
This program is brought to you
by the following companies.

295
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,786
Ah come on, dozing off with the TV on
without even locking the door.

297
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:04,323
Hey, -Shibata!
We're going to start pretty soon!

299
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,496
It looks like he was still eating?!

300
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,367
The soup is cold

301
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,103
The rice 1s all dried up and hard

302
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,404
This couldn't be his breakfast

303
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,707
What a waste, the guji looks so good.

305
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,711
Oh, I mean tilefish.

306
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,148
I'm back.

307
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,383
Dear?

308
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,622
Hey, who are all of you?!

322
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,062
W We are.

323
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,064
Hey, Shibata?! What's the matter?!

324
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,900
Get a hold of yourself!

325
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:50,869
Mr. Shibata!

326
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,372
Mr. Shibata!

327
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,106
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

328
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,110
Mr. Shibata!

329
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,347
He us holding something In his right hand!

330
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,082
What is it?!

331
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,723
This is?

332
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,366
So, let me verify what you said

333
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:25,704
Mr. Mouri and his party
came over to Mr. Shibata's house

335
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,240
and pushed the button of the interphone,

336
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,042
but there was no answer.

337
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,447
Just then, Mr. Yoshikawa whom he had
a previous*engagement with came along

339
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:39,317
and tried turning the knob of the door.
The door was unlocked,

341
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,952
so the five of you came into the room.

342
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,056
Then,

343
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,859
Mrs. Shibata, Mr. Shibata's wife,
who had been out comes back

345
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,327
and runs into Mr Mourn and the others.

346
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,596
After that, at hearing

347
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:55,767
Mr. Yoshikawa shout you all go to
the living*room+to-check things out

349
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:01,039
and found Mr Shibata bleeding from
the head and dead.

351
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:08,680
The estimated time of death us
between dawn and morning today.

353
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,652
Where were you around that time,
Mrs. Shibata?

355
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,820
Oh yes.

356
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:18,190
I had a golf date
with a friend of mine today,

358
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,860
and my friend came to pick me up.

359
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,030
So, I prepared my husband's breakfast

360
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,466
and left the house before 5:00.

361
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,870
Was Mr. Shibata at home then?

363
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,608
He came home about 03:00
and was fast asleep.

365
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,444
He came home at 03:00?

366
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,879
Y, Yes .

367
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,114
Wywere 'la in: man on .

369
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,984
We were playing mahjong,at my room
that is on the fourth floor.

371
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:50,088
Just as Mrs. Shibata says
we finished the game around 03:00.

373
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,726
As a matter of fact,
the morning paper was one the table,

375
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,896
About what time is the newspaper delivered?

376
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:02,834
It comes about 06:00 and I's put inside
the mailbox right outside the front door.

378
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,069
I see.

379
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,670
Which 'means that Mr. Shibata,

380
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,406
got up in the morning,
pulled the newspaper out of the mailbox,

382
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,709
and was in the middle of
eating his breakfast

384
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,279
when someone
who came to the door killed him.

386
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,182
I guess-that's what happened.

387
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,619
How can you tell that
it was when he was eating?

389
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,156
The food on the table IS half eaten

390
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,625
and besides, it's cold and dried up.

391
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,927
Who did this?!

392
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,128
Who killed my husband?!

393
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,830
Well, I don't know yet.

394
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,133
Mr. Mouri, did you notice anything strange

395
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,536
when you entered the room?

396
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:39,771
Well,

397
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:43,041
I guess the only thing is
that the TV in the kitchen was on.

399
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,143
What, the TV?!

400
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,746
It was turned off when we got here!

401
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,448
P I tu med-it off because it was noisy.

402
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,887
Besides, I just figuredithat he was
watching TV while eating breakfast.

404
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,055
Maybe

405
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,959
My husband could've been watching
a samurai show

407
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,829
called Kenyuden that starts at 08:00.

408
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,034
MYdhusband records
that program every week

410
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,603
and watches it in the living room.\

411
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,073
He sure does have a lot of them.

412
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,276
Okay, go check out the video deck
In the kitchen!

414
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,110
Yes sir!

415
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,849
I wonder why the ID player is gone.

416
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:30,255
Because he has a lot of ID software
and yet there is no player.

418
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,291
See, this place here on the shelf is empty!

419
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,461
Morever, there is only one speaker.

420
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,763
True .

421
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:43,201
Maybe it s out for repair or something,
right Mrs..Shibata?

423
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,704
Oh, as to that my husband...

424
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:49,407
WwW .,Who cares about that right now!

425
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,611
Hurry up and do what you have to
and let me go!

427
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,014
All right, I'm going to verify your alibi

428
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,085
so could you give me the phone number
of your friend who you went golfing with?

430
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:00,852
Sure...

431
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,588
And, I'd like to have
the phone numbers of the people

433
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,123
who play mahjong with you too.

434
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,895
What?

435
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,464
She came to pick Mrs. Shibata up
at 05:00 sharp?

437
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,466
Are you sure?

438
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,133
Yes.

439
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,169
She says the radio beeped
the time at the tone.

441
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:21,940
And she says she dropped
Mrs. Shibata off here a little after 7:00.

443
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,911
A little after 7-00 is
just about the time we got here.

445
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,547
I also checked with the newspaper man,

446
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,851
and he said that he delivered
the papers here around 06:00.

448
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:35,820
Taking into consideration

449
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,723
that the samurai program this morning
kept recording the video

451
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,026
and the time the-program was aired.

452
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,162
The estimated time of the crime
would probably be

454
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,197
around 08:00 to 45 minutes from then.

455
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:51,069
Which means that
Mrs Shibata couldn't have done it.

458
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,772
0,of course not!

459
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,008
Then let me ask you this, Mr. Yoshikawa,

460
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,611
I've had my doubts about the way
you've been acting till now,

462
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,780
but would you tell me of your alibi
around 08:00 this morning?

464
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,315
A, At home sleeping.

465
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,051
Is there anyone who can verify that?

466
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,720
No, because ll live alone!

467
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,387
Oh that's right!

468
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,656
I left a message in the answering machine

469
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:15,493
I said About time you get up
because I'm going to pick you up soon.

471
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,431
A Killer wouldn't leave
such a message behind, would he?

473
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,401
Or, maybe that's the very reason
you left the message?

475
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,337
Wait a minute!

476
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,938
You seem to be suspecting only me

477
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,373
but, what about them?

479
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,810
Although they seem to be
,an acquaintance «of you or something!

481
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,748
They would never commit murder.

482
00:18:37,148 --> 00:18:40,986
He is' KogoroiMouri,
a detective that:I"deeply:respect!

484
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,886
Why, thank you.

485
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,823
Y, You mean that famous...

486
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,158
Sleeping Kogoro!

487
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:47,759
Yes.

488
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,162
The young. lady with him,
IS his daughter Ran.

490
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,298
The little one is.staying at his place,
and his name is Conan.

492
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,668
And, this beautiful woman here
Is Mrs. Mouri!

494
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,137
Right, Mr. Mourn?

495
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:01,373
Does it'look that way?

496
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,607
Oh, no way.

497
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,377
My name is lkenami

498
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,047
and I went over to Mr.yMouri's office
to have him look for Mr. Shiro Shibata

500
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:11,683
who happened to be
an old friend of mine.

502
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,987
I came here because I wanted him
to give me back a picture

504
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,491
that I had mistakenly given
to him about 30 years ago.

506
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:21,426
A picture?

507
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,997
That picture is probably the picture
that he's holding in his hand!

509
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,069
I took a look at it a while ago.

510
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,104
It cant be...

511
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:34,639
T This is...

512
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,975
D, Don't tell me that this is...

513
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,210
Yes that's the picture!

514
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,679
That's the picture I was looking for.

515
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,719
Why is Mr. Shibata holding
the picture in his hand.

517
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,655
Maybe, Mr. Mourn,

518
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:57,095
that is his dying message...

519
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,831
It cant be.

520
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,666
Beautiful Shizuka can't possibly
be involved in any way.

522
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:06,771
Besides this picture was
kept between the pages of a book!

524
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,573
I can't believed that
it just happened to conveniently be

526
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,308
on the floor where he was struck to death.

527
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,409
What?

528
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,280
Something is squashed
under the stomach of that man.

530
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,651
What is this?

531
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,287
A novel?!

532
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,123
The title us, Raljin No Mon.

533
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,094
bond tell me that this is the book
you were talking about?

535
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,429
Yes, it Is.

536
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,299
That's the book that I borrowed
from Shiro 30 years ago, \

538
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,769
and read, using that picture
as abobkmarker.

540
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,139
Then, don't tell me that the killer is...

541
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,007
Hold it, will you...

542
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,210
Don't you think everything fits in too well?

543
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,178
How can it be that the book
as well as the picture

545
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,481
just happened to be lying on the floor,
so coincidentally?

547
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:53,184
Come to think of it, there was a strange
phone call the day before yesterday.

549
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,086
A strange phone call?

550
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,222
Well, Mr. Shibata said,

551
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,325
Watch the program
because it's interesting.

553
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,795
That's why I was watching that
samurai movie here in this living room.

555
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,997
Just then, I got a phone call

556
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,799
Right, Mrs. Shibata?

557
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,433
Yes...

558
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:13,471
The person on the phone
asked my husband something.

560
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:17,208
He searched for a book,
took it from the shelf,

562
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,912
flipped through the pages and grinned
while remarking, I found it, I found it.

564
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,547
He grinned? And?

565
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:24,949
Where did your husband put
that book after that?

567
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:26,584
I'm sure that

568
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,854
he put it on top of the books that
he had piled up in:front of the bookshelf.

570
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,358
They are scattered!

571
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,260
Officer Yokomizo!

572
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,328
Although they are very slight,
there are blood stains in the corridor!

574
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,296
What?!

575
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,202
It seems as though the real scene of
the crime was here in the corridor.

577
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,473
Officer!

578
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,909
Could I take a look at that book?

579
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,611
No no it's
very important evidence!

581
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,347
Besides, this is a ninja book
full of kanji characters.

583
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,616
You're too young to be reading
something like this!

585
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,986
Did you read the book, officer?

586
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,155
Yeah, a long time ago.

587
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:08,593
Does a person bAthe name of'Reiko
come out in that"book?

589
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:12,564
A lady with such a fancy name
doesn't appear anywhere in the book!

591
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,365
Not again.

592
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,601
Yet another one.

593
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,303
She's lied again.

594
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,041
What on earth is she up to anyway?

595
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,712
What is there behind all the lies of hers?

I refuse!

The killer ls...

642
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,713
She was here!

643
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,349
She was here before we got here.

644
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,651
Don't tell me that this 1s the remains of!
