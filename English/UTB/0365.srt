Today's caselis:an unimaginable one
that has no connection what so ever.

00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,124
One clue however,
solves the mystery perfectly

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,525
and connects the
seemingly unrelated cases.

Pop's Is tailing somebody.

14
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:02,721
A person by the name of Shoichiro Hitomi
falls to his death from the Beika Hotel.

16
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,759
At the samertime. his twin kid brother

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,996
is found killed by someone

19
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,968
Could this have been synchronicity

20
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,004
a so-called fateful coincidence?

21
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,808
Wrong, that's not it.
This is not a case of "synchronicity."

23
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,376
The line that connects
Kaoru with the others...

25
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:29,047
If I can figure out what that is,
the mystery would be solved.

27
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:32,751
Why did Shoichiro
attack. rather. try to kill Kaoru.

29
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,970
For what reason?

30
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:42,010
A Case of Synchronicity Part 2

Um, Pops about this picture...

32
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,705
What about it?

33
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:57,075
Ms Kaoru Minimisato
went to the front desk

35
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,112
after Shoichiro made the call, right?

36
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,146
Right.

37
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,882
Back then. what was it that Kaoru said...?

38
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,085
Huh? Uh.

39
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:11,924
Uh, did you receive anything
for me. from a person called Anzai...?

41
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:16,495
You're not going to ask
Kaoru about this Anzai?

48
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:19,031
Shutyup!

51
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,933
What seems to be the matter, Mr. Mouri?

52
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,802
I'd like to talk to Kaoru once more...

54
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,871
Agh, wait dad!

55
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,638
Pops!!

56
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,385
@h, w.who are you?!

00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,026
\ aaaah!!

59
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,128
What-was that?!

60
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,496
I-think it came from Kaoruss room.

62
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,631
What?

63
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,805
Kaoru, Kaoru!

64
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,608
Kaoru!

65
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,713
They just fixed the door awhile. ago.
and yet gee whiz; notiagain

67
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,880
I have. no:choice

68
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,419
Kaoru!

69
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,655
Dad! Nab him!

73
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,280
She's still okay. get the ambulance!

74
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:49,888
I was going with Manabu Anzai
when I was living in the Kansai District.

76
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:09,408
We were also going to
get married. but 6 months ago...

78
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,284
I haven't had contact since...

79
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,853
I see

80
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,058
Well. I'm sorry to have suspected you.

81
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,927
I'm sure the man
was only after your money

83
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,797
Have you filed an offense report?

84
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,968
No. I wanted to see him and
confirm things-before doing.so

86
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:40,605
But, if you don't even knew where he is

87
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:46,745
Well, I came here because I was told
that he was seen in To « 0 somewhere

89
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:55,620
But, when I came looking for him,
I had no idea where to start looking

91
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,856
Other than! his name Anzai

92
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,727
realized that I didn't know where he was born
or where he"worked.

94
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,262
I didn't know anything. about him.

95
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,400
He didn't say anything
deliberately Which means

97
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,670
it's doubtful whether Anza
us his real name or not either.

99
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,374
The only clue that I have # *
IS a picture off him.

101
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,742
What?!

102
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,044
Maywerhave a look at 1t?!

103
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:26,318
I met Mr. Anzai on a diving trip. SO
I figured he'd be diving over here too...

105
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:30,722
So, I looked here and
there with the picture and

107
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,825
contact number of Beika Hotel,
Iooking for him but.

109
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,182
Agh~H He's!

110
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,218
What's up. Conan?

111
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:45,302
Pops. show me your digital camera.

112
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:47,272
OO. Okay...

113
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,208
See, it's him.

120
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,814
Please try to remember dad.

121
00:06:56,815 --> 00:07:00,218
Wasn't there anything between
this man and Sheichino?

123
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,623
Hmm=NO...
Not that I can recall. I think.

125
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:09,594
Uh. where is that'? I'll tr,yand go there.

126
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,197
No. let us handle this...

128
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,167
I'm a detective so
I'm used to looking for people.

130
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:21,072
By the way. the man that attacked
you-arwhiletagoxwasn t he Mr. Anzai?

132
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,476
' In. vad J, UW am ke

133
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,746
Oh no... I, 1 don't know...

134
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,535
It's this man In the picture...

135
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,587
Oh. you mean Mr. Tanizaki.

136
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,923
Tanizaki...His name .is not Anzai?

137
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,692
Yes, I'm certain that this-is Mr. fT anizaki.

138
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,727
He was using .an alias after all...

139
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,198
Well, who knows if Tanizaki
Is his real name either though...

141
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,207
Mr. Tanizaki...

142
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,343
Rather. should! call you Mr. Anzau...

143
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,714
h...May I ask what this is all about

144
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,384
You know Ms. Kaoru Minamisato,
don't you?

146
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,154
W.Who's that? No. I don't.

147
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,989
Please don't play dumb with me.

148
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,725
I'm sorry, Shin-chan.

149
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,727
For:making:«you wait.

150
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,997
Oh, who is that lady?

151
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,232
Who is this man?

152
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,667
It's nothing. He's got the wrong person.

153
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,869
Hurry up and get in.

154
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,769
Okay.

155
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,247
Right~I just got mail
from daddy saying that

157
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,849
he'd come up with the money for us!

158
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,619
Oh... thanks, you're a life-saver.

159
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,188
It's okay. anything for you, Shin-chan.

162
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,265
I see

164
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,167
just as I thought...

165
00:08:56,168 --> 00:09:00,071
I hate to say this, but I guess
he had deceived you.

167
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:08,446
I seefit'SYpot all there
is to it. One more man...

169
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:14,119
Whatever his Bme IS. Tanizaki or Anza
that guy is involved in this case...

171
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,590
Kaoru's probably not the only
one who'd been deceived by this guy.

174
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,326
Including the woman
that we saw a while ago

176
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,095
he probably deceived
several others more...

178
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,630
If Kaoru found out, she would indict him.

179
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,318
That's why he wanted to shut Kaoru up.

180
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,637
In other words...he has a motive...

181
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:37,676
Shoichiro and that guy are connected
to each other with the sports gym...

183
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:41,146
but.this can be brushed
away as mere coincidence.

185
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,860
Shoichiro's accidental death.

186
00:09:58,147 --> 00:10:01,666
And Tiakehiko's*homicide
which occurred at the same time...

188
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,571
And Kaorru's assault and battery case...

190
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,776
I've got to figure this one out $8
after all Huh

194
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,979
WwW. Wait a sec...

195
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,481
I get it...so that's the story!

196
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:33,081
Ran.

197
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:34,749
What is it. Conan?

198
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:35,517

he'll be using them later.

sud Bile

209
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:00,442
Mr. Mouri, everyone's here.

210
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:05,480
Yes. sir, thank you all for coming...

211
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:09,317
And, what is this?
What'reiwyou going to start?

213
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,870
I'm going to unravel
the mystery of the two cases.

215
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,055
Cases...

216
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:17,759
wasn't Shaiehirds case an accident?

217
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,230
Whether it was an accident
or had to do with synchronicity,

219
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,800
everything fit too well into place
In other-words

221
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:30,071
a frightening perfect murder
was being schemed...

223
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:32,640
P.Perfect crime?!

224
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,976
Yes, If it worked out
the way it should've...

226
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:38,713
Ran, is the monitor ready?

227
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:39,614
Yes.

228
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:45,153
To be honest, I was concerned about
something from the very beginning.

230
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:50,392
Despite owning a cell phone, Shoichiro
made a call using the public phone

232
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:55,830
in the lobby of the hotel. and-the place
was not even an out of service range area.

234
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:03,004
He did so because he didn't
want anyone to know who he was calling

236
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,039
Why didn't he want anybody to know?

237
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,776
He didn't want to leave
any-evidence behind. Just in case

239
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:11,079
he:had to justify himself and
the evidence would work against him.

241
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,481
Oh, and who was the person
on the other side of the line?

243
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:17,786
Most probably...
the woman who was staying at this hotel...

246
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,359
Kaoru Minamisato.

248
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:37,138
Kaoru::what were the contents of the
phone-<call that you received back then?

250
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,594
Well .that he received
something from Mr Anzai

252
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,513
and had taken it to the front desk...

253
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:45,764
and had taken it to the front desk...

254
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,082
But I was told that. the front desk
didn't have anything for me...

256
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:52,620
Why did he lie and make that phone call?

257
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,657
Because he didn't know
Ms. Minamisato's face.

259
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,392
Who didn't know...?

260
00:12:57,393 --> 00:13:00,094
Shoichiro. That's why
he called Ms. Minamisato

262
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:02,263
Toconfirm what she looked like.

263
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,998
And...

264
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,585
Kyaaah!

265
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,187
Aaagh?!

266
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:32,126
He ambushed Kaoru, then attacked her.
However, I happened to be there.

268
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:35,563
Shoichiro, who attempted
to flee from the veranda. +

270
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:40,368
Whaaaa~~~aaa

271
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:46,474
But. why did he attack me,
who he didn't know at all...?

273
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:50,678
Because it would be
very convenient for the culprit.

275
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,546
Huh 7!

276
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:54,516
If.he didn't know you at all.
He would not have a motive.

278
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:57,685
In other words...
He would net be suspected either.

280
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:01,990
Uh...l don't really understand
what you re trying to get at.

282
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:05,260
Kanako, do you know
why Shoichiro called you

284
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,162
to tell you to come all the way to Beika?

285
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:10,198
Huh. $0 that...

286
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,935
my husband wouldn't find out?

287
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,005
No, he used you for his alibi.

288
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,274
To establish...an alibi?

289
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:24,212
Shoichiro 'has no motive to kill Kaoru.
However,

291
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,552
You:re fired, get out of here this minute.

292
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:34,689
He. has a motive to Kill Takehiko.

293
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,126
But, he could've established
his alibi any other way...

295
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,596
Yes. But the fact was. he had
another important purpose

297
00:14:41,597 --> 00:14:44,999
It was to make Kanako
Ieave the house and make sure

299
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,436
that Takehiko was
at home alone After all,

301
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:51,839
it would be troublesome
to have Kanako at home,

303
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,142
iffhe wanted to murder Takehiko.

304
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:55,276
What . ?!

305
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,579
Please try to remember,

306
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,116
the call you received from
Shoichiro His first question was

308
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:03,167
I's Tékefiikoflrfr?

309
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,669
Yes, he is.

310
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,155
He wanted to know where Takehiko was.

311
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,757
Andhe made sure Takehiko was home,

312
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,793
he 'went on to say that
he wanted to see you .

314
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:13,761
Can you comeioutito Beikar?

315
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:15,163
Okay...

316
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,700
In front of the station at 12:30. See you...

317
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:22,036
He called you on his cell phone
from the restroom of the gym.

319
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:25,406
I'm pretty sure that there was
one other person near him at that time...

321
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:29,260
Shoichiro probably
checked on the whereabouts

323
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,314
of Takehiko, as well as lure Kanako out...

324
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,985
Ran, can you display the
relationship connection diagram...

326
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:37,585
Okay

327
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,255
At first glance. it looks to be a case

329
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:44,258
that is complicatedly interwoven. but

330
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:48,830
If we omit Kanako. who was
justiused to carry out the murders...

332
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,699
Hmm, it's true it starts
to look way more simple.

334
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,868
But, who is that character
to the lower right?

336
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,971
Tiheregs Shoichiro who has
murderous feelings towards

338
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:59,574
Takehiko and as for Kaoru
the man over there...

340
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:02,961
who uses an array of aliases had
murderous feelings towards her.

342
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,680
I guess we'll just call you
Mr Anzai for now

344
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:09,017
Murderous feelings that would
never had intersected and

346
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:12,654
a plan to carry them out was
established, when Shoichiro and you,

348
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:15,089
Mr. Anzaprencountered
each other in the restroom.

350
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,724
A.plan for exchange murder!

351
00:16:21,096 --> 00:16:24,198
You must've really panicked Mr. Aza,

352
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,503
when you succeeded carrying
out your part of the deal,

354
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:32,874
and Shoichiro goofed,
on top of getting himself killed.

356
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:38,880
Because of this, you ended up
having; to kill Kaoru with your own hands.

358
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:46,020
Therefore, you head off
to Beika Hotel in/person and ==.

360
00:16:53,462 --> 00:16:55,163
Ma. ha,

361
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:58,966
An exchange murder?! Say what you like.

362
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:00,201
Ws SN
Do you have evidence, though?
Some kind of definite proof?

365
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,970
Do you have evidence, though?
Some kind of definite proof?

367
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:06,107
Dad...

368
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,978
Well, of course,
that's an understandable remark.

370
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,481
Inspector Megure, were
you able to find the thing

372
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:16,551
iln.question in the vicinity
of Takehiko's residence?

374
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:20,755
Yeah, it came out of a trash can...
Of a nearby park.

376
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:23,391
Oh. that's the key to our house...

377
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:28,229
Kanako, that's the key that you
gave to Shoichiro, isn't it?

379
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,197
Yes.

380
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:34,268
Strangely enough, this key was
not found among Shoichiro's belongings.

382
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:41,342
He had given it to Mr. Anzai Since
he had no intention of getting"it back,

384
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:45,313
SO maybe it's more appropriate
to say, he gave it to you...

386
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:52,185
As foriyou, Mr. Anzai, although you used
the key to-go into the house, figuring that

388
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:56,758
it would:only serve as evidence if you have
it on:you, you decided to throw it away.

390
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,228
Why was the window cracked. then?

391
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:04,531
Of course it was just to make it
Iook .as if a robber had broken in.

393
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:08,935
There was no meaning for him
to leave the key back in the room,

395
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:11,204
so:he locked the door and left.

396
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:14,509
Amazing how you deduced that far.

397
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,845
Lease think back to where
Mr. Takehiko was lying on the floor...

399
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:22,450
It was night by the front door, wasn't it?
If the window had been cracked first,

401
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,586
even though Tlakehko
was in the living room,

403
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:29,457
he would've headed for
the study to check out what happened.

405
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:34,195
However he in fact, heard
someone come in from the front door...

407
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:40,468
He ran into you; Mr: Anzai
as yourcamerin, and was: Killed.

409
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,445
Phooey. did you find any
fingerprints on the key or what?

411
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:55,283
No, you must've wiped;,it off
before getting rid of it.

413
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:00,988
It deesn"t matter either way.
If you have no-evidence,

415
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:02,757
sorry. but I think I'm leaving.

416
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:05,493
Then: how about something like this. Ran,

417
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,228
can you take out the picture please.

418
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:07,929
Yes...

419
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,133
W. What is) it?

420
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:15,670
Looking for a mistake.
Will everyone here look very carefully.

422
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:20,608
The picture to the left is Mr. Anzai
before he goes into the restroom.

424
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:24,278
The picture to the right is
Mr Anzai when he comes out.

426
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:36,557
Agh! The key!

428
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:53,574
You have no way out at this point.
Admit your/shameful deeds.

430
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:01,749
When I was shown the
picture at a diving shop

432
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:03,050
used to frequent,
shivers. went through my spine.

434
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:06,520
I somehow: made it through back then,
but when I thought of the time

436
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:10,124
that Kaoru eventually finds me...
It was: just around that time...

438
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:17,899
Ugh! Damn, that Takehiko.
He can just drop dead for all I care...

440
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:22,670
Ugh, he can just drop dead...

441
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:33,114
How about it? What do you say
e commit exchange murders...?

443
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,650
Even if we do get caught,
we would have no motive,

445
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,185
and besides. we'll have a perfect alib...

446
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:42,757
Let me sleep on it.

447
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:45,159
I've gone as far as tell you this much,

448
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,795
I really don't want you
o refuse this offer...

450
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,833
- - He was not all for it to begin with,
but after I convinced him

452
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:56,820
that we would never be caught,
he decided to do it.

454
00:20:56,821 --> 00:21:00,207
So. you're the one who
talked him into this after all...

456
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,044
By:theiway, Shoichiro seems
to have repented after

458
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:06,079
realizing what a serious
crime he had committed

460
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:08,416
Brn sorry...

461
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:12,169
I don't know what's gotten over me.
Please forgive mel!

463
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,058
He was probably cornered to no end.

464
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:20,895
That:s-why he was conned
into going along with your plan.

466
00:21:20,896 --> 00:21:24,598
A disgusting crime. You're really
going to have to make amends
