No, wait! Call the hospital and
tell them we're bringing a patient in!

00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,979
Eh? But Inspector,

How embarrassing... he saved
me again .just like the last time

67
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,665
whenever I'm feeling depressed. he
seems to be able to see right through me

69
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:35,608
I hate to admit«it but,
It makes me happy...

71
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,543
Shinichi.

00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,430

the Statue of Liberty.

ca er ISS 1rery ougn...

82
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,786
For goodness sakes!
Why didn't you wake me up!

84
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,588
I was really looking forward
to seeing this night view

86
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,891
of the city from the Brooklyn Bridge!

87
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,161
And look, we're almost at
the end of the bridge already!

89
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,528
Listen you...

90
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,032
If you'd have slept in the
plane like everybody else

92
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,867
you wouldn't have
fallen asleep like you did!

94
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,237
How could I sleep after that last case?

95
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,638
I'm not like, some people.

96
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,474
Can fall fast asleep after
being satisfied they solved a case!

98
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,111
I wouldn't say I was completely satisfied.

99
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:50,716
When it comes to the reasoning
and analysis of crime

101
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,486
I don't think we can learn enough,
it would take a lifetime and

103
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:55,955
I still wouldn't know
everything there is to it, Watson

105
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,656
What?

106
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,491
Just listen to you two

107
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:05,564
this romantic view of the city would
charm every couple in the world,

109
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,832
are you two having a lover's spat?

110
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,534
How I envy you!

111
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,770
Mom, this is all your fault you know...

112
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,207
we weren't supposed to
arrive in New York until tomorrow

114
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,141
but the minute we arrived in Los Angeles,

115
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:19,011
you made us get on the
Iane to New York...

117
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,780
I didn't have a choice.
I wanted to see this musical

119
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,750
but I didn't think I could
get the tickets, but I did!

121
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,752
What? Did you say musical?

122
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,754
Yes. see, that one.

123
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:33,425
Good grief...

124
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,161
Golden Apple, I hear
It's very popular now...

126
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:42,868
That's right! Broadway's Phantom
Theater, 8pm. I'm so excited!

128
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,910
There sure seem to be a lot of police cars
on the road tonight. don't you think?

130
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:55,347
I guess they're after that slasher.

131
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,349
S. slasher?

132
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:04,590
I heard the slasher's Japanese and
he only goes after young women

134
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:11,030
You don't have to worry!
He only appears after midnight

136
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:15,401
you won't run into him as long as
we get back to the hotel by the besides

138
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,336
it isn't even 6 yet!

139
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,474
Don't you mean 7?
We're on daylight savings time now.

141
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:22,975
What?

142
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,881
Oh no! It slipped my mind completely!

143
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:33,585
Starting the first Sunday in April,
we set our clocks 1 hour ahead, don't we!

145
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,054
Oh no!

146
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,588
Why re you so upset?

147
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,125
It only takes about 40 minutes
to get from here to Broadway!

149
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,362
And it's still before 7,
we'll get there in plenty of time

151
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,500
You don't understand, I promised to meet
the person who got the tickets for me!

153
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,569
I'm supposed to get to
see the dressing rooms is

155
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,671
I get there 1 hour before
the curtain goes up.

157
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,607
I guess you're just going
to have to forget about it.

159
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,511
This so called "English Lady you bought
because you fell in love with it

161
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,880
will never get you there on time, mom.

162
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,187
Now you've done it. Shinichi

163
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:13,192
Ran. grit your teeth and hang on tight.

164
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,960
Okay...sure...

165
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,197
The people at the Jaguar
company put everything

167
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,799
Into this E type when they built it!

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,701
You can't be serious...

169
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,671
Never underestimate me!

170
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,666
Are you sure about this?

171
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,770
This car was in the
shop for repairs last month...

173
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,105
you just:got it back the other day!

174
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,510
Don't worry mechanic was a pro,
the car works like a dream!

176
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:10,048
The 267 horsepower
engine won at LeMans!

178
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,390
What are you doing!

179
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:25,029
That's enough! There're
police cars all around you know!

181
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:28,767
I don't care!
They were in the opposite lane.

183
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:34,139
While they're admiring this beauty of
a car, we'll disappear from sight

185
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,644
By the way will you and
Ran do that thing you always do?

187
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,915
It's pretty tricky up ahead. okay?

188
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,050
Will you do it for me?

189
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,753
Oh good grief...

190
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,188
Thanks!

191
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,425
I hate to ask but Ran,
can you come up here

193
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,161
Eh? Okay...what is it?

194
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,466
Don't worry, just trust me
it's only scary in the beginning

196
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,968
I guess so...

197
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:06,605
Are you okay?

198
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,478
What are you doing. Shinichi?

199
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,446
Just hang on tight.

200
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,137
See. it wasn't so bad.

201
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,275
Are you crazy, how can you say that!

202
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,021

Sh, Sharon. .what are you doing here?

245
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:12,090
The officer who was just
here. he's one of my fans

247
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,427
He and-!- started talking
while I was waiting for you,

249
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,895
then a police bulletin came in

250
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,367
about a silver Jaguar heading this way
travelling at a ridiculous speed

252
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,605
and I came up with this idea of disguising
myself as Captain Redwood!

254
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:32,778
You should be impressed!
This man's coat was pretty expensive.

256
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,050
I am impressed but are you sure it
was okay? Everyone's looking at us

258
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,153
Don't worry, it won't be a problem,

259
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,523
I told everybody we were filming a movie.

260
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,026
Oh Sharon. I just love you!

261
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:53,198
Hey, mom...explain
things to me... who is this lady?

263
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,635
You mean you don't know, Shinichi!
She's a famous American actress!

265
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,438
Like I was saying...

266
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,640
how can a famous actress.

267
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,942
Like her disguise herself
so well that nobody recoggnizes her!

269
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:07,012
Didn't I ever tell you the story?

270
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:12,918
When I was just starting out as
an actress, I got a role as a spy.

272
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,487
And to get into character

273
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:21,259
I signed up to study under a famous
magician to learn how to disguise myself

275
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:26,531
Sharon was also there since
she had gotten a similar role,

277
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,600
that's how we became friends!

278
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,104
Only thing is. I never got
to be as good as her

280
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,840
she can disguise herself perfectly!

281
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,443
Yeah, you were always fooling around

282
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,279
but you seemed to be playing dress up
instead of disguising yourself

284
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:47,986
Sorry I wasn't good enough for you!
But I was doing my best!

286
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:56,661
I'm so thrilled! I got to meet such a
famous person and in New York, no less!

288
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,297
I've got to thank God for this!

289
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,448
Does god really exist?

290
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,920
If God does actually exist...

291
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,023
then all the people who
are striving to survive

293
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,192
should be rewarded with
happiness, isn't that right?

295
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,463
Yes, at the very least...

296
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,866
no angel ever smiled down on me

297
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,169
not even once...

298
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:49,414
The sadness in her smile might have
been a premonition of things to come

300
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,517
of the tragedy that would soon follow

301
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,191
I didn't want to
remember it. that awful incident

303
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,132
Wh...what do you mean by that?

304
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,835
About no angel ever smiling on you?

305
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,605
She's trying to say she's had a hard time!
Isn't that right ..Sharon!

307
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,143
That's right, my life's been
one hardship after the other

309
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,013
I struggled to become an actress and on
the day my debut film was to be shown

311
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,249
my parents died in a fire...

312
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,586
thentthe day after I received the Oscar,
my husband died from an illness

314
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,592
then there's Chris who made her debut so
easily just because she was my daughter

316
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,395
everything was handed to her on a silver
plate, what a difference between us.

318
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,968
Don't exaggerate, I know you're proud of
her, you put everything into raising her.

320
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:48,573
That child, I don't
consider her my daughteranymore

322
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,341
What?

323
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,810
I don't know if you can believe this.

324
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,647
But she stood behind me while I was
putting flowers on my husband's grave

326
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:59,317
and she had disguised herself
to look exactly like him,

328
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,688
don't you think it was rather
sick to be considered a joke?

330
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,725
I just remembered what
you once told me

332
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,493
you said you taught her
how to disguise herself

334
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,562
because she begged you so much...

335
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:16,034
I haven't spoken to her since
it's been almost 10 years

337
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,971
and it seemed like she was hanging
around some shady characters

339
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,174
but enough about that, go park
your car in the parking lot

341
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,477
Iet's head for the dressing rooms.

342
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,749
I think those people have started to
realize there're no cameras around

344
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:36,154
But why did you want us
here an hour before the show starts?

346
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,722
We'd be less of a bother
for everybody if we came earlier

348
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:43,094
and we'd have had more
time to talk to the performers.

350
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,665
Don't be silly, if we came here earlier

351
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,767
the performers would still
be just regular people

353
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,969
but seeing them just
before the show starts

355
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,113
Why if it isn't Sharon!
You came to see us after all!

She analyzed a crime and

the criminal was arrested right away.

437
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:20,959
that's how she became so popular and
they nicknamed her Night Baroness.

It was apples sprayed with

474
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,618
there was a message inside, it was
