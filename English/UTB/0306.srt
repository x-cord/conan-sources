1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,437
Reduction flows withthe rhythm of the wind

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,405
Dark stains are rinsed clean and exposed

3
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:08,441
A real case at a Drama shoot

4
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:10,243
The murder weapon and suspect is nearby

5
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:13,980
A child in appearance
with the l.Q. of an adult

7
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,514
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

11
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:30,790
Us? r1
oy â‚¬aO

14
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,342
Pops was asked to act as substitute for

15
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,411
doing the opening commentary
of a detective story.

17
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,415
He runs into a childhood
friend of his, Ruri Ujo

19
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,818
who turned into a big name actress.

20
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,555
However...

21
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,156
Kyaaaah!

22
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,758
Ru, Rurippe?!

23
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,766
K.Kogoro .

24
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:20,172
(#527)
Invisible Suspect Part 2

26
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,316
D.Damn...

27
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,786
Oh, so you smoke, Kogoro.

28
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,722
Eah. You don't smoke. Ruripj

29
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,192
Oh did you forget? About my father...

30
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,527
Oh. right he was famous in the

31
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,396
neighborhood as ene
that hated smokers...

33
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,666
Right! Thanks to him, yr
I hate cigarettes too...

35
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,603
Oh. the same here!

36
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:53,272
But in my case,
my mother hated cigarettes...

38
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,475
So. my father who was a heavy smoker
says that

40
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:59,144
he was forced to quit
as soon as I was born...

42
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:04,216
But. what if you have to
smoke in dramas?

44
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,686
I just hold the cigarette
n my mouth at times like that...

46
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,356
Right, right, we push the
director and producerito do it our way!

48
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:14,894
That's why you can never be
any greater than you father!

50
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,228
K.Kasumi...

51
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:18,864
Well, I guess for Ms. Somebody
who was selling herself

53
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,766
as an actress with soothingeffects. phoo

54
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,834
Cough!

55
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:25,037
It was geod thatnot smoking
gave off a healthy image.though...

57
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,372
Phooey...

58
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,973
K.Kasumi...

59
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,643
What's with her anyway...

60
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,511
She's jealous...

61
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,914
of me because
I'm talking intimately with him...

63
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,117
Chuckle, I think she's cute, don't you?

64
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,718
I see.

65
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,954
Just like the victim
Mr. Kazami was saying,

67
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,691
It seems that they're going with
each other

69
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:51,030
Which means that the lover
he is secretly going out with is...

71
00:03:54,468 --> 00:04:00,372
Um. have you already figured out
who the killer is... Mr. Renown Detective?

73
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,775
N.No not yet...

74
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,643
Muuumlljlu 47

75
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:06,745
May I have a word with you...

76
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,380
Oh, sure...

77
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,584
Agh!

78
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,253
Conan, where are you going?

79
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,122
To the men's room!

80
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,257
Don't bother the police officers, okay!

81
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,391
Okay!

82
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,532
What is it...?

83
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,667
Just what are you up to?

84
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,002
Huh?

85
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,739
I'm asking you
why you're making passes at her!!

87
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,675
Oh...you mean?Rurippe?

88
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,412
I'm not making passes,
we're just childhood friends...

90
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,014
Are you sure that's all there 'is to it?

91
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:42,982
Huh

92
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:43,616
Huh

93
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,751
Is' that honestly true?

94
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,620
YY, Yes...

95
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,789
Okay then .4. If you do anything
funny, though,

97
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,492
I don't care if you're a-renown
detective or what, I won't forgive you...

99
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:58,564
Hey, hold it...l feel as if...

100
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,233
I've gone through
sometime in the past too...

102
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,970
If I'm not mistaken... it was...

103
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,775
Hey kid. what re you doing?!

104
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:14,313
But this toolbox was left here in
this room

106
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,516
together with the golf glove
and coat too, right?

108
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,186
That's why I figured maybe
there's something in here

110
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,389
besides a cutter knife that is
capable of slashing things!

112
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,524
Playing detective is okay,

113
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:30,062
but the police checked every
nook and cranny of this tool box.

115
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,397
Even this tape measure?

116
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,731
Yeah...

117
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:37,002
Hey. who is it? Who bamitted
in a crummy place like this?

119
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,939
Huh? What the "bamit mean?

120
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,608
It means to mark the floor with masking!

121
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,544
It's done to indicate
where the set is to be placed or

123
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,947
to determine the place
where the actor is to stand!

125
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,082
Well, I guess the shooting is
going to be called off...

127
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,150
But, I'll
remove this for now...

129
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,018
Wait!!

130
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,955
Something is
fishy about the masking tape...

132
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,692
It's a little bloated...
and something is stuck te the tip.

134
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,094
What is this?

135
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,296
A wire?

136
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,297
INNATE 2

138
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,437
I got it!I've figured
hat the murder*weapon is...

140
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,373
As well as why
we can't find it!!

142
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,445
The room where the coat
and the glove were is hear...

144
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,449
and the scene of the crime
Is diagonally beyond...

146
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,252
If from this room. the crime can
be carried out easily...

148
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,987
Al I need to figure out next, is who did this...

149
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,924
But, something bugs me...

150
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,860
about Ruri, who looks out the window
and invites everybody

152
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:38,330
to suddenly go outside and
Iook at the snow...

154
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,067
Huh? Agh, on no! Pops!!

155
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,673
T.That brat! Skittering around the scene
of the crime again!!

157
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,474
Hey!

158
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:50,609
Damnl!!

159
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,478
Where the hell is he?!

160
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,313
Heave, heave, heave...

161
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,215
Heave, heave, heave...

162
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,685
I get it now!!

163
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,888
Huh? Where is Inspector Yokomizo?

164
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,290
He just stepped out a while ago...

165
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:09,028
I see . By the way, do you guys smoke?

167
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,299
Oh. okay...

168
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:17,569
I'd like to see the evidence once more.
So will youplease lend me a glove?

170
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,773
Y.Yes sir...by all means...

171
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,044
Uh- this is the wallet
and this is the cigarette...

173
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,980
The coat and the glove...

174
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,581
and this is...

175
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,450
the victim's lighter...

176
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,323
Shoots-it's out of oil"H

177
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,992
I've figured out the mystery!

178
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,394
All I have to do now is
put Pops to sleep with

180
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,729
this anesthetic-gun

181
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,267
Huh? -Huhp Huh?
Can't use the gun...

183
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,538
O Oh! I used it
at the filming site a while ago...

185
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,441
Bummers! What now?

186
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,143
I can't use Sleeping Kogoro!

187
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,147
I've got no choice, but
to drop a lot of hints at Pops...

189
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,084
U,Uh, Pops!

190
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,355
There are many things that I've noticed,

191
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,223
will you lend me an ear?

192
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,693
Maybe I can help solve the case...

193
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:17,629
Phooey; ll don't need
anything like that anymore...

195
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,566
Huh? B.But.

196
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,570
D.Don't tell me Pops...
already figured the case out...

198
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,375
M. Mr. Mouri!! I looked all over for you!!!

199
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:30,976
Just where were you'd!

200
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,044
Well,

201
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,781
I was going around this building
Iooking for a key to this case...

203
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,183
And? Did you find the anything?

204
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,784
Did you solve the mystery
of the vanished murder weapon?!

206
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:44,590
Well, what a found was not the key,
but just this kid alone...

208
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,457
Just as I thought...

209
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,594
OO. Oh.

210
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,797
We'll continue to look
for the murder weapon then

212
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:54,466
so if you come up with anything...

213
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,601
Okay. I'll let you know right away!

214
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,936
Yes. please do by all means!

215
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:03,008
Agh~~=Only if I could
use the anesthetic gun...

217
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,776
Huh?

218
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,076
Huh

219
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,012
HHS facial expression changed...

220
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,817
Maybe Rope's figured out
the Killer after all.

222
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,522
Rurippe... I'd like to talk
to you for a minute

224
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:20,092
N No. she's not the killer!!

225
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,032
Damn,

226
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,901
I guess I've no choice but
to hit Pops on the head

228
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,502
with something and pass him out...

230
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,638
Uh, something to kick...

231
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,972
I wonder if there's something I kick...

232
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:34,773
Agh!

233
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,375
Huh? They locked the door...

234
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,210
H.Hey,

235
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,913
I can't go inside if you lock the door!!

236
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,183
Y what's up, Kogoro?
Hy lock the door...

238
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,853
000000

239
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:52,124
Don't tell me, Koggoro.
That you're going to seduce me?

241
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,594
Damn. I can't hear
what they're saying inside.

243
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,263
If I can at least get this wiretap inside

244
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,132
1Â° - 4-7
from the space beneath the door...

246
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,207
are you suspecting that I killed Mr. Kazama,

247
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,176
and going to try to persuade me
till I admit! committed the crime?

249
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,312
Yeah exactly...

250
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,049
I want you to confess on your own initiative.

251
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,086
Just as I thought!!
Pope's got it all wrong!!

253
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,289
I've go ate stop him. quick

254
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,297
I want you to confess
on your own initiative.

256
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:36,835
Just as I thought!
Pope's got it all wrong!!

258
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,437
I've got to step him. quick...

259
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,242
But, you're not the one
who's making the confession...

261
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,377
The one you're protecting

262
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,580
Mr. Nagumo is the one
who's confessing!!

264
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,983
Huh?

265
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,452
J.Just what are you
talking about, Kogoro?

267
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,923
Why would I have to
otect Mr Nagumo...

269
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,058
You saw, didn't you?

270
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,728
Just before seeing the snow
fall outside the window...

272
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,329
SS, See. what?

273
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,664
Back then,

274
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,332
the staff opened the door to the room

275
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,003
near the window and came out, right?

276
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,206
I'm sure you saw Mr. Nagumo
from the reflection on the glass door...

278
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,409
I'm sure you saw Mr. Nagumo
from the reflection on the glass door...

280
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,612
coming out from the room next door
where Mr. Kazami was taking a nap.

282
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,683
You saw the staff about to
come out of the room,

284
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:29,421
as well as the figure of the Killer
who rushed back into the room!!

286
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,489
Â¢ Â¢ ob

287
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,493
You saw how acted and sensed
that he did something, so

289
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,430
you invited everybody to go
Iook at the snow outside

291
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,099
and tried to get everybody
away from the room

293
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,637
I realized just a while ago that's
what happened.

295
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,374
When I found Conan by the doorway
of the room of the sceneof the crime

297
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,980
just before I turned the corner...

298
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,119
Just as would be expected
of a renown detective,

300
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,255
I'd like to say but...

301
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,123
you haven't found the murder
weapon yet, have you?

303
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:09,661
The knife that slashed Mr. Kazami
who was taking a nap...

305
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:14,199
Isn't it more important to figure out
the mystery of the missing knife

307
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,601
that has a blade about 10 centimeters

308
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,470
before you go around
making assumptions

310
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,339
about me having witnessed the killer?

311
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,741
Yeah...

312
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,745
We were all too concerned about
the blade being 10 centimeters long

314
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,215
because it's hard to believe that
the blade is a small clump of steel,

316
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,418
NO more than two 2 centimeters...

317
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,486
Huh?

318
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,422
A cutter knife...

319
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,626
After the killer killed Mr. Kazama,

320
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,896
the blade was folded compactly away
and hidden...

322
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:49,433
inside this lighter
that Mr Kazami had!

325
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,171
WwW. Wow! Pops got it right!

326
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,841
B.But, Kogoro,

327
00:12:55,842 --> 00:13:00,379
even if a blood smeared blade
were to be inside that lighter,

329
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,916
it makes no difference that the murder
weapon hasn't been found yet, does it?

331
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,319
A blade of 10 centimeters means that

332
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,056
the knife sunk that deeply into him, doesn't it?

333
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,457
Unless the blade is firmly attached to the handle,

334
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,594
it's impossible to poke
that deeply into something, and

336
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,797
I'm sure that blood would've splattered
on the handle too, right?

338
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:22,534
If so, a cutter with a handle

339
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,737
indicating luminol reaction
should've been found already!

341
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,207
Okay. Pops. slash back at her .

342
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,542
I guess so...

343
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,144
See?

344
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,478
Hey, hey

345
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,215
First of all, yourre going to have to
Iook for the handle of that cutter.

347
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,550
Oh boy...

348
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,020
Hey, Conan,
just what are you doing here?!

350
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,622
Oh, well...

351
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,257
right! Ran...

352
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,258
right! Ran...

353
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:47,893
Do you have something sticky like gum?

354
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:48,694
Huh?

356
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,897
Sticky like gum...masking tape?

358
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,231
I have some gum that

360
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,100
Dad wanted me to bring along
to keep him from getting sleepy...

363
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,036
Il seell

364
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:58,837
Masking tape!!

365
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,505
If you wrap the handle of the
cutter from the end of the blade

367
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,676
connected to the handle with
masking tape*then blood won't

369
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,379
splatter onto the handle!!

370
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,048
After committing the murder the
masking tape was removed

372
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,451
after the blood was wiped off,
and the tape was probably pasted

374
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,052
onto the floor of
he filming site or something .

376
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,988
There were masking tape
pasted all over the floor as

378
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:21,526
indicators there, so it would be
very inconspicuous too...

380
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,662
B.But...

381
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,598
But, why would Mr. Nagumo do
something like that?

383
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,869
Even I, the first one to find the body
could've rigged the trick too!!

385
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,271
I could've used snow to
move everyone away,

387
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,140
and committed the murder myself!!

388
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,610
BDÂ». Don't be ridiculous.
You could never kill somebody...

390
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,746
Damn. she sure is a tough one...

391
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,483
Sorry, Conan, it seems
that I left the gum in the car

393
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,885
Uh-um, Ran...

394
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,220
Huh

395
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,355
How do yon wear brassieres?

396
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,423
Wi at?

397
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,092
Iineverwsed them) so I donit
Know ho 7to us ) them!!!

399
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,431
Hey!! Boys don't have to
know Row to use them!!

401
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,032
1. guess so...

402
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:02,901
Rurippe...

403
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,036
you could never
have committed this crime...

405
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,439
WwW. Why not?

406
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,040
Okay then tell me!

407
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,511
How would you hide the blade
of a cutter. inside this lighter?

409
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,913
Il just put it inside the lid and...

410
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:21,319
There's nothing inside the lid.

411
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:26,391
T.Then your deduction
must've been wrong, Kogoro!

413
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,395
Maybe you're wrong about
Mr. Nagumo being the killer...

415
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,997
Rurippe...

416
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,132
In a lighter such asfthis,

417
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:38,136
you add oil to the cotton that is in here...

418
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,506
So. first you remove the bottom

419
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,176
and take out the cotton that is
inside and make space...

421
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,112
otherwise you cannot hide
the blade of the cutter...

423
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,116
Since I smoke. I realized
when the lighter didn't light.

425
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,518
That the cotton must've beenYFemoved...

426
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,323
But, since you don't like cigarettes and
have never used a lighter,

428
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,526
you would never even think of
hiding somethingin a place like this...

430
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,729
So. the only person that can
think of something like this.

432
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,200
As well as someone that you
would want to protect is...

434
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:11,670
Mr. Akira Nagumo. who used to
be a heavy smoker in the past...

436
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,140
T.That's:why I just said
a while ago, didn't I?!

438
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,343
Why would I have to
protect Mr. Nagumo?

440
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,546
WwW. Well, it's true that I've met
him sometimes at work,

442
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,682
but...I'm not all that intimate with him...

443
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,084
I wonder about that

444
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:27,953
He's your...

445
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,355
Lover, lover...

446
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,893
Because he's your real father?

447
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,829
Huh? Is that true?

449
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,901
Exhale-Nothing that was used
to commit the murder

451
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,371
murder seems to have been
prepared ahead of time.

453
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:50,375
It was probably something that
occurred on impulse...

455
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:54,112
As for the cotton with oil'on it,

456
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,781
he probably pasted masking
tape over it and hid it somewhere

458
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,917
on the floor of the filming site

459
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,319
but it would probably be easily
found if searched for...

461
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,688
Besides, after committing the murder,

462
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,692
it; would be impossible to
remove the cotton from the lighter

464
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,395
and putting the blades of the
cutter into it with gloved hands,

466
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,264
with the risk of somebody
walking in anytime...

468
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,268
So I'm sure that we'll be able to
find fingerprints somewhere...

470
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,072
So. before any evidence comes up...

471
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,941
persuade your father to turn himself in...

473
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:30,147
That's right, Kogoro...Akira
Nagumo is my real father

475
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,084
I was bern when my mother and he

476
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,754
used to be no-name
actors at an acting school...

478
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,690
My mother found out she was pregnant

479
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,358
only after she split with my
father and started going out

481
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,829
with my present father that you
know too. Kogoro

483
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,499
Fuh, fun...

484
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,168
It never even crossed my mind...

485
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,905
until we acted in a film together
and he mentioned that

487
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,308
I looked exactly like
his lover in the past...

489
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,045
After he heard of the truth from my mother,

490
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,382
I went to complain to him
because he called ask to see me...

492
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,585
I wasn't going to have him
saying that he was my father!

494
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,856
Then he broke down in tears before me...

495
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,928
So, I used to meet him now
and then from that time...

497
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,397
Fuh. fun...

498
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:23,335
A father is a father after all...

499
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:28,406
He killed Mr. Kazami for me...

500
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,876
if people found out that he's my
real father,

502
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,147
my whole family would turn out a mess...

503
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,418
That's why, you see that's why Kogoro...

504
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,621
I'd like you to keep this all inside you...

505
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,757
because after all.
We are childhood friends...

507
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,159
aren't we, Kogoro...Please...

508
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,163
No way...

509
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,765
Huh?

510
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:57,769
Being that you're the one asking me to do so

511
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,438
the more I can't accept the deal...

512
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:04,175
I don't want you,
my childhood friend to be bound

514
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,912
by suchza painful and sad lie
for the rest of your life...

516
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,582
00000

517
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,853
uh...Just as expected of you, Kogoro.

518
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,721
You haven't changed at all,
your Kind heart...

520
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,857
Shut up...

521
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,458
Well, I guess it can't be helped...

522
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,128
because he was the one who
called you and told you

524
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,262
that he was my real father
from his side...

526
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:26,865
No...

527
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,068
Mr. Nagumo said nothing of
that sort back then.

529
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:33,538
Huh? Then, how did you know
that we were father and daughter...?

531
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,809
I figured 'it.-out from
how Re acted back then.

533
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,780
The hostility I felt from him back
then was not of a man who was upset

535
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,016
over another guy making
passes at his lover,

537
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,118
but rather similar to what I felt

538
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,020
when I went to introduce myself
to Eris father

540
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,889
In other words,
the feelings of a worried father...

542
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,693
Oh boy, so it's Eri after all...

543
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,630
I can never out beat her...

544
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:02,634
Uh, no...not her. I remembered
er stubborn father and...

546
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:07,172
Hey. do you know why I was studying so hard

547
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:11,176
wearing those thick lens
glasses during jr. high school?

549
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,112
Elt's because I wanted to
attract someone's attention...

551
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,781
I was under the mistaken impression that
you liked smart girls.

553
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:17,449
Huh

554
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,383
Huh?

555
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,586
Thirty minutes later...

556
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,522
through Ruri's persuasion
turned himself in...

558
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:30,929
The actual detective drama
that occurred came to an end

Oh. so you met Run...

611
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,254
She was more beautiful than
she looks on TV wasnstsshe??

613
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:08,059
Yes, did you know mother, that
shes Run Uo. the actress 7?

615
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,932
Yes, of course, because unlike him,
I attend the class reunions...

617
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,203
Right, I heard-a-lot about.you
two from Ms. 01ml"

619
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:23,007
About Dad and you getting into
a big fight over shoyu or sauce...

621
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,278
He got me angry because he
used to always pour sauce over

623
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,948
his sunny side up too, but just
because he was embarrassed to

626
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,087
Oh. I see. .Come to think of it,

627
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,756
Dad always pours sauce
over his sunny side up...

629
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,493
He's that kind of a pee-wee...

630
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,964
Then, why'd you marry him?

631
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,166
It's been, so long ago,
that I've already forgotten.

633
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:53,438
Which 'gloves do you think are better?

634
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,908
Let's see...l like the black...

636
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,445
I prefer this gray one...

638
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:05,450
Because it's the gray color of a mouse.

639
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,920
Doesn't it make you feel warm?

640
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,521
Huh?

641
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:13,191
It's because the gay tablecloth
I0ooked warmer than

643
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:15,326
the black coat...

644
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,163

No. you didn't...
