1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,702
Friendship. Romance. Mystery

2
00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:05,671
Because we cherish them we can continue

3
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,790
Ran gets involvedyin a case at a
convenience store

5
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,441
A-pure deduction to save her friend

6
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,009
He sees through the one and only truth,

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,945
A child inrappearance.
With the I.Q. of an adult

9
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,147
no case is left unsolved
with Detective Conan.

11
00:01:54,814 --> 00:02:01,787
Convenience Store Trap Part 2

16
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,609
Who are you?

17
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,158
J.Jodie?! Jodie!

18
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,494
E you all right, Jodie...

19
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,363
Didg¢you come across
an idea or something?

21
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,498
You seemed to be in deep thought...

22
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,768
No idea... Not the slightest!

23
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,837
Huh? What's the matter?

24
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,841
Huh?! Oh...l saw you take off
your glasses for the first time so...

26
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,442
You know what I mean, don't you?
Yeah...

28
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,378
For the first time...?

29
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,714
But...those glasses
sure look old...

31
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:04,116
Oh, yes!

32
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,852
This is something I cherish...

33
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:12,457
The only vestige that a person very,
very important to me. left in this world

35
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,126
That's why it's so very important!

36
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,662
A very important person...?

37
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,400
Is.Is it a keepsake of your ex-lover
r something? Heh, heh...

39
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,737
By the way, did you two
figure out this case?

41
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,406
Not at allll...Hmm...

42
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,293
Huh?!

43
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,745
It stopped...

44
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,881
A delivery truck?

45
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,750
Right! The sales clerk

46
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:39,551
Huh...?

47
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,168
Huh... 27

48
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,221
Remember...

49
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,755
On the days that Aya is in charge,

50
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,626
even the boxes that arrive just before
closing are nicely organized, right...

52
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,429
Now that you mentioned it,
the sales clerk said so...So?

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,432
How does that connect
to what happened?

56
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:58,170
Uh?...
Grr 1 wonaocr now it connec.

59
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,905
Sigh...Ah .

60
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,506
I thought you had something in mind...

61
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,309
There!

62
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,047
Here are the items
you ordered!

64
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,766
Oh. you're early...

65
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,518
We'll stack the boxes up as usual in
the corridor.in front of the restroom...

67
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,189
Oh, a customer is still using
the restroom.. What should I do...

69
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,193
Oh...
We'll bring the boxes over again later.

71
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,930
We got otherplaces
to make deliveries to too

73
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:25,864
Thank you

74
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,867
Since a customer as
using the restroom...

76
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,019
The boxes cannot be placed
in front of the restroom...

78
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,355
If the boxes are placed there,

79
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,607
the customer cannot
come out of the restroom...

81
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:38,810
We'll be back! later then!

82
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,146
Thank you, see: ou later!

83
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,615
On the days that Aya is in charge,

84
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,951
the boxes in front of the restroom
re nicely organized...

86
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,094
Uh, what was it?
That famous dialog by Holmes...

88
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,028
Huh...?

89
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,633
Shinichi usedlto remark haughtily:...

90
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,836
When you have eliminated
the impossible. .then, this and that...

92
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,173
When you have eliminated
the impossible...

94
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,845
When-you have eliminated
the impossible.

96
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,997
Whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth

98
00:05:14,998 --> 00:05:15,998
remains,
whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth

101
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,532
remains
improbable,
whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth

105
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,184
remains
improbable,
e truth
whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth

110
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,323
When you have eliminated
the impossible,

112
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,591
whatever remains,
however improbable...

114
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,460
ust be the truth...

115
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,864
When you have eliminated
the impossible,

117
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,334
whatever remains,
however improbable...

119
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,868
mustibe the truth...!

120
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,004
This dialog?

121
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,208
What, what?! Don't tell me Ran,
that you came across something?

123
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,609
H, not really...

124
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,145
Ah...stop bringing
my hopes up again...

126
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:52,417
I think I got it. I feel like I got it...

127
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,520
but I wonder if my deduction...
is correct...?

129
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,866
It's already 21:00,
I'll have tc¥Oall mother

131
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,668
The customers are decreasing.

132
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:10,535
Yes...

133
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,008
Aya!

134
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,143
$.Shop keeper...

135
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,813
SO. are you ready to confess?

136
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,549
B.But. really haven't done anything...

137
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,753
It seems have no choice
but to call the police!

139
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,754
OO. Oh mo...

140
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:34,426
WwW. What... shall I deo.
I could telllthem about my deduction...

142
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,963
But what if I'm wrong...
What. if I'm off the point...?

144
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,967
Then, I may be getting Aya
Into more trouble than helping her...

146
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,569
What shall') dos .What shall I do...

147
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:51,510
What would he do at a time like this.
What? ¥ ould he do...What would he do.

150
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,458
C. Caller unidentified?!

151
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,595
H.Hello?

152
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,331
Yon. Ran...

153
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,400
How re you doing. 5?

154
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,670
Shi...

155
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,891
Sorry, Ran...
I don't have anything to really say but,

157
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,610
there was a little something
I wanted to ask you...

159
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,378
S,Shinichu...

160
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:26,912
Huh...?

161
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,354
Huh? What? Is it from Shinichi?

162
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,289
Y.Yeah...

163
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,624
Hey, what's up?

164
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,627
U.Uh...my friend's
in a tight situation right now...

166
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,162
You know her too Shinichi,

167
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,431
Aya, who was our classmate
in intermediate school...

169
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,366
Yeah...you mean Nanakawa

170
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,635
For some reason

171
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,038
things disappear at the convenience
store where she:works:

173
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,172
and it happens only on the days

174
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,175
thatvAya is in charge of cleaning
and closing the store...

176
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,513
So, the shop keeper suspects
that Aya is stealing the things

178
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,450
and says that he will call the police
unless she confesses...

180
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,186
There aren't any customers
on the surveillance camera

182
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,387
that are shown stealing either.

183
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,556
The shop keeper insists
that there is no one but Aya

185
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:15,961
he was watching the store after it
closed, but things disappeared after all

187
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,180
And? What kinds of things
have disappeared?

189
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,168
Game softwares, CDs, DVDs,
drinks, lunch boxes and candies...

191
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,704
According to Aya, she thinks that

192
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,640
there are three suspicious people
among the customers...

194
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,443
h...what kind of people are they?
Those three?

196
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:35,313
One of them is a man.that looks
to be a university student

198
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,182
who reads gameimagazine
till near closing time...

200
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:40,452
He bought some cup.noodles
and pouched«food...

202
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,723
The second one is
a timid office worker type of man

204
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,526
who always lets others go through
the register or use the restroom

206
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,863
He bought a toothbrush set. a shaver.
Batteries and a towel...

208
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:55,400
The third one rs a stubborn old lady
who asks for discounts

210
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,002
on lunches are near
shelf life expiration...»

212
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,803
She seems toghave bought nothing
tithe store...

214
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:00,755
I see...yeah...And... 42

215
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:01,255
I see... yeah...And...?

216
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:01,590
I see... yeah...And...?

217
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,007
I see...yeah...And...?

218
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,943
What all the three of them
have in common is

220
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,412
that they frequently come
to use the restroom at this store...

222
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,080
A month ago,

223
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,750
when Aya was scolded in front of
the restroom by the shop keeper,

225
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,686
things stopped disappearing
just likesthat.

227
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,087
Then, last night,
a month after the incident,

229
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,690
again on the night when Aya was
in charge, things disappeared...

231
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,694
ee...which means it's only natur
that Nanakawa is suspected...

233
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,697
WwW. Wait! Don't talk like
it's somebody else's problem!

235
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,966
And?
There's something else, isn't there?

237
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:28,300
Huh...?

238
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,902
Something that only-Nanakawa
does on the days

240
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,305
that she is in-charge
that nobody else does...

242
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,639
Oh, yes...

243
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,909
The other employees leave the boxes
that arrive just before closing time

245
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,447
stacked up in the corridor in front of
I the restroom. and go home but,

247
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,517
Aya organizes: the boxes
neatly before closing the store...

249
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:49,187
Since the surveillance cameras
are working all this time,

251
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,323
it should be easy to preve
Aya's innocence

253
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,993
but the shop keeper seems to turn off
the switch of the surveillance camera

255
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,860
after operating hours...

256
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:01,533
Uh... weren't the lunches-that were
stolen all near shelf life expiration?

258
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,069
Huh? How do you know?

259
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,270
Just as I thought...

260
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,340
The culprit...is-probably
a pretty nice person...

262
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,076
Huh?!" W.What? You
know who the culprit is?

264
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,810
Huh /!

265
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,212
Yeah...the culprit isfprobably...

266
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,480
WwW. Wait, Shinichi!!

267
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,548
Huh

268
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,685
1.1 sort of came up with
my own deduction...

270
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,553
So. will you hear me out
without laughing...?

272
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,689
Go ahead...

273
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,391
000000

274
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,331
Let me hear your deduction. .:!!

275
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,906
So, that's my deduction...

276
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,377
I took everything into consideration,
and although it's hard to believe,

278
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:50,248
I came to the conclusion that
it's not shoplifting. a thief, or Aya...

280
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:51,082
Well? Am I right...

281
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,450
Well? Am I right...

282
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,021
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

283
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:58,790
H.Hey! I told you not to laugh?!

284
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,592
Oh, sorry...

285
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,861
it's not your deduction I'm laughing at...

286
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,197
I mean I couldn't help imagining
you looking all troubled

288
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,733
after having deduced the situation
S much as you have...

290
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,467
Huh?

291
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,537
Then are you saying-I'm right?
Is my deduction correct?!

293
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,472
I wonder...

294
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,341
Just what do you mean by that?

295
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,209
Pon't be mean and tell.me!

296
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:23,948
I'm not an over confident detective
Iike somebody somewhere, you know!

298
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,150
Dont be silly

299
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:29,553
A detective is only human,
and not some almighty god...

301
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,955
Huh 2!

302
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,492
When a detective reveals
his deductions,

304
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,062
chances are that he carries
doubts somewhere in his heart...

306
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,900
Like...maybe, I left some detail out
or overlooked something...

308
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,303
That's why when your deduction
hits the bull's eye,

310
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,438
you feel more joy than anyone ever will!

311
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,076
I'm just thinking that I don't want to
take the best part away from you, Ran

313
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,044
Shinichi.

314
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:58,483
He's putting on airs like he always
does...that hubby of yours...

316
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,119
If you think your deduction is correct,

317
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,885
try it out...

318
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:02,220
try it out...

319
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:02,754
T,Try it out?

320
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,055
T,Try it out?

323
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:07,192
You know? Come on, Ran...

324
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:11,162
there's a simple way to drag
the culprit out before everybody...

326
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,932
Drag the culprit out...?

327
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,868
If you were the culprit Ran,

328
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,437
what situation would
ou hate to be in...

330
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,773
If I were the culprit...

331
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,582
R.Ran?!

332
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:32,517
R.Ran...

333
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:33,485
R. Ran.

334
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,022
May I help you. 7?

336
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,096
Excuse me...

337
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:45,697
Py La,

340
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,266
( ad <<
ket me...borrow your restroom!

342
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,001
Y.Yeah...

343
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,439
R.Ran...7

346
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,359
Shinichi...

347
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,596
WwW. Wheres Ran?

348
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,698
1. The restroom...

349
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,134
Huh? T,The restroom?

351
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,775
Quick everybody!!

352
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,777
You'd better hurry,
or you'll burn to death!!

354
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:33,344
H.Hey!!

355
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,412
Hey!

356
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,847
You'd better cut it out

357
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,682
or I'll file charges against
you for interfering with business...

359
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,249
Huh?!

360
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,187
U-Uh.:. listen, here...

361
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,889
What on earth's on your mind...

364
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,327
1,Huh...

365
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,062
Huh

366
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:57,735
7?" What!

367
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:13,818
Yes!

368
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,921
N.No

369
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:22,961
AM ooooO WA oR

370
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,730
What's with him...
What's up...?

372
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,366
So. it was you after all...

373
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:29,033
What...?

374
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,819
Timid, office worker type customer?

375
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,505
Don't tell me it was him...?

376
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,207
Yes, it's him!

377
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,178
He's the one who's been stealing
stuff night after night

379
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,314
from this store and giving
Aya bad time!!

382
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,485
Night after night but I was in front of
the store watching last night too

384
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,822
But, I didn't see him sneak into the shop...

385
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,191
Of course. you didn't...

386
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:57,729
Because he was living in the Attic of
your store all this-tirely

389
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,266
I can't believe it...

390
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,868
It may be hard to believe

391
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,436
but this is the truth...

392
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,640
He, after Aya closed the store...

393
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,709
came out of the attic through the
restroom and sneaked inte the store

395
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,480
taking drinks and tons of food,
and was making a living!

397
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:20,218
B.But Aya is in charge only
2 or..3 days a week and not everyday.

399
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,622
If he steals a lot at one time,
he can probably last 2 to 3 days...

401
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,627
Then, why were games
and CDs also being stolen?

403
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,830
I think he was probably
taking them out of the store occasionally

405
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,166
and selling.them off fer cash...

406
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,269
He'd have to go get a hair cut as well
as go to take a bath at the times,

408
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,872
otherwise his hair would grow long
and he'd be smelly,

410
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,041
which would force him to stay
in the attic keeping him

412
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,275
from coming out forever...

413
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,412
But, can he come in
and out of that restroom

416
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,215
without the customers or
the employees noticing him?

420
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,618
If he suddenly comes out
of the restroom

422
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,219
or goes inside and doesn't come out,

424
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,088
he'll be suspected rightiaway...

425
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:00,792
No problem!
If he's hesitant and careful...

427
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,362
Because, if he keeps
Ietting people go before him

429
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,798
and keeps standing at the end of the line

430
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,334
Nobody would notice
him going into the restroom.

432
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,102
SO he wouldn't have to come back out,

433
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:11,869
right?

434
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,004
Oh, I see...

435
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,975
If he comes down
from the attic to the restroom

437
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,310
just before it starts getting crowded

438
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,211
and comes out of the restroom

439
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,613
after it gets crowded and goes
into the store among the other customers;

441
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,416
he wouldn't risk being suspected.

442
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,385
If he'd been living in the attic for a while,

443
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,354
he would probably have had an idea of
when it would start getting crowded...

445
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,274
Besides, if the restroom
starts-getting crowded.

447
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,943
SO woulds=thesstore, so the employees
wouldn't possibly be able to

449
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,695
rememberwho came into the store
and who went out. right?

451
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:42,700
Then the toothbrush set. batteries
and shaver that he bought...

453
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:43,701
The batteries

454
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,571
he usedifor the flashlight he used when
Iooking for stuff after the store closed!

456
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,977
All the other stuff he took
to make himself look decent!

458
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,613
Besides, there's a
mirror in the restroom too!

461
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,417
Shop keeper! It's just as she says!

462
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,719
The board of the ceiling
of the restroom is removed!

465
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,888
What~~~71

466
00:17:04,455 --> 00:17:07,191
Which mean he was hiding
in the attic all this time, after all...

468
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,361
Wha?!

469
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,096
This place is a trash dump,

470
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:12,897
shop keeper!

471
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,265
Incredible!

472
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:16,034
Oh mygod...

473
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,171
ut, why did he do it only on the days
that Aya was in charge...

475
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,007
That's because Aya is a diligent worker!

476
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:23,508
Huh

477
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,694
The cardboard boxes with items
in them that are left out on the corridor

479
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,380
The other employees would leave
the boxes stacked,

481
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,216
in other words, the restroom door was
blocked. so he couldn't come out.

483
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,653
But, Aya would organize.them and
move them: to both sides of the corridor

485
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,540
making it possible for him to come out
of the restroom and go into the store!

487
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,925
But, Ran...

488
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,228
the boxes can be moved over
with just a slight shove, can't they?

490
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,030
Exactly .

492
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,933
That's one thing I can't make out...

493
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,535
H. Hey...

494
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,838
Maybe he could've gone through
the corridor if he moved the boxes...

496
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,875
But if the employees:find out that the
boxes have been moved even slightly,

498
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,962
they:might find out
that the culprit walked through

502
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:01,779
the corridor and get suspicious

503
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,029
Iid:
the corridor and get suspicious

505
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,280
83d:
the corridor and get suspicious

507
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:02,530
fink \
the corridor and get suspicious

510
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,030
They would suspect the restroom

512
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,365
They would suspect the restroom

513
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,983
fink \
that he's hiding in the
attic may be discovered...

516
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,854
Since he was afraid of this happening.
He couldn't make any moves...

518
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,689
That's the story!

519
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,589
Right!

520
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,492
I see...

521
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,861
But. I still don't understand...

522
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:17,428
Huh?

523
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,199
Why did he stop stealing for a month?

524
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,068
Well, it may be that he was working
things out with the cash he got

526
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,486
from.selling off the games and all,

527
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,738
but if he didn't stop at that timing

528
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,108
I wouldn't have suspected-Aya
as much as I did...

530
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,810
The culprit...is probably
pretty nice person...

532
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,815
T.That's probably because
he's a pretty good person...

534
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,151
That is, he heard Aya being scolded

535
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,986
because of what he did from the attic

536
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,689
and that's whyyhe probably decided
not to steal for a while...

538
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,156
I~~~seel

539
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:47,791
That s'the story

541
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,028
He stole only the lunches
that were near the expiration date

544
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,298
because he wanted losses
to the store to be as little as possible...

546
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,335
But...stealing is stealing!!

548
00:18:59,021 --> 00:19:00,838
How dare you make
Aya go through something like this...

550
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,306
R.Ran?! Hey...

551
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:07,845
I could never forgive anyone
who did something like this to Aya!!

553
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,147
Uuudgh.

554
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:10,647
I'm s& sorry!

555
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,683
I'm so sorry!!

556
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,284
Huh...?

557
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:13,584
Huh...?

558
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,685
Three.months ago...

559
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,556
I was fired from my company
and evictedifrom my apartment.

561
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,659
I walked into this store
feeling faint from hunger...

563
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,362
But...I'didn't have money
to buy anything...

565
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,832
The lights were turned off while I was
in the restroom at a loss what to do...

567
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,333
Even if I wanted to go out,

568
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,152
the doors were locked
nd I couldn't go out...

570
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,173
Once my eyes got used to the dark

571
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,875
the thing that came bursting into
my eyes was the stack of food...!

573
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,178
And, that's why you stole
things from our store...

575
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:40,945
VOoOO...

576
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,581
I figured since there was so much.
Taking just a little wouldn't hurt...

578
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,283
You've gotta be kidding!

579
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,085
How much do you think we have to sell

580
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,521
In order to regain the amount
you stole from us!!

582
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,456
I'm really sorry

583
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,093
Either way, you're going to pay us
back for all the loss you cost us!

585
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,431
E Even if I wanted to pay you back,
I don't have a cent...

587
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,166
You're going to work here...

588
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:06,437
Although you'll have to work
for free for a while to start with...

590
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,973
Y.You're willing to hire me?!

591
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,909
After all the trouble I caused you?!

592
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,379
I quit being an office worker
and started working here,

594
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,281
so I sort of understand how you feel!

595
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,317
