00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:03,569
Even destiny serves
as a clue to deduction

3
00:00:03,871 --> 00:00:05,671
and the light of truth pierces
through the most mysterious case.

5
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,506
Misunderstanding and
compassion as a storm clears the air,

7
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,275
today's incident helps strengthen
the bond of friendship.

00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,210
He sees through the one and only truth

10
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,912
A child in appearance
with the IQ. of an adult,

12
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,281
no case is left unsolved

43
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:22,507
But Kaoru, while taking a bath,
Is attacked by someone

45
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:34,920
The Secret of Pop Stars Part ill

46
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,692
But before that

47
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,161
aren't you forgetting something?

48
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,262
Huns

49
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:44,897
The deadly weapon...

50
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,200
the knife that was used
to cut Kaoru's throat

52
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,771
If it is found in our belongings or indoors,
it means that the criminal ls among us...

54
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,406
Otherwise, the criminal
came from outside...

56
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,241
But it's very unlikely, because
after committing the murder,

58
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,710
a criminal from outside
wouldn't hide the weapon

60
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,578
somewhere in this condo at the risk
of being witnessed by one of us.

62
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,680
Even though the criminal wiped
the blood from the knife,

64
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:05,117
and hemoglobin of the blood
Is invisible to the naked eye...

66
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,253
Iuminol solution can detect

67
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,188
the small amount of hemoglobin
In the blood that has been removed.

69
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,324
It's not something
you can hide after all, right?

71
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,560
You're right...

72
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,701
You know very well...

73
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,373
I'm hooked on detective
novels thanks to someone...

75
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,811
Ok, Takagi, you body check Mr. Kenzaki

76
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,947
and you police women
search those ladies...

78
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,683
The rest of you split up to
search for the weapon!!

80
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,150
Yes, sir!

81
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,119
But Inspector,

82
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,189
if Mr. Makuma, who is
accompanying her to the hospital,

84
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,958
were the murderer,
the weapon would already...

86
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,827
Shoot!

87
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,828
You don't have to worry about it...

88
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:54,800
I asked the paramedics to call here
if he were to act strangely...

90
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,869
You, you're a good boy!

91
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,341
Next, Ms. Takeno, please...

92
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,809
Ah, yes...

93
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,915
Hey, was Ms Takeno a regular
on Detective, Samonji"?

95
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,883
Yeah...

96
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,750
She played a role

97
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,786
of an annoying journalist
who followed Detective Samonj.

99
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,257
But she canceled her appearance on
the drama because of her father's illness,

101
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,859
so her role went to Kaoru...Actually,

102
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,195
Terumi's name first came up for the role,

103
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,133
but thanks to Mr. Maguma's push,
Kaoru got the role.

105
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:32,138
A little while ago,
she called Mr. Maguma a loser...

107
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,207
Mr. Makuma was also a would-be actor

108
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,409
and he belonged to
the same studio as us...

110
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:43,015
But he gave up his dream early on
and became her manager.

112
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,885
Nonetheless,

113
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,686
and contrary to what she said before,

114
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,489
Kaoru thought highly of him and
expressed her regret over his decision,

116
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,293
saying he gave up too soon,
he just doesn't have courage

118
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:55,995
Hmm...

119
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,764
-_- -—
I OTC.

121
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,100
That no weapon was found...

122
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:03,235
No...

123
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,739
We couldn't find it anywhere, the room,
the drain pipe, or their belongings.

125
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,509
Did you check their
fashion accessories too?

127
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:11,677
1 To...

128
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,047
Ms. Takeno's false nails
and Ms. Hoshino's earrings.

130
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,751
We even checked Mr. Kenzaki's choker

131
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,388
but there was no luminol reaction.

132
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,890
About Mr. Ma uma oin to the hos ital?

133
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,391
Investigator said that

134
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:31,129
that he had looked into
Mr. Maguma's glasses but no results.

136
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,266
And until our detectives
got to the hospital,

138
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,669
he was sitting depressed
and gloomy on the chair.

140
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,137
I thunk it is very unlikely that

141
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,972
he would try to get rid of
the weapon In question...

143
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,140
Umm...

144
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,611
So, it appears that the criminal
took the weapon outside. then.

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,281
We're driven back to the theory that
it was done by someone from outside.

148
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,150
No, maybe not...

149
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:56,455
The culprit wouldn't have known
that Ms. Kusano was taking a bath.

151
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,358
So, who would dare to
commit a bold crime like that...

153
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,826
It would be too daring and too risky

154
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,861
if the stranger just
walked inside and tried to kill her.

156
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,963
I think it was an inside job,

157
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,498
and the weapon must
be hidden somewhere

159
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,300
in this apartment right now...

160
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,302
But where is the weapon?

161
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:13,072
Inspector!

162
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,475
There's a bugging device in
a stuffed animal in her bedroom!

164
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,344
What!?

165
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,347
And there re signs of

166
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,148
someone having
ummaged in the drawers

168
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,455
So, the criminal had known from the
outside that Ms. Kusano was engaged,

170
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,292
or even that she was in the bathroom.

171
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:36,095
If the perpetrator is her fanatic fan,

172
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,696
it would be possible that

173
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,365
the culprit aggressively
attacked Ms. Kusano

175
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,834
and took something away
to remember her by.

177
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,436
Then call her office immediately,

178
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,640
and ask if she had
a stalker-like fan like that.

180
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,807
Yes, Sir.

181
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,684
This is the bedroom...

182
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,819
That is the drawer
they were talking about...

184
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,324
This is the drawer that was searched...

185
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,625
There are some pen and scissors...

186
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,462
This is the drawer of clothes
and accessories

188
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,398
mm... This has been lef auntouched...

189
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:13,465
HUM Pi a.

190
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:20,706
This picture

191
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,142
Hey!

192
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,980
Don't do that!... You're violating privacy...

193
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,615
I'm sorry...

194
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,788
Girls have secrets that they don't want
anyone to know about.

196
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,692
Even though sometimes it could be
foolish to keep a secret.

198
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,098
That picture, put it back in
the drawer at the lower left

200
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,335
She will be troubled if she can't find it.

201
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,870
Oh, yeah...

202
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:58,043
OK, Into the drawer...at the lower left...

203
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:01,213
KEN - 75» /

205
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,015
Tihates why...

208
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:09,688
I've solved the mystery about
the weapon used by the criminal...

210
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,593
Now how would the culprit
try to erase the evidence!!

212
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,764
Anyway...

213
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,034
as long as the murder
weapon isn't found indoors,

215
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:26,138
the crime may have been committed
by someone from outside.

217
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,842
Maybe this was
the work of an obsessed fan...

219
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:30,876
Yieah .

220
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,379
Now all we can do is hope
and pray that Ms. Kusano,

222
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,347
who was taken to the hospital

223
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:40,319
gets better...She may have
at least seen the criminal...

225
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,606
He. .Hello...Oh, yes...
I'm a friend of Ms. Kusano

227
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,308
Yes...

228
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,714
H Kaoru...

229
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:11,984
Yo.,Yoko?

230
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,952
What's wrong?
It's from the hospital, isn't it?

232
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,622
WwW, W Wait!

233
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,457
Don't tell me that Kaoru...

234
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:21,894
Don't worry!
The operation has been a great success!

236
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:25,029
They said she will come
to in a few hours!

238
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,731
Oh, that's great!

239
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,933
Thank goodness!

240
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:32,504
Then you had better go to her now,
Mr. Kenzaki...

242
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,606
She needs you, her future husband...

243
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,874
Yeah...

244
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,210
But, Is it okay because

245
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:42,281
I heard that hospital is being thronged
by journalists who smelt trouble...

247
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,817
So, I'll go later.

248
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,351
I don't want to cause trouble
to other patients at the hospital,

250
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,354
and I don't want this to be blown

251
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,190
all out of proportion
by the media with misinterpretations .

253
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,356
Misinterpretations?

254
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:55,494
Now why don't you tell everyone else?

255
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,061
Eh...

256
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,431
The real reason for
this engagement party...

258
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,501
The real reason?

259
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,369
Oh well, that...umm...

260
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,640
ell, actually... well...

261
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,368
That's too bad...

262
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,537
Things didn't go as planned.

264
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,106
as it"you?

265
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,611
The criminal who slashed
at her throat in the bathroom...

267
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,980
Hey, kid...

268
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,816
I'm sorry to say this,
you are acting like a detective,

270
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,251
but there's no weapon here...

271
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:55,521
That deadly dammed thing
that cut her throat!

273
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:57,956
Listen, kid.

274
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,959
The police searched everywhere
in this room but found nothing,

276
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,295
and I didn't have it on me either...

277
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:09,167
If you insist that I'm the one,
tell me where the weapon is ?

279
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,869
I don't know where it is now,

280
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,772
but I can tell you
what it is! It's something long,

282
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,576
attached to the tip of your finger!

283
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,013
Oh, you mean these fake nails?

284
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:26,218
1111 S0Ity... 11He police
have already checked these nails but...

286
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,887
No, the fake nails are a camouflage!

287
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:29,488
Huh?

288
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,492
It's the thing that you're hiding
under your fake nails.

290
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:37,262
It's very hard, second only to teeth,

291
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,932
and can be used as a weapon
to slit the opponent's throat...

293
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,269
Your real nails that
are as sharp as a fine knife!

295
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,875
You probably used the thumbnail
of your right hand as a weapon

297
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:54,046
because it is the thickest
and easiest to use.

299
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,517
Before the crime you put
the fake nail on your thumb nail

301
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,486
And you used your real nail as a weapon.

302
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,455
And you cut off the bloody nail afterward.

303
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,757
Then you again
put the fake nail back on...

305
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,463
No one would think that
you had a long nail on your thumb

307
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,334
So that's why you used
the work glove with holes, right?

309
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,337
You let only the thumb nail
out of the glove,

311
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,106
and covered yourself with the rain jacket,

312
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,042
to avoid getting your clothes stained
by the blood of the victim.

314
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,245
The only reason blood
was dripped on the floor,

316
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,114
the rain jacket was thrown out
dripped on the floor,

318
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,149
and the gloves were outside
the entrance door is...

320
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,052
in order to make it look like
the work of an outsider...

322
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:39,224
The work of the stalker you made up!

323
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,827
Yuki... And you're also the one
who left the strange notes

325
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,963
behind the door and
also sent the stuffed toy

327
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,832
with a bugging device, right?

328
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,104
Oh, I'm sorry

329
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:52,971
Oh, I'm sorry...

330
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,109
well... That's right,
The weapon was a fingernail.

332
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,945
But if so,

333
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,716
there should be some tool
to cut the nail here somewhere

335
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,752
So, that's why you were in the drawer

336
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,922
where there were some pens
and a pair of scissors...

338
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,292
because you just wanted
to get her nail clipper...

340
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,063
But unfortunately,
there was no nail clipper...

342
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,967
Perhaps, Ms. Kusano shaped and trimmed

343
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,370
her finger and toe nails with
a nail file before her nails grew long.

345
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,505
Well,

346
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,808
if I'm the murderer, I could just
have cut off the nail with scissors...

348
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,909
No, you wouldn't

349
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,645
because you knew that

350
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,814
the police would first notice the scissors
that is capable of slashing the throat.

352
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,619
If you cut off your blood stained nail,
they would soon find out...

354
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,354
On the other hand,

355
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,690
you thought a nail clipper
wouldn't be checked by the police...

357
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,693
But, you didn't bring one because

358
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:50,996
you didn't want
to have such evidence on you.

360
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,765
And moreover,

361
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,601
because you knew all personal items
belonging to the suspects

363
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,903
would be checked closely.

365
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,211
Tell me...how I cut my nail not
being able to find a nail clipper?

367
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:08,113
I have already told you...

368
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:11,082
your nail is very hard only second to...

369
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:13,652
your teeth...

370
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,989
After biting the nail into bits,

371
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,858
you drained it down the sink somewhere

372
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,030
Doing so, even if bits
of the nail are found,

374
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,566
they wouldnat look like a weapon.

375
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,603
I have PROOF that you did that!

376
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:36,241
Look! Your lipstick mark on the card.

377
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,744
I didn't think much of it at the time

378
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,146
but as time went on,
a part of it turned brownish...

380
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,249
If this is Ms. Kusano's blood that
got on your nail at theltime of the crime,

382
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,985
and that smeared on to your lips
when you bit off the nail...

384
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,488
This is concrete evidence that...

385
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:56,328
W, without it,
she will attest the truth of all...

387
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,700
that I called her from outside
when she was taking a bath

389
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,773
and that I made her sniff something
when she went out of the bathroom.

391
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,741
WwW: what!

392
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,245
Did she drink something before
I came in here?

394
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,284
I love..um...ll loved him...l

395
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:24,923
Ioved Mr Kenzaki...
ever since we performed together.

397
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,197
But both my role and Kenzaki
were taken away from me by Kaoru...

399
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,133
No, you're wrong .

400
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,739
So when I said Congratulations
and you know what she said?

402
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,642
It's just a gimmick,

403
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:48,847
a gimmick to make a topic out of it.
See, he's kinda cute, it's good enough...

405
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,550
It surprised me...

406
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,854
that my jealousy drove
me to commit the crime...

408
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,558
Fatal misunderstanding!

409
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,196
The real reason why Kaoru
got engaged with Mr Kenzaki is...

411
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,898
How stupid I am!

412
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,135
If I only cut a little deeper...

413
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,440
but when I saw her face...
I couldn't kill her.

415
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,310
I couldn't do it...

416
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,278
he ls my friend...

417
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,449
I'm glad that Kaoru...
didn't die...really...

419
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,188
What, what did she drink?

420
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,158
Her face is pale,
breaking into cold sweat

422
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,962
pulse racing, and hands shaking...

423
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,298
aving jitters...

424
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:46,571
My dad often goes to see a doctor
at the hospital because of his diabetes...

426
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,808
Hypoglycemiants

427
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,911
Medicine for people with diabetes

428
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,980
if a normal person takes it,

429
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,581
their blood sugar level will drop too low

430
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,717
and so the pill is very likely to be fatal!!

431
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:02,120
If she had prepared it in advance

432
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,357
she may have been planning
to kill herself all along!!

434
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:07,425
Gotcha!

435
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,262
I won't let you die!

436
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,432
Just because of a misunderstanding...
hat's too sad...

438
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,233
I will not let you die!!

439
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,040
Kaoru...

440
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,608
I'm sorry...Kaoru

441
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,012
I'm so sorry

442
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,048
Kaoru...

443
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,487
Ka, Kaoru...

444
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,789
Are you awake yet?

445
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,325
Where am I?

446
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,559
Haido hospital...

447
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,862
You have been sleeping
for two whole days now!

449
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,231
You're so silly...

450
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,668
You mistook your daddy's
medicine for a vitamin pill.

452
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,201
Huh?

453
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,403
Well,

454
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:55,006
I'm gonna call Terumi and
tell her that Yukihas finally come to...

456
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,776
Oh...

457
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,751
Well,

458
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,019
Kaoru...

459
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:11,323
All right!

460
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,625
I told the police in
detail about what happened...

462
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,294
that the person who
attacked me in the bathroom was

464
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,997
a short fat middle aged woman...

465
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:19,731
Huh?

466
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,701
I just kind of tentatively said that
the criminal was a middle;aged woman...

468
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,602
I don't want to be thought that

469
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,238
some stalker old man
saw me naked, so...

471
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,606
But,

472
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:30,875
but...It was me...

473
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,179
Well, I will thankfully accept
this scar on my neck

475
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,347
as a punishment

476
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:38,483
for deceiving you without
considering your feelings at all...

478
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,618
Were you deceiving me?

479
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:41,453
Yeah...

480
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:44,556
That engagement party
thing was all a hoax,

482
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,758
a complete fabrication
that Mr. Kenzaki and I made up...

484
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,928
to help somebody make a decision...

485
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,229
Remember,

486
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,165
I used to say that my dream
was to suddenly get married at 20,

488
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,102
ust: like Yukiko Kudo...

489
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,470
Yeah...

490
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:02,474
And, and...
Now that dream has just come true!!!

492
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,108
Shazzam!!

493
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,078
Look at the morning paper today!

494
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,681
He finally made up his mind!

495
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:14,386
Do you, do you STILL like him,
that geek guy?

497
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:15,920
Oh, Shut up!

498
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,156
He sure doesnst-have-guts,;. 1.
But he still has good points.

500
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,192
He announced 'his-feelings for me

501
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,794
in front of the journalists and cameras.

502
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,631
She is the one I love,
I don't want to lose her!

504
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,569
He said that about me...

505
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,939
Really...

506
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,176
Actually, a lot of things happened but...

507
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,544
I think it was meaningful

508
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,945
to carry out my plan,
despite Terumi s objection.

510
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:42,547
What!

511
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:44,349
Terumi also knew about the plan!

512
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,418
Oh, in fact, we,

513
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,087
we, Terumi and I weren't
on bad terms with each other...

515
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,191
That fight was
a fake fight to disband our group

517
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,293
because we thought
if we had continued the group,

519
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,363
we would have gotten all messed up

520
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,299
I knew you and Yoko
wanted to continue the group...

522
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,334
So, we were hiding
the real reason from you...I'm sorry...

524
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,935
I see.

525
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,574
You pretended to be fighting
in order to hide it from me.

527
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,011
Then what did she mean
when she wrote,

529
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,746
I express my condolences
on that card...

531
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,882
Oh, that kid told me,
that the painful remarks from her

533
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,854
meant that
our plan has failed miserably...

535
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,456
That kid?

536
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:25,990
Onan, you know...

537
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,360
Mr. Mori must have
trained him very well!

539
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,665
When Mr. Kenzaki
carried me out of the bathtub,

541
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,103
Conan saw that he got bashful,
covering my body with a towel,

543
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,506
and realized that
he wasn't my fiancee...

545
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,975
Then, judging from
the picture of Makuma and me,

547
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,044
and Terumi's words and deeds,

548
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:51,316
he asked me: directly if I like him a lot.

549
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,086
He is also the one
who put sugar in your mouth

551
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,355
as a stop-gap measure when

552
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,057
you collapsed with
the effect of the medicine.

554
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,695
That boy...

555
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,297
And so, what will you do now?

556
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,999
I mean, about Mr. Kenzaki!

557
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,834
If you still insist on hesitating,

558
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,169
TerumiPayWaKe him away from you!

559
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:11,903
Huh?

560
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:12,737
Why?

561
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,540
This is also what Conan was saying!

562
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,076
The reason why Terumi
IS now hooked on mystery novels is

564
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,445
probably because she likes Mr. Kenzaki

565
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,113
playing the role of"Detective, Samonji.

566
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,185
Unfortunately, that is wrong.

567
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,556
I heard Terumi dumped
Mr. Kenzaki before.

569
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:32,624
On, really .

570
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,093
So who is her ideal guy now?

571
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,730
I don't know, but...
it would not surprise me at all

573
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:41,299
if Terumi has a younger lover...
