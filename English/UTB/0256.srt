00:00:01,602 --> 00:00:03,102
Even destiny serves. as a clue to deduction,

and thetight of truth:pierces through ~*
the most mysterious case.

4
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:07,340
The Matsue mystery is solved today.

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,308
There are so many secrets in the lake.

6
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,310
He sees through the one and only truth,

7
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,145
a child in appearance
with the I°Q-"of an adult

10
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,514

One autumn day

00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,617
the three of us take a trip to
Matsue city in Shimane prefecture

16
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,919
and at Matsue Spa,

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,187
we meet a group of five people

18
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,622
who have come to compose
what is called renku , or linked verses.

21
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,695
One of their members,
Mr. GozosUshikubo is found murdered

23
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,597
on the Matsue Castle grounds.

24
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,533
His index finger seems to be
pointing to something

26
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,435
and we must find out
what his-dying message is...

28
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,642
I'm positive one of them is the Killer...

29
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,478

Also,

50
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,197
to make it easier for Mr. Mourn,
who is a beginner,

52
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,665
we'll do it with a word game style,

53
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,868
using the last syllable of
the previous word to start the new verse.

55
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,668
A word game? 'Really?

56
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:51,604
Yes.

57
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,739
There are only a few rules
you have to follow,

59
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,708
other than that.
It's pretty much anything goes.

00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:56,542

However,

76
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,453

not to add on to the poem two poen

118
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,007
Oh wow!

119
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,709
Are you sure you can handle it...

120
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,712
Well, let's just start and see.

121
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,748
First: the opening poem,

122
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,750
the.poems you all wrote...

123
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,351
Mr. Shiina's' is

124
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:43,155
Even. the gods will gather
and gaze upon Deer's Window.
Kamigami mo tsudoi termiru ya
Shika no Mado

128
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,457
Mr. Yagisawa's is,

129
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,760
To the huge turtle a mantis does raise
ax in reverence forsooth.
Oogame Ni kamakiri ga kama furiage te .

132
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,762
Mizuki's is,

133
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,365
Softsand gently.where the sun shine
downrautumn leaves dance.
Yawaraka ki hi ataru hou e momiji mau

136
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,935
and now Mr. Ushikubo's poem,

137
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,005
Ah. Autumn is full I suffice to say,
my life has no sorrow.
AKi taka shi wa ga jinsei ni urei nashi

140
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,775
I think they are all good poems, but...

141
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,411
since this session is dedicated
to Mr. Ushikubo,

143
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,314
I'd like to use his poem as the opener.

144
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,381
We agree.

145
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,021
All right then,
will someone: follow withthe waki"...

148
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,290
Jh, what's a "waki...

149
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,360
It's the second poem.

150
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,730
Like the "hokku",
it contains reference to the season.

152
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:29,401
Within the silence
I hear a nut falling from the tree.
Shizukasa no naka ima konomi otsu

156
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,606
That's very good.
You interpreted the opener very cleverly.

158
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,308
All right then why don't you go next,
Mr Yagisawa.

160
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,243
Okay.

161
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:43,082
I wonder if dad will be able to do it.

162
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,083
Hmm...

163
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,586
The guy's about as boorish as can be...

164
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,963
Under the moonlight Dracula
does come to me joining me in vers
Tsukiakari tsugi wa dorakyura
tsukékUshi te"

169
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,168
That's quite amusing.

170
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,569
The use of Dracula,

171
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,804
a very radical character is
very stimulating...

173
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,807
Is that.kind of poem:allowed?

174
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:09,641
Yes,

175
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,478
for the:third. poem
you can.let-yourself go.

177
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:15,047
Let your imagination go wild.

178
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:18,083
Let the imagination...go wild???

179
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,920
Mizuki. it's your turn

180
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,254
Okay.

181
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:24,857
That text I see there
seems to be made in Japan.
Tekisuto wa meido in Japan

184
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:30,930
Oh. I think it'd be better to use the word
textbook instead of text.

186
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:33,299
It's all right if you have an extra syllable.

187
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:33,933
Okay.

188
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,334
Hmm...

189
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,268
Mr. Mouri!

190
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,336
Y. yes!

191
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,672
Would.you:like:to:give it a try?

192
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:41,106
Use the last syllablerof the last word

193
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,308
so yourll have to start with a
Pan or:hans word.

195
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,008
Huh!?

196
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,177
All right. I'll try it!!

197
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,583
Hmmm...

199
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,222
Here goes!

200
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,825
Catching the killer will prove to all
that I am a great detective.
Hannin wo age te miseru to meitanter

203
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,199
W: well... what. do:you think?

204
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,901
Et's see.

205
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,171
Great-detective,and .Dracula do
seem to belong to the same realm

207
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,506
whiCh.would bring us
back to the uchikoshi but...

209
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,674
I guess.it's all night.

210
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,376
Phew...

211
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,145
Now it's my turn...

212
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,118
What the future holds for us
god alone knows:for:certain.
IKitsuku saki-wa kami nomi zo shiru

215
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:27,720

216
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,088
Bravo, Ms Ando.

217
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,692
You've subtly challenged the detective.

219
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,262
won't be so easy?

220
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,631
All right then. I'll go next.

221
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,766
U', ru, ru. ru...

222
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,370

Funny, isn't it!

228
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,112
The 7th syllable. O is the main point.

229
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,782
1? What does he mean?

230
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:01,754
Mr. Yagisawa...

231
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,621
Here...

232
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,590
I found it in the lobby just now.

233
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,025
Oh brother.

234
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,526
I must have dropped it again.

235
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,326
Thank you.

236
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,528
Don't mention it.

237
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,601
See...

238
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,871
You're all so very good!

239
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,706
How's it going. Mr. Mouri?

240
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,009
Well, uh...not very good actually.

241
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,847
3 more poems to go...
we've got to do something soon.

243
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,750
Hey. Miss Mizuki.

244
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,385
Didn't you say you wrote the first poem

245
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,953
while you were looking
at the autumn leaves

247
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,822
at the rest area in the grounds
of the samurai residence

249
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,257
Why...yes...

250
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,292
That's strange.

251
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,128
I went there just a little while ago.

252
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,131
But I couldn't see the leaves
from the rest area.

255
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,367
Is that true. Conan?

256
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,034
Yes!

257
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,537
Oh, uh, ma be...

258
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,572
I saw the autumn leaves
in another location...

260
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,107
Another location?

261
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,308
Where was that?

262
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,078
Uh...well...uh...

263
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,681
Is Mizuki the killer?

264
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,150
If she isn't,

265
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,785
why did she lie like that?

266
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,961
This poem...could it be?

267
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,665
That means she's doing it
for that person...

269
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,367
but,

270
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,402
what did that dying message mean...?

271
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:32,811
Heh...

272
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,480
so that's what it meant.

273
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,549
But why'd that person
do something like this...

275
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,288
I've got it!

276
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,990
Now I understand!!

278
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,159
Orders from Mr. Mouri for me!?

279
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,194
Yes,

280
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,230
He said not to tell Detective Yasurai,

281
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,265
and he wants you
to investigate something.

283
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:53,999
All right!

284
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,800
I understand!

285
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,207
If my deduction is correct,

286
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,277
that person is the killer!!

287
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,851
I've got it!

288
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,255
Wh. what do you mean?

289
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,792
I know what
Mr. Ushikubo's dying message is.

291
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,362
He wasn't pointing to the bamboo.

292
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,365
He was pointing to
something beyond that.

294
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,167
? Something beyond the bamboo?

295
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,870
Past the shrubs around the walk way.

296
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,139
And past Horikawa...

297
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:35,808
That's right!

298
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,076
It's the site of the samurai homes

299
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,778
where Ms Mizuki
went to compose her poem.

301
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:40,913
Which means you.

302
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,415
Ms Mizuki,
Oil) ad;IreD> Te I er...

304
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,384
Th, that's not true...

305
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,790
Hey Ms. Mizuki!

306
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,461
The 10th poem here, it's a love poem,
Isn't it?

308
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,095
And a one sided one a \that.

310
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:57,529
Il]/

311
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,665
And another thing. Mr. Yagisawa,

312
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,401
during dinner, you were whistling,
weren you.

315
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,735
Oh...uh huh...

317
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,206
So that's what it is!

318
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,642
Mizuki's in love with Yagisawa!

320
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:12,277
Fl sees.

321
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,513
So that's why last night. she...

322
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,315
? What about last night?

323
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:20,686
Mr. Ushikubo said something cruel
to-Mr. Yagisawa last-night.

325
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,922
Ms. Mizuki was watching them
and she looked very worried.

327
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,924
Whoa. wait just a minute.

328
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,326
Are you saying

329
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,362
Oh I get it! Now I understand!!

330
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:34,233
Ms. Mizuki,
are you trying to protect'Mr. Yagisawa?

333
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,638
Fi What do you mean by that, Mr. Mouri!?

334
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,040
I mean that she was concerned

335
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,043
about whatihappened between
Mr Ushikubo and Mr. Yagisawa last night,

337
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,079
so she changed her plans

338
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,615
and went to Matsue Castle
to see Mr. Ushikubo.

341
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,819
when she got there. she saw...

342
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,461
No. you're wrong!

343
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,829
I saw no such thing!

344
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,230
All I saw was...

345
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,199
Saw what's.

346
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,501
Mizuki...

347
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:10,903
Mizuki,

348
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,071
I think it'd be better if you told the truth.

349
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,007
But Ms. Ando!

350
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,575
I agree with her.

351
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,077
Oh: I'm sorry if I:sounded.cocky.

353
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,615
if you really do love him .

354
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,486
If you really think he's special...

356
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,626
at first, I had planned to go
to Gessho Temple,

358
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,228
not Matsue Castle...

359
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,298
But I was worried about Mr Yagisawa

361
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,770
the bus going to Matsue Castle
passed-by-and I saw

363
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,340
Mr. Yagisawa in it.

364
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,845
So I'headed:for-Matsué Castle right away

366
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,915
when I got to the walk way,

367
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,719
Mr Ushikubo was already dead.

368
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,287
And...

369
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,323
And at his fingertip. I found...

370
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,093
After that,

371
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,162
I rushed back to the samurai residences

372
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,831
and sat in the rest area
until I calmed down.

374
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,069
Then when it was time
to come back here.to the hotel, I did.

376
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,004
Hey. wait a minute.

377
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,440
Sure, it's true I went to the castle!

378
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,575
But I didn't kill him,

379
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,344
and I didn't go to the walk way either!

380
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,279
Then what part of the castle
did you go to?

382
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,181
To the Shiroyama Inari shrine.

384
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,951
That's where there's a lot of
fox statues. right?

386
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,455
That's where Mr. Ushikubo»
told me to meetéhim

388
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,492
About 30 minutes
after I got to Gessho Temple,

390
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,129
I got an e-mail
from Mr. Ushikubo on my cellular.

392
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,132
It said Come to the Inari shrine
at Matsue Castle right now

394
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:54,973
It was about:10:05
when I got to the shrine.

396
00:12:56,376 --> 00:13:00,178
I waited about fifteen minutes
but he never showed up,

398
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,714
so I tried calling his cellular
but there was no answer.

400
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,718
There was nothing I could do
so I went back to Gessho Temple,

402
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,887
and composed the poem
about the big turtle.

404
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,492
Then why was your eye medicine
at the scene of the crime?

406
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,659
I don't know...

407
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,562
I'm telling you the truth detective!

408
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:18,997
If you don't believe me,

409
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,332
check Mr. Ushikubo's cellular.

410
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,036
We've already checked
all the data-on his.cellular.

413
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,340
But there's, no record of
any message to you like you claim!

415
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,741
Th, that's impossible...

416
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,909
How-about his spare cellular?

417
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,880
Mt. Ushikubo said
he always carried a spare in his bag.

419
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,985
We checkedFall his belonging
but there was only one cellular.

421
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,787
Mr. Yagisawal!

422
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,924
You stole Mr. Ushikubo's spare cellular

423
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,695
and sent yourself that message,
didn't you?

425
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,496
No, that's not true!!

426
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,665
Detective Yasugi!

427
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,201
We-found the murder weapon!

428
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:56,968
What?

429
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,904
We found it in the Ictus pond
at Gessho Temple.

431
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,308
The nightstick was wrapped
in this raincoat,

433
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:07,145
and the blood on it matched the victimes.

434
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,648
And this raincoat,

435
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,384
Yagisawa!?

436
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,519
That settles it.

437
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,421
Th, that's impossible...

438
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:17,723
Come on!

439
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,257
You can tell us all about it at the station!

440
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,759
D. detective!

441
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,527
It wasn't me.

442
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:23,862
You're making a big mistake!

443
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,230
Mr. Yagisawa!

444
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,152
Oh boy. what a poetry composing trip
this has turned into.

446
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,820
Yes...

447
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,556
Lets end today's session...

448
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,024
Good idea.

449
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:00,732
Excuse me.

450
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,601
I have a poem Id like to contribute.

452
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,103
You're starting with chi next aren't you?

453
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:10,809
Rm finished!

454
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,879
Yummy chocolate candy hurry

\ Chiyocoleeto kashi hayaku chodai

457
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,616
NO. mo. No!

458
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,050
That's not what you call a renku!

459
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:19,584
Not true!

460
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,989
You associated chocolate
candy with ant trail. didn't you?

462
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,491
That's a very amusing
poem befitting a child.

464
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,228
The next one should be a
flower poem. Mr. Shiina., you do it.

467
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,598
Come on! Make a poem starting with I

468
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,300
Make it a pretty one!

469
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,003
All right then!

470
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,239
There!.

471
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,710
Perhaps one fine day together
with my daughter flowery temple.
Itsunohika musume to
futari hananotera

475
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,013
What do you think?

476
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,681
How strange.

477
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:50,982
It's really strange.

478
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:55,620
That's the poem Mr. Mouri
read to me just a little while ago See?

480
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:56,855
Look!!

482
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,396
When did you write that, dad?

483
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,498
Well, uh, I uh...

484
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,368
Ma tsu..e

485
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,437
Ta... ma... tsukuri!

486
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,041
Dad?

488
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,812
the truth is. I didn't write that poem.

489
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,683
Mr. Tomonaga the man
we met in the lobby yesterday

491
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:26,618
from the brokerage firm wrote it.

493
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:33,124
Mr. Ushikubo had written it
down in his memo pad

495
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,025
Mr. Shiina...

496
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,598
You were convinced Mr. Ushikubo
came up with it himself. weren't you.

498
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,600
He was such a cruel man,

499
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,135
you couldn't forgive him
for writing such a beautiful poem...

501
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,873
that's why you tore it out of
his memo pad, didn't you.

503
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,308
After you killed him!!

504
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,944
Boom

505
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:57,983
Your poems had secret messages
n them, didn't they...

507
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,219
The seventh syllable
in the seventh poem,

509
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,121
The seventh syllable
in the seventh poem,

511
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,191
and the eleventh syllable
in th )eleventh poem

513
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,794
I'm the killer

514
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:14,531
that was your challenge to me...

515
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:20,605
You secretly put messages in your poems
mocking both the police and me,

517
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,240
you must have been enjoying yourself.

518
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,844
Judging from your personality.

519
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,712
Given the right conditions

520
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,281
I knew you would use the poem
you stole from Mr. Ushikubo...

522
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:34,953
I had you pegged.

523
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:36,588
Because

524
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,491
this is the kind of poem you like...

525
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,395
My favorite poems are
those with feeling

527
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,764
Like how a father feels for his daughter.

528
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,233
The conditions were perfect.

529
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,438
Then when Mr. Yagisawa was
taken away as the suspect in the murder,

531
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,740
The thirteenth poem was a flower poem

532
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,678
so I composed: the previous
poem setting 'things up for you.

534
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:02,847
So that's why you told Conan
to do the twelfth poem...

536
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:03,915
That's right...

537
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,217
and just as I'd figured

538
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,788
you used Mr. Ushikubo's poem...

539
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:13,058
because you were so sure you'd won...

540
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,459
Haha...

541
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,629
the secret message
in the poems was just a joke.

543
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,297
And about that poem,

544
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,000
Mr. Ushikubo showed it to me last night.

545
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,769
Besides. I have an alibi.

546
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,137
An alibi?

547
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,272
That's right.

548
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,140
I just remembered that at about 10:05

549
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:33,044
I saw a female attendant
at therart museum.

551
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,214
She give a lost boy back to his mother.

552
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:38,983
Oh that,

553
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,252
you could have set up a video camera

554
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,520
below the hedges there

555
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:44,956
and then seen it on the tape.

556
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,427
Conan found marks
Ieft behind by a tripod.

558
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,131
When you got
to the art museum this morning.

560
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,701
You set a video camera up
underneath the hedges.

562
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,339
Then you sent an e-mail to Mr. Yagisawa
with Mr. Ushikubo's spare cellular,

564
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,241
which you had stolen beforehand

566
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,745
then you went to Matsue Castle

567
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,747
and killed Mr. Ushikubo.

568
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,281
After that.

569
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:15,453
You put Mr. Yagisawa's eye medicine
by Mr. Ushikubo's finger.

571
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,456
Went to Gessho Temple to get rid
of the raincoat and murder weapon

573
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,026
then went back
to the art museum: for: the video

575
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,796
then came back to hotel
pretending like nothing happened.

577
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:28,733
That's a very interesting story. Mr. Mour.

578
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,368
I hate to disappoint you though...

579
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:32,003
I have the evidence to prove it.

581
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,339
It's Mr. Ushikubo's dying message.

582
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,745
He wasn't pointing
to the bamboo or the samurai residence.

584
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,681
He was making the number 1.

585
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,850
So what's that supposed to mean...

586
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,052
Ran,

587
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,721
what's the first poem in renku called?

589
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,389
Ho, hokku...

590
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,591
Now Detective Tsubaki.

591
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,160
Give us the results from the lab.

592
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:55,827
Yes sir! w

593
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,396
This is Mr. Shiina's shoe.

594
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,732
The left front hook
on the left shoe,

596
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,134
is where we found a bloody fingerprint,

597
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,570
which matched Mr. UshikubO's right
index finger and it was his blood!

599
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:15,012
He was telling us to check
your shoe in his dying message!

601
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,048
You were probably

602
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,485
so engrossed with his:memo pad

603
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,556
you didn't notice he touched
your shoe, did you.

605
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,392
I give up Mr. Mour.

606
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:28,193
You're right

607
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,295
I killed him...

608
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,496
But...

609
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,364
What made you suspicious of me?

610
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,166
The first thing I found strange was

611
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,403
Iast night's drawing of lots.

612
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:39,704
Usually.

613
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,839
The person who makes the lots draws last

614
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,108
but you went second.

616
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:45,743
INT AL,

617
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,512
we'll go according to age. so it's me.

618
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,116
You rigged the drawing

619
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:54,552
so that Mr. Ushikubo would pick a place
that would make killing him easy

621
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,857
and your place would be faraway
giving you an excellent alibi...

623
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,259
Hah...

624
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,027
you're sharp.

625
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,730
No wonder you're the country's
best private detective.

627
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:09,100
So your motive for killing
Mr. Ushikubojwas...

629
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:14,105
I couldn't forgive him for lying
and cheating us out of our money

631
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,775
But that doesn't give you
the right to pass sentence on him...

633
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:18,443
Yes.

634
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,544
I know that...

635
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,547
I know that very well

636
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,118
I know only god can
pass judgement on him...

638
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:36,261
I guess the god of Izumo brought you
here to teach that to me. huh

Magatama

685
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,559
It looks like Mr. Yagisawa
feels the same for Mizuki...
Magatama

688
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
It certainly does...

689
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,496
By the way, Ms. Reiko.

690
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,897
The renku's still short one poem.

691
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,001
All right then,

692
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,236
this one will express
my gratitude to Mr. Mouri

694
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,338
and how I feel about Matsue...

695
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,909
Infamous Lafcadio Hearn
miles brightly and Spring arrives
Rafucadeo Haan hohoende haru

698
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:34,078
Oh that's a wonderful poem.

699
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,813
Isn't it dad!

701
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,584
Lafcalio?

702
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,419
It's Lafcadio Hearn!

703
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:43,454
Yakumo Koizumi!

704
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,357
Koizumya. oh,

705
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,192
Hahhhhh

706
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,128
Ah hah...

707
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:50,795
at this rate,

708
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:54,098
Infamous Lafcadio Hearn
annoyed by you, he springs up
Rafucadeo han akirete haru

711
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,800
would be more appropriate...

712
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:02,607
Why you do think that thief
chose this old shrine?

714
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,810
I mean, even if he did get
the offering box open,

716
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,445
it doesn't look like there'd be
too much inside. right?

718
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,684
Wh. what happened!?

719
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:15,920
I wonder...

721
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,056
if that's what it was,

722
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,758
it would explain why it had to be
that place
