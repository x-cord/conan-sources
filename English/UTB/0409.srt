But Miss Range did not return.

253
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,831
But Miss Range did not rot-urn.

254
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,739

00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,169
probably to make the halation disappear

434
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,939

That's It. I got it)!

481
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,620
False kidnapping!?

482
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,790
Renge did it herself!?

483
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,059
What!?
Why would she want-to do*that...1?

485
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,397
Maybe she wanted to
ruin the talk about marriage?

487
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:27,999
What's that supposed to mean?

488
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,901
I don't really know

489
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,503
but probably-the reason for
asking for ransom

491
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,672
from the-people who proposed to her...

492
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,508
was her way of wanting to relate
how she-f@lt to-her father

495
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,344
In accordance to
he story of Princess Kaguya...

498
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,079
Right! I think so too!

499
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,384
But that's no excuse for her
to do:such a thing!

501
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,718
Little one!

502
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,454
