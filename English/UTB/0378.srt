not good at remembering has lines.

Are we U-turning back to Kurashiki again?

Wholissthought will be arrested soon...

393
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,431
The fact is. he's innocent.

394
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,800
I he real culprit is. someone else

395
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,168
I kept trying to toll youl!

396
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,805
WwW. What 7! Do you mean
that it Is Mr Onitsurn aftersall-thon 9

398
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,074
You gotta be kidding! I didnat-do it!

399
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,911
Come. come flet me explain things in order

400
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,181
1b years ago . ..you all put
things that were precious; to! you

402
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,151
Inside a time capsule and
exchanged it with each other

404
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:36,087
You shufflediit and each of you
buried Someone else's capsule

407
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,890
Let me reconfirm something here

408
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:43,495
Ne Momo hid Salka's capsule
in the KHinomi-Watchtower

410
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,799
Saiko hid Mr. Onilsura's capsule
in tho garden of the Ohashi residonco.

412
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,904
Mr O ilsura hid Mr Saruwatarn,
capsule here In:lvy Square

414
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:58,877
Mr Sarawatacifhnd, Yae's capsule
or rather a dummy;in Komorizukn,

416
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,813
and the actual,capsule in Kibitsu Shrine

417
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:06,918
And finally, Mr. Momi's
capsule was hidden by Yae,

419
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,388
you. In the Ohara Art Gallery

420
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,025
Way li Nin Gy edd to Ne of RIREY Ws ay
dug the capsules out

422
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:16,827
The problom is theuqh,
that every capsule was alnozrxdy

424
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:19,664
dug over before the members
of the squad got there.

426
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,033
So. like I said, the killer
Just a ted to make it

428
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,835
Iook like somebody broke into school

429
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:27,404
There, one thing we just
ant seem to understand...

431
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:31,209
Why was only Mr. Momoi's
capsule missing something In

433
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,712
witting that was ineludaed in
everybody clse's capsule?

435
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:39,584
Ha, ha, ha, It just didn't appenl
to mo to bury something like that

437
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,351
That's all there 1s to it

438
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:45,156
NO --=llll"bet It was
actually Inside. You removed It

440
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:49,159
and got rnd of it. But,
Seiko happened to see you...

442
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,529
Isn't that it, Mr. Momol?!!

443
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,199
WwW. What?!

444
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,432
You...?

445
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,768
INFINRO §

446
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,969
ron] {X82100 WdkekeTu JU

447
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,170
What proof do you have!

448
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,875
Let me explain First I the dying message

449
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,644
The point 1s the
position of the victim's finger.

451
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,379
AY aA
Position of her finger

453
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,282
Seiko, the victim was left handed.
Therefore,

455
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:15,854
most naturally she would've written
hor dying messago with her right hand.

457
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,391
But. if so, the position of her finger
Is odd. Her finger should've near

459
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:24,729
the last "I" of the message.
But it was by the first letter...

461
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,164
Neo,

462
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:26,397
T True.

463
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:31,736
By the way, left handed peopl:
usually right their letters in reverse

465
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,906
Don't you think the samo goes for this?

466
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,309
That is, viewed from the position
of the finger, it was not written

468
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,880
from left to right but rather,
from right to left backwards

470
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,583
And 1 the part that 1s erased
Is connected with a hneoe

472
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,151
Else

473
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:47,619
[1 we?

474
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,356
It wasn't "TONIT" but rather.
She tried to write "Momo"!

476
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,824
Exact,!

477
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,394
In other words, "ONI" neither
meant Mr. Onitsura nor Mr. Saruwatarl.,

479
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,064
but was pointing out that
Mr. Momol Is the killer...

481
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,966
1 That's bullshit!

482
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,402
That's all nothing but imagmation!

483
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,937
I oven have an aha!

485
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,976
You wore walking together with Mr. Momo
through the fine sight district, is that right?

487
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,613
You said) you only separated
for 5 minu 8s tO) go to the restroom.

489
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,448
Oh...yes ~

490
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,785
A blind spot, or rather once,
one notices there's nothing to it

492
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,022
but uh, ean you continue
Youth Dctective. Squad?

494
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,493
Od) TRO hay Squire
and tine Sights District

496
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,429
ire actually located back to back.

497
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,198
If you walk on the outside in front,
hay Soom Le Ho Some distance apa

499
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,068
but you walk within the grounds
or the buildings they aro very near!

501
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:37,468
A round trip takes 1 minute 50 seconds!

502
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,904
A Bund trip takes 1 minute 50 seconds!

503
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:45,209
He probably mado Seiko
wait here boforehand

505
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,814
Hoe then came to her and
killed her! Then, ran back

507
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,049
N.Naoto?!

508
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,151
N.No! That's a liel

509
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,486
And . after

510
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,556
he killed Seiko, He 'dug
over the capsules in this area

512
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,726
It should've taken him about
an hour

514
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,096
So tho Lime of the
rime would've been.about 14:00.

516
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:13,137
Wasn't ho out of your, sight for
bout an hour. Yae.,

520
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,978
he was go ne te go to
[bookstores and to We Whranyk

522
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,212
You'rd only making assumptions!!

523
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,349
You have no evidence to
support what you're saying at all]!

525
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,919
There is proof... Im your wallet!

526
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,222
Huh?! . . MM. My wallet...

527
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,659
You. the killer. In order to make it look as: if

529
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,396
Mr. Onitsura, the alleged
killer, broke into school,

531
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:42,033
removed the contents
inside the victim's wallet.

533
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,436
However, since you couldn't
just dispose of it, you put it

535
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,973
Inside your wallet
You still have it with you, don't you?

537
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,708
Tell me will you?!

538
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,277
Just what proof de you

00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,013
from Seiko's wallet 1s in my wallet?!

00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,683
Officer Tsuyama. did you
bring the you know what here?

543
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,084
Oh, es .

544
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,554
The: thang that Mi Moun told

Officdr Tsuyama'!! Please check

547
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:11,229
Do you see one bill in there
that has something odd stuck-to it?

549
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,563
Odd...?

550
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,432
IF... This is.

551
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,402
So what about it.

552
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,471
If a bill is «dirty, does
that make nu, Mu, killer?!

554
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,140
Mr. Momoil...

555
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,208
How are you going to explain this...?

557
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:30,348
Normally at wouldOnly look as if
the stamp of the ticket smeared off

559
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:36,220
in your wallat there was h
16, other half of he stamp mar

561
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:40,725
that was found on this
pamphlet of the art gallery.

563
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,328
Seiko probably put the ticket on top of the

564
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,765
pamphlet then put them inside hcr wallet

566
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,569

Thanks to the adnussion stamp, you took
bill that coincidentally "became a pair

571
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,052
It's because that broad Seiko
referred to What happened 15 years ago...

573
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,490
Baocause she started snooping
around nd investigating

576

what happonod lh years ago

00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:30,374
Momol

597
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,514
I thought! he was going to squeak on me.

598
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,217
That he'd tell the teacher my parents

599
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,152
That's what I thought.

600
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,924
Boy Momol never spoke of
an one about that incident. But

602
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,794
because of his feeling of guilt,
he impulsively wrote

604
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,497
the truth on the paper and
put it Inside the time capsule...

606
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,367
I was graduating anyway. and
I get to sever ties with those guys too

608
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,871
I thought that we'd never be
digging the capsu es out again anyway

610
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,105
back then...

611
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,675

619
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,756

624
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,466
You know the capsule that I buried?

625
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,435
When I came to look for it,
it was already dug up

627
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,272
You're the only one who
could've done it. right?

629
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,575
You're the only one who knew that
I was going to dig out the time capsule...

631
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,745
Why'd you do something
Iike this'? Don't tell me that...

633
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,948

of scoop article about it...7?

649
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,949
You're the one who put this code
inside (hé capsule and burled it. right?

651
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,752
I was asked by Shunya
a while before he died

653
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,790
that he wanted to go with
everybody to bury the capsule...
