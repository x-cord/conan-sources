Ah, hey!

195
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,222

196
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:50,289

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,593

And, where is the victim whe was shot?

215
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:51,450

called and was looking at the ball

217
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,988
that rolled right below the boy in the
front row wearing a blue cap with monitor.

219
00:10:55,989 --> 00:11:00,726
Then. the ball sT™denly bounced
and the air leaked out of the ball...

221
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,263
I'm sure the ball was shot by a gun!

222
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:09,368
But, maybe it was a prank where
Nn air gun was used...

224
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,437

00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,775
7.62 millimeter bull
ussian made, eh...

243
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:53,779
A Russian gun that can be loaded
with this bullet would be one that

245
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:59,418
is frequently smuggled via China into
Japan, mest probably a Tocaref...

247
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:03,255
It is extremely deadly and has
a:high capability of killing its target

249
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:09,362
Gun fire was net heard, so the
killer probably used a sileficer...

251
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:13,099
W Why are you so knowledgeable...

252
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,104
of course Pops told me: all of this...

253
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:23,242
Ghads... What's with him teaching
kid semething like this

255
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,311
The game's off! ff!

256
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,413
Stop the game right this minute and

257
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,248
evacuate the spectators
as well as the players!

259
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:29,949
Yes, sir!

260
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,384
N.No!

261
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:38,491
The man who called said if we do
anything funny like stop the game or let

263
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:43,729
the spectators go.he'd sheot
indiscriminately throughout the stadium. .!!

265
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,964
What?!

266
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,570
And, what does the criminal want?

267
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:55,274
He says to have 50,000,000 yen put
into a bag and ready by half-time.

269
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,711
As to where to take it, he said
he'd call back later .

271
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:01,814
Did he demand that of you people?

272
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:04,650
S, to Nichwun TV

273
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:09,889
Could it be semeone who has
grudge: against Nichiun TV...

275
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,925
r, could it be a terrorist...

276
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:16,162
Do you have any idea as
to the voice of the man?

278
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:20,832
T, The thing is, his voice is muffled
nd hard to make out...

280
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:25,571
He probably had a cloth over the
receiver or was wearing a mask

282
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,574
And, didgyou get
the 50.000.000 yen eady

284
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,844
es...it's on its way here...

285
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:37,850
Okay! Scatter plain clothes officers
through the audience!

287
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:41,053
Our chance is when the criminal calls!

288
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:46,826
The mement he calls, nab everyone
who is using the phone!!

290
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:47,927
Yes, sir!!

291
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:52,731
It's dangerous here, you folks go on home.

292
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:57,003
Hey, is that kid wearing the blue cap a girl?

293
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,406
Y how rude
Can't you tell by lookingyatiher?

295
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:04,076
Strange . he man who called said,

296
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:09,582
the boy in the blue cap to the
treme left of all the 5 kids .

298
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,951
Please wait; Inspector Megureb!

299
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:16,154
It's not a good idea to nab the
criminal just like that!

301
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,557
What do yeu mean?

302
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,760
The ball was right below
us, which means

304
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:23,629
thatthe criminal shot from
nearby us, right?

306
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,633
Yeah... He shot from a range
that is not difficult to shoot from.

308
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,870
Besides, it'll be no laughing matter
he missed

310
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:35,274
If the criminal isthearby, why did
he mista -eher for a boy?

312
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:38,778
Looking at her clothes anybody
an see that shes a girl...

314
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,082
Maybe he couldn't see her skirt
because ef the wall, or something .

316
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,151
If the wall locked! his view,
it would mean that

318
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:49,355
he was at the back stand
ight opposite us

320
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:54,126
In other words, the person who told us
about the gun going off over the phone,

322
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,963
and the person who actually fired
re different people...

324
00:14:56,964 --> 00:15:01,067
There are at least more than
two people involved. right?

326
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,372
Hey Inform all the officers by radio.

327
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,908
And tell them not to move
until I order them to!!

329
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,142
Y.Yes sir!

330
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,511
What are they geing to do?

331
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:15,381
Can they find the criminals with
what little clues there are?

333
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:20,620
From this stadium that helds 56.000 fans...

334
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:21,854
How?

335
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,235
To all ofiicers scattered
ameng the audience!

337
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,271
There are mere than two criminals!

338
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:42,041
And. one of them is most likely
armed with a Toearef!

340
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,210
Donst do anything; even if you
see somebody suspicio!

342
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:48,181
Just keep on watch until further orders!

343
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:52,218
We can't be sure what the crimin
willido to save. their companiens'

345
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:56,122
Listen, don't you ever let them
suspect that you're officers!

2 ¢ Z 2 Q
TCrRVYECLY LaicTiul alliluUu TACIT UL youull

350
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,195
The next time the.criminalem

352
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:05,798
when he calls to designate where
to pick up the ransom he demanded!

354
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,569
Check each and every
person in this stadium

356
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,605
who us using the phone at that time!

357
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,173
H; and check. also for binoculars...

358
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,776
I'said before just awhile ago, didn't 1?

359
00:16:16,777 --> 00:16:22,348
That the criminal was watehing us from
the back stand night. opposite us .

361
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:25,618
He could see that there wereY 'of us.

362
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:28,654
As well as that there was one kid
wea ing a blue cap, from so far away.

364
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,290
He couldn't have possibly seen
that the ball was night below

366
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,226
that kid with his bare eyes...

367
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:38,931
Besides the cellular phone, the
criminal probably has binoculars, or

369
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,299
Opera glasses!

370
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,467
A teleseope!

371
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,336
A mobile video camera!

372
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,606
A camera with zoom lenses
should also be checked

374
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,875
T.True

375
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:51,777
There is a high probability that one
of the criminals have something

377
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,946
that will help him: view
quite a distance away.

379
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:55,114
Please keep.that in mind

380
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,317
I,Inspector! The phone!

381
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,953

00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:03,216
This ls sector "E" .~... An 'elderly man
was using the phone till just a while ago...

411
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,718
this is sector "K.!" There is one
person ere on the phone,

413
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,255
but he 1s still using it so
dent think he's the criminal...

415
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:12,124
He may be contacting the
others In his group!

417
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,126
Keep your eyes en him!

418
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:18,030
Hey. Takagi! How about your side?!

419
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:25,872
The ones who were on the phe
at that time, are the 8 people here...

421
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:31,077
Were you also watching the aisles
and dressing reams of this building?

423
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,113
Fficers were also watch
over the restrooms,

425
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,382

I had the cameras-that were open,
check the audience too

430
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,228
but it seems that only these
people were using the phone

432
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:55,601
There seems téube-no mistake that
ne of the criminals: is among the eight...

434
00:18:55,602 --> 00:19:00,540
But. Inspector! I wender if the criminal is
