00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:08,975
who is the person full of mystery?

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,775
He sees through to the one
and only truth,

00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,477

After tH SW

16
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,854
we went outside and saw.
A man named James Black

18
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,223
in trouble having been mistaken for
someone else so we went to his rescue.

Later.

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,896
Mr. Black went to get his Car
to take us to a restaurant

23
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,566
but he simply disappeared...

24
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,171
Ieaving behind his blood stained strap.

Uh...

29
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,751
what does ittmean? Id

30
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,486
It-was on the ground.

31
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:38,424
Hm sure it's a message from Mr. Black
telling us about the kidnappers!

33
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,225
Look!

34
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:43,129
There's blood on the P
and the & and the A

36
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,773
Well, first things first

37
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,977
We'll take back to the station
and check to. see if it's real blood...

39
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,146
Come back to the policelbox tomorrow!

40
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:00,946
H, he...

41
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:01,213
H, he...

42
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,418
Rats...

43
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,320
If we only knew
what he meant by that P & A

45
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,323
Maybe he. meant P & A together,
to make pa...

47
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:14,793
Maybe he meant the-name of a shop?

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,962
You know, like panya (bakery)!

49
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:17,730
NO...

51
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,900
If he was in trouble and
he wanted to get pa across.

53
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,004
He'd have smeared blood
on the "Pa" in Paul.

55
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,674
I think we should think of
the P and the A separately...

57
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,079
Hmm...P and A. P and A...

58
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,815

63
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:43,622
Come on.

64
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,394
Maybe Ne meant panking area!! ,

65
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,297
Ah. a parking lot!!

66
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,331
Yeah.

67
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,234
But: we don't know which parking lot!

68
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,735
Wait until I finish...

69
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,372
maybe he was trying to tell us

70
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:03,609
he left a clue at the parking lot
his car was parked «~

72
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,743
Yes...

73
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,747
I thought the same thing so I checked
the place out but I didin't find anything.

75
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,316
Oh, I see...

76
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,084
Rats .

77
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,153
Just can figure it out.

78
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,790
Ikguess we don't have any other choice
except to ask around this neighborhood

80
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,492
with he assumption
they're still in the area!

82
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:20,793
All right!

83
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,497
Let's all split up and ask around
the neighborhood

85
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,134
, to see if anyone saw two men take
a foreigner. a way!

87
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,403
If youslearn something.
- Contact the others with your badge!!

89
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,771
Okay!

91
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:34,907
oh oh...

92
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,909
What's wrong. Ayumi?

93
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:40,179
I can't find my badge.

94
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,780
You're kidding

95
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,915
Maybe you) droppe I it some place.

96
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,218
I don't understand...

97
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,121
it was here when
I showed it Mr. Black.

100
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,491
Oh. Sherlock Holmes!

101
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:57,496
I think Mr Black
might still have my badge!

103
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,364
Eh!?

104
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,865
Are you sure!?

105
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,399
Yes,

106
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:01,500
pretty sure...

107
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,871
Then the transmitter built inside it...

108
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,706
will give us his location...

109
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,575
e There they are! O

110
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,710
16kilomaters
north-north east from here...

112
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,081
they're mo ing north along Temuzu Rivers
and Ikumo Highway

114
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,651
judging by the speed,
they're in a can...

116
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,187
They're in a car?

117
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,588
On the Ikumo Highway?

118
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,822
Heading north...?

119
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,124
All set...

120
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,692
now that we know that much...

121
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,431
What!?

122
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,466
Are you serious...

123
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:39,371
you want me to put up a roadblock on
Ikumo Highway at the Saitama border!?

125
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,141
You're asking the me to do
E IMpossiH» eé .anan.

128
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:45,177
I can't order a roadblock on
unsubstantiated information. like that...

130
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:48,547
But that man might get killed
iffyou don't

132
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:51,784
@h. uh. but nonetheless

133
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:52,685
Hey!?

134
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:53,886
Conan. is that your.

135
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,287
This is Sato...

136
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,990
there was a.t affic accident %
in that area just now

138
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,059
and Yumi is handling the traffic...

139
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,927
I can ask her to check
for-suspicious cars.

141
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,362
That shouldn'tre any problem!!

142
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,398
Height, 180...

143
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,271
an American of English descent about
50 to 60 years old, beard and glasses...

145
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,907
Look for the car he's in, right?

146
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:15,908
Got it!

147
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,378
I'll tell her to stop the car if she sees it...

149
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,615
The kidnappers might be armed?

150
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:25,084
Yes...okey.

151
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,052
Don't worry!

152
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,055
Takagi'and I will.go there right now!

153
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,459
Et? MM, me too?

154
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,161
What's the big deal!

155
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,231
We'veigot nothing to do
untilPlater tonight...

157
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,534
I besides. whenever:.that kid gets involved,
things. get interesting...

159
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,004
Okay!

160
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,106
We're Reading there too,

161
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,241
Doctor Agasa.
Please bring the car around!

163
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:53,445
After all, we're the only ones
who can identify Mr. Black!

165
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,047
All right, I,understand!

166
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,118
Listen,

167
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,586
doesn't something strike you as odd?

168
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,725
Mr-Black was brought here through
the alley by two men...

170
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,195
and then transferred into another car...

171
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,766
it would mean he had to cut himself
on the finger and leave the blood code

173
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,735
while he was walking through the alley,
isnt that right?

175
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,536
Yes...

176
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,906
I guess so the man must
have threatened him with a gun

178
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,875
While TO was in the parkiing lot

179
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,512
he must've put the blood on the strap
when they weren't watching.

181
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,181
Or maybe...

182
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,951
he went with them willingly knowing
full well they were up to no good

184
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,387
and left us that message...

185
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,690
What're you trying to say?

186
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,725
I feel something.

187
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,061
Like something's calling me...

188
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,829
Aren't you over reacting?

189
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,366
I hope you're right...

190
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,378
Hey: 166)

191
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,379
Did you see that!?

192
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,648
Did yo Wsee who was driving that car!!

193
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:03,782
No...

194
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,718
it went by too fast.

195
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,020
Oh...

196
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,180
A foreigner...

197
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,282
a foreigner...

198
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,451
Iet's see

199
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,088
a foreigner...

200
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,556
A foreigner...

202
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,197
Excuse me...

204
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:54,600

205
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,935
I hate to ask O
buticould you let us:through?

207
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:02,074
We've got to get this guy on the scene
investigation done by sundowm...

209
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,443
Sow-you're working a case...

210
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,010
Yes...nothing major.

211
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,346
The guy's small time,

212
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,915
he wrecked his girlfriend's house,
that's all...

214
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,523
No problem! Go on ahead!

215
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,924
We really appreciate this...

216
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,161
Where was I!!

217
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,863
Look for a foreigner.

218
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,998
a foreigner...

219
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,201
What!?

220
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,601
You didn't see them...?

221
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,871
Are you sure!? 4

222
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,606
You know he's a foreigner?

223
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,474
Yes...

224
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,643
I didn't see a single foreigner...

225
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,145
What do) you think happened, Conan?

226
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,548
/henexs the car now?

227
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,082
They're on the move
about 8 kilometers from here

229
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,252
but my batteries are running low...

230
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,254
I don't get it though

231
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,757
how'd they get past this ma? blocld?

232
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,561
If that guy's got one of our badges.

233
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,430
All we have to do is ask hinnyYwhere he) is,

235
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,701
The kidnappers will hear us beeping him!

236
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,772
I guess we have to figure out
what that P & A means...

238
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,776
There's a possibility that it's referring
to where they're headed.

240
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,480
I've got it!! Parfait and anmitsu (jelly like
dessert). so maybe a restaurant!

242
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:19,183
How about perm and afro
referring to a beauty salon!

244
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,955
Can't you guys think
a little more seriously!

246
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:24,255
How about this then!

247
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,123
Let's Tae

248
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,626
pelican and ashika (seal) for zoo!?

249
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:28,627
You know

250
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,596
since rr. ac I es animas.

251
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,064
You're wrong!

252
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,265
If he meant zoo.

253
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,735
He'd have put blood on the word animal
on the title Animal Show...

255
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:37,603
Aha 1!

256
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:38,904
So that's whalit La ven

257
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,106
Nice going Ayumi!

259
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,342
Eh!?

260
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,244
I figured (Rout...

261
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,479
I know where Mr. Black is!!

262
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,019
Eh!?

263
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,988
The kidnappers are...

264
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,956
in a police car!?

265
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,325
I. I don't believe it. it can't be...

266
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,226
It's true, it's true!

267
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,365
If we don't go after them before it
get dark, we'll lose them!

269
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,268
Yumi!

270
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,002
What happned?

271
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,540
Did you get the kidnappers
Conan was telling us about?

273
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,442
So...wheresare the kidnappers?

274
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:18,944
Well, uh...

275
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,246
they're saying that
the)men are in a car...

277
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:21,914
What!?

278
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,549
Uh, huh!

279
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,018
A police car!?

280
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:26,985
That's right!

281
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:33,358
The message Mr.Black for us,
the PP & A" it stands for police car!

283
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,563
I still don't understand...
why does P & A stand for police car?

285
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,767
Take the and symbol (&),
spell it out and connect to the P & Al

287
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:46,238
Let's see PP & A...

288
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,807
PP. AND. A...

289
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,276
P.AN DA?

290
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,712
That's it, panda!!

291
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,116
Aha! A police car is black and white!

292
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,653
The same as a panda! I get it...

293
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,255
Conan, you're so smart!!

294
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,692
I see what you mean...

295
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:10,696
there are some police officers in Japan
that refer to the police cars as pandas

297
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,666
didn't you say the victim is
an American ofiEnglish descent?

299
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,868
It's: hard to imagine a foreigner
would know

301
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,204
argon Japanese police officers use...

302
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,572
And besides..t doesn't necessarily
have-to-be a police car,

304
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,808
it could be a round,
white car withblack tires and rims

306
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,479
that would make you.think of
a panda tooywouldnst ite

308
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,413
Maybe...

309
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,047
Maybe...

311
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,517
IN ac. xa wou ¢ re more panca
Iike to a foreigner than a police car

313
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,555
No. the victim James Black
was raised in London, that's why

315
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,523
he would visualize a panda!

316
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,225
A long time ago.

317
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:44,029
Police cars in England were
painted black and white too!

319
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:51,135
In 1965. the police department in
Lancaster, England was the first to paint

321
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,205
black and white and
they gave them the nickname panda.

323
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:57,743
The nickname stuck and in England, +
police cars are known as pandas'g.

325
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,579
The word panda car is
ven listed-in-the English.dictionary!

327
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,417
I don't think the younger generation
would know that though. but

329
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:12,824
Mr James's generation would immediately
associate police car with panda!

331
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,029
What generation are you, anyway?

332
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,165
Uh, just remembered.

333
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,933
I let-a-police cargo
through-without checking-it...

335
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,738
Bull don't think there was
a foreigner inside...

337
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,675
The officer in the car!!
Didn't he seem strange?

339
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:30,909
Let's see...

340
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,510
there were two detectives,

341
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,813
the suspect was in the back seat
sitting between them,

343
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,582
his head was covered with a coat...

344
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,354
That's them!!

345
00:13:58,438 --> 00:13:59,871
That was so easy! So easy!!

346
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,239
We:re right on schedule

347
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,176
we'll be: deep in the mountains
of Gunma by nightfall!

349
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,612
You were right,
your plan's working out perfect...

351
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,947
We can't let our guard down yet...

352
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:10,716
Didnst you think it was.strange?

353
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,218
That female cop was
just supposed to be directing traffic

355
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,321
but she looked into each and every car.

356
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:21,093
Hey. you :don't think...
the cops are already on:to us...

358
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:22,661
There's nothing to worry about.

359
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,197
We've got a hostage...

360
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,865
We've got to be prepared for anything

361
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,035
SO keep your gun"pressed«to
this guys throat...

363
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,871
and if they set up another
roadblock or something...

365
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,741
We're going to crash-our way through.

366
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,496
Uh, Sato
we re going to be in big trouble...

368
00:14:57,797 --> 00:15:00,132
We've entered Saitama prefecture!

369
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,002
We've already asked the Saitama police
to set Up a roadblock...

371
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,972
we don't have to keep going after them...

372
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,474
Aren't you worried. Trakagi?

373
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,978
Yumi's checked that police car once.

374
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:17,215
They might have figured out already
that their cover's been blown

376
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:21,753
so they might use their hostage as a
shield and break through the roadblock...

378
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,757
another thing. when Yumi looked inside,
she said the hostage didn't move at all...

380
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,028
so there's a high possibility
the kidnappers are armed!

382
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,498
At a minute...

383
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:38,570
If they have guns and
they see a roadblock,

385
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:43,642
they might start shooting at everything in
sight...the city's going to be in a panic!!

387
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:47,112
That's why I've been trying to think
up a plan where we can surround

389
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,315
the kidnappers without them knowing
and then take them in...

391
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:54,319
but then we'd need a miracle...

392
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,454
No. I think there's a way!

393
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,022
Conan?

394
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,857
Conan?

395
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:01,526
The kids detective badge?

396
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,996
Sorry! I put it in your car
when you weren't looking!

398
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,933
And where are you now?

399
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,068
Abouti500 meters behind -that:car!

400
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,339
So what:re-we going to do?I've got
a great plan, do you want to try it?

402
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,542
The only thing is. this plan'll work only

403
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:24,216
if a lot of other police officers go along.
With. my crazy idea...

405
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:29,554
Good grief. what's the matter with me,

406
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,823
what am I doing way out here...

407
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,224
what am I doing way out here...

408
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,427
Yumi? You following me?

409
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,629
Yes. I am...do I have a choice...

410
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,166
I mean. I made a mistake and
Iet those kidnappers get away-

412
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,969
Yumi, weren't you in
charge of all the arrangements

414
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,404
when we had that get together with
the Saitama police the other time?

416
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,507
Yes. I was...

417
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,846
Another red light.

418
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,214
On't get impatient...

419
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,484
just drive normally and we won't draw
any attention to ourselves...

421
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,020
we'll be safe once it gets dark...

422
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,202
Oh crap, it:sithecops!!
I guess they:refon.totus!!

424
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,209
Come on!! Get going!!

425
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,144
We'll make a run for it,
we'll use him as a cover!!

427
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,579
Yeah, okay!!

428
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:33,018
Help me sail!

429
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,053

All right.

437
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,805
We'll go along with them for a little while

438
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,272
then turn off into a side road
when the coast's clear!

440
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,074
Got you!

441
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,345
Good they fell for it!!

442
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,448
Well? Is it working?

443
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,618
Uh...just fine! It's going justine!

444
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,253
Don't worry about it...

445
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,993
Get ready...

446
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,296
We're going to;turn into a

Hey!! Why re you going so slow?

449
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,604
They're going to get away!

450
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,307
If you can't turn left, turn into the right!

451
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,812
There's another one onthe right...

452
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,914
Allright then we'll go back!!

453
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,281
Slow down and then back up...

454
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,249
It's no good...

455
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,552
there's another one behind us too...

456
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,220
Wh, what?!

457
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,256
Oh man! We re-completely
surrounded by cops!!

459
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:48,259
Oh man! We're completely
surrounded by cops!!!

461
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,699
Nice going, Irregulars...

462

or should I say Holmes...

463
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,106
Damn the cops. they set us up!.

464
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,308
Humph, never mind!!

465
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,443
We've got a hostage!!!

466
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,146
It's no use

469
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,150
when someone gives the signal...

471
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:16,054
all the cars will stop at once...
LvotWC TL -FEDNT

473
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,063
By the time the kidnappers
regain their balance

475
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,403
Put your hands up!!

477
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:31,736
Ill?

478
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:37,275
Your method was a little rough
but it worked out perf ct...

481
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,412
You're a real cool guy...

482

484
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,218
Don't mention it! This was an easy job!

485
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,120
By the way, about our next get together...

486
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,255
I'll handle it!!

487
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,357
I'll round up all the pretty
single ones from headquarters.

489
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:56,628
I don't care,
as long as Miss Sato's there...

491
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:57,695
Me too.

492
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,732
Hey. Yumi?

493
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,169
Where's the victim. James Black?

494
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,570
He was right here just awhile ago...

495
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:07,338
where'd he go?

496
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,543
I knew something was
strange about that guy...

498
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,679
He disappeared before
the police could¢question him. =

500
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,082
I just "now there's something behind this.

501
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,383
You think sof

502
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,518
He seemed like a pretty nice guy to me...

503
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,054
Only his name struck me as odd...

504
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:25,156
His name?

505
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,758
You don't mean because it was Black?

506
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,294
No...James...

507
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,428
Really?

508
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,264
There's James Bond, James Dean...

509
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,634
I.get-a=pretty good image
from that name...

511
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,439
Professor James Moriarty...

512
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,810
The Napoleon of the criminal world.
Holmes' arch rival,

514
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,612
Professor Moriarty.

515
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,248
James is his first name!

516
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,819
I guess only a Sherlockian
ould think of that though...

518
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,822
After all, James is a common name!

519
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,825
Es, suppose so...

520
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,128
Something else bothers me
more though

522
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,598
The man who was
Iooking at us from that car...

524
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,301
he was one of the passengers
on the bus that got hijacked...

526
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,669
I'm positive

527
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:17,642
he said his name was Sryichi Akaiwhe 1
he was questioned by the police...

00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,999
That was something...

573
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,668
Leaving a code like that
when you were taken by surprise...

575
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:55,406
When'd you realize
they weren't real cops?

577
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:01,479
When they spoke to me in Japanese,
it was as if they knew I understood.

579
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,647
If they were detectives

580
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:07,752
and if they knew I was a foreigner
who could speak Japanese.

582
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,488
Then they'd have confirmed
my name in the very beginning.

584
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,323
That's what tipped me off...

585
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,026
I thought they knew who I really was

586
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:19,097
but were pretending not to,
that's what made me suspicious...

588
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,333
Oh well, it seems it: was
a case of mistaken identity though...

590
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,702
But what a surprise.

591
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,172
I never thought you'd cut off
your long hair.

593
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,942
Want to change my luck...

594
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:33,544
My girlfriend keeps leaving me...

595
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:35,780
Is that so?

596
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:39,050
You went out of your way
to get me here.

598
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:42,654
So does that mean you have a
chance of getting back with her?

600
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,189
Sort of...

601
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,291
I want to get back AT her.

602
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,028
For dumping me...

603
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,563
I want her to cry-tears,of blood™...

604
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,976
Why's there blood here?

605
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,449
Wow...there'll be no sleep tonight,
the mystery's got to b Solved...

607
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,825
So that's the answer, incredible!

608
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:25,163
The next case
takes place in a mysterious restaurant.
